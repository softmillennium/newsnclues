            A Houthi drone hit the arrivals hall at Ramon Airport in southern Israel, the Israeli military and the Israel Airports Authority said Sunday. No sirens were sounded, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, adding that the incident was under review.
    


            It is rare for sirens not to warn of incoming projectiles in Israel, which has a multi-layered system to defend against missiles and drones. The vast majority of drones fired by the Houthis in Yemen have been intercepted before striking Israel.
    


            A spokesperson for the Israel Airports Authority said the southern airspace over Ramon Airport closed to aircraft traffic, but the airport reopened after about 90 minutes. Ramon Airport is one of the few international airports in Israel, primarily serving the city of Eilat at the southern tip of the country.

            Videos shared on social media showed shattered windows and glass-covered floors at the airport's arrival hall.
    


            Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's emergency response service, said that they received a report at 2:35 p.m. local time about a drone that fell in the Ramon Airport area. MDA said two people sustained minor injuries as a result of the attack.
    


            There was no immediate comment from the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have repeatedly fired projectiles at Israel in protest over its war in Gaza.
    


            In early May, a ballistic missile fired by the Houthis penetrated Israel's air defenses and struck Ben Gurion international airport near Tel Aviv, halting flights for about 30 minutes. Israel's long-range Arrow interceptor missile failed to stop the Houthi projectile before it hit. It marked the first time the Houthis had managed to strike such a well-defended target.
    


Israel says it has ‘fully' disabled Yemen's main airport in escalating strikes on Houthi rebels



            Israel and the Houthis have engaged in an escalating long-range conflict since the Iran-backed rebel group began targeting Israel in what the group's leaders say is solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The Houthis have also targeted shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, some of the world's most critical waterways.
    


            After the Houthis fired a ballistic missile armed with a new type of cluster warhead in late August, Israel carried out a strike that killed the group's prime minister and other senior officials. An Israeli security official said the strike, carried out in the Yemeni capital of Sana'a, killed “a majority of the leadership,” including the foreign minister, minister for security affairs, and others.
    


            Asked if the Houthi's military chief and defense minister were killed, the official said, “If they are not dead, we will continue to hunt them down.”
    


            Israel has also carried out strikes against Houthi military targets and civilian infrastructure the IDF says is used by the rebel group.

            • RFK Jr. defends leadership: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  dismissed his intense grilling by senators on Thursday as “theater,” and said he did not think federal government health agencies have had any great successes.
    


• Sanctions on Russia: President Donald Trump signaled today that his administration is ready to move to the second phase of sanctions against Russia. This comes as the president has grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress toward peace in Ukraine.
    


            • US Open final: Trump will spend the day in New York for the US Open men's final match. Broadcasters have been asked to avoid crowd reactions to the president.
    


            Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier of Washington state said today that Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo is “flat wrong” after he defended his decision to remove vaccine mandates in the state.
    


            “I think he is flat wrong. Public schools should absolutely require children to be vaccinated,” said Schrier, a former physician, after Ladapo said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper that the issue is a matter of parental control over what happens to their children's bodies.
    


                    “Parents have always had a right to make their own decisions about whether to vaccinate their children or not,” Schrier told CNN.  “When that freedom to not vaccinate their own children and put them at risk comes up against another child's freedom to go to school knowing that they will not get measles or polio or whooping cough, then we have a real problem.”
                





            Florida announced last week that it will be the first state to move to end immunization requirements for everyone, including schoolchildren, that have been in place since the 1980s. The American Medical Association “strongly opposes” this change, a member of the association's board of trustees told CNN in a statement.
    


            Ladapo claimed his decision was “based on data and common sense,” yet in the interview with CNN,  said his state has not done any data analysis on the impact of ending vaccine mandate.
    


            The Trump administration launched a new federal immigration enforcement effort in Massachusetts focused on deporting criminals who entered the country illegally, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
    


                    “ICE launched ‘Patriot 2.0' to target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens living in the state of Massachusetts, following the success of Operation Patriot in May,” a DHS spokesperson told CNN today.
                





            The statement blamed Boston's Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu for so-called sanctuary city polices that it said “not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens,” vowing that DHS will arrest criminals released by local authorities.
    


            CNN has reached out to Wu's office for comment.
    


            “Under President Trump and (DHS Secretary Kristi) Noem, nowhere is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return,” the statement continued.
    


            The Justice Department sued Wu earlier this month over Boston's sanctuary policy, which limits cooperation with federal immigration efforts.
    


            “What we have seen from ICE and from the administration really isn't about public safety, it's about political theater. It's about a political power grab and an attempt to intimidate,” Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said today in an interview with MSNBC.
    


            CNN reported last month that Trump administration officials had discussed a major immigration enforcement operation in Boston in the coming weeks, according to two sources familiar with the talks.
    


            This comes as officials in Chicago are bracing for a federal immigration enforcement operation that sources had told CNN could start as soon as this weekend.

            President Donald Trump signaled on Sunday that his administration is ready to move to the second phase of sanctions against Russia.
    


            “Are you ready to move to the second phase of sanctions against Russia?” a reporter asked the president as he left the White House to head to the US Open in New York.
    


            “Yeah, I am,” the president responded.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday stressed the importance of ratcheting up pressure on Moscow and on “all countries who trade with Russia.”
    


            “The Russian economy is pressured and all the countries who trade with Russia are pressured, and we will continue with this,” Zelensky said, adding that “secondary sanctions and special trade tariffs” can help.
    


            CNN has previously reported that Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress on peace and was contemplating how involved he should be in brokering a meeting between Russian and Ukrainian leaders.
    


Russian attack: Meanwhile, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine said Sunday that Russia is “escalating” following its largest air attack of the war overnight.
    


                    “The danger in any war is escalation. Russia appears to be escalating with the largest attack of the war hitting offices of the UKR Cabinet in Kyiv,” Gen. Keith Kellogg posted on X. “History shows events can escalate out of control through actions as these. It is why President Trump is working to stop this war. The attack was not a signal that Russia wants to diplomatically end this war.”
                





            Russia launched its largest aerial assault of the Ukraine war overnight into Sunday, deploying more than 800 drones and striking a government building in Kyiv for the first time.
    


            An infant was among at least two people killed in drone strikes on several residential buildings in the capital, Kyiv's city office said.
    


            Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said she hasn't seen any indication the Trump administration is preparing to imminently send National Guard troops into Chicago, as she accused President Donald Trump of “essentially declaring war on a major city in his own nation.”
    


            Duckworth, a Democrat, told CBS' “Face the Nation” she was at the Great Lakes naval base, the facility being used as a command center for immigration agents, on Saturday. She said personnel there told her they've only been asked to provide “office space for ICE” as Chicago braces for a federal immigration crackdown.
    


            “No barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared to in order to support troops into Chicago,” Duckworth said today.
    


            She called Trump's social media post on Saturday saying Chicago will find out why “it's called the Department of WAR”  as “not normal.”
    


                    “I take what the president United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office,” Duckworth said. “And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear, it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the president of the United States.”
                





            Duckworth said she and her Democratic colleagues in Illinois, Sen. Dick Durbin and Rep. Brad Schneider, who represents part of the Chicago suburbs, asked the Department of Homeland Security for more information about what they were preparing, but did not hear back.
    


            She added that DHS denied the lawmakers a visit to the base at Great Lakes, and “gave their staff the day off on the day that we went to go look at the facilities and locked the doors and left the base.”
    


            The Trump administration is moving full steam ahead with its crime and immigration efforts, focusing their attention on Chicago.
    


If you're just joining, these are the latest headlines:



            Republican Sen. Roger Marshall, a doctor, defended Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after a tense hearing leading to criticism from other Republican senators who are also physicians.
    


                    “I respect what my colleagues are saying. But I think that you know this whole issue today, or in that meeting, was about vaccines,” said Marshall, who practiced for over 25 years. “In my humble opinion, not every person needs every vaccine.” 
                





            Marshall also sits on the Senate Finance Committee and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which oversee HHS and worked on Kennedy's confirmation.
    


            “President Trump chose Robert F Kennedy Jr., to be a disrupter to the CDC, and that's exactly what he's doing,” Marshall said on CBS' “Face the Nation.”
    


            Marshall, who is an OBGYN, also commented on an upcoming report from HHS linking people taking Tylenol during pregnancy to increased autism in children.
    


            Marshall said he recommends patients to not take anything during pregnancy because “we don't know what we don't know” and said he wants “gold standard studies to help us figure this out.” He, however, did add “as far as I know, Tylenol is OK in pregnancy.”
    


            “There is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues,” Dr. Christopher Zahn, chief of clinical practice for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement Friday.
    


            Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott told CNN's Manu Raju that the city doesn't need federal troops after former President Donald Trump threatened to send the National Guard. Scott and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore instead announced a surge of state law enforcement to fight crime.
    


            The World Health Organization made a public show of support for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention today, with its leader saying in posts across social media feeds that the American agency's work is “invaluable and must be protected.”
    


                    “When I was Ethiopia's Health Minister, I sent a team to Atlanta to learn from the US CDC, and a significant part of what the Ethiopian Public Health Agency does is based on these best practices,” wrote Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who serves as WHO's director-general. “The establishment of the Africa CDC, which I proposed at the African Union summit in Abuja in 2013 when I was Foreign Minister, was also inspired by the US CDC.”
                





            Florida's surgeon general said today his state has not done any data analysis on the impact of ending vaccine mandates and defended the state's decision to do so, saying,“it's really about ethics.”
    


                    “I mean, is it appropriate for a government or any other entity to dictate to you what you should put in your body? No, it's absolutely not appropriate,” Dr. Joseph Ladapo ​told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” “You have sovereignty over your body.”
                





            Last week, Florida announced that it will be the first state to seek to remove immunization requirements for everyone, including school children, which have been in place since the 1980s. The American Medical Association “strongly opposes” this change, a member of the Association's board of trustees told CNN in a statement.
    


            Florida, like all US states, grants exemptions from immunizations for medical and religious reasons. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around about 5% of kindergartners in the state were exempt from at least one vaccine last year — higher than the national average. The vast majority of these children were exempt for non-medical reasons.
    


            Pressed about whether the state had commissioned any medical research to back this move, the surgeon general responded, “The way you're portraying it is nonsense.”
    


                    “We don't need to do any projections,” said Ladapo — who last week likened vaccine mandates to slavery. “We handle outbreaks all the time, so there's nothing special that we would need to do.”
                





            Additionally, the surgeon general pointed to other countries without vaccine mandates, such as the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden, saying, “The sky isn't falling over there.”
    


            Meanwhile, the Treasury Department will issue rebates if the Supreme Court upholds a ruling that President Donald Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs were an overstep of power, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today.
    


                    “We would have to give a refund on about half of the tariffs, which would be terrible for the Treasury,” Bessent said during an appearance on NBC News' “Meet the Press.” He added that, “If the court says it, we'd have to do it.” But there are “numerous other avenues” that can be taken instead of rebates, Bessent said, without citing details.
                





A federal appeals court ruled on August 29 that Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs were among the imposed duties that breach the president's authority, saying that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the emergency tariffs Trump imposed earlier this year.
    


            The fresh slate of the Trump administration's so-called “reciprocal” tariffs, which went into effect in early August, will remain in place after the court delayed implementation of its order until October 14.
    


            The court ruling has put into question the Trump administration's ability to continue trade negotiations. The Trump administration appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, warning of a “poor nation” without tariffs.
    


            Bessent said he is “confident” the Trump administration will win at the Supreme Court.

CNN's Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.



            Tom Homan, White House border czar, defended President Donald Trump's “Chipocalypse Now” social media post from a day earlier, which said Chicago “will find out why it's called the Department of WAR.”
    


                    “I think his words are being taken out of context. I said we're going to war. We're going to war the criminal cartels. We're going to war with illegal aliens, public safety threats that rape children, that raped citizens, that committed armed robberies, that distribute narcotics that kill Americans,” Homan told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” today.
                





            Democratic officials in Chicago and Illinois condemned the post Saturday, with Gov. JB Pritzker calling it “not normal.” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and US Rep. Mike Quigley, who represents part of the city, described the post as an example of authoritarianism.
    


CNN previously reported the Trump administration's plans to conduct a major immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, and that officials there were bracing for it to begin as early as Friday.
    


            Pressed on whether the administration will send the National Guard in to Chicago this week, Homan told CNN that the option is “always on the table.”
    


            “We used them in Los Angeles, and we use them in Washington, DC. They're a force multiplier,” he said.
    


            Asked  how many National Guard troops would be in Chicago, Homan declined to respond, saying that it was “law enforcement sensitive information.”
    


            Asked whether there will be any action in Chicago this week, Homan responded “absolutely,” adding, “you can expect action in most sanctuary cities across the country.”
    


Hyundai immigration raid: He was also asked by CNN whether there will be more extensive immigration raids, like the one at a Hyundai manufacturing plant in Georgia that led to 475 arrests.
    


            “The short answer is, yes, we're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,” Homan said.
    


            Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr defended his leadership earlier in an interview on “Fox and Friends,” as we just reported.
    


            Jerome Adams, who served as US surgeon general during President Donald Trump's first administration, called for Kennedy to be fired as controversy continues to swirl over his handling of vaccine approvals.
    


            When asked by CNN's Victor Blackwell yesterday if Trump should remove Kennedy, Adams said, “I absolutely believe that he should for the sake of the nation and the sake of his legacy.”
    


            Adams' comments came after a contentious hearing on Capitol Hill last week, where Kennedy was grilled by both Democrats and Republicans about his views on vaccines and the recent exodus at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the resignation of its director, over tighter vaccine policies Kennedy was pushing.
    


            “I'm deeply concerned about the health and safety of our nation under RFK's current leadership,” Adams told Blackwell, later adding: “I absolutely believe he is uniquely damaging the credibility of federal agencies like the CDC, (National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration) and he's putting us at risk.”
    


Read here for more on the RFK Jr. hearing and Adams' remarks. 



CNN's Adam Cancryn contributed to this report.



            Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. decried his intense grilling by senators from both parties over major shakeups at the top health agencies as “theater” and defended his leadership.
    


                    “I've come to realize that those hearings are performative. They're theater. And, you know, they're not the kind of debate or open conversation that democracy would give us at its ideal,” he told “Fox and Friends” on Sunday.
                





            His interview on the conservative cable network show continued some of his first comments after a testy hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday. Democrats and Republicans on the panel pressed Kennedy on his vaccine skepticism and decision to fire the newly-installed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director.
    


            Kennedy accused senators on the panel that played a role in his confirmation of being beholden to pharmaceutical companies, without citing evidence, saying “they don't want to hear the answers to the questions that they ask me. They want to make a little speech and then shut me down.”
    


            Defending his ousting of Dr. Susan Monarez as director of the CDC, which led to the resignation of several other top health officials, Kennedy told Fox News “we need new blood, and we need new people who are committed to public health and integrity and gold standard science, and the Trump administration is going to make sure that happens.”
    


            Pressed on what he sees as the last great success of federal government health agencies, Kennedy answered: “I don't think there have been successes,” claiming that the infiltration of pharmaceutical companies have led to a “series of bad decisions.”
    


            After weeks of warnings, Chicago could be the next US city to see National Guard troops rolling through its streets.
    


            Local leaders were preparing ahead of this weekend – from the governor bracing for a court fight to parade planners postponing – even while it was not clear troops whether will show up.
    


            Officials in Illinois had heard the National Guard will be in place by Friday and ready to act Saturday – in step with an expected immigration enforcement swell – but no one from the Trump administration has told the state of its plans, Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker said Wednesday.
    


            Meanwhile, there are “no immediate plans” to send soldiers to Chicago, Vice President JD Vance told reporters Wednesday after President Donald Trump the prior day called it “the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far” following a violent Labor Day weekend and said the feds were “going in,” though without saying when.
    


            Read more here on how Chicago was preparing for this weekend.
    


            Just ahead of the weekend, President Donald Trump signed several executive orders in the Oval Office Friday and also took questions on a variety of topics from reporters.
    


            Let's take a look back at what was said:
    


CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo, Elise Hammond, Samantha Waldenberg, Kit Maher, Aditi Sangal, Jennifer Hansler, Alayna Treene, Donald Judd, Haley Britzky and David Goldman contributed reporting to this post.



            As we've reported, President Donald Trump is heading to the US Open men's final today after starting his day at the White House, an administration official has told CNN.
    


            According to the White House schedule, he'll get there at around 2 p.m. ET after leaving at 11.45 a.m. ET.



            As we report here, The last time Trump attended a US Open match, as a presidential candidate in 2015, the booing was so loud that multiple news outlets wrote stories about the critical crowd reaction
    


            He's then due to return back to the White House at 7 p.m. ET.
    


            President Donald Trump reposted a meme on social media Saturday saying in part that Chicago will find out why “it's called the Department of WAR.”
    


                    “‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning … Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR 🚁🚁🚁🚁,” the text of the post reads.
                





            It is accompanied by what appears to be an artificially generated image of the president and the Chicago skyline reading “Chipocalypse Now.”
    


            Trump signed an executive order Friday to rebrand the Pentagon as the “Department of War.”
    


            The president's post comes as he has ramped up his rhetoric against Democratic-led cities, with a direct target on Chicago.
    


            “Chicago is the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far,” Trump said Tuesday morning on Truth Social. “(Illinois Gov. JB) Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet. I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC.”
    


            “We're going,” the president told a reporter hours later about sending in the National Guard. “I didn't say when. We're going in.”
    


            Pritzker responded on social media Saturday calling out the president's post as “not normal” and said that his state would not be “intimidated” by the president.
    


                    “The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city. This is not a joke. This is not normal,” Pritzker wrote on X. “Donald Trump isn't a strongman, he's a scared man. Illinois won't be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.”
                





            Welcome to our coverage of the latest developments and headlines from President Donald Trump's administration.
    


            The president is expected to attend the US Open in time for the start of today's men's final match in New York at 2 p.m. ET, a White House official tells CNN.
    


            The US Open Tennis Tournament is held annually at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing, New York.
    


            It will be just the latest sporting event the president will attend during his second term in office. Earlier this year, he attended both the Super Bowl and the Daytona 500 race.
    


            We'll bring you the latest on that, when it happens. We'll also keep you updated with any key lines from today's political shows - stay with us.

            What do you give a man who already can buy anything? How about $1 trillion?
    


            That's what the Tesla board of directors have decided to offer CEO Elon Musk. They unveiled a new pay package Friday for shareholders to consider that could give Musk up to 423.7 million additional shares of Tesla stock in the next decade.
    


            Those potential shares might “only” be worth $148.7 billion as of Friday's closing price. But if Tesla shares appreciate as much as the pay package forecasts, they would be worth close to $1 trillion once Tesla hits certain milestones: He gets all of those shares only if Tesla becomes worth $8.5 trillion, about eight times as much as it is today, and twice as much as any company on the planet has ever been worth.
    


            The company's board says in its filing to shareholders that it needs to offer Musk a historic pay package or risk losing the leader who has become synonymous – for better or worse – with the Tesla brand.
    


            The board said that during the negotiations on the pay package, “Musk also raised the possibility that he may pursue other interests that may afford him greater influence if he did not receive such assurances.”
    


            The board said it “believes that Mr. Musk singularly possesses the leadership characteristics necessary to transform Tesla and realize its long-term mission at an unparalleled level.”
    


            But it's also been clear that the company was not pleased that Musk has been viewing his Tesla gig as a part-time job. He has focused much of his attention on some of his other privately held companies, such rocket company SpaceX and its satellite internet offering Starlink and his artificial intelligence firm xAI, which now owns his platform X, formerly known as Twitter, which Musk bought for $44 billion of his own money in 2022. And Musk has become more involved in politics, including plans to start a third party.
    


            Earlier this year, when Musk was still leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the board began a search for a possible successor for Musk, according to the Wall Street Journal. Both board chair Robyn Denholm and Musk denied the report. Soon after the reported search began, Musk announced he would be leaving DOGE to spend most of his time again running Tesla.
    


            “The simple message the board is sending to Elon: ‘We want your attention on Tesla,'” wrote Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management in a note Friday. “Implicit in that message is the promise that he'll have the control he's been seeking (a 25% stake) and that it will be worth his time.”
    


            Musk has made clear control of Tesla is vitally important to him. He said in a post on X in January 2024 that he needs to control at least 25% of Tesla shares.
    


            “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned,” Musk wrote in a post on X. “Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.”
    


            That need for control is what's behind this pay package, said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki, an investment firm and one of the early investors in Tesla.
    


            “This is all about Musk being scared about being kicked out of Tesla because he only owns 13%,” said Gerber, who has sold almost his entire stake in Tesla.
    


            Munster and other Tesla bulls believe he's right that AI, autonomous vehicles, robotaxis and humanoid robots are the future that will lift Tesla to the $8.5 billion target price, and adjusted operating profits of $400 billion that would be 20 times greater than Tesla's previous record profit.
    


            “We are still just scratching the surface of physical AI: current use cases are almost comical, limited to nascent robotaxi trials by Waymo and Tesla,” Munster wrote Friday. “Eventually, physical AI will impact anything that moves, representing a market potential that's hard for me to fathom.”
    


            But critics of Musk and Tesla predict that Musk will fail to deliver on that potential, just as he failed to meet many previous target dates for the company to produce full self-driving vehicles and robotaxis. They say that Musk's real value to Tesla is his ability to convince Wall Street of the bright future that lays ahead, despite a trail of broken promises.
    


            “Elon Musk has been saying since 2014 ‘we will have a fully autonomous car next year.' It hasn't happened, but that promise has been valued in the billions by Wall Street,” said analyst Gordon Johnson, one of the harsher critics of Tesla. “Elon Musk is a master manipulator. He's been able to keep the stock elevated. The reason the board is paying him is he's willing to say things that other CEOs aren't willing to say or get away with.”
    


            Despite that track record, there's a good chance that Tesla investors will approve the potentially massive pay package. They have regularly approved his pay packages in the past, even reconfirming a pay package in 2024 that a Delaware judge had thrown out as being unfair to shareholders and the company.
    


            They will see that Musk won't get anything from this new package unless the company, and their own holdings, greatly increase in value. The first target that Musk and Tesla will have to hit before he sees any shares will be $2 trillion, or nearly twice its current value.
    


            “They'll think ‘I kind of having nothing to lose,'” Gerber said. He said their thinking will be along the lines of: “The goals are so high that if he makes them, I'll make a lot of money. So who cares if he gets $1 trillion.”
    


            “But if you actually think about it, it's absurd,” he said.

US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping could meet in October in South Korea during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, CNN reported on Saturday, citing sources. This comes amid trade tensions between the two countries.

According to three unnamed Trump administration officials, the president and his top advisers “are quietly preparing” to travel to the APEC meeting and hold talks with the trade ministers of member states. The APEC summit is scheduled for late October to early November in Gyeongju, South Korea.

The officials added that “there have been serious discussions about a bilateral meeting” between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the forum, but “no firm plans are in place.”

Trade tensions between the US and China have been running high. In early 2025, Trump imposed sweeping tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods, prompting reciprocal tariffs of 125% from Beijing. The two countries agreed in May, however, to a temporary tariff truce, which has been extended to mid-November.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month that the current arrangement was “working pretty well,” adding that the sides were holding “very good talks” and are likely to meet again before the truce expires.

The CNN report noted that Trump's presence in the region could open the door to a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the first since 2019, although it is unclear whether he will attend. US officials told the network that more emphasis is being placed on meeting with Xi.

This comes in the wake of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in China. Commenting on the gathering on Truth Social, Trump remarked, “Looks like we've lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China.” He also claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim are “conspiring” against the US, after the two leaders held talks.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected speculation of any plots against the US, suggesting that Trump's remarks should not be taken literally.

US Vice President J.D. Vance has bluntly rejected accusations that a missile strike on a boat carrying alleged Venezuela-linked cartel members amounted to a war crime.

On Tuesday, the US destroyed what President Donald Trump described as a “drug-carrying boat” in international waters in the southern Caribbean, killing 11 people on board. Trump claimed the vessel was tied to the Tren de Aragua cartel, which he has designated as a terrorist organization. Venezuelan officials dismissed the footage as fabricated, calling it “cartoonish.”

In a post on X on Saturday, Vance praised the strike, saying that “killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.”

Social media influencer and frequent Trump critic Brian Krassenstein challenged the attack's legality, arguing that “killing the citizens of another nation who are civilians without any due process is called a war crime.”

“I don't give a s**t what you call it,” Vance replied.

While many Trump supporters backed the vice president, Senator Rand Paul condemned his remarks as “despicable and thoughtless.”

The strike followed the deployment of a US naval armada in the western Caribbean last month as part of Trump's crackdown on drug trafficking. In 2020, a US court indicted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on charges of leading the Cartel de los Soles, an allegation he denounced as a plot to topple him.

CNN reported on Friday that Trump is considering strikes against cartels inside Venezuela. The president has denied regime change plans but described the country's 2024 election as “very strange.”

A California woman has been charged with registering her dog to vote and casting ballots in her pet's name in two elections, the Orange County Attorney General's Office said on Friday.

Prosecutors said Laura Lee Yourex “self-reported” her actions in 2024 and now faces five felony counts. If convicted on all charges, she could serve up to six years in prison.

According to the statement, Yourex submitted a mail-in ballot under the name of her dog, Maya Jean Yourex, in the 2021 gubernatorial recall election, which was counted. She attempted to do so again in the 2022 primary election, but that ballot was rejected.

In 2022, Yourex reportedly posted a photo of Maya wearing an ‘I voted' sticker on social media. Two years later, she shared another post showing the dog's tag alongside a ballot with the caption “maya is still getting her ballot,” even though the pet had already died, prosecutors said.

California does not require residents to present identification to register or vote in state elections, though ID is required for first-time voters in federal contests.

US President Donald Trump has argued that mail-in voting enables election fraud, and has vowed to ban the practice before the 2026 midterms. California is among 19 states suing to block his executive order aimed at tightening identification rules and restricting the counting of mail-in ballots.

Footage of raid by US immigration officials showed detained workers in handcuffs and with chains around their ankles

South Korea has said negotiations with the US to secure the release of its nationals detained in a raid by US immigration officials on a Hyundai plant in the state of Georgia have been “concluded” and that they would soon be freed and flown home.

It follows the arrest of more than 300 South Korean workers at a Hyundai-LG battery site being built in the southern US on Thursday.

Footage of the raid released by US authorities showed detained workers, in handcuffs and with chains around their ankles, being loaded on to an inmate transportation bus.

The operation, carried out in the town of Ellabell, was the largest single site raid implemented so far under President Donald Trump's nationwide anti-migrant drive, catching Seoul officials off guard.

“As a result of the swift and united response … negotiations for the release of the detained workers have been concluded,” Kang Hoon-sik, chief of staff to South Korea's president, Lee Jae Myung, said on Sunday.

“Only administrative procedures remain. Once these are completed, a chartered flight will depart to bring our citizens home,” he added.

Scrambling to contain the fallout, a senior executive at electric vehicle battery maker LG Energy Solution flew to Georgia on Sunday morning.

“The immediate priority now is the swift release of both our LG Energy Solution employees and those of our partner firms,” executive Kim Ki-soo told reporters before boarding a plane.

LG Energy Solution has said 47 of its employees had been arrested – 46 South Koreans and one Indonesian.

The company has also said about 250 of those arrested were believed to be employed by its contractor, and most of them were South Koreans.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Israel's attacks helped forge a new sense of patriotism and raised expectations for a future of reformist politics

Amid the ruins of the building that was once the Tehran home of the Iranian nuclear scientist Ahmadreza Zolfaghari, workmen are underway demolishing the remains, damaged beyond repair by Israel's surprise attempt to assassinate Iran's political, military and nuclear elite.

Zolfaghari had worked at the Faculty of Nuclear Engineering at Shahid Beheshti University, and was editor-in-chief of a nuclear energy journal, all of which was sufficient to make him an Israeli target. He was found dead in the rubble of his home, along with his wife and grownup son. The three adjoining buildings had also been blown apart, killing at least five others, including an 11-year-old child. A blue banner, draped down one of the damaged buildings, reads: “A piece of the body of Iran.”

The group of workmen wielding sledgehammers are clambering across the remaining unstable floor struts to demolish what remains of the building. Loose masonry crashes to the ground, sending dust into the air. Their perilous task – the beams on which they stand creak as they hammer – seems a metaphor for a country still in shock, neither at peace nor at war, but in need of reconstruction.

More than 1,000 Iranians died in the Israeli attack, and some professional sociologists – a broad term in Iran – argue a new nationalism has emerged into public view.

There is no doubt that, outwardly, Tehran is changing fast – and socially it is light years from western perceptions. The number of women not wearing the hijab in Tehran's streets is about a third and it is not just young women, but sometimes whole families. A new punitive chastity law passed by the religious conservatives – still dominant inside parliament – was rejected by the consensual, but reformist president Masoud Pezeshkian on the pragmatic grounds that it would cause an uprising if it was enforced.

The burial of the measure has emboldened women. The police, once keen to bundle the “unchaste” into the back of a van, now leave unscarfed women to their individual choice. The vibrant, albeit polluted, evening streets resemble Beirut as much as Kabul. The next step is to allow women to ride motorcycles. Observers say that Mahsa Amini, the young Kurdish woman who collapsed in a police station in 2022, sparking the “women life freedom” protests, did not entirely die in vain.

The cultural sociologist and Soas alumni Nematollah Fazeli claims a deep change may be afoot. What he describes as the emergence of an “everyday nationalism” is reflected in a return to epic poetry, popular podcasts about Iranian history, and thousands of ordinary conversations across the country about Iranian identity.

Fazeli explained: “Before the war, we loved Iran, but it was not a very conscious feeling. After the war, it became a central point of our discourse. Everywhere in cities and villages you observe that people are talking about their nation, their identity, their geography and their history. We just want to remind one another we are Iranian. The sense of oppression of Iran, our nation, our land, our culture, our feelings, by a world system and by foreigners was very important. It led to a desire to be together and to express the commonality of being Iranian.”

But he adds: “The Islamic Republic ideology is not a nationalist ideology. The official ideology of the revolution is not keen or interested to represent ancient Iranian culture, and that culture cannot be seen in official education, TV or radio. The people's reaction to the war was a shock and a kind of negative cohesion. Despite their frustration with the government, the people stood up against foreign aggression; not to defend the Islamic Republic, but to defend Iran. We believe we have been an organic nation for more than 5,000 years.”

Mohammad Faze, a teacher, described how his students had put the Iranian flag on their social media profiles. Others point to the flourishing of podcasts about Iranian history and the declarations of love for Iran by popular singers including previous regime critics such as Homayoun Shajarian.

Some in government have acknowledged the challenge posed by this outpouring for the homeland. Abdolkarim Hosseinzadeh, the vice-president for rural affairs, told a gathering of journalists: “Iran is beautiful with all of us together, my closest friends are not Kurds, they are Persians, Turks, Kurds and Baloch. We have lived together, loved each other and cherished one another. We may not think alike, we may not share the same beliefs, but in Iran, there is no doubt about our friendship, patriotism and love for our homeland.”

The issue under debate in Iran now is whether, and how, the government responds to the display of resilience shown by a population under fire, or what the foreign affairs spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaee, described as the blitz spirit.

The experience of war, even short wars, can change nations. Aliakbar Velayati, an adviser to Iran's supreme leader, argued: “the people have proven themselves, and now it is the turn of the officials. Outdated methods will no longer suffice for a society after the war.”

But turning these generalities into reality in a deeply polarised and political society is proving hard. Even Shajarian's plan to hold a mass free open air concert in Tehran's Azadi Square this weekend collapsed as a political row broke out as to whether the event was an innocent moment of relief or propaganda.

The conservatives believe the social cohesion inadvertently forged by Benjamin Netanyahu's misconceived attempt at regime change from 30,000ft confirms the popularity of the supreme leader and its ideological foreign policy.

But for many reformists, it would be a mistake to read this everyday patriotism as an endorsement for the Islamic Republic, or the status quo. One reformist said: “How can we be so complacent when the currency has fallen 25% in the past week, poverty is everywhere, the official media is a lie and no one knows if another war is around the corner?”

The reformists indeed hope there could be a breakthrough; what the former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has described as a paradigm shift. In recent weeks, former prime minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi, who has been under house arrest for 15 years and is now in hospital, issued an open letter demanding a new constitution, while the Reform Front – an umbrella group of moderate and reformist figures – called for the government to take the stepthe US had been demanding and voluntarily suspend domestic enrichment of uranium, in return for the lifting of sanctions.

The former two-term president Hassan Rouhani has also weighed in, advocating for a “national strategy based on the will of the people. This crisis must create an agenda to correct the course and rebuild the foundations of governance.”

He called for the creation of a grassroots intelligence agency, giving scientists a platform and opportunity to modernise Iran's defences, diversification of the media by launching more private television channels and ending Iran's abrasive relationship with the world, including reducing the hostility towards the US.

Beyond politicians, 180 economists urged a reordering of “Iran's economic and political paradigms”, including the removal of the army from business, while 78 former diplomats pressed for a foreign policy that “does not allow delay” in taking the steps necessary to lift sanctions.

But there is still resistance to change. The power held by the Iranian security apparatus has led to a crackdown involving road checks and as many as 20,000 arrests, according to Amnesty International.

The conservatives rushed to pass a draconian law giving the authorities power to block online content. The head of the judiciary, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i, condemned the Reform Group's statement criticising the move as “in line with the enemy's wishes”, adding “it would be natural for the Tehran prosecutor to take an interest in such statements”, a remark designed to send a chill through the reformists.

Faced by these perennial conflicting tides, Pezeshkian's instinct is to avoid confrontation, sometimes to the frustration of the reformists thatgot him elected in a surprise result only a year ago. Pezeshkian is deeply aware of the limits of his power: that conservative forces are out to crush him, his dependence on the supreme leader and the ubiquity of a deep state protective of its privileges. The polarised tone of Iranian politics worries him as much as sanctions, he admitted last week.

He has made consensus his watchword, so much so that Mohsen Asgari, the editor of the innovative multimedia outlet Haft Sobh, argues: “The risk is that he turns a method of government – the search for consensus – into an objective.”

Fatemeh Mohajerani, a government spokesperson, educated at Heriott-Watt University, defends Pezeshkian's commitment to persuasion and problem solving.

Consensus building on complex social issues in a polarised society takes time, and separation of powers prevents him from calling for political prisoners to be released. She insists progress is underway, for instance to remove the filters placed on external social media sites such as Telegram, X and even Instagram. Only the intervention of the war prevented Telegram executives from visiting Iran to discuss the terms of their launch, she said. Asked if she thought the government needed to apologise for the deaths and injuries caused to women fighting for their freedom, she responded by saying the government will always apologise if necessary.

Pezeshkian's space to undertake the necessary economic reforms is restricted by the universal political anger caused by the 12-day war and now the threat of reimposed UN sanctions. For many Iranians, reformist or otherwise, the widespread view is that Europe is in effect endorsing Israel's illegal bombing campaign by its move toward snapback sanctions.

Anger that the US allowed or connived in the bombing while negotiations were underway, and Europe could not bring itself to condemn this, has left a deep distrust that plays into the hands of the anti-western factions.

Reza Nasri, an international lawyer close to the reformist camp, said: “Before the war, there was concern that Trump might withdraw from any signed agreement, but now the worry is that he will bomb us. It is very difficult to make the case within domestic Iranian politics that negotiations are beneficial or will lead to a lifting of sanctions.

“The perception is Trump has outsourced his Iran policy to Israel. People feel ‘we went to negotiate and we got bombs so why should we do that again?' It would be so costly for any government to go back to negotiations. And if Europe wants that to happen, they have gone about it absolutely the wrong way. The most likely outcome of imposing snapback [sanctions] is that Iran will exclude Europe from all future negotiations altogether, and will exclude the UN weapons inspectors. The logical thing for Europe to do is to delay snapback and give diplomacy a chance.”

Nasri added: “The issue of Iran's right to enrich uranium domestically – supposedly the cause of the conflict – is not about building a bomb, deterrence or even about nuclear energy, it is all about retaining a symbol of dignity.”

Speaking inside the courtyard of the Hemmat Tajrish mosque by the graves of some of those killed in the 12-day war, Mohammad Faze admits Iranian society has been living on the edge, but insists: “My nature is not to be 100% certain about anything, but if this war comes again we will be ready. We have learned from the 12-day war, and we are prepared. It is deep in the Iranian heart we will not surrender, and we will not be humiliated.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Ukrainian forces struck the Ilsky oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar Krai and the ""8-N"" oil pipeline control station near the village of Naitopovichi in Bryansk Oblast, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed on Sept. 7.

Both facilities are involved in supplying fuel to Russian troops invading Ukraine, according to the General Staff.

In recent months, Ukrainian forces have intensified attacks against Russia's energy infrastructure in an effort to put economic pressure on Moscow and undermine its ability to finance the war.

The ""8-N"" control station sustained multiple strikes, with a fire erupting near its pumping station and tank farm, according to Ukraine's military.

The strike was conducted overnight on Sept. 7 by Ukraine's Missile Forces and Artillery and the Unmanned Systems Forces, in coordination with other branches of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The facility is part of the ""Steel Horse"" oil pipeline complex, which has a pumping capacity of 10.5 million tons and is considered strategically important for transporting fuel to Russian forces, according to the General Staff.

Ukraine's top drone warfare commander, Robert ""Madyar"" Brovdi, said the ""8-N"" facility is also strategically important for transporting oil products from Belarusian refineries to Russia, particularly from the Mozyr and Novopolotsk plants.

Explosions and a fire were also reported at the Ilsky oil refinery, which processes 6.42 million tons of oil annually and supplies the Russian military, according to the General Staff. 

The strike was carried out by the Special Operations Forces. The extent of the damage is still being assessed, the statement read.

Located roughly 500 kilometers (311 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory, the refinery is among the largest in southern Russia, producing over 6 million tons of fuel annually.

Reports of Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil facilities surfaced on Russian social media prior to an official confirmation. Photos and videos circulating on social media appeared to show a large fire rising from the refinery in Krasnodar Krai.

Officials in the Krasnodar Krai previously claimed that a technological workshop had caught fire at the refinery, adding that no casualties had been reported.

Beyond targeting oil infrastructure, Ukraine's General Staff said Ukrainian forces also struck Russian personnel positions and logistics depots in Kursk Oblast.

Ukraine has intensified long-range strikes against Russian energy facilities, targeting refineries and depots to cut into Moscow's war funding.

Kyiv has previously struck the Ilsky Oil Refinery on multiple occasions — most recently on July 7 when a drone struck one of the facility's technological workshops, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent.

Krasnodar Krai, a strategic region along Russia's Black Sea coast, has increasingly come under Ukrainian drone attacks as Kyiv extends the range of its strikes deep into Russian territory.

In August alone, Ukraine struck at least 12 refineries, shutting down facilities representing over 17% of national processing capacity, or 1.1 million barrels per day.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC News on Sept. 7 that the U.S. is prepared to work with European allies on new sanctions targeting countries that buy Russian oil, aiming to weaken Moscow's economy and step up pressure on Russia to reach a ceasefire.

In addition to missile production, Russia plans to manufacture a range of modern military hardware by the end of 2025, including 57 combat aircraft.

Russia launched a large-scale overnight attack on Ukraine on Sept. 7, killing at least four people and injuring more than 40, prompting swift condemnation from Kyiv's European partners.

In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur looks at the two summits that took place in China and France, delivering two starkly different messages about the future of Russia's war — and the world.

Ukrainian forces lost 5 square kilometers but regained control of 26 square kilometers in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast in August, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said.

Ukraine's Air Force said Russia launched 810 Shahed-type drones and 13 cruise and ballistic missiles during the attack.

Ukrainian forces struck the Ilsky oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar Krai and the ""8-N"" oil pipeline control station near the village of Naitopovichi in Bryansk Oblast, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed on Sept. 7.

At least eight Ukrainian regions, as well as the city of Kyiv, came under attack over the past 24 hours. Russian forces launched missiles, drones, and glide bombs across Ukraine. 

The number includes 970 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

""During this war, Ukraine has already reached the level where nearly 60% of the weapons we have, weapons in the hands of our warriors, are Ukrainian-made, and they are strong weapons, many of them cutting-edge,"" Zelensky said in his evening address.

Putin seemingly contradicted Fico on Sept. 3, a day after his meeting with the Slovak leader, again inviting Zelensky to Moscow for a meeting. Days later on Sept. 5, Putin said that he ""doesn't see much point"" in a meeting with the Ukrainian president.

Russian forces struck Zaporizhzhia with drones on Sept. 6, injuring 15 people and destroying a kindergarten, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said.

The Kyiv Independent's law enforcement source identified the suspect as Fedir Khrystenko, a 41-year-old lawmaker and a former member of the now-banned pro-Russian party, Opposition Platform — For Life.

Reuters on Sept. 5 withdrew a video in which Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping were shown discussing whether humans could live to 150 years old, after China's state broadcaster revoked permission to use the footage.

A transit of the Taiwan Strait by Canadian and Australian naval vessels “sent out wrong signals and heightened security risks,” China said Saturday, as Western militaries continue to assert their right to pass through the disputed waters despite repeated protestations by Beijing. 

The Canadian frigate HMCS Ville de Quebec, accompanied by the Australian destroyer HMAS Brisbane, transited the waters separating democratic Taiwan from China's east coast on Saturday morning, closely followed by Chinese naval and air forces. 

In a statement, Colonel Shi Yi, a spokesman for the eastern theatre command of the People's Liberation Army, called the transit “provocative,” and said his forces “remain on high alert at all times” to “resolutely safeguard China's national sovereignty.” 

Taiwan's Ministry of National Defence said 21 Chinese aircraft, including drones, as well as six warships, had been detected in the Strait on Saturday, adding it was “closely monitoring” the situation. 

The Decibel: On board a Canadian warship in the Pacific

Canada regards the Taiwan Strait as international waters, as do most Western countries and the government of Taiwan. In recent years, the United States and allied militaries have asserted their right to transit the strait as part of “freedom of navigation” exercises, infuriating Beijing, which has increased its military presence in the sensitive waters as part of a pressure campaign against Taiwan, which China claims sovereignty over. 

The Canadian military does not typically publicize or comment on such actions, but Saturday's transit appears to be the first since February, and the first under Prime Minister Mark Carney, who has attempted to repair relations with Beijing that frayed under his predecessor Justin Trudeau. 

HMCS Ville de Quebec, a Halifax-class frigate, has been deployed to the Western Pacific since April, on what Ottawa describes as a “forward-presence mission to the Indo-Pacific region to promote peace, stability, and the rules-based international order.” 

“This deployment further demonstrates the Canadian Armed Forces' commitment to international peace and security efforts through operational excellence,” Lieutenant-General Steve Boivin, Commander Canadian Joint Operations Command, said at the time of the deployment. “Our ability to integrate seamlessly with our allies makes us a valued partner in maintaining global stability.”

Prior to the Taiwan Strait transit, the vessel previously attracted China's ire for taking part in joint drills with the Philippines, Australia and the U.S. in the South China Sea, where Beijing is engaged in multiple increasingly-hostile territorial disputes with its neighbours. 

According to the Philippines military, the exercises took place near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, where Chinese and Philippines vessels have had numerous clashes in recent months, as the PLA attempts to assert its control over the strategic reefs. 

In a statement, General Romeo Brawner, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said the drill “reaffirms our collective resolve to protect our seas and uphold a rules-based international order.” 

“We will continue to build on this foundation of trust, proving that we are indeed stronger together,” he added. 

The exercise took place Wednesday as China was holding a massive military parade in Beijing, where the PLA showed off cutting-edge hardware, including its air, sea and land-launched “nuclear triad” for the first time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","Canadian lifespans are no longer increasing. Here are some possible reasons why","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/personal-finance/retirement/article-canadian-lifespans-decreasing-retirement-pensions/","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

The narrative that Canadians are living longer has been largely true for the past 100 years, and in the public consciousness for perhaps the last 40. It is the main reason given for why we should save more for retirement and retire later. It is also why Stephen Harper's government felt that Old Age Security pensions should start at 67, rather than 65. 

That narrative, however, is shifting. Whether one measures life expectancy from birth or from age 65, the number has plateaued. When measured from age 65, life expectancy in 2023 was virtually the same as it was in 2016. When measured from birth, it was actually lower in 2023 than it was in 2012. 

When an important long-term trend suddenly reverses, it is natural to wonder why. The following reasons represent my personal views on this subject, supported by statistics, where available. 

COVID-19 was one obvious factor contributing to stalled longevity, but it only explains the dip in life expectancy in 2021 and 2022. 

Another factor is that, for many years, medical advances have prolonged lives. But perhaps that low-hanging fruit has already been picked, and further increases in longevity will be harder to come by. 

The increasing use of opioids in recent years –⁠ especially fentanyl –⁠ is also leading to younger deaths. There were 7,146 toxicity deaths in 2024, and while this represents just slightly more than 2 per cent of all Canadian deaths during this period, those affected were younger, in age groups where mortality rates are usually low. 

There's one last possible reason mortality rates have climbed –⁠ and life expectancy gains have stalled –⁠ since 2016. It was in that year that Canada legalized euthanasia by passing Medical Assistance in Dying. MAID now accounts for one death in every 20 in the country, and while there's no way to know exactly how much longer people would have otherwise lived, it's possible that it is contributing to the longevity changes we are seeing.

In spite of these demographic headwinds, my best guess is that life expectancy will resume its upward trend, but more slowly than was the case before 2015 and more slowly than demographers and actuaries would have expected a few short years ago. 

If so, it means that life annuities are currently more expensive than they should be, since insurance companies build future improvements into mortality assumption when determining pricing, and may have built in more than they should. 

It may also mean that the cost of Canada/Quebec Pension Plan benefits may drop if the future improvements in mortality baked into the actuarial assumptions don't materialize. Perhaps we'll even see a small break in the contribution rate in the not-too-distant future.

A German woman filed a suit against the US search engine Google after failing to get it to remove intimate pictures of her that were spread online. HateAid, a German non-profit, hopes that it will be a landmark case. 

It sounds like a nightmare, yet it could happen to anybody: In this case, unknown people stole nude pictures and sex videos from a young woman's private cloud and spread them on internet porn sites. What was worse is that the content could be found via a simple Google search of the woman's name because her ID had also been stolen from the cloud.

She turned to HateAid, a German non-profit that provides support for people affected by online hate and digital violence. With the organization's help, she contacted many of the sites involved and reported more than 2,000 URLs that could be found via Google's image search. Though Google usually removes such content, the images and videos kept reappearing online and in search results, as did deepfakes, which are generated and manipulated by artificial intelligence (AI).

The case has raised a number of crucial questions: How extensive should online data protection be? What are the worst-case scenarios, particularly for women and those perceived to be female? What can be done? 

The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous and is referred to as Laura on HateAid's site, found out by chance that her data had been stolen when she one day decided to look up her own name online. She told the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel that discovering intimate pictures and videos of herself online, none of which were ever intended for publication, felt akin to having been raped. Her life has since changed completely. She has moved homes, changed jobs and now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.

After failing to get Google to remove the content from its search results out of court, she has now sued the company in Ireland, where it has its European headquarters.

HateAid is supporting her in this endeavor. ""We are covering all the costs and future cost risks in this case, because very few people affected [by such a case] can actually imagine taking the risk of suing a corporation like Google,"" Hate Aid CEO Josephine Ballon told DW. She added that she hoped there would be a landmark ruling that would clarify whether search engines are legally obliged to permanently remove images from search results after they are reported, even if they are re-uploaded elsewhere.

""11 years ago, the European Court of Justice made data protection history with its landmark ruling on the 'right to be forgotten,'"" Data protection expert and computer scientist Marit Hansen told DW. ""The current case aims to build on that.""

The right to be forgotten allows a person to request the removal of their personal data if certain conditions apply. 

Hansen, the data protection commissioner for the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, said it made sense that, in accordance with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the fundamental right to data protection, a person's use of their own data must remain manageable.

""It is not surprising that obligations for global search engine providers will arise. However, the extent of these obligations with regard to images must now be delineated.""

Asked whether it was technically possible to filter out certain results, Hansen said this was relatively easy regarding exact copies, where all the bits in an image file matched. What was more complicated, she explained, was when it came to content containing deviations from the original, for instance, due to cropping or alterations made with the help of AI.

""This issue is related to the possibilities offered by reverse image searches, which various companies, including Google, provide,"" she said. A reverse image search involves uploading an image, and asking a search engine to look for similar images. It's not 100% reliable, and often delivers incorrect results.

Hansen explained that search engine providers could use this to argue that the technical accuracy for filtering identical images simply wasn't high enough yet. But she said that in principle, Google and others should be held accountable. Google did not respond to a request by DW to answer questions regarding the current case.

HateAid sees Laura's case not only as an example of the problems related to data protection and privacy issues on the internet, but also of image-based sexualized violence against women and those who are perceived as female. And also of the profit that companies such as Google make. Because ""a search engine makes content accessible to a wide audience and profits from the resulting clicks,"" said Ballon.

HateAid is accompanying its lawsuit with a campaign: Our nudes are #NotYourBusiness. ""Women and people perceived as female are particularly affected by the misuse of intimate images, or fake images and videos created using AI. These days, all you really need is a LinkedIn profile picture. This is a problem that affects society as a whole, and it is growing, as we see from our counseling services for victims,"" said Ballon.

Many people probably associate image-based sexual violence with celebrities. In 2014, hundreds of nude photos of mainly female celebrities were leaked after a huge hacking attack that became known as ""Celebgate."" The US singer Taylor Swift and the Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni are just two of the many women who have been the victims of deepfake videos.

But Laura's case shows that such attacks can also target people who are not in the public eye.

The idea of Hate Aid's case is to force Google to provide better protection for victims of such attacks, as well as to make the creation of deepfakes a criminal offense if a person depicted did not give their consent.

""Without this, those affected will have to search for images their whole lives and submit manual removal requests,"" said Ballon. ""This is an incredible psychological burden that should not exist and does not have to exist.""

'Cyber-apostle' Carlo Acutis, who died of leukaemia in 2006 aged just 15, was officially canonized at the Vatican on Sunday. Pope Leo said he was happy to see many young Catholics attending the ceremony.

An Italian teenager who died of leukaemia in 2006 at the age of 15 was on Sunday proclaimed a saint of the Catholic Church, becoming the first millennial to be canonized.

London-born Carlo Acutis, dubbed ""God's influencer"" due to his use of the internet and social media to spread the faith during his short lifetime, was canonized by Pope Leo XIV in a ceremony in St Peter's Square attended by tens of thousands of people, including his family.

Pier Giorgio Frassati, a young Italian mountaineering enthusiast who passed away from polio in 1925, aged 24, was also made a saint.

""Saints Pier Giorgio Frassati and Carlo Acutis are an invitation to all of us, especially young people, not to squander our lives, but to direct them upwards and make them masterpieces,"" Pope Leo said in his homily, in front of tapestries displayed on the facade of St. Peter's Basilica showing images of both young men.

""Even when illness struck them and cut short their young lives, not even this stopped them nor prevented them from loving, offering themselves to God,"" he said.

Acutis, who was born in London in 1991 to Italian parents, grew up in Milan in northern Italy.

Despite his family not being particularly religious, the young man became a devout Catholic, attending mass daily and developing a reputation for kindness, standing up for bullied children and bringing food and sleeping bags to homeless people.

But other aspects of his life were less traditional. A keen gamer, Acutis taught himself basic coding and used his skills to document miracles and other elements of the Catholic faith online.

The body of the so-called ""cyber-apostle,"" dressed in modern jeans and a pair of Nike trainers, lies preserved in a glass tomb in the central Italian town of Assisi, which was visited by over one million pilgrims last year alone.

Acutis had a particular impact on young Catholics, many of whom were present at his canonization ceremony at the Vatican. ""I'm happy to see so many young people!"" said Pope Leo ahead of the mass.

""He was able to combine his everyday life — school, football and his passion for IT and computers — with an unshakeable faith,"" 17-year-old Filippo Bellaviti told the AFP news agency.

""Seeing people from so many parts of the world, you can see the affection for Carlo for what he's done.""

Eleanor Hauser, 15, on a school trip to Italy from the state of North Carolina in the United States, said she had been told about Acutis by her Catholic grandmother.

""It shows that you can do so much even when you're young, you can make an impact on the world no matter how old you are,"" she said.

Being made a saint is the result of a long and meticulous process, involving an investigation by Vatican specialists who assess whether the obligatory two miracles have taken place.

Miracles attributed to Acutis include the healing of a Brazilian child suffering from a rare pancreatic malformation, and the recovery of a Costa Rican student seriously injured in a traffic accident.

Acutis' mother, Antonia Salzano, said her son was proof that ""we are all called to be saints ... everyone is special.""

President Donald Trump and his top political advisers are plotting an aggressive push to oust one of his most persistent Republican adversaries: Rep. Thomas Massie.
    


            And House GOP leaders won't stand in Trump's way.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team are sending their clearest signals to date that their conservative colleague will have to fend for himself as Trump's allies prepare to dump millions into Massie's district to purge him from the Northeastern Kentucky district he's represented for nearly 13 years. In interviews with CNN, five members of House GOP leadership declined to offer their backing for Massie's reelection bid – and Johnson would not say if he'd support his colleague.
    


            Instead, the speaker admonished Massie for undercutting his party's agenda – as the libertarian-minded Republican intensifies his furious battle to force the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files and derides Trump's signature domestic policy achievement for driving up the national debt.
    


            “He is actively working against his team almost daily now and seems to enjoy that role. So he is, you know, deciding his own fate,” Johnson told CNN, delivering a firm message that party leaders would not intervene to protect Massie in the escalating feud with Trump.
    


            While Johnson said his job is to “lead the incumbent protection program,” the speaker chided Massie for waging “unfounded attacks” against him. And he added: “My way is to reach out an olive branch to everybody and be a peacemaker. And some people make that very difficult for me.”
    


            The lack of support among House GOP leaders is a reflection of months of mounting frustration with the Kentucky Republican as he's personally antagonized both the speaker and president in a series of fights – most recently in trying to force a vote on a bill to release the Epstein files over intense opposition from Johnson and the White House. Massie needs the support of just five other Republicans – along with all Democrats – to put the bill on the floor, but he remains two GOP signatures short.
    


            Trump and his team are still searching for a candidate who can go toe-to-toe with the 54-year-old Massie, who has burnished a brand of a party maverick not afraid to break from his leadership and the president of his own party – namely on issues of government spending and budget deficits. But Trump views Massie as a deeply disloyal actor in a party where he demands unflinching support.
    


            Trump has met with state Sen. Aaron Reed, who has privately expressed interest in a primary challenge against Massie, according to three sources familiar with the meeting from earlier this summer. But Trump still has yet to signal he'd endorse Reed, a former Navy SEAL who is staunchly conservative, as the presiden'ts team is weighing other potential challengers ahead of the January 9 candidate filing deadline, according to the sources. (Reed did not respond to requests for comment.)
    


            But Trump allies fully expect the president to put his muscle behind a candidate after his outside group pummels Massie with millions in attack ads.
    


            In an interview, Massie brushed off the attacks and voiced confidence in his reelection chances. He pushed back on the criticism from the speaker as he defended his push for the government's files on Epstein's sex trafficking case, citing broad support based on public opinion polls. And he claimed that Trump was trying to spare some of his allies and donors from “embarrassment” by shielding the files.
    


            “The speaker's position depends on him rubber stamping, not just rubber stamping, but reinforcing anything Donald Trump wants, even if Donald Trump is wrong,” Massie said. “So the speaker's in a tough spot.”
    


Here's what's next in the Epstein files saga



            He added: “I don't see that I'm making their life hard at all, unless they think it's hard, because they're going to have to take a vote to put them on record. If that's hard, I'm sorry, that's your job.”
    


            Trump and his political advisers are girding for a blockbuster primary fight next year.  A pro-Trump super PAC called “MAGA Kentucky” has reserved $1.6 million in ads this summer, according to AdImpact data reviewed by CNN. The group is being led by Chris LaCivita, Trump's 2024 campaign co-manager, and pollster Tony Fabrizio.
    


            And there could be a lot more anti-Massie money to come. Pro-Israel groups like AIPAC also plan to spend big to oust Massie, who has a long history of voting against US support for Israel, according to a person familiar with the plans.
    


            With the May primary still months away, Massie has yet to spend much on air, having spent just $418,000 on ads this year. Whether he gets some outside help – including from the world's richest person, Elon Musk, who posted on X in June that he'd help Massie as he was railing against Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act – remains to be seen.
    


            In his more than a dozen years in Congress, Massie has never been a leadership loyalist, opposing plenty of party priorities on the floor under several GOP speakers – and even unsuccessfully sought to oust Johnson from the speakership last year.
    


            But his standing within the party has shifted recently, and many Republicans privately argue that he has become more of an agitator to Trump and leadership, according to multiple lawmakers and senior aides. He retains staunch support from fellow conservatives like Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who also voted against Trump's megabill earlier this year.
    


            “I'm a big supporter of Thomas Massie,” Paul told reporters in July, according to the Louisville Courier Journal. “He's a man of principle who votes against the deficit like I do, whether it's Republicans proposing spending or Democrats.”
    


            Within the House GOP, Massie has won over some key Trump allies like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who is forcefully backing his push to release the Epstein files and has personally spoken to the president about the importance of the matter.
    


            Even so, other GOP colleagues working with Massie on the Epstein push said they wished he'd taken a different approach with Trump.
    


            “I will tell you that I like Thomas on a lot of positions,” said Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican who has long demanded the Epstein files be released but has yet to sign onto Massie's push to force a vote in defiance of the White House. “But I think that the way that this has kind of flushed out between his personal relationship with the president is unfortunate to see unfold.”
    


            Luna declined to say whether she'd back Massie's reelection.
    


            “There's a way that you can debate and disagree with people, but the moment that you get personal and the moment that you start doing things for reasons other than what you're telling the public, I think that kind of crosses the Rubicon,” Luna said. “There's no turning back from that.”
    


            Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican who has supported Massie's bill but said he will not go against his own leadership to force a floor vote, said he wished his colleague had made it a “less confrontational” issue.
    


            “I didn't make that choice. He did,” Van Drew said. “He has chosen his bed. Now he's gotta lie in it.”
    


            Massie has fended off every previous challenger in his district, a fiercely independent, deeply conservative stretch of Northeastern Kentucky that is known to local political operatives as the “Wild West” of the state. It's also an extremely expensive district for anyone running for office: It's split into four media markets in three different states. Still, senior Republicans believe Massie could be vulnerable given the right candidate.
    


            “I would not underestimate the president's grip on the base,” said one senior House GOP lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity to freely discuss a colleague's political future. But the member said they still need a Republican there who can win: “That's a problem. The candidate matters. Ultimately, it's not a plebiscite. It's an election, right? It's not – do you like this person or not?”
    


            Massie would not be the first Republican targeted for defeat by Trump. Last March, then-Rep. Bob Good of Virginia was ousted in an ugly primary after sparring with GOP leadership and backing Trump's opponent, Ron DeSantis, in the 2024 presidential primary.
    


            Some Republicans believe the Massie vs. MAGA primary will be even nastier, given the Kentucky congressman's repeated votes against Trump priorities — including his signature tax and spending cuts bill — and his disparagement over Trump's handling of Epstein.
    


            On the leadership level, top Republicans are typically reticent to publicly criticize their own members. But some, like House GOP Conference Chair Lisa McClain, struck a note of disappointment about Massie's rogue push to defy Johnson over the Epstein vote.
    


            “He's challenged us, and disagreement is not disloyalty. … But at the end of the day, when we decide to call a play, we've got to run the play the coach calls,” McClain said.
    


            As for his reelection, McClain said leadership tends not to get involved in primaries and stressed she simply wants to keep the GOP majority.
    


            “Whoever is going to stay in that seat and keep that majority, that's what I want, right?” McClain said. “If Thomas Massie is the best person to do that, then absolutely, I want him to do that, right? I also think it's up to his voters to decide, not necessarily for me.”
    


            House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, the No. 3 Republican, said it was up to Massie to figure out his own reelection bid.
    


            “I work with every single member of our team,” Emmer told CNN when asked about how party leaders would handle the White House's efforts to oust Massie. “I have to work through their relationships with each other. I have to work through their relationships with their constituents. I leave all of our members to take care of their own business, both in the policy arena and in the campaign.”
    


            Rep. Richard Hudson, the House GOP's campaign chief, signaled he was staying away from the internal feud as well.
    


            “My focus is on beating Democrats,” Hudson said. “I don't get involved in primaries.”
    


            Asked about GOP leaders' views about his race, Massie shrugged it off.
    


            “I thought about this yesterday in our press conference with the survivors,” Massie said, referring to an emotional, 90-minute event where nearly a dozen women spoke about how Epstein abused them when they were children. “My life is difficult in a political sense, but they're living a nightmare of shame. I think it's kind of petty for me to complain about some political race that I have to be in when there are other people who are making much greater sacrifices.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Will RFK Jr.'s wrecking-ball approach to vaccines and public health lead Trump onto thin political ice?","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/07/politics/covid-vaccines-rfk-monarez-trump-public-health-analysis","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT","


            As Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intensifies his drive to reverse decades of vaccine policy, the medical profession joins a growing list of fields and institutions facing unprecedented threats from the federal government under President Donald Trump. But this time the administration may have chosen an adversary with more capacity to fight back than the law firms, major universities and media organizations it has targeted so far.
    


            To many medical professionals, Kennedy's hostility toward vaccines represents the greatest threat to the nation's public health system in memory. Medical groups fear that Kennedy's wide-ranging actions — such as firing all the members of a prestigious advisory committee that advises the federal government on vaccine policy; narrowing access to the latest Covid vaccine; and pledging to soon release a study that will probably reexamine the widely debunked claim that childhood vaccines cause autism — will trigger a resurgence of deadly diseases, particularly among children.
    


            “It's overwhelming; it's a complete frame shift,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. “It's not only that people are declaring their own scientific truths; it's that science is losing its place as a source of truth. I could never imagine that something like this would ever happen. It's a war on expertise.”
    


            Medical groups are expressing increasing alarm that Kennedy's rhetoric and actions will increase the already-growing number of parents demanding medical or religious exemptions from state vaccine mandates for school attendance and potentially encourage conservative states to repeal those mandates altogether. That concern became much more immediate last week after Florida's Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis announced their intent to eliminate all state vaccine mandates, including those for school attendance. If implemented, that will make Florida the first state to do so.
    


            Other institutions that Trump has targeted have struggled to mount an effective resistance to his efforts. But the medical profession may have more advantages than most.
    


            Although confidence in medical professionals has declined since the Covid pandemic, particularly among Republicans, they still enter the debate over vaccine access with a much deeper well of credibility with the public than many of the other groups Trump has targeted, polls show. Surveys also consistently show that most Americans believe the major childhood vaccinations are safe and should remain a requirement for children to attend school. Taken together, those attitudes could make Kennedy's crusade against vaccines riskier for Trump than the president's actions against other constituencies.
    


            “At the moment (Trump) seems to be enjoying it but … how important is it for him to keep the fringe part of his base happy?” said Drew Altman, president of KFF, a nonpartisan think tank focusing on health care issues. “Why does he care so much? At some point this (will) turn off a large segment of the American people, and he may decide this is no longer in his interest.”
    


            The key question in how this debate unfolds may be whether the disparate and often fractious medical interests can unite effectively in common action.
    


            “We need the organizations that represent America's physicians to stand up, both for the sake of (influencing) policy and for the sake of giving guidance to their patients,” said Leslie Dach, chair of Protect Our Care, a liberal advocacy group that focuses on health care access. “This is no time to sit on the sidelines.”
    


            Many of the institutions Trump has targeted most aggressively in his second term present a similar profile. Elite universities, such as Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania; media organizations such as ABC, CBS and the Wall Street Journal ; and law firms such as Covington & Burling are all wealthy, influential and accustomed to circulating through the elite circles of political power.
    


            But all operate in sectors of the economy that face substantial skepticism from the general public and antagonism from the Republican base, which tends to view them as pillars of the liberal establishment. Polling by the Gallup Organization over the past few years captures those dynamics.
    


In an annual Gallup poll that tracks the public's assessment of various professions, just 17% of adults last year said lawyers demonstrate high standards of honesty and ethics, and only 13% said the same about TV reporters. Even fewer Republicans expressed trust in those groups: just 12% for lawyers and 5% for TV reporters. College teachers performed better in a 2023 survey, with 42% of the public overall expressing trust in them. But the share of Republicans who expressed trust in them was only about half that, at 22%.
    


            That backdrop may help explain the strategy adopted by institutions in the industries Trump has targeted for funding cuts or other sanctions. Several negotiated settlements with the administration. A few have fought him in court, with some law firms and Harvard University winning strongly worded lower court decisions invalidating Trump moves against them. But none of Trump's early targets have launched a campaign to mobilize public opposition and pressure Congress to stop his moves altogether.
    


            Medical professionals may be in a better position to try.
    


            The share of Americans who view doctors as honest and trustworthy in Gallup polling has fallen since the Covid pandemic. Confidence in the overall “medical system” — a more expansive and amorphous concept — has also declined somewhat since Covid. But in the latest Gallup survey, 53% of all Americans still expressed trust specifically in doctors, including 44% of Republicans. Nurses received even higher grades for honesty.
    


            The public is especially inclined to trust medical professionals on issues related to vaccination. In an April national poll, KFF found that about four-fifths of Americans trusted their own doctors as a “reliable source for information about vaccines.” Among parents, about four-fifths said they trusted their pediatricians for such information. By contrast, only about two-fifths of all Americans said they trusted either Kennedy or Trump for vaccine guidance.
    


            KFF surveys have also found that the vast majority of Americans remain convinced that the major childhood vaccinations are safe, and about four-fifths of parents (including three-fourths of Republicans) continue to support the requirement that students receive vaccinations to attend schools.
    


            Robert Blendon, an emeritus professor of health policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the backlash among Republican voters against public health decisions during Covid, such as vaccine and mask mandates, created a constituency within the GOP for challenging federal vaccine policy — but that medical professionals still have standing to sway it.
    


            “Republicans hold a belief (that) real mistakes were made by the CDC and public health authorities, and that has really opened up this opportunity for Kennedy,” Blendon said. But “when I was terribly sick (during the pandemic), who did I go to? It was my physician. It was the people running the units at my local hospitals.”
    


            Blendon said the key for medical interests will be to focus their message on personalizing the potential impact of Kennedy's policies — particularly for influencing voters in Trump's electoral coalition.
    


            “They are not going to be that influenced when scientists say it's really bad for the world,” Blendon said. “But they could be interested in practicing physicians who say it could endanger the health of your own family.”
    


            It remains uncertain, though, how forcefully medical groups will press those arguments. One reason universities, law firms, media organizations and even the clean energy industry failed to unite in robust opposition to Trump's actions is that many preferred to stay quiet for fear the Trump administration could retaliate by threatening other federal funding, licenses or contracts.
    


            Trump holds similar leverage over medical professionals with his ability to influence federal reimbursement rates, particularly for Medicare — which Kennedy has already signaled he hopes to reexamine. Pediatricians and other physicians “will be incredibly more trusted by parents than these various government people,” Blendon said. But the question remains “whether or not they are going to be nervous about threats to payment.”
    


            Early in Trump's presidency, the medical professions seemed to follow the same accommodating strategy as universities, law firms and media companies. The leading medical industry and professional associations mostly kept mum during Kennedy's contentious confirmation hearings, Trump's moves to slash federal funding for medical research, and even during congressional passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that will revoke health insurance from more Americans than any single bill ever.
    


            But medical groups are now issuing more urgent alarms about the flurry of anti-vaccine actions from Kennedy that culminated in last month's dismissal of Dr. Susan Monarez, the recently confirmed director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who has said she refused to rubber-stamp Kennedy decisions that could reduce vaccine access.
    


            Probably the most aggressive group has been the nation's pediatricians. When Trump dismissed Monarez and triggered the resignations of other top CDC officials, Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, issued a stark statement declaring, “This is a dangerous moment for our country and for the health of every family in every community.”
    


            Together with other medical groups, including the organizations representing public health officers, the pediatricians sued in July to overturn Kennedy's decision  not to authorize the latest Covid booster for healthy people younger than 65. The pediatricians have also launched a website to rebut Kennedy vaccine claims and published their own recommendations for childhood vaccination, which continues to encourage the Covid vaccine for young people.
    


            Other groups that have pushed back especially forcefully against Kennedy include organizations representing immunologists, public health professionals and nurses. The most important evolution has occurred at the most prominent of the medical groups, the American Medical Association. Its members are more vulnerable than pediatricians to possible changes in federal payment systems because pediatricians would not be directly affected by reimbursement rates for Medicare, which serves seniors. And early on, the AMA appeared especially leery of confrontation with Trump.
    


            But, as documented in a recent Politico story, the group faced mounting dissent over its hands-off approach that culminated in an open rebellion at its June annual meeting from critics demanding more forceful pushback to an array of Trump policies. Since then, the tenor of the AMA's statements has moved closer to those of the other major medical organizations; the AMA president called Monarez's dismissal “highly alarming” and a threat to public health.
    


            A senior executive at one of the leading medical professional trade associations, who asked not to be identified while discussing internal conversations, said that all the leading groups are trending in that direction.
    


            Early in Trump's term, the official said, “people were trying to find their footing” and “figure out how to play a constructive role in health policy and also stand up to the things that are really out of bounds.” In addition, the official added, groups were hesitant about engaging because “this administration has a history of punishing people that disagree with them.”
    


            Now, though, the official said, “things are shifting” because Kennedy's actions have grown so alarming. “Groups are going to feel … that they can't sit it out anymore,” the official said. In a measure of the change, a coalition of medical groups on Thursday issued a joint call for Kennedy's resignation, writing, “We are gravely concerned that American people will needlessly suffer and die as a result of (his) policies.”
    


            Medical professionals may have retained more public trust than other experts, but all forms of expertise have lost ground with the public in recent years, noted Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Young people, particularly men, are drawn to a kind of DIY ethos around decisions where they might once have deferred to credentialed experts, Cox said.
    


            “This younger generation has grown up with access to all the information that they could ever want or need and that feels more natural and comfortable to them” than relying on experts, Cox said. “They feel: ‘I don't need a college degree, I don't need experts to tell me how to live or what to do. I can find what's right for me online and … look for people who have a lifestyle that I aspire to. And those are the people I can put my faith in.' ”
    


            Those libertarian-ish attitudes have seeded the ground for Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement and created the energetic constituency he brought into Trump's electoral coalition. But as Offit pointed out, such attitudes directly collide with the core tenet of public health, which is collective action to protect the most vulnerable.
    


            “The current zeitgeist is medical freedom: ‘I'm going to do my own research, I'm going to make a decision that is best for me and my child,'” said Offit, who was recently blocked from participating in a federal vaccine policy advisory committee.   “That is in direct conflict with public health. In public health, you care about your neighbor.”
    


            Those competing instincts are now colliding most consequentially in the nation's classrooms and playgrounds. Public health experts say that to achieve herd immunity against the most dangerous childhood diseases, such as measles, about 95% of all schoolchildren must be vaccinated. But the share of newly enrolled kindergarten students who have received the MMR vaccine covering measles, mumps and rubella has fallen well below that level (to 92.5% in the school year that began in September 2024) as the share of parents requesting an exemption has steadily increased, according to CDC data.
    


            These trends mean the vast majority of parents who continue to believe in vaccines cannot fully protect their children if enough people around them choose not to vaccinate their own. That threat will only rise if Kennedy takes further actions that encourage more parents not to vaccinate their children — or inspire more red states to consider rescinding their school mandates.
    


Record share of US kindergartners missed required vaccinations last year, ahead of surge in measles cases



            In that way, the risks that Kennedy's decisions could impose on average families are far more tangible than the implications of most debates about Trump's second-term priorities. Trump, mindful of the independent following that Kennedy has brought to him, appears extremely reluctant to curb him. But even at last week's Finance Committee hearing, several GOP senators sharply challenged Kennedy's direction — a rare moment of open Republican dissent to Trump.
    


            And on Friday afternoon, Trump took a conspicuous step away from vaccine skepticism, telling reporters, “You have to be careful when you say people don't need to be vaccinated. You have some vaccines that just work.” Trump was responding to a question about Florida's move to rescind school vaccination mandates — but his language could easily apply to Kennedy as well.
    


            With the medical profession stirring in opposition, cracks opening in Republican support and polls showing that most Americans don't share Kennedy's hostility to vaccinations, Trump eventually may view his lightning rod HHS secretary as too great a threat to his own political health. The political system's antibodies against extremism have been gravely compromised in the Trump era — but they may be starting to coalesce against Kennedy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","A property tax revolt is spreading — with help from key conservatives","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/07/politics/property-taxes-abolish-florida-texas","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT","


            With real estate prices climbing and household budgets under strain, a once-fringe push to eliminate property taxes is drawing new energy — and the backing of high-profile conservative figures.
    


            Republican firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia recently argued for making it a national priority. Billionaire Elon Musk has likened property taxes to “a de facto lease from the government” that should be abolished. And in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a once and possible future presidential contender, has vowed to move his state in that direction.
    


            “If you own your home, to truly own it, you have to own it free and clear of the government,” DeSantis said Tuesday.
    


            For decades, property taxes have underwritten the basic functions of local government — schools, parks, roads, police and fire departments, trash collection. But as home values have surged, tax bills have ballooned in tandem, fueling what David Schleicher, a Yale professor of local government, described as a “property tax revolt” shaking cities and states alike.
    


            “This is a really big trend that is below the radar because it doesn't involve President Trump,” Schleicher said. “But it doesn't need fireworks to announce itself. It's already changing our relationship with government and how schools work and property markets.”
    


            The frustration is cutting across partisan lines. Last year, voters in nine states approved referendums to cap or curb rising assessments, from tying bills to inflation in Georgia to New Mexico and Colorado expanding tax exemptions for veterans who own homes there. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Texas, Indiana, New Jersey, New York and elsewhere have approved tens of billions of dollars in property tax relief over the past 18 months.
    


            To some, though, such measures fall short. Grassroots campaigns in Michigan and Ohio are now gathering signatures for ballot initiatives that would abolish property taxes altogether. In Texas, Republican state Rep. Brian Harrison has proposed a state constitutional amendment to end them there by 2031.
    


            “Never-ending property taxes are unethical, immoral and incompatible with private property rights,” Harrison said, “and need to be thrown to the ash heap of history.”
    


            Critics warn that eliminating property taxes would devastate local budgets. The levy accounts for 70% of what cities and counties collect nationwide, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. In Florida alone, property taxes amounted to about $60 billion last year, according to the state Department of Revenue.
    


            Jared Walczak, the vice president of State Projects at the Tax Foundation, said that while angst over property taxes is justified, few communities could overcome their elimination. Rural and residential areas lack the retail base to rely on sales tax, and most local governments are barred from taxing income, he said. That would leave states to collect and distribute money through new levies, stripping power from local officials.
    


            “It's just not responsible,” Walczak said. “That's an enormous amount to offset.”
    


            Even DeSantis, who is exploring a 2026 ballot measure to phase out property taxes on homes, has acknowledged Florida may be uniquely positioned because of its robust tourism taxes and revenue collected on second homes.
    


            “We're the only state that can probably pull this off,” DeSantis said, though he has yet to unveil a detailed plan.
    


            For some advocates of the idea, finding a way to pay for programs and services is a problem for others to solve. Harrison, who downplayed the financial pain, nevertheless made clear: “I'm not looking for a dollar-for-dollar replacement. I want to cut government.”
    


            In Ohio, Brian Massie, who leads a citizens group pushing to abolish property taxes, suggested charging fees for fire departments calls, adding more toll roads and selling annual park and library passes. But he said those concerned about the unknown should be troubled by the status quo's effect on struggling families and seniors on fixed incomes.
    


            “I've spent $100,000 in property taxes for a school I've never used,” Massie said. “You can't continue to suck the lifeblood out of the community.”
    


            The moment recalls anti-tax movements from a half-century ago, when homeowner anger over rising costs produced a wave of ballot initiatives, including California's Proposition 13, which sharply capped property taxes.
    


            The belief that property should never be taxed has long lingered at the margins of American politics. But a post-pandemic surge in home values has transformed it from a grievance bubbling beneath the surface into a cause that is beginning to reshape tax debates and Republican politics.
    


            Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who lost a bid for governor in 2022 and has hinted at another campaign in 2026, proposed a constitutional amendment that would eliminate school property taxes in his state. Rep. Byron Donalds, the Trump-backed candidate to succeed DeSantis as Florida governor, told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson earlier this year he would “definitely be in favor” of eliminating property taxes.
    


            In Ohio, Republican Vivek Ramaswamy, a presidential candidate in 2024, launched his campaign for governor with a speech declaring “we need to bring down property taxes in this state immediately — eventually down to zero.” He has since softened his stance, saying he would eliminate income taxes and “cap” property taxes, though his campaign would not explain the shift.
    


            The movement has largely grown on grassroots support and without major financial backing, though that could be changing. Club for Growth, a conservative group funded in part by billionaire GOP donors Jeff Yass and Richard Uihlein, has been discussing the issue with lawmakers and gubernatorial candidates and is closely tracking its rise, a person with knowledge of the organization's planning told CNN.
    


            “Conservatives who oppose cutting property taxes so they can fund big government are RINOs we will hold accountable,” Club for Growth president David McIntosh told CNN in a statement supporting efforts to eliminate the tax.
    


            Despite the momentum, the cause suffered a considerable setback last year in North Dakota. There, an unusual coalition of labor groups, progressive organizations, business leaders and both Republicans and Democrats banded together to defeat a ballot initiative that would have ended property taxes in the state. The measure was opposed by then-Gov. Doug Burgum, now the secretary of the interior, as well as fellow Republican Kelly Armstrong, who succeeded him.
    


            By a two-to-one margin North Dakotans rejected the referendum — about the same share of voters who backed Trump in the state.
    


            Chad Oban, a Democratic operative who led the opposition campaign, said he assumed such a decisive defeat in a deeply conservative state would halt the movement. Watching it spread now, he warned leaders in other states not to ignore the anger.
    


            “People are upset about property taxes and it's not because they're unreasonable,” Oban said. “If they get pushed too hard, eventually a state is going to pass this. And then, oh my.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","In Chicago, residents celebrate Mexican Independence Day amid threats of heightened immigration enforcement","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/07/us/chicago-immigration-enforcement","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 08:45:00 GMT","


            In the Lower West Side of Chicago, music blared and green, white and red flags fluttered down the streets of the predominantly Latino Pilsen neighborhood on Saturday as crowds gathered for the start of Mexican Independence Day celebrations.
    


            Costumed performers and children with baskets of treats paraded through the community, drawing cheers from families lining the sidewalks.
    


            But the joy of the annual celebration came with an undercurrent of unease this year. Bright orange whistles swung from the necks of parade-goers and dancers, each one ready to cut through the music should federal immigration agents appear.
    


            The caution reflects fears across the city that Chicago could be the next target of President Donald Trump's intense immigration crackdown. Independence Day festivities in the Windy City this year were quieter, some even postponed, under the weight of the looming threats.
    


            But in Pilsen, the neighborhood gathered anyway, choosing joy over fear.
    


            “It's always a good moment to celebrate our culture, our customs,” Araceli Lucio, a parade-goer and longtime resident, told CNN. “I think now more than ever is when we need to demonstrate that we are united and we are a community.”
    


            The Mexican holiday usually draws hundreds of thousands of attendees to more than a week of celebrations across Chicago that began Saturday. But in response to the anticipated ramp-up of immigration enforcement, streets are quieter as events have been muted.
    


            In Wauconda, a village in northwest Chicago, the annual Latino Heritage Festival was canceled due to “the recent weather situation and immigration concerns in our area,” the Wauconda Police Department said in a Friday social media post.
    


            Fiesta Patrias, one of the largest Mexican Independence Day events, has been postponed for the first time in its 30-year history to November 1 from September 14. The festival is celebrated every year in Waukegan, a suburb along Lake Michigan just north of the Great Lakes naval base, the facility Gov. JB Pritzker said Trump is set to use as a command center for incoming immigration agents.
    


            “I know that the vendors perhaps are upset, but it is what it is – for the safety of the people,” said Margaret Carrasco, president of Fiesta Patrias.
    


            El Grito Chicago, a two-day festival in downtown's Grant Park, also decided to postpone citing concerns for the “safety of our community.”
    


            “We're saddened about the loss of an opportunity to uplift a vision of dignity, strength, and belonging at a time when it's sorely needed,” event organizers said in a statement.
    


            Pilsen parade-goers acknowledged the fear and hesitation in these pockets of the city's Latino communities, backing organizers' decisions to put a hold on their events.
    


            “We're with them, we support them, we understand what they're feeling,” Claudia Villagrana, who celebrated Saturday in Pilsen, told CNN.
    


            Illinois Reps. Mike Quigley and Jesús “Chuy” García were also seen walking in Saturday's parade in Pilsen, as state officials have been heeding warnings of the impending immigration enforcement in Chicago.
    


            Officials in Chicago have been monitoring days of warnings the city could be the next target of Trump's expanding enforcement efforts across the country.
    


            The president and his aides have repeatedly slammed Chicago over policies limiting cooperation between local authorities and federal immigration enforcement. Chicago grappled with an influx of migrants during the Biden administration following surges along the US southern border and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's decision to transport migrants to Democratic-led cities.
    


            Chicago was also among the first cities targeted in immigration enforcement operations when Trump took office in January.
    


            Now, the anticipated operations in Chicago are expected to be on a larger scale, using personnel from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and possibly other agencies, CNN previously reported.
    


            Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an order last weekend aimed at resisting the crackdown, laying out plans for the city amid “escalating threats from the federal government.”
    


            The order “affirms” Chicago police will not “collaborate with federal agents on joint law enforcement patrols, arrest operations, or other law enforcement duties including civil immigration enforcement.”
    


            But residents are still bracing for impact.
    


            Communities are preparing for ICE presence by handing out flyers reminding families they have the right to remain silent, don't have to consent to be searched and don't have to share their birthplace or citizenship status, among other rights.
    


            Sylvelia Pittman, a teacher at Nash Elementary on Chicago's West Side, said she heard children in her classroom talking about potential ICE arrests on Friday.

            Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Sunday he had decided to resign, ushering in a potentially lengthy period of policy paralysis at a shaky moment for the world's fourth-largest economy.
    


            Ishiba, 68, instructed his Liberal Democratic Party – which has governed Japan for almost all of the post-war era - to hold an emergency leadership race, he told a press conference, adding he would continue his duties until his successor was elected.
    


            Since coming to power less than a year ago, Ishiba has overseen his ruling coalition lose its majorities in elections for both houses of parliament amid voter anger over rising living costs.
    


            Until Sunday, he had refused calls to step down following the latest of those losses in July's upper house vote. He had focused instead on ironing out details of a trade deal with the United States on President Donald Trump's tariffs, which have roiled Japan's critical automotive industry and cast a shadow over weak growth.
    


            “With Japan having signed the trade agreement and the president having signed the executive order, we have passed a key hurdle,” Ishiba said, his voice seeming to catch with emotion. “I would like to pass the baton to the next generation.”
    


            Concern over political uncertainty led to a sell-off in Japan's yen currency and its government bonds last week, with the yield on the 30-year bond hitting a record high on Wednesday.
    


            Speculation over Ishiba's fate was stoked by the LDP's decision to schedule a vote for Monday on whether to hold an extraordinary leadership election.
    


            While a fresh leadership race could add pain for an economy hit by U.S. tariffs, markets are focusing more on the chance of Ishiba being replaced by an advocate of looser fiscal and monetary policy, such as LDP veteran Sanae Takaichi, who has criticised the Bank of Japan's interest rate hikes.
    


            Ishiba narrowly defeated Takaichi in last year's LDP leadership run-off. Shinjiro Koizumi, the telegenic political scion who has gained prominence as Ishiba's farm minister tasked with trying to cap soaring prices, is another possible successor.
    


            “Given the political pressure mounting on Ishiba after the LDP's repeated election losses, his resignation was inevitable,” said Kazutaka Maeda, economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.
    


            “As for potential successors, Koizumi and Takaichi are seen as the most likely candidates. While Koizumi is not expected to bring major changes, Takaichi's stance on expansionary fiscal policy and her cautious approach to interest rate hikes could draw scrutiny from financial markets,” Maeda said.
    


Who is Japan's ‘dragonfly' prince, who could be the last emperor of the world's oldest monarchy?



            Since the party does not have a majority in either house, it is not guaranteed that the next LDP president will become prime minister.
    


            Whoever becomes the next leader may choose to call a snap election to seek a mandate, analysts said. While Japan's opposition remains fractured, the far-right, anti-immigration Sanseito party made big gains in July's upper house election, bringing once-fringe ideas into the political mainstream.
    


            Nearly 55% of respondents to a poll by Kyodo news agency published on Sunday said there was no need to hold an early election.
    


            Ishiba's last act as premier will have been to finalize the trade deal with the United States last week, under which Japan pledged $550 billion of investments in return for lower tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump.

WASHINGTON (AP) — In a swath of the nation's capital that sits across the tracks, and the river, residents can see the Washington Monument, the Waldorf Astoria — formerly the Trump Hotel — and the U.S. Capitol dome.

What the people of Anacostia cannot see are the National Guard units patrolling those areas. And they don't see them patrolling on this side of the Anacostia River, either.

In this storied region of Washington, home to Frederick Douglass, the crime that President Donald Trump has mobilized federal law enforcement to address is something residents would like to see more resources dedicated to. But it's complicated.

“We do need protection here,” said Mable Carter, 82. “I have to come down on the bus. It's horrifying.”

There might be military units patrolling Union Station and public spaces where tourists often come, she said, but “none of them over here. They are armed — on the Mall. Ain't nobody doing nothing on the Mall. It's for show.”

Carter wants to see more police in this area — the city's own police, under the direction of Chief Pamela Smith. “I'd rather see them give her a chance. She has the structure in place.”

The Pentagon, when asked if there were plans to deploy the National Guard to higher crime areas like Anacostia and who determines that, sent a list of stations where the military units were present as of Thursday. None of those deployments included stations east of the Anacostia River.




Over the course of two weekends east of the river, in conversations with groups and individuals, including a senior's gathering at Union Temple Baptist Church, a theme emerged. 

Like Carter, people would like more law enforcement resources, but they distrust the motives behind the surge and how it has usurped the authority of the mayor and local officers. And while they acknowledge crime is more serious here than most other areas of the district, it is nowhere near the levels of three decades ago, when the D.C. National Guard worked with the Metropolitan Police to address the violence.

This year's homicides in the district, as of Friday, were at 104, a 17% decrease from 126 as of Sept. 5 last year. But, more than 60% of them are in the two wards that are almost exclusively east of the Anacostia River, including 38 in Ward 8, according to the Metropolitan Police Department crime mapping tool. That proportion is about the same as it was in 2024 when there were 187 homicides citywide for the year. One of the most notable murders was a double homicide that left two teens lying dead on the street and a third man wounded.

“I just called the police the other night,” said Henny, 42, who owns NAM's Market. 

He said a group of teenagers attempted to rob his store after casing it throughout the day. He called police and said they asked him if they were armed. “I didn't see a weapon,” he said, adding that no patrol officers responded. 

The store owner said he has been here about 10 years and been victimized multiple times but thinks it is getting worse now. He does not give his last name out of fear.

“What worries me is to make sure they're not coming back,” he said. “There are a lot of things going on.” Asked if he feels safe he answers: “Absolutely not.”

He has pepper spray but has been told by authorities not to use it, he said. When he heard of the federal law enforcement and National Guard arrival, “To be honest, I said that's good — but that's not over here. It's getting worse. The city says crime is down but I don't see it.”

A block away, Rosie Hyde's perspective is different. The ashes of one of the 75-year-old widow's sons are spread around her property. Samuel Johnson was killed about three miles away on April 20, 1991. The case is still open.

Hyde, a retired probation officer for the city, said her son died during that epidemic of gun violence. “That was 35 years ago,” she said. “That tells you the rampage with guns is nothing new.”

Homicides topped 400 annually in 1989 and stayed there through 1996, according to the district's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Aggravated assaults were also at record totals.

Hyde believes Trump is after the optics in areas where he will get attention — at the train station, on the Mall, in areas with a concentration of tourists. “They haven't been over here like that,” she said.

The majestic home of Frederick Douglass is here, offering a panoramic view of other parts of the city west of the river. Farther east is the Smithsonian's Anacostia Community Museum. The plaque outside says as much about this moment as it does about history: The museum, it says, “aspires to illuminate and share the untold and often overlooked stories of people furthest from opportunity in the Greater Washington, D.C. region.”

Federal agents are in this area working with local authorities, including FBI agents and Border Patrol, as well as Metro Transit Authority police. Along Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, a major thoroughfare in Anacostia, new buildings mix with older ones and small groups of people mill about, drinking from bottles and with the occasional smell of marijuana. But it is relatively quiet.

At one point, a large group of National Guard members climbs out of a van at the Anacostia Metro station, but they catch the train heading west back beneath the river. While troops are stationed at 18 stops, the last one on the green line is the Navy Yard-Ballpark station, the final one west of the river. 

There was a time when the Guard was here — or, more precisely, above it. During the high crime years, the D.C. National Guard worked with District police; officers flew aboard the Guard's helicopters directing patrol units to crime scenes.

Norm Nixon, an associate pastor at Union Temple Baptist Church, said there are federal agents around, but their presence is not constant and no military uniforms are seen on the streets. He said local officers who try to push community policing — communicating with residents and acknowledging their concerns — will probably get blowback because of the federal presence. 

He, like others, questions why Trump decided to federalize the city when violence is present virtually everywhere, including in rural areas where drugs and economic hardships have created fertile ground for lawlessness.

“The president needs to have these initiatives to make it seem like something is happening, almost like he's got to make news,” Nixon said, adding that he is also concerned about the focus on rousting the homeless population. “What happened to those people? Are they receiving services?”

Vernon Hancock, a church elder and trustee attending a senior's day party, said he believes Trumps' actions are a test. “Washington, D.C., is easy because it is federal and he has the authority to do what he's doing,” Hancock said. “It is a federal city so he can just take over. But he wants to take this to other cities and spread this.”

President Donald Trump has promised to remove millions of people from the United States in the largest deportation program in American history. But his immigration agenda is facing various tests in the U.S. courts. 

For example, a federal appeals court ruled last week that the Trump administration cannot use an 18th-century wartime law to speed deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members, setting up a likely return showdown at the Supreme Court. 

Some of the president's policies affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people. Here are some Trump administration efforts that have come under court scrutiny: 

The Trump administration has used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to remove people it accused of being in the Tren de Aragua gang, arguing it's an invading force.

The administration deported people it designated as members to a notorious prison in El Salvador and argued that American courts could not order them freed. The Alien Enemies Act was only used three times before in U.S. history, all during declared wars — in the War of 1812 and the two world wars.

More than 250 of the men who were deported by the U.S. to El Salvador were returned to Venezuela earlier this summer in a complex deal brokered between the three countries. But litigation over the matter has continued. 

In Tuesday's ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, two judges on a three-judge panel agreed with immigrant rights lawyers and lower court judges who argued the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was not intended to be used against gangs such as Tren de Aragua.




Lee Gelernt, who argued the case for the ACLU, said the ruling reined in “the administration's view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.”

But Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said the president has the authority “to conduct national security operations in defense of the United States and to remove terrorists.” 

“We expect to be vindicated on the merits in this case,” she said.

President Trump issued an executive order that attempts to redefine birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment. 

The amendment's Citizenship Clause says all people born or naturalized in the U.S., and subject to U.S. jurisdiction, are citizens. The Trump administration asserts that a child born in the U.S. is not a citizen if the mother does not have legal immigration status or is in the country legally but temporarily, and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. 

States that have sued over the order — Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon — argue that it ignores the plain wording of the Citizenship Clause as well as a landmark birthright citizenship case in 1898. The Supreme Court had found that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents was a citizen by virtue of his birth on American soil.

A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled in late July that Trump's order is unconstitutional, affirming a lower-court decision in New Hampshire that blocked the order's enforcement nationwide.

The Trump administration has been sending people to countries where they have no ties, including El Salvador in Central America and the African nation of South Sudan. 

Trump officials have said these immigrants often come from countries that won't take them back or were convicted of violent crimes. Advocacy groups sued this year, arguing that people's due process rights were being violated and that immigrants were being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. 

In late March, a federal judge temporarily blocked third-country deportations of people without first being allowed to argue that it would jeopardize their safety. But in June, a divided Supreme Court halted that order, allowing the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands.

Lawyers for five men who were deported to the African country of Eswatini in July said Tuesday that the men have held prison for seven weeks without charges and no access to legal counsel. 

Attorneys for one of the men, Jamaican national Orville Etoria, said his home country was willing to accept him back. 

Earlier this year, U.S. immigration authorities began conducting mass immigration raids in Southern California, rounding up predominantly Latino immigrants from locations like car washes, Home Depots, and bus stops, even sometimes ensnaring U.S. citizens.

The practice prompted a lawsuit by immigrant advocacy groups that accused the administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in the region. The Justice Department has argued that federal agents are allowed to consider factors like race or ethnicity and occupations in an area it considers a “top enforcement priority.”

A federal judge ordered the administration to halt such tactics in seven California counties, including Los Angeles, writing that they violated the U.S. Constitution. A federal appeals court upheld the judge's temporary order. 

The Trump administration filed an emergency petition in early August that asks the Supreme Court to halt the lower court's ruling, with Solicitor General D. John Sauer arguing that it puts a “straitjacket” on federal agents. 

The Trump administration has sought to end programs that offer legal yet temporary authorization for people to live and work in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe. 

The efforts have prompted lawsuits across the country that say more than 1.5 million people are under what's known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, or humanitarian parole. 

Temporary Protected Status allows people already living in the U.S. to stay and work legally for up to 18 months if their homelands are unsafe because of civil unrest or natural disasters. The status can be repeatedly renewed. 

More than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela live in the U.S. under humanitarian parole, which allows people from countries where there's war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the U.S.

To qualify, they had to fly to the U.S. at their own expense and have a financial sponsor. For most people, the designation lasts for two years.

In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke TPS and humanitarian protections while the lawsuits proceed. As a result, it's possible that people who had protections could be deported before the legal cases are completed.

On Friday, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen restored TPS protections for 1.1 million Venezuelans and Haitians, ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had no legal authority to revoke extensions granted under the Biden administration. In August, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals backed him up in a related appeal. 

On the East Coast, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is deciding whether to uphold a Boston judge's order halting humanitarian parole terminations for roughly 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. 

The Department of Homeland Security announced in January that it was expanding the use of expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process for migrants who came to the country illegally and have been here less than two years. 

It allows for their removal without appearing before a judge first. 

Before Trump's second term, expedited removal was only used for migrants who were stopped within 100 miles of the border and who had been in the U.S. for less than 14 days.

The change has triggered lawsuits by the American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant rights groups. In late August, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb temporarily blocked the administration's expansion, suggesting that it's trampling on people's due process rights.

In another case, Cobb agreed in early August to temporarily block the administration's efforts to expand fast-track deportations of immigrants who legally entered the U.S. under humanitarian parole. 

Cobb said the case's “underlying question” is whether people who escaped oppression will have the chance to “plead their case within a system of rules.”

A mass Russian drone and missile attack on Ukraine's capital Sunday has killed at least two people and left smoke rising from the roof of a key government building.

Ukraine's Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, released a video message of her speaking from inside a government building in Kyiv which had been damaged by Russian strikes.

A residential building in Kyiv was hit and damaged overnight into Sunday after Russia bombarded Ukraine's capital with drone and missiles in the largest aerial attack on the country since the war began.

Russia has launched its largest aerial attack on Ukraine since the war began, targeting Kyiv with drones and missiles. On Sunday, officials confirmed at least two people were killed, including a mother and her 3-month-old child. Ukraine's Air Force reported that 810 drones and decoys were used, with 747 drones and 4 missiles neutralized.

Two adults and two children were injured after a Russian drone hit a residential building on Sunday, Sumy authorities said. Russia attacked Ukraine with 810 drones and decoys, according to Ukraine's Air Force.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia hit Ukraine's capital with drone and missiles Sunday in the largest aerial attack since the war began, killing four people across the country and damaging a key government building.

Russia attacked with 810 drones and decoys, Ukraine's air force said, adding it shot down 747 drones and four missiles. 

Associated Press reporters saw a plume of smoke rising from the roof of Kyiv's government headquarters. It was not immediately clear if the smoke was the result of a direct hit or debris, which would mark an escalation in Russia's air campaign, which has so far spared government buildings in the city center.

The building is the home of Ukraine's Cabinet and its ministers. Police blocked access to the building as fire trucks and ambulances arrived. 

Yuriy Ihnat, an air force spokesperson, confirmed to The Associated Press that Sunday's attack was the largest Russian drone strike since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia also launched 13 missiles. Hits from nine missiles and 54 drones were recorded at 33 locations across Ukraine. 

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that four people were killed and 44 wounded. He said he spoke on the phone with French President Emmanuel Macron about the attack. 

“Together with France, we are preparing new measures to strengthen our defense,” Zelenskyy said.

Marcon earlier on Sunday accused Russia of “striking indiscriminately” and said Moscow “is locking itself ever deeper into the logic of war and terror.” 

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also condemned the attack. “These cowardly strikes show that Putin believes he can act with impunity. He is not serious about peace. Now, more than ever, we must stand firm in our support for Ukraine and its sovereignty,” Starmer said in a statement.

In the Ukrainian capital, the attack killed two people and wounded 20 others, according to city officials. 

Those killed were a mother and her 3-month-old child, whose bodies were dug out of the rubble, said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv's city administration. At least 10 locations in Kyiv were damaged, he added. Direct drone hits struck a nine-story residential building in Kyiv's Sviatoshynskyi district and a four-story residential building in Darnytskyi district. 

“I just have no more words left to express what I feel towards Russia,” said Olha, a 77-year-old Kyiv resident whose apartment was damaged. She didn't give her last name. “Although I'm an ethnic Russian myself, from outside Moscow. And I've never thought my people would be capable of this.”

Zelenskyy called for sanctions on Russia and for strengthening Ukraine's air defenses.

“Such killings now, when real diplomacy could have started long ago, are a deliberate crime and a prolongation of the war,” he said. “The world can force the Kremlin criminals to stop killing; only political will is needed.” 

Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko posted a video of herself inside the damaged government building, where she said a fire covering 800 square meters (8,600 square feet) was put out. 

“For the first time since the start of full-scale invasion, Russians struck our government headquarters in the center of Kyiv,” she said. 

“It looks like Russia is not seeking peace and is not ready for negotiations. We call our partners to help close our sky. Let's strengthen sanctions against Russia. Let's create the security guarantees system that will help stop the enemy,” she said. 

The Russian Defense Ministry said Sunday that it used “high-precision weapons” and drones to strike drone assembly and storage sites, military air bases in central, southern and eastern Ukraine, an industrial facility and a logistics facility on the outskirts of Kyiv. 

The ministry said that “all designated objects were hit” and claimed that “no strikes were carried out on other objects within the borders of Kyiv,” in what could be a reference to the damaged government building. 

Sunday's attack is the second mass Russian drone and missile attack to target Kyiv in the span of two weeks, as hopes for peace talks wane. 

It comes after European leaders pressed Russian leader Vladimir Putin to work to end the war after 26 of Ukraine's allies pledged to deploy troops as a “reassurance force” for the war-torn country once the fighting ends. 

Zelenskyy has said he is ready to meet Putin to negotiate a peace agreement, and has urged U.S. President Donald Trump to put punishing sanctions on Russia to push it to end the war. 

Moscow has repeatedly objected to any Western troop deployments to Ukraine and pushed back against a Putin-Zelenskyy summit, saying lower-level talks must take place first. 

Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted a total of 100 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions, the annexed Crimean peninsula and the Azov Sea between 8 p.m. Saturday and 6:30 a.m. Sunday.

Most were downed over the Belgorod, Voronezh and Krasnodar regions near the border with Ukraine, according to the statement.

In the Krasnodar region, falling drone debris sparked a brief fire at an oil refinery, local authorities said. In the Belgorod and the Voronezh regions, two people were injured, officials said. 

The Russian Defense Ministry also said Sunday that its troops seized the village of Khoroshe in the Dnipropetrovsk region. There was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine.

An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that drone debris struck a four-story building in Sviatoshynskyi District. It was a nine-story building.

'Outnumbered' reacts to some parents sending their children to college with Narcan.

A trend is sweeping college campuses nationwide as students head back to school while looking to make some extra cash. 

Creating and selling content on OnlyFans – a website that allows adults to produce and post their own sexually explicit content in exchange for money from subscribers – has become a popular way for college students to earn extra income while in school. 

""More and more people aren't getting married,"" Rock Jacobs, director of a documentary series about the online platform infiltrating college campuses called ""Lonely Fans,"" told Fox News Digital. ""More and more people aren't having kids, and more and more people want to cut the line. And since the pandemic, there was this explosion of OnlyFans. The amount of money they're making is more than Google, more than Intel, more than the NBA.""

The platform has seen a sharp increase in traffic since the pandemic, with creators flocking to OnlyFans as a way to exchange virtual sex for money. 

In 2019, the site featured approximately 350,000 creators from around the world on its platform, according to data from Statista. However, the number of creators has since skyrocketed to over 4.1 million in 2023 – signaling a staggering rise in users pushing content on the site. 

""It's a payroll system,"" Jacobs told Fox News Digital. ""And what [creators] have been able to do is use sex to prey on lonely people, and because of technology anybody can have a payroll.""

The trend has infiltrated even the highest-ranking universities across the country as rising tuition costs plague students seeking out college degrees. 

In 2025, the average cost of college in the United States is roughly $38,270 a year, according to the Education Data Initiative. The cost has reportedly more than doubled in the 21st century, with student loan interest rates forcing students to pay as much as $500,000 for a bachelor's degree. 

""There's some people that really need money,"" Jacobs said. ""And this is such an easy way to do it. It comes quick, and you know [that] you will make money.""

However, the use of the platform does not come without risks. Students who choose to put their image online face the possibility of hurting their job prospects or risk their reputation among their community.

Jacobs points to a notable shift in campus culture since he began filming his documentary series in 2023, with students initially remaining secretive about their online sexual endeavors. 

""I think it's become normalized,"" Jacobs told Fox News Digital. ""I've been working on [the film] since 2023, and at the beginning, I didn't think it was something that people were trying to hide. Now it's something that people are proud about.""

In what could signify a startling cultural shift in career aspirations, Jacobs recounted overhearing a group of girls under 18 expressing interest in joining OnlyFans while filming a protest outside a California high school.

""There were girls coming out of the high school that said, ‘Oh, what's wrong with OnlyFans? We're going to do that as soon as we turn 18,'"" Jacobs said. ""It has turned itself into being something that people want to do right out of school instead of picking a real career.""

While the consequences of launching an OnlyFans account while in college could remain strictly social, Jacobs warns creators could also face life-threatening repercussions stemming from posting explicit content online.

Instances of creators facing threats and stalkers have plagued the online community, with Jacobs recalling an alarming incident that he uncovered while filming his documentary. 

""There's one guy that literally drove five hours to a girl's house,"" Jacobs said. ""[He] broke into her house and was living in her attic."" 

""The stalkers can be digital, but it can actually turn physical and real – and in some cases, it can get violent."" 

Jacobs also pointed to another woman's testimonial featured in the documentary. 

""She's done really well [and] she's made over a couple million dollars,"" Jacobs said. ""She's been able to change her entire life and set herself up. But she admitted that every night when she goes to sleep, she feels like someone's going to break into her house and murder her. She said she's come to terms that she's not going to have a peaceful death.""

The psychological impact of students posting to OnlyFans is also alarming experts, with New York City-based psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert warning about the concerning trend. 

""Psychologically, it offers instant gratification, attention, validation and income all at once,"" Alpert told Fox News Digital. ""Those same rewards can create dependency and affect self-worth. Students risk tying their identity and confidence to clicks and subscribers. What is framed as independence often masks a deeper vulnerability.""

Jacobs echoes the same concerns, while warning parents that the rise of college students turning to OnlyFans to achieve online fame and fortune is threatening the future of family values. 

""If we keep moving and normalizing this type of behavior, then family values are going to be diminished,"" Jacobs said. ""And how are you going to have those deep roots when you send your child off into the world so that they are able to control themselves and restrain themselves from certain things?""

Retired Border Patrol chief Chris Clem joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to weigh in on a Chicago ICE protest and an illegal immigrant being charged with murdering a woman while being out on bail.

The South Korean government has reached a deal with the U.S. to secure the release of hundreds of migrant workers detained at a Hyundai automobile factory in Georgia.

Homeland Security Investigations said 475 people who were in the country illegally, primarily from South Korea, were arrested as part of the operation at the under-construction battery plant. Hyundai owns the plant, but claimed none of the workers were directly employed by the company.

President Lee Jae Myung's office says the country will send a charter plane to bring the workers back to South Korea in the coming days.

South Korea's Foreign Ministry issued a statement last week to express ""concern and regret"" over the raid.

HSI Georgia chief Steven Schrank said some of the detained workers had illegally crossed the U.S. border, while others had entered the country legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working.

HSI said some of the workers arrested were employed by subcontractors on the construction site, which has since been paused. Fox News Digital reported that ICE and other law enforcement agencies were part of the operation.

""We prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone working at the site and comply with all laws and regulations wherever we operate.""

Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume explains why President Donald Trump should not remove himself from the peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine and more on 'Special Report.'

When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, many experts predicted Kyiv's quick fall. When Ukraine pushed back overextended Russian forces, the same experts confidently said that Russia's mass — a population almost four times larger than Ukraine — would certainly grind Ukraine down. Triumph for Putin was inevitable. But, an odd thing happened on the way to Russia's victory parade: Ukraine is outfighting Russia.

Why is that? A big factor comes out of the grinding trenches of Ukraine, where a Russian war blogger known as ""Atomic Cherry"" recently laid bare a stark truth about Moscow's persistent military woes. As translated and analyzed by an OSINT enthusiast, the blogger laments how Ukraine's forces have outmaneuvered Russia's rigid, Soviet-style bureaucracy in the drone war.

Ukrainian commanders, he notes, have spun up alternative structures to pull resources from the traditional military to innovate rapidly. Meanwhile, Russia's monolithic Air Force and Navy fumble with technologies that should be in their wheelhouse, like unmanned aerial vehicles and naval drones. The result? Ukraine's loose system fosters flexibility, while Russia's top-down control stifles it.

AFTER UKRAINE'S SURPRISE DRONE ASSAULT ON RUSSIA, NEW ATTENTION DRAWN TO SENSITIVE SITES STATESIDE

The blogger doesn't name it, but he's describing the essence of Col. John Boyd's OODA Loop theory — Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. This cycle, in which speed in processing information and adapting trumps sheer firepower, has been America's edge in warfare for decades.

I know this firsthand. In 1987, as a 24-year-old Reagan appointee in the Pentagon, I received the full Boyd briefing, alongside two or three other men in a brownstone two blocks east of Union Station in Washington, D.C. Boyd, the maverick fighter pilot turned strategist, hammered home how out-cycling the enemy — getting inside their decision loop — wins battles. His ideas reshaped U.S. military doctrine, from the Gulf War to today.

In Ukraine, this plays out vividly. Russian forces can observe emerging threats, but they then orient slowly, bogged down by layers of approval. Ukrainians, however, decide and act swiftly, often outsourcing innovations to special ops or civilian-military hybrids. This adaptability has turned the tide in key domains — from the sea to the air. Ukrainian drone boats have humbled Russia's Black Sea Fleet while long-range drones execute devastating deep strikes on Russian refineries and warehouses.

The implications for modern warfare are profound, especially as drones and AI supercharge the battlefield. These technologies compress the OODA Loop to seconds, demanding not just superior hardware, but cultures that empower independent command.

Here, Malcolm Gladwell's insights in ""Outliers"" and ""The Tipping Point"" are instructive. Gladwell explores how cultural legacies shape behavior — high-power-distance societies like Russia or China prioritize hierarchy, discouraging junior officers from improvising. In contrast, low-power-distance Western cultures, rooted in individualism, encourage initiative. America's all-volunteer force thrives on this, training NCOs and officers to seize opportunities without waiting for orders from afar.

Yet even the West isn't immune to pitfalls. The communications revolution — satellites, real-time video feeds — has enabled the White House to micromanage commanders, slowing our loop. We saw this in Afghanistan and Iraq, where political second-guessing eroded battlefield agility. President Donald Trump is remedying this by slashing the bloated National Security Council staff, devolving power back to the field. It's a smart move, restoring the decentralized ethos Boyd championed. Lawyers — both military and civilian — are a problem as well. Victory doesn't emerge from a legal brief and the pace of deliberative law is ill-suited to the battlefield.

Now, pivot to the big threat: China. Beijing's People's Liberation Army mirrors Russia's rigidity, with Communist Party oversight ensuring loyalty over innovation. But don't underestimate them. China leads in drone swarms and AI-driven warfare, pouring billions into hypersonics and unmanned systems. In a Taiwan scenario, their massed forces could overwhelm regional defenses. The U.S. must double down on OODA superiority. We must invest in AI that augments human decision-making, not replaces it; increase the pace of exercises emphasizing rapid adaptation and culturally reinforce independent thinking in our ranks.

Drones and AI aren't just tools — they're force multipliers for the side that cycles fastest. Ukraine's success against a larger foe proves it. Against China, we'll need more than cash, ammunition and spare parts — we'll need Boyd's spirit. We must cut the red tape that hampers innovation.

The OODA Loop remains America and the West's secret weapon. As Boyd warned, victory goes to the agile, not the arrogant. In an era of hypersonic threats and autonomous swarms, let's ensure we're the ones inside the enemy's loop — before they get inside ours.

Sophia Parker, a wildlife rehabilitator and Army National Guard sergeant, is competing in the Miss America pageant. The glitzy competition is taking place in Orlando, Florida.

Miss America hopeful Sophia Parker wants everyone to have ""a seat at the table"" – regardless of their political affiliation.

Miss Vermont, a 27-year-old Army National Guard sergeant, will compete in the Miss America pageant on Sunday. She said her mission is to remind Americans that service and unity matter more than division.

""Unfortunately, we are living at a time of great division, and I've seen this grow even just in my lifetime,"" Parker, a combat medic and nurse at the University of Vermont Medical Center, told Fox News Digital.

""Between the left and the right… there is a ton of division,"" she shared. ""However, one thing that I think is very important is for people of all different opinions from both sides and everyone in the middle to be able to come together and have the baseline be that we need to speak to each other with respect. We need to hear each other out.""

""I believe that the role of Miss America and Miss Vermont is to be that person who hears everyone's perspective,"" said Parker. 

""As Miss America, my goal would be to travel the country, listening to people's stories, sharing my passion for wildlife rehabilitation, and encouraging young people to discover the joy of serving,"" said Sophia Parker. (Miss America IP INC.)

""I, as Sophia, of course, have my own personal opinions about things. But as Miss Vermont, I'm not here to have strong political opinions. I'm here to listen to everyone, and to try to create a middle ground where everyone can feel heard and seen. I think that is the starting point to find solutions. Our Founding Fathers created this country to be a place where you can have different opinions… where everyone can come together and find a place at the table, find a seat at the table.""

""As Miss America, as Miss Vermont, that is what I see as my job,"" Parker added.

Parker said it was a teacher at her high school in Vermont who encouraged her to pursue pageants. It would be an outlet for her to connect with other everyday Americans.

Sophia Parker said she plans to work with legislators and other nonprofits to create more humane laws for wildlife in Vermont. (Miss America IP INC.)

""She recognized that if I was going to college, I would actually need some financial help and scholarships in order to do so,"" said Parker. ""… I had never thought about competing in a pageant before. I was… a tomboy.""

""I raised wild animals that needed help and ran around in the woods with my friends,"" she chuckled. ""But I ended up absolutely falling in love with the organization… It's been such a privilege and such an honor to be able to speak about this organization that I love so much.""

Miss America, a glitzy competition, was born from a 1921 Atlantic City beauty contest just a year after women were given the right to vote, The Associated Press reported. Many participants say the organization – a large provider of scholarship assistance to young women – has been life-altering, opening doors for them both personally and professionally.

Meeting other competitors from across the country and hearing their stories has given Parker a deeper appreciation for our country.

""I am extremely grateful to be an American every single day,"" she said. ""I wake up every single day with freedoms and privileges that people in any other country in the world do not have. One of the things that I am extremely grateful for is that I, as a woman, am able to be everything that I want to be. This is part of why I love being in the Vermont Army National Guard, why I love the Miss America Organization – I can stand here as someone who doesn't really fit into a lot of boxes… I can wear a lot of different hats.""

Sophia Parker said her service has given her a deeper appreciation for America and its people. (Miss America IP INC.)

""… We as women and as people can be passionate about any number of things,"" said Parker. ""I believe that as an American, you can be anything that you want to be. And I stand here as Miss Vermont, as a nurse, as a soldier, as a pageant girl, and I am so grateful for those [roles].""

Sophia Parker is the 80th Miss Vermont. (Miss America IP INC.)

The eagerness to serve runs in Parker's veins. Her grandfather served in World War II and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. He was awarded a Purple Heart. Growing up, Parker often listened to her grandfather's stories from his time in the Army – ""the good, the bad and everything that he lived through and saw.""

""One of the things that always stuck with me [was] how he was a part of something bigger than himself,"" she explained. 

Sophia Parker is the youngest licensed rehabilitator in her home state. (Miss America IP INC.)

""He had such a strong sense of comradery with the fellow soldiers that he served with. There's nothing like it in the world, and I wanted to be part of something bigger than myself… I immediately knew that I wanted to be a medic if I was going to join. I talked to the recruiter in my town about what was involved. I took the ASVAB and ended up enlisting as a medic in the Vermont Army National Guard.""

Between the Miss America Organization and the Army National Guard, Parker was able to graduate debt-free from Castleton University last May with a nursing degree.

One of the key causes Parker wants to highlight this weekend is wildlife rehabilitation. The Green Mountain State native and her mother co-founded Otter Creek Wildlife Rescue, a nonprofit dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating injured and orphaned birds and mammals across Vermont. 

""Service is such a blessing both to those who receive it and those who give it,"" said Sophia Parker. (Miss America IP INC.)

Parker said she has vivid memories as a child bringing home wildlife, caring for them and releasing them back to their natural habitat when they were healthy. She's currently involved with several local organizations that aim to create better wildlife policies.

""Currently, the state of Vermont allows things like leghold trapping and hunting with hounds,"" she said. ""We're working to make these things illegal or at least much more regulated.""

""We would never strive to ban hunting,"" she clarified. ""Hunting is an age-old tradition in Vermont. It's very possible to be an extremely ethical hunter. I know many ethical hunters who go out and kill a deer and use it to feed their whole family. It's one of the most ethical ways you can get your meat. But Vermont, unfortunately, has a lot of archaic politics that allow a lot of abuse of wildlife. And so, I'm actively working with our legislature to change these policies.""

Sophia Parker hopes her journey will inspire others to get involved in their communities. (Miss America IP INC.)

""… I think it's very important to not only view the natural world from the perspective of a consumer, but as someone who shares this world with other animals.""

Today, Parker hopes her journey will encourage others to support a cause they're passionate about.

""A life of service has changed my life,"" she said. ""It's made me who I am today. It gives you a purpose in life. It gives you inspiration, and it's grounding in a world where, frankly, the problems [are] overwhelming… You don't have to have money. You don't have to have some crazy talent. You just need to get involved in your community and make a difference.""

Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., discusses the possibility of President Donald Trump renaming the Defense Department to the Department of War and responds to criticism of the strike on a Tren de Aragua 'drug-carrying' boat.

As U.S. forces carry out strikes abroad and policymakers prepare to release a new national defense strategy, the Trump administration has chosen to revive a name not heard in Washington since 1947: the Department of War. 

Friday's executive order has opened a debate over whether words shape policy, or whether the symbolism matters less than the capabilities behind them.

Supporters argue the shift restores honesty to the Pentagon's identity, acknowledging that America's armed forces have long been engaged in conflicts that stretch beyond ""defense."" Critics counter that the change risks glorifying war, unsettling allies and giving adversaries new propaganda lines at a sensitive moment in global security.

Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who proudly assumed the new title, described the move as a cultural reset. ""Words matter. Titles matter, cultures matter,"" Hegseth told Fox News Digital. ""George Washington founded the War Department.""

Jennifer Kavanaugh, a senior fellow at Defense Priorities, said recent strikes have emboldened Trump to lean more heavily on military power. She pointed to U.S. attacks on Iranian targets earlier this summer and, more recently, a strike on a Venezuelan drug-smuggling boat, which she said the administration clearly views as both policy successes and strong political points. 

""These two strikes, as well as other small things, are maybe pushing Trump to be more aggressive than he was on the campaign trail, or even than he planned to be coming in,"" Kavanaugh said.

Others were more skeptical of the name's practical impact. Frank Rose, a former Defense Department and Nuclear Security Administration official, said the change does little to address real challenges. ""I have no problem with the [new] name,"" he said. ""The real question is this: Will this name change allow us to get capability faster to the warfighter and stay ahead of Russia and China? I'm skeptical. Names don't deter. Capabilities deter.""

Some observers worry the debate over symbolism is overshadowing substantive developments. ""This story is overshadowing more important news,"" said John Byrnes, strategic director for Concerned Veterans for America. ""The overdue National Defense Strategy seems about to be published, and sources are reporting that it outlines a pivot toward focusing more resources on defense here in North America.""

The Pentagon's strategy document, released once per administration, is expected soon. A recent report in Politico suggested it will center on homeland defense and the Western Hemisphere, underscoring a shift in priorities as the U.S. faces threats closer to home.

The executive order allows the Pentagon to continue using ""Department of Defense"" as a secondary name, a concession that may ease the daunting task of changing countless seals, emblems and bureaucratic references.

TRUMP TO RENAME PENTAGON, RESTORING HISTORIC ‘DEPARTMENT OF WAR' IN LATEST MILITARY MOVE

For most of the nation's history, the U.S. military was overseen by the Department of War. Created in 1789 as one of the first executive departments, it managed the Army, fortifications and the nation's defenses. The Navy, established separately in 1798, was not folded into the War Department.

By the mid-20th century, policymakers were rethinking the military's role. The devastation of World War II and the onset of the Cold War spurred the 1947 National Security Act, which merged the War and Navy Departments into the National Military Establishment. 

In 1949, that structure was renamed the Department of Defense. The new title was meant to signal a mission of deterrence and stability rather than aggressive war-making, aligning with America's Cold War role as a global protector.

For more than 75 years, the Department of Defense has symbolized that mission. Restoring the ""War"" name represents a striking departure from that framework.

Modern governments have largely abandoned the blunt language of ""war"" in naming their defense bureaucracies. The United Kingdom once had separate War and Air ministries, which were merged after World War II into today's Ministry of Defence. In Germany, pre-1945 governments relied on a War Ministry, but postwar leaders created a Federal Ministry of Defense to emphasize collective security within NATO. Russia maintains a Ministry of Defense, headquartered in Moscow, even as it wages wars abroad. 

The trend reflects a 20th-century shift toward language that frames militaries as protectors rather than aggressors. America's decision to move in the opposite direction stands out globally.

Kavanaugh noted that the rhetorical turn may resonate differently with U.S. audiences. For some, she said, it will emphasize the military's lethality — a theme Trump and Hegseth have repeatedly embraced. 

For others, it will serve as a reminder that the United States spends far more time intervening abroad than defending its own borders. 

""Department of War is sort of a much more accurate description of what the military does,"" she said. ""The homeland itself is actually very secure: we have oceans on two sides, weak neighbors to the north and south… so I do think it calls attention to what is the fundamental role of the military here, which is fighting wars abroad, which hasn't always advanced U.S. interests.""

It remains unclear whether Trump can make the change permanent without congressional approval. His order directs Hegseth to propose both legislative and executive measures to enshrine the name. Democrats have already voiced opposition.

""Totally something my 8-year-old would come up with,"" Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., wrote on X. ""Americans want to prevent wars, not tout them.""

""Only someone who avoided the draft would want to rename the Department of Defense to the Department of War,"" added Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz.

Fox News senior correspondent Mike Tobin reports on Democrats' reaction to President Donald Trump's social media post about I.C.E. in Chicago on ‘Fox Report.'

Democrats are criticizing President Donald Trump for a social media post that appeared to threaten Chicago with deportations and the U.S. military.

Trump posted on Truth Social an AI image of himself styled as Robert Duvall's character in ""Apocalypse Now,"" a Vietnam War epic about a decorated U.S. officer who has gone rogue deep in the Cambodian jungle. The words ""Chipocalypse Now"" were also seen on the image.

""'I love the smell of deportations in the morning…'"" Trump wrote in the post on Saturday morning, a play on a famous quote from the 1979 film.

""Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR,"" he added, referring to his recent executive order renaming the Department of Defense to the Department of War.

Several Democrats blasted the president for his threats of ""war"" against U.S. cities, which comes as the federal government is potentially considering deploying the National Guard to Chicago to deal with crime – a move Illinois leaders have repeatedly criticized.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom responded to the post by saying Trump was ""using our troops like political pawns.""

""The President of the United States is deploying the military onto US streets and using our troops like political pawns,"" Newsom wrote on X. ""DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO BECOME NUMB TO THIS.""

Newsom butted heads with Trump over the summer after National Guard troops and Marines were deployed to Los Angeles to respond to anti-ICE demonstrations and support federal immigration enforcement.

Both Illinois senators pushed back on the president's ""disgusting"" post suggesting he would wage war on the Windy City.

""No Donald, Chicago is not your war zone,"" Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth wrote on X.

Duckworth is also a combat veteran and retired Army National Guard lieutenant colonel.

CHICAGO RESIDENT GOES AFTER CITY'S ‘PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATIC GANG' FOR REFUSING TRUMP'S FEDERAL HELP ON CRIME

Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin wrote on X that Trump should be focused on his ""weak jobs reports,"" ""record measles cases,"" ""tariffs hurting American farmers and businesses"" and ""hidden Epstein files,"" instead of ""asking ChatGPT to make him memes and threatening to turn our brave armed forces against American cities.""

""This tweet this morning was disgusting to suggest that the troops are coming into Chicago or that the Department of War is going to be engaged is an embarrassment,"" Durban said during remarks before a parade in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood, according to FOX 32 Chicago.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have been feuding with Trump in recent weeks over the potential deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago.

""The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city,"" Pritzker wrote on X on Saturday. ""This is not a joke. This is not normal. Donald Trump isn't a strongman, he's a scared man. Illinois won't be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.""

Johnson has previously cited data showing that violent crime in Chicago has declined in the last year, including homicides and robberies dipping by more than 30%, and shootings dropping by nearly 40%.

""The President's threats are beneath the honor of our nation, but the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution,"" Johnson wrote on Saturday. ""We must defend our democracy from this authoritarianism by protecting each other and protecting Chicago from Donald Trump.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Police union, Republicans sound alarm on Kamala Harris's makeshift security detail","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3795552/police-union-republicans-alarm-kamala-harris-security-detail/","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Los Angeles police and the California Highway Patrol are providing taxpayer-funded security for former Vice President Kamala Harris — a move that has infuriated the police union and some Republican lawmakers. 

The use of state and local resources was likely requested by Harris and approved by Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D) and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) after President Donald Trump revoked her Secret Service detail earlier this week. 

The CHP is authorized to provide security for current and former California constitutional officers when a threat assessment deems it necessary. Harris, a former state constitutional officer, is receiving protection coordinated by the agency in response to current concerns, sources told the Washington Examiner. 

Bass called Trump's actions “another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation in the forms of firings, the revoking of security clearances and more.”

“This puts the former Vice President in danger and I look forward to working with the Governor to make sure Vice President Harris is safe in Los Angeles,” she said. 

A DECADE OF MAGA: HOW TRUMP'S GOLDEN ESCALATOR RIDE CHANGED AMERICA

About a dozen LAPD officers have started working a detail to protect Harris, parking outside her Brentwood home. It's unclear if they will be with her when she starts on her nationwide book tour, which begins at the end of the month in New York City. 

The CHP and the LAPD have been tight-lipped on how long the around-the-clock security service will last and how much it will cost. 

“We do not comment on security arrangements,” the CHP told the Washington Examiner, while the LAPD confirmed it was “assisting the California Highway Patrol in providing protective services for former Vice President Kamala Harris until an alternate plan is established. ”

“This temporary coordinated effort is in place to ensure that there is no lapse in security,” LAPD Communications Director Jennifer Forkish, told the Washington Examiner. 

Spending money to protect Harris isn't sitting well with some, including the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union that represents rank-and-file LAPD officers. 

“Pulling police officers from protecting everyday Angelenos to protect a failed presidential candidate who also happens to be a multi-millionaire, with multiple homes and who can easily afford to pay for her own security, is nuts,” the union said in a statement. It added that Bass “should tell Governor Newsom that if he wants to curry favor with Ms. Harris and her donor base, then he should open up his own wallet because LA taxpayers should not be footing the bill for this ridiculousness.”

Assemblyman Carl DeMaio (R-CA) also had an issue with it. 

BIDEN AUTOPEN USE IN DC WAS MORE WIDESPREAD THAN PREVIOUSLY KNOWN

“It will reduce public safety plain and simple,” he told the Washington Examiner. “It's not even an argument. It's not even debatable. How dare Karen Bass and Gavin Newsom shortchange Californians' and Los Angelenos' safety so that they can give a politician protection? Nobody cares about Kamala Harris. Nobody is threatening her. She isn't being given any less security than any other vice president. Vice presidents lose their security after six months. That has been perfectly fine for the past 40 years but no, apparently Californians are going to be on the hook to cater to her as servants.” 

Steve Hilton, who is running as a Republican candidate for governor, called Harris's new security “completely outrageous and a corrupt abuse of public resources.” 

“It's just having insult added to injury when we've got the absolute underfunding of police departments across the state, we are way below capacity, in terms of the number of police and sheriff's deputies we need to fight crime,” he told the Washington Examiner. 

The Secret Service usually protects a former vice president for six months after they leave office, but former President Joe Biden had signed an order extending Harris's protection for a year beyond that. Harris's aides had asked Biden's team to extend protection due to safety concerns. Without the extension, Harris's protection would have ended in July. 

A White House memorandum, signed by Trump, directed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law,” for Harris.

Trump also pulled protection from Mike Pompeo, one of his former secretaries of state; former aide Brian Hook; John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser; and Anthony Fauci, who received death threats when he oversaw the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Not everyone is upset that Harris is getting star treatment on the public's tab.

JUDGE RULES TRUMP DEPLOYMENT OF NATIONAL GUARD TO LOS ANGELES VIOLATED FEDERAL LAW

Kaivan Shroff, a Democratic commentator and alumnus of the Hillary for America digital team, told the Washington Examiner that securing Harris's safety is paramount.

“Yes, protecting our first black woman vice president, despite Trump's antics, is a good use of funds,” he said. “Kamala Harris — like many Democrats — has a target on her back because of the rhetoric Trump, Vance and other MAGA electeds use. The reality is that less than 3 months ago, a deranged Trump supporter murdered Melissa Hortman and her husband and shot their dog.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former Vice President Kamala Harris will no longer receive protection from the Los Angeles Police Department after backlash from officers who were reportedly pulled from crime prevention efforts for the security detail.

Officers within the LAPD's Metropolitan Division had been assisting California Highway Patrol in protecting Harris after President Donald Trump revoked her Secret Service protection late last week. The detail consisted of about a dozen officers and was funded by the city, where Harris has a home in the Brentwood neighborhood.

As of Saturday, that detail has since been disbanded, sources told the Los Angeles Times.

The move is relatively unsurprising, as the additional LAPD protection for Harris was previously described by an official as a “temporary coordinated effort” with CHP “until an alternate plan is established.”

But it does follow frustration from LAPD officers, with the biggest police union in Los Angeles slamming the earlier formation of the detail, which was organized by Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, as “nuts.”

NEWSOM COMPARES CALIFORNIA'S HOMICIDE RATE TO RED STATES. DOES HE HAVE A POINT?

“Mayor Karen Bass should tell Governor Newsom that if he wants to curry favor with Ms. Harris and her donor base, then he should open up his own wallet because LA taxpayers should not be footing the bill for this ridiculousness,” a statement from the Los Angeles Police Protective League said.

The union added that Harris can “easily afford to pay for her own security,” which may be needed as she is set for 15-city book tour starting on Sept. 24 and lasting until Nov. 20. The book, 107 Days, is slated to release on Sept. 23.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), an outspoken opponent against what she describes as rich elites, stayed at several swanky hotels while rallying across the country with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, a Washington Examiner review of the congresswoman's campaign spending receipts has found.

According to Federal Election Commission filings, her high-end hotel stays, which coincided with stretches of the Democratic Socialist duo's cross-country trek to rail against the ultrawealthy, cost thousands of dollars in campaign funds.

Ocasio-Cortez's spending spree at opulent locales appears to conflict with the congresswoman's rhetoric about class disparity, an anti-affluence message she repeatedly delivered during the tour.

In mid-March, Ocasio-Cortez's campaign splurged $3,508.92 on a stay at Vdara Hotel & Spa, a luxury property situated on the Las Vegas strip in Paradise, Nevada. Equipped with a five-star spa, the MGM resort boasts roomside views of the famous Bellagio fountain, executive-level corner suites, and bookable penthouses.

Days before the donor-funded disbursement date, as listed later in an expenditure report, Ocasio-Cortez appeared alongside Sanders at a stop in North Las Vegas, where they both bashed the luxurious lifestyles of billionaires and “oligarchs” purportedly taking over the country.

“We are witnessing an oligarchy in America,” claimed Ocasio-Cortez. “That is when those with the most economic, political, and technological power destroy the public good to enrich themselves while millions of Americans pay the price.”

Speaking on access to affordable housing and income inequality among working-class Americans, she said, “We don't have to live like this anymore, Las Vegas. We deserve better than this, Las Vegas.”

Ocasio-Cortez was photographed flying first-class to the Las Vegas town hall. According to a passenger who spotted her aboard the plane, the congressional representative had ignored a friendly greeting from the economy-cabin flier.

In April, Ocasio-Cortez's campaign spent another $3,445.59 on a sojourn at Asher Adams, Autograph Collection, an upscale mountain-area escape in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Retrofitted from a historical railroad station, the train-themed hotel houses a fine dining restaurant offering wine as pricey as $900 a bottle, lobster towers, and $95 caviar for appetizers. Reminiscent of the golden age of train travel, the hotel bar, which overlooks the Wasatch Mountains, is adorned with the original stained-glass windows and terrazzo floors of the Union Pacific Depot.

Ocasio-Cortez reported the travel expense shortly after a one-day Salt Lake City rally with Sanders. There, they preached about the plight of “everyday, working Americans like us” struggling to make ends meet.

BERNIE SANDERS & AOC ‘PREACHING TO THE CHOIR' WITH OLIGARCHY TOUR: SALENA ZITO

The following day, Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders joined forces again at a “Fight the Oligarchy” junket in Nampa, Idaho, approximately a half-hour drive from nearby Boise, to call for a federal “living” minimum wage and lament rising rent costs nationwide.

Around this time, Ocasio-Cortez's campaign disclosed spending $1,534.90 at the award-winning Hotel Renegade in downtown Boise. A newly built boutique getaway inhabiting over 5,100 square feet of event space, including a rooftop ballroom, Hotel Renegade has received AAA's distinguished four-diamond rating.

Sanders, the congresswoman's travel companion and fellow climate change activist against carbon fuels, previously faced criticism for spending more than $221,723 on private jet flights over the course of their anti-oligarchy campaign.

An unapologetic Sanders, pressed by Fox News host Bret Baier to defend his penchant for private planes, said that he has to fly non-commercial to appear at multiple rallies within a week's span. According to Sanders, the public depends on his timely arrival.

“Think I'm going to be sitting on a waiting line at United [Airlines] while 30,000 people are waiting?” Sanders said, referring to an expectant audience. “That's the only way you can get around. No apologies for that. That's what campaign travel is about. We have done it in the past, and we're going to do it in the future.”

BERNIE SANDERS: RIDE PRIVATE JETS? I DO IT FOR THE PEOPLE

After the initial outcry, Sanders continued jetting himself around the country. Between April and June, the senator's campaign committee paid Ventura Jets, a private airline charter on Long Island, an additional total of $229,173, according to campaign disclosure data reviewed by the Washington Examiner.

On another leg of the tour, Sanders spent $260 on a limousine service in Montana. At the time, Sanders told a crowd of supporters in Missoula that “the richest people in America are becoming much richer” as 800,000 homeless Americans “sleep out on the street.”

The senator's net worth, meanwhile, makes him a multi-millionaire. In 2019, Forbes magazine reported that Sanders, an owner of three homes, amassed a $2.5 million fortune from real estate, investments, government pensions, and book earnings.

On the fundraising front, Ocasio-Cortez has outraised her congressional counterparts by a wide margin, with a whopping $15.4 million accrued in contributions this election cycle, well ahead of the 2026 midterms.

AOC HAS THE MOST CAMPAIGN MONEY IN THE HOUSE WITH $15.4 MILLION WAR CHEST

Her record-breaking haul has left some observers speculating that Ocasio-Cortez may be eyeing higher office, whether that be a seat in the Senate or a White House run in 2028. Many left-wing media outlets have touted her as a top presidential contender.

Some may crave a little privacy, even your dog.

Charles Darwin once noted that natural selection tends to preserve traits that conceal an animal in nature. It can paint camouflage onto their bodies with astonishing quickness: The peppered moth's wings darkened only a few decades after England's Industrial Revolution blackened urban tree trunks. Decades later, when pollution let up, their wings lightened again. But evolution has not moved quickly enough to conceal animals from human-surveillance technologies, which are undergoing their own Cambrian explosion. Cameras and microphones are shrinking. They're spreading all over the globe. Even as we cause animals to dwindle in number, they are finding it harder and harder to hide.

Humans are closing in on a real-time god's-eye view of this planet. Some subsurface places remain unmonitored. The sun's light penetrates only a thousand yards down into the ocean. In the “midnight zone,” below that threshold, strange, glowing animals can still live a life of genuine mystery. But on the planet's surface, humanity's sensors are everywhere. Even animals in the Himalayas can be seen by the satellites that fly overhead, snapping color pictures. They can spot the hot breath of a single whale geysering out of its blowhole.

Deep in the wilderness, way off the hiking trails, scientists have laid out grids of camera traps. Automated environmental-DNA stations census animals in these places by gathering fragments of their genetic material straight from the air, or from veins in the watershed, be they trickles of snowmelt or full streams. The closer a landscape is to civilization, the more intrusively its animals are watched. Those that live in rural barns, feed lots, or aquaculture ponds are monitored by cameras. Along fence lines, their predators are too. Even herds that roam free on the open range are microchipped and trailed by drones.

Cities are the most potent nodes of this global animal panopticon. CCTV cameras stake out big public spaces, and Ring cameras peer out onto quieter streets. Smartphone-toting humans wander everywhere in between, taking geotagged photos of animals, including those in their home. They upload these images to social networks, hoping that they go viral.

Many animals appear to be entirely unbothered by all of this surveillance. Raccoons may show interest in a camera after it flashes, but then move on quickly. Birds have a mixed response: Black-tailed godwits seem to barely even register the nest cams that hover above their freshly hatched chicks. Other species are more likely to abandon a monitored nest. Some animals react even more strongly. The mighty tigers of the Nepalese jungle try to steer clear of camera traps, and at least one chimpanzee has executed a planned attack on a surveillance drone.

If animals do indeed have feelings about surveillance and privacy, those feelings won't map cleanly onto ours. I recently had occasion to reflect on this while letting my dog, Forrest, out to relieve himself at night. I tend to watch where he goes in the yard so that when he's done, I can call him right in and get back to bed. As a consequence, we sometimes make eye contact while he completes the act. It gives me an uneasy feeling, the green shine of his irises hitting mine just as his stream touches the grass. I wonder if my sleepy-eyed stare strikes him as intrusive.

I asked Alexandra Horowitz, who researches dog cognition at Barnard, if Forrest might be experiencing something akin to embarrassment during these moments. Horowitz, who has written multiple books about the mental lives of dogs, was reassuring on this point. (She would later have much more to say about the limited privacy that dogs are afforded.) She explained that dogs understand where people are looking, and that if mine wanted to hide his behavior, he would be unlikely to engage in eye contact. And anyway, in his olfactory social world, urination is a proud public act.

But all of this is speculation, Horowitz emphasized. We can't ask animals directly whether they have their own notions of privacy, so we have to settle for these behavioral clues and the musings of philosophers. Since at least the 1960s, they have been asking whether animals might have privacy interests, and now that surveillance technology is spreading rapidly, a new generation has revived this question. Angie Pepper, a philosopher at the University of Roehampton, in the United Kingdom, answers in the affirmative. She points to animal behaviors that strongly suggest that some animals have privacy interests, including some that we are currently violating. She argues that coming to see these animals in a morally decent way may entail not seeing them at all.

There are some obvious ways that surveillance can harm animals. Animal-location data may be used for conservation purposes, but it can also be accessed by “cyberpoachers” or even the authorities. In 2014, an Australian government agency noticed that a GPS-tagged great white shark was swimming close to a beach and issued a kill order, even though the agency had no record of it ever approaching a swimmer. The order was withdrawn a week later, but had scientists never tagged the shark's dorsal fin, it likely wouldn't have been targeted by this precrime unit.

Just because surveillance might cause an animal harm doesn't mean that its privacy has been invaded. But disturbing its tranquility might qualify, according to Martin Kaehrle, a Ph.D. student at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who has written about this subject. Many of our fellow creatures do seem to prefer feeling that some tiny corner of the universe is uniquely theirs, if only for a moment. When animals are packed together and deprived of that feeling, total social breakdown can occur. Pepper points out that pigs on factory farms commit acts of violence that would otherwise be rare in their communities. Some bite their neighbor's tail without warning. Hens in similar situations will peck out one another's eyes. In a famous experiment, a colony of mice was forced to live in tight conditions just so scientists could see what would happen. The colony quickly descended into indiscriminate violence, stopped mating, and died out.

Since at least the mid-2000s, birding groups have been passionately debating how best to preserve an animal's tranquility, Kaehrle told me. He has spent years screenshotting these discussions on social-media sites, wildlife forums, and listservs. People argue about how much space a birder should give to its target, and whether baiting them with food is appropriate. Several communities agreed to implement total bans on location sharing.

In decades past, a birder who spotted a rare bird might notify someone at their local Audubon Society, who might then mark it with a colored pushpin on a map, or add it to a weekly recorded hotline message. Today, sightings flow much more quickly through digital-birding platforms, Discords, WhatsApp groups, and X accounts. One such account in New York City has tens of thousands of followers. A few years ago, the account doxxed a snowy owl, and it quickly became encircled by admirers, plus at least one drone. Snowy owls live in the High Arctic for half the year. By the time one reaches as far as New York, it is tired and hungry. If these endangered birds have to take flight over and over in order to avoid the boldest members of a human crowd, they can weaken further and even fail to mate.

Not all philosophers are willing to count these disturbances of an animal's serene environment or personal space as an invasion of privacy. Some would argue that there are plenty of other reasons to think that harassing an animal is wrong. But a more straightforward case can be made in instances involving a more intimate kind of exposure. Humans are familiar with these scenarios, because we live in a complex social world, and we navigate it by presenting ourselves differently in different situations. You have a version of yourself who is the thinker of your innermost thoughts, the dancer before your bedroom mirror—but you likely present other versions in your interactions with your partner, kids, close family members, dear friends, doctors, and bosses. That's why people don't want their deepest secrets spilled onto the internet: Our ability to switch between selves would be seriously impaired. We would be forced into intimacy with everyone.

Many other animals also present different selves to different members of their communities. Kristin Andrews, a philosopher at York University, told me about gelada monkeys, which live in units consisting of one dominant male and about a dozen females. Gelada social norms dictate that the dominant male has sexual access to all of the females; a few follower males may be in the group but have no such access. When females mate with the dominant male, they do it out in the open and emit loud mating cries. It is a public act. But sometimes, for reasons that are her own, a female will transgress the community's norms: She will seek to mate with another male, but not in public. The two will likely go for it when the dominant male is away, and they will emit much quieter mating cries.

Animal self-switching can also be detected in their communications. Some of their utterances are just indiscriminate broadcasts, but certain species use quiet tones to target a limited set of listeners, or even an individual. When humans communicate in this way, we reflexively describe it as private. Yet this has not stopped researchers from placing bioacoustic sensors in all kinds of wild habitats—and not only microphones: Seismic arrays of the sort that originally listened for nuclear tests have recently been used to detect the infrasonic rumbling of elephants. Teams of researchers are trying to use AI to decipher these rumbles.

Eavesdropping on elephants may not be technically possible, in the end. Either way, people probably won't get too worked up about it, unless researchers use the information that they glean from an elephant wiretap to hurt the animals. But there is a class of animals whose privacy concerns are already acute: those that we keep in zoos or our homes. These animals are monitored by humans in ways that they likely would not choose. In zoos, many primates clearly prefer enclosures that give them the ability to retreat out of view. Not all of them get to make that choice. Neither do some of our most beloved pets.

“Dogs are given almost no privacy,” Horowitz told me. “I don't know if they yearn for it, but in a typical home, they are expected to always be available. We even decide where they sleep.” Dogs don't have a lot of opportunities for self-determination, Pepper told me when I asked her about pet privacy. “They always have to be accessible, not just in terms of sight but also touch.” Hearing this gave me a little jolt of shame. My Forrest is affectionate, but he is not a constant cuddler, like some of my previous dogs were. I probably force more hugs on him than I should.

We are not great respecters of boundaries, human beings. Dogs may not have known this about us when they first edged up to our campfires, more than 10,000 years ago. They could not have anticipated the degree to which we would dictate the most intimate parts of their lives, up to and including their sexual partners. Even after these dramatic interventions, which we have used to cultivate in dogs a preference for captivity, we still have to exercise a lot of coercion in order to get them to play along. We have to remove them from their mother while they are still young. We have to keep them behind locked doors and gates, and on leashes.

“It's not obvious to me that the natural end point for dogs is this thick relationship where we dictate all aspects of their life,” Pepper said. “There are free-living dogs that have much thinner relationships with humans. They might stop by to get something to eat or to find somewhere to sleep, but they aren't under this constant human control. Even the dogs that we have thoroughly socialized to live with us prefer varying levels of intimacy. Not all of them want to be with us all the time. They might seem like it when we come home at night, but in some cases, that's because they didn't have much company during the daytime.”

We can't say what dogs' preferences might be under different circumstances. But we do know that they have not chosen all of the intimacies that we impose upon them. They don't get to decide the amount of distance that exists between them and us. They are expected to come right away when called. Rarely are they allowed to refuse our physical attention. There are moments when they may prefer to be untouched or unseen. Even when we are out of town, many of us watch them on cameras. We do all of these things because we love them, but this love is one that we thoroughly control. To them, at times, it may feel like something else.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The entire U.S. economy is being propped up by the promise of productivity gains that seem very far from materializing.

If there is any field in which the rise of AI is already said to be rendering humans obsolete—in which the dawn of superintelligence is already upon us—it is coding. This makes the results of a recent study genuinely astonishing.

In the study, published in July, the think tank Model Evaluation & Threat Research randomly assigned a group of experienced software developers to perform coding tasks with or without AI tools. It was the most rigorous test to date of how AI would perform in the real world. Because coding is one of the skills that existing models have largely mastered, just about everyone involved expected AI to generate huge productivity gains. In a pre-experiment survey of experts, the mean prediction was that AI would speed developers' work by nearly 40 percent. Afterward, the study participants estimated that AI had made them 20 percent faster.

But when the METR team looked at the employees' actual work output, they found that the developers had completed tasks 20 percent slower when using AI than when working without it. The researchers were stunned. “No one expected that outcome,” Nate Rush, one of the authors of the study, told me. “We didn't even really consider a slowdown as a possibility.”

No individual experiment should be treated as the final word. But the METR study is, according to many AI experts, the best we have—and it helps make sense of an otherwise paradoxical moment for AI. On the one hand, the United States is undergoing an extraordinary, AI-fueled economic boom: The stock market is soaring thanks to the frothy valuations of AI-associated tech giants, and the real economy is being propelled by hundreds of billions of dollars of spending on data centers and other AI infrastructure. Undergirding all of the investment is the belief that AI will make workers dramatically more productive, which will in turn boost corporate profits to unimaginable levels.

On the other hand, evidence is piling up that AI is failing to deliver in the real world. The tech giants pouring the most money into AI are nowhere close to recouping their investments. Research suggests that the companies trying to incorporate AI have seen virtually no impact on their bottom line. And economists looking for evidence of AI-replaced job displacement have mostly come up empty.

None of that means that AI can't eventually be every bit as transformative as its biggest boosters claim it will be. But eventually could turn out to be a long time. This raises the possibility that we're currently experiencing an AI bubble, in which investor excitement has gotten too far ahead of the technology's near-term productivity benefits. If that bubble bursts, it could put the dot-com crash to shame—and the tech giants and their Silicon Valley backers won't be the only ones who suffer.

Almost everyone agrees that coding is the most impressive use case for current AI technology. Before its most recent study, METR was best known for a March analysis showing that the most advanced systems could handle coding tasks that take a typical human developer nearly an hour to finish. So how could AI have made the developers in its experiment less productive?

The answer has to do with the “capability-reliability gap.” Although AI systems have learned to perform an impressive set of tasks, they struggle to complete those tasks with the consistency and accuracy demanded in real-world settings. The results of the March METR study, for example, were based on a “50 percent success rate,” meaning the AI system could reliably complete the task only half the time—making it essentially useless on its own. This gap makes using AI in a work context challenging. Even the most advanced systems make small mistakes or slightly misunderstand directions, requiring a human to carefully review their work and make changes where needed.

This appears to be what happened during the newer study. Developers ended up spending a lot of time checking and redoing the code that AI systems had produced—often more time than it would have taken to simply write it themselves. One participant later described the process  as the “digital equivalent of shoulder-surfing an overconfident junior developer.”

Since the experiment was conducted, AI coding tools have gotten more reliable. And the study focused on expert developers, whereas the biggest productivity gains could come from enhancing—or replacing—the capabilities of less experienced workers. But the METR study might just as easily be overestimating AI-related productivity benefits. Many knowledge-work tasks are harder to automate than coding, which benefits from huge amounts of training data and clear definitions of success. “Programming is something that AI systems tend to do extremely well,” Tim Fist, the director of Emerging Technology Policy at the Institute for Progress, told me. “So if it turns out they aren't even making developers more productive, that could really change the picture of how AI might impact economic growth in general.”

The capability-reliability gap might explain why generative AI has so far failed to deliver tangible results for businesses that use it. When researchers at MIT recently tracked the results of 300 publicly disclosed AI initiatives, they found that 95 percent of projects failed to deliver any boost to profits. A March report from McKinsey & Company found that 71 percent of  companies reported using generative AI, and more than 80 percent of them reported that the technology had no “tangible impact” on earnings. In light of these trends, Gartner, a tech-consulting firm, recently declared that AI has entered the “trough of disillusionment” phase of technological development.

Perhaps AI advancement is experiencing only a temporary blip. According to Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at Stanford University, every new technology experiences a “productivity J-curve”: At first, businesses struggle to deploy it, causing productivity to fall. Eventually, however, they learn to integrate it, and productivity soars. The canonical example is electricity, which became available in the 1880s but didn't begin to generate big productivity gains for firms until Henry Ford reimagined factory production in the 1910s. Some experts believe that this process will play out much faster for AI. “With AI, we're in the early, negative part of the J-curve,” Brynjolfsson told me. “But by the second half of the 2020s, it's really going to take off.” Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has predicted that by 2027, or “not much longer than that,” AI will be “better than humans at almost everything.”

These forecasts assume that AI will continue to improve as fast as it has over the past few years. This is not a given. Newer models have been marred by delays and cancellations, and those released this year have generally shown fewer big improvements than past models despite being far more expensive to develop. In a March survey, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence asked 475 AI researchers whether current approaches to AI development could produce a system that matches or surpasses human intelligence; more than three-fourths said that it was “unlikely” or “very unlikely.”

OpenAI's latest model, GPT-5, was released early last month after nearly three years of work and billions in spending. (The Atlantic entered into a corporate partnership with OpenAI in 2024.) Before the launch, CEO Sam Altman declared that using it would be the equivalent of having “a legitimate Ph.D.-level expert in anything” at your fingertips. In a few areas, including coding, GPT-5 was indeed a major step up. But by most rigorous measures of AI performance, GPT-5 turned out to be, at best, a modest improvement over previous models.

The dominant view within the industry is that it is only a matter of time before companies find the next way to supercharge AI progress. That could turn out to be true, but it is far from guaranteed.

Generative AI would not be the first tech fad to experience a wave of excessive hype. What makes the current situation distinctive is that AI appears to be propping up something like the entire U.S. economy. More than half of the growth of the S&P 500 since 2023 has come from just seven companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. These firms, collectively known as the Magnificent Seven, are seen as especially well positioned to prosper from the AI revolution.

That prosperity has largely yet to materialize anywhere other than their share prices. (The exception is Nvidia, which provides the crucial inputs—advanced chips—that the rest of the Magnificent Seven are buying.) As The Wall Street Journal reports, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have seen their free cash flow decline by 30 percent over the past two years. By one estimate, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Tesla will by the end of this year have collectively spent $560 billion on AI-related capital expenditures since the beginning of 2024 and have brought in just $35 billion in AI-related revenue. OpenAI and Anthropic are bringing in lots of revenue and are growing fast, but they are still nowhere near profitable. Their valuations—roughly $300 billion and $183 billion, respectively, and rising—are many multiples higher than their current revenues. (OpenAI projects about $13 billion in revenues this year; Anthropic, $2 billion to $4 billion.) Investors are betting heavily on the prospect that all of this spending will soon generate record-breaking profits. If that belief collapses, however, investors might start to sell en masse, causing the market to experience a large and painful correction.

During the internet revolution of the 1990s, investors poured their money into basically every company with a “.com” in its name, based on the belief that the internet was about to revolutionize business. By 2000, however, it had become clear that companies were burning through cash with little to show for it, and investors responded by dumping the most overpriced tech stocks. From March 2000 to October 2002, the S&P 500 fell by nearly 50 percent. Eventually, the internet did indeed transform the economy and lead to some of the most profitable companies in human history. But that didn't prevent a whole lot of investors from losing their shirts.

The dot-com crash was bad, but it did not trigger a crisis. An AI-bubble crash could be different. AI-related investments have already surpassed the level that telecom hit at the peak of the dot-com boom as a share of the economy. In the first half of this year, business spending on AI added more to GDP growth than all consumer spending combined. Many experts believe that a major reason the U.S. economy has been able to weather tariffs and mass deportations without a recession is because all of this AI spending is acting, in the words of one economist, as a “massive private sector stimulus program.” An AI crash could lead broadly to less spending, fewer jobs, and slower growth, potentially dragging the economy into a recession. The economist Noah Smith argues that it could even lead to a financial crisis if the unregulated “private credit” loans funding much of the industry's expansion all go bust at once.

Rogé Karma: Does the stock market know something we don't?

If we do turn out to be in an AI bubble, the silver lining would be that fears of sudden AI-driven job displacement are overblown. In a recent analysis, the economists Sarah Eckhardt and Nathan Goldschlag used five different measurements of AI exposure to estimate how the new technology might be affecting a range of labor-market indicators and found virtually no effect on any of them. For example, they note that the unemployment rate for the workers least exposed to AI, such as construction workers and fitness trainers, has risen three times faster than the rate for the workers most exposed to it, such as telemarketers and software developers. Most other studies, though not all, have come to similar conclusions.

But there's also a weirder, in-between possibility. Even if AI tools don't increase productivity, the hype surrounding them could push businesses to keep expanding their use anyway. “I hear the same story over and over again from companies,” Daron Acemoglu, an economist at MIT, told me. “Mid-to-high-level managers are being told by their bosses that they need to use AI for X percent of their job to satisfy the board.” These companies might even lay off workers or slow their hiring because they are convinced—like the software developers from the METR study—that AI has made them more productive, even when it hasn't. The result would be an increase in unemployment that isn't offset by actual gains in productivity.

As unlikely as this scenario sounds, a version of it happened in the not-so-distant past. In his 2021 book, A World Without Email, the computer scientist Cal Newport points out that beginning in the 1980s, tools such as computers, email, and online calendars allowed knowledge workers to handle their own communications and schedule their own meetings. In turn, many companies decided to lay off their secretaries and typists. In a perverse result, higher-skilled employees started spending so much of their time sending emails, writing up meeting notes, and scheduling meetings that they became far less productive at their actual job, forcing the companies to hire more of them to do the same amount of work. A later study of 20 Fortune 500 companies found that those with computer-driven “staffing imbalances” were spending 15 percent more on salary than they needed to. “Email was one of those technologies that made us feel more productive but actually did the opposite,” Newport told me. “I worry we may be headed down the same path with AI.”

Then again, if the alternative is a stock-market crash that precipitates a recession or a financial crisis, that scenario might not be so bad.

﻿The US eradicated screwworm. Its return could cost America billions.

A Maryland resident who traveled to El Salvador came home last month with an unwelcome souvenir: larvae of the New World screwworm burrowing in their flesh.

The patient has since recovered from the painful parasite, and Maryland health officials confirmed that there's no sign of transmission to anyone else. But the case is historic: It's the first time in more than half a century that a human in the US has been infected by a screwworm.

On its own, it's a medical oddity — a one-off, travel-linked case that doesn't pose a direct risk to Americans. But it's also a warning sign of a much bigger threat creeping toward US borders. One that could rattle the backbone of American agriculture.

For the past two decades, screwworms were held at a distance by an invisible barrier along the Panama-Colombia border by a joint US-Panama program that regularly floods the region with sterile flies. That barrier has, however, cracked. Since 2023, screwworm has resurged through Central America and into Mexico.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

Because the flies lay their eggs in any open wounds, infestations escalate fast: A single cut can attract wave after wave of flies. And since cattle are kept in confined herds, outbreaks can ripple through dozens of animals. By the time the damage is visible, it's usually advanced and the flies have spread out. In just the past year, such infestations have led to a $1.3 billion loss in the Mexican cattle export industry, according to the Mexican National Agricultural Council.

Screwworm outbreaks can spiral rapidly, crippling entire herds. Cows are expensive to raise, feed, breed, and slaughter — that's why the American livestock industry treats screwworms as a nightmare scenario, worse than mad cow or foot-and-mouth disease. In Texas alone, a screwworm outbreak could drain as much as $1.8 billion a year from ranchers and the wider economy, according to an estimate by the US Department of Agriculture.

The US has a history of eliminating these flies before. And it's now dusting off old, proven strategies and spending real money. In May, the USDA put $21 million to renovate an existing facility in Metapa, Mexico, to produce sterile flies to control the spread. Earlier this year, the USDA also announced its $8.5 million plan to build a plant in south Texas. But is a 20th-century toolkit enough to fight off this emerging threat?

Experts say that the context has shifted in the last 50 years. Climate change is warming habitats, increasing possible places where screwworms can thrive. Industrial livestock farming has scaled up enormously, meaning a single outbreak could speak through herds faster than ever. Meanwhile, the Trump administration pushed out around 15,000 USDA employees and terminated a screwworm monitoring project. We have newer, better tools to fight off these, but those are yet to be approved. And parasites don't wait for paperwork.

The New World screwworm is a parasitic fly found today across parts of South America and the Caribbean. They have shiny blue-gray bodies and look similar to house flies that swarm your local dumpster. But unlike those ordinary flies, screwworm flies love fresh wounds.

Female screwworm flies are attracted to warm-blooded animals, and lay their eggs in open cuts or natural openings like ears or nostrils. Each female can lay up to 200 eggs at a time, which hatch some 12 to 24 hours later. Upon hatching, the larvae twist into flesh like corkscrews tearing deeper as they feed, causing extreme pain and tissue damage. Their scientific name, Cochliomyia hominivorax, which translates to man-eater, and their common name, screwworm, capture their horror: a spiral fly that eats its host alive.

After feeding for up to a week, the larvae wriggle back out of the wound and drop to the ground, where they pupate in the soil before emerging as adult screwworm flies — ready to repeat the cycle.

What makes screwworms particularly brutal is they only consume living flesh. A single infested wound becomes a beacon for more flies, leading to layer upon layer of larvae literally eating the host alive. Infestations in humans are excruciating and disfiguring, but rarely fatal with treatment. In animals, it's a different story: A single untreated wound can host thousands of larvae that literally eat a cow from the inside out, leading to blood loss, infections, and collapse. Entire herds can be decimated.

But there's an achilles heel: Female screwworms mate only once in their life — a unique biological quirk that has underpinned the US's control strategy for decades.

Screwworms once terrorized the American South and the Western US, and killed millions of dollars' worth of cattle each year. By the mid-20th century, the fly was costing America's ranchers up to $100 million annually.

But starting in the 1950s, USDA scientists found a way to use the fly's biology against itself. If they could find a way to get the female flies to mate with sterile mates, they could stop the flies' population in its tracks. And that's how the sterile insect technique (SIT) was developed.

The SIT is fairly straightforward: Rear huge numbers of screwworms in a lab and sterilize the pupae through radiation (a discovery from the post-war atomic age when scientists realized they could make flies infertile without killing them). Then these freshly sterilized pupae are packed onto twin-engine planes, timed so the flies hatch in the air. These flies are then sprayed out over the forest and ranchlands by the millions. They wake in warm air and do what flies do: They mate. Those pairings then produce nothing. If you do that at a sufficient scale and for a long enough time, the population will eventually collapse.

The first eradication program in the American Southeast ran through the 1950s followed by a larger push across Southwest, costing roughly $42 million in total. Ranching groups pushed the USDA for eradication, Texas cattlemen even wrote letters to USDA urging the agency to expand SIT. And unlike today's debates around genetically modified mosquitoes, screwworms never stirred much controversy. The technique was targeted, pesticide-free, and spared other insects, which is why it was an unusually “green” pest control, said Max Scott, a professor of entomology at NC State University. By 1966, the fly was gone.

The technique then was adopted in Mexico and parts of Central America, pushing the flies all the way to a narrow band of dense rainforests between Panama and Colombia called the Darién Gap. The Pan-American highway famously stops there, the region is sparsely populated, treacherous to cross, and light on livestock. It's exactly the kind of chokepoint where a biological “firewall” can hold.

Since 1998, a US-Panama program called Commission for the Eradication and Prevention of Screwworm (COPEG) has held the line at the Darién Gap. Planes drop off millions of sterile flies each week, and inspectors patrol the frontier town (not the deep Darién itself) to spot infestations, pluck out maggots manually, and treat wounds with insecticides — because SIT only works if you also knock down active infestations.

The program costs about $15 million annually and is funded mostly by USDA, with Panama contributing a small share. “It was one of the greatest achievements of the USDA in the 20th century,” Scott said.

But, in 2023, the firewall cracked.

Smuggling of cattle through Central America seeded fresh outbreaks in new regions, and climate shifts — higher temperatures and humidity — aided their spread. By spring 2025, Mexico was reporting detections as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz, a stretch of land far wider and difficult to contain than the narrow Darién. COPEG has been running flat out, turning out around 100 million larvae each week. But even at maximum capacity, the plant can only do so much. The screwworm front continued to advance.

Earlier this year, the USDA committed $21 million to convert an old fruit-fly plant in Metapa, Mexico, to churn out 60 million to 100 million sterile screwworms weekly to be released in southern Mexico, where the new front is. It's also building a factory in Edinburg, Texas, with three times that capacity. Congress is trying to lock this in with the STOP Screwworms Act, a bipartisan bill that would formally authorize USDA to build and fund the new Texas facility.

This is a lot of mobilization for a freaky bug, but it underscores how differently the US treats livestock threats.

Bird flu has killed more than 160 million birds in the US since 2022, according to the Coalition to Stop Flu, and USDA recently rolled out a $1 billion package to shore up defenses. The strategy there is still mass culling of chickens and relief checks to producers — much more reactive than proactive. Screwworm, by contrast, has long been treated like a national security threat, defended by a prevention firewall that costs tens of millions dollars a year to maintain.

Part of it is simply value: Cattle is a $112 billion industry, and a screwworm outbreak could cost billions a year in losses. Part is political: Ranchers pressed for eradication in the 1950s and have consistently backed the sterile-fly program since. The poultry industry is just as powerful, but it's split on bird flu strategy – with many producers fearing that widespread vaccination could jeopardize US export markets. That caution shows up in the USDA's new $1 billion bird flu package: half a billion for biosecurity, $400 million in financial relief, and just $100 million — 10 percent — for vaccines.

Right now, there are no FDA-approved drugs to treat screwworms in people or animals, though the agency says it has “multiple regulatory pathways” to fast-track reviews and authorize drugs. There are promising genetic tools that improve on SIT, but they will need regulatory approval and public trust before they fly.

And even with fresh funding, the USDA may not be able to aptly execute its ambitious plans, given that 15,000 of the agency's staff were let go earlier this year. In the end, it's not just biosecurity at stake, it's also a major source of our food supply and a slice of our economy.

Trump's war on immigrants could make your housing, food, and health care more expensive.

President Donald Trump has vowed to deport 1 million undocumented immigrants out of the United States every year. So far, he's falling well short of that goal, with estimates in the neighborhood of 200,000 as of August.

Still, the Trump administration carries on with its deportation campaign. Driven by publicly anti-immigrant officials like Stephen Miller, the White House has ramped up funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to record levels, deployed masked agents across cities and towns tasked with fulfilling arrest quotas, and is pursuing new deals with countries like South Sudan for so-called third-country deportations.

The unwitting face of Trump's crackdown has become Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father and Salvadoran citizen who was mistakenly deported to a megaprison in El Salvador in March. Abrego Garcia is back in the country and is now fighting off federal smuggling charges on top of a deportation order to Uganda. The chaotic case against Abrego Garcia and the Trump administration's tactics are becoming emblematic of a larger war on immigrants that could lead to a smaller, poorer United States.

According to Derek Thompson, writer, podcaster, and co-author of Abundance, this crackdown could contribute to a “massive” change in the US population and economy. And Trump's “unjust” tactics could backfire in the next elections.

Below is an excerpt of Thompson's conversation with Today, Explained host Sean Rameswaram, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Derek, you recently wrote on your Substack that the United States is at the precipice of a “historic, if dubious, achievement,” which of course sounds quite ominous. Tell us what that achievement is.

Well, for the entirety of American history, the US has only known population growth. The US grew through the Civil War, we grew through the Spanish Flu. We grew through both World Wars, we grew through Covid, even despite the deaths of a million people. But President Donald Trump is on the precipice of a truly historic and, as you said, dubious achievement in 2025.

It is absolutely possible that the US population shrinks for the first time on record. And the math here is straightforward. There's only two ways for a population to grow. There's something called natural increase, which is births minus deaths, and there's net immigration, which is migrants who arrive minus migrants who leave.

Last year, births outnumbered deaths by about 500,000 people. And that means that if net immigration declines by more than 500,000, the US could shrink for the first time in history. And several demographers are forecasting that net immigration could be negative 500,000 or in excess of that. And that would mean that the US would, for the first time ever, be a shrinking nation.

Is the reason that this isn't above-the-fold breaking news because we don't actually know if this is for sure going to happen?

Yeah. We don't know if this is going to happen. I spoke to William Frey, who's a really renowned demographer and a senior fellow at Brookings Institution, and I said, “Do you think it's possible the US shrinks this year?” And he said, “It's certainly possible. My bet at the beginning of 2025 was that growth would be positive but very slow. But, it's certainly possible that the population could shrink this year.”

So, one possibility is that I'm wrong, and the US doesn't shrink this year. I do think population growth will be very low. But I think most simply the reason why we aren't talking about this is that I don't think enough people have put together the basic math here. Number one, natural increase, births minus deaths, is very low. US fertility is low. I write a lot about that. And number two, net immigration is low because of all these deportations and all the migrants that the Trump administration is scaring away from even trying to enter the US in the first place.

You think a lot about shrinking birth rates. How does something like the story of Kilmar Abrego Garcia tie into what might be happening right now with the country's population?

Well, immigration politics clearly has swung in a pendulum over the last few years. Donald Trump's first term had some very cruel policies. And then, Joe Biden responded to those cruel policies by liberalizing immigration and liberalizing asylum law. And that created some years of the highest immigration in American history. I think in 2023 and 2024, we had an excess of 2.3 to 2.5 million immigrants coming into the US. That's extraordinary. And there was a backlash against that migrant surge. And that backlash is partly responsible for Trump being the president now. Trump has swung the pendulum all the way back to not only shutting down the border, but also to these extra legal deportations. These — in many cases illegal — deportations scare migrants from coming over in the first place, sending ICE into all these cities and rounding up people that they think don't look like Americans.

But what's really historic is that the fertility rate is low enough that, without consistent immigration, the US is going to shrink very, very soon. Most demographers thought the US wasn't going to shrink until the 2070s or 2080s. Donald Trump's immigration policies might pull forward that moment of American shrinkage by 60 years.

And you wrote on your Substack about how this is going to affect three essential sectors of American life: food, housing, health care. Please, indulge us.

Well, little in life is more fundamental than the right to food, shelter, and medicine. So, it's pretty important that immigrants play a disproportionate role in each. I'm going to start with farming. Two-thirds of agricultural workers are immigrants. In the absence of new migrant arrivals, farms are going to struggle in a number of ways. They can struggle to find replacements, and then wages go up for people working in agriculture. That can be really good for folks working in agriculture, but it means higher prices for people who are buying produce, milk, or meat at the grocery store. And we're already dealing with years of higher inflation.

“Many Americans clearly did not like the era of record-high mass immigration under Joe Biden, but I think they might hate the era of record deportations even more.”

Housing: Immigrants account for about 50 percent to 60 percent of roofers, painters, drywall, installers, and plasterers. We need immigrants to build houses. In fact, if you look across the country, 30 percent to 40 percent of the construction labor force is foreign born. Almost all of the largest housing markets — Florida, Georgia, Texas, Nevada, California, and New York — are incredibly dependent on foreign labor.

So, sometimes I say, “America's going to shrink this year.” And people say, “Oh, thank god. Everywhere's too crowded. Immigrants are competing for houses, they're competing for jobs. This is going to be fantastic for the country.” Well, guess what happens if you don't have enough people to build houses? You don't have enough houses. What happens to housing prices? They don't go down. They go up, because there's a housing shortage.

And then, finally: health care.

We're an aging nation. We need more clinicians, and we need more caregivers. And in a world with low immigration, we're going to have fewer clinicians and fewer caregivers.

This was one of the things that really surprised me most in my reporting: just how immigrant heavy the American medical labor force is. Foreign-born people account for up to 25 percent to 27 percent of America's physicians and surgeons; one in six people working across the health care sector are foreign-born. And so, if you have an aging country, and you have fewer people to care for them, then once again, you could have higher prices and longer lines at hospitals, and fewer people to be that home health aide for your sick parent, your grandparent, your uncle. Once again, I see major, major problems coming in a world where we have fewer immigrants.

Do you see the Trump administration trying to counter their immigration policies with the effects they may have on the economy with other policies? Are they aware of these pain points?

There are definitely folks in the Trump administration that want an America with fewer people and certainly want an America with fewer nonwhite people. I mean, that's clear. I'm more interested in how Donald Trump will use immigration policy as a weapon.

One of the things I'm most interested in is Donald Trump's sort of theory of economic power. As far as I can tell, he has a three-step formula for everything that he does. Step one: Create pain. Step two: Offer to remove pain. Step three: Demand tribute. How can you use immigration policy in this way? Well, immigration policy that's restrictive is painful for cities, and states, and companies, and industries that rely on immigrants.

I think he's going to ask certain cities, and states, and chief executives to pay him tribute in some kind of way in exchange for a guest worker program that he specifically targets for whoever just bent the knee. So, you can imagine some hospital or city that's struggling with population growth in 2026 or 2027 going to Donald Trump and saying, “Can you please change your immigration policy?” And maybe he'll change immigration policy — only if they offer him something in return. The politics of American stagnation could be quite interesting.

Do you think, if this goes badly in the coming years, if people attribute a negative economic circumstance to these policies, that we could have another shift and reverse some of what's happened in the past six months?

I absolutely do. Many Americans clearly did not like the era of record-high mass immigration under Joe Biden, but I think they might hate the era of record deportations even more. It's hard to really take the temperature of the median voter when it comes to immigration policy. But if I had to do my best, I would say that the median American voter wants positive immigration that feels orderly.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","South Korea says it has finished talks with the US to return nationals detained in an ICE raid on a Hyundai facility","https://www.businessinsider.com/hyundai-lg-battery-plant-workers-georgia-arrested-ice-raid-2025-9","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 11:19:00 GMT","

South Korea says it has finished talks with the US to return its citizens who were arrested in an immigration raid on a Hyundai facility in Georgia, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported, citing a senior presidential official.

A chartered plane will be sent to the US if administrative procedures are completed, presidential chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik said on Sunday, per the report.

Kang added that Seoul would push for an improved visa system for South Koreans looking to work in the US in the future, the report said.

It comes after nearly 500 workers were detained at a new Hyundai-LG battery facility on Thursday.

The raid was part of an ongoing criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, an official for the Department of Homeland Security told Business Insider.

""This, in fact, was the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security investigations,"" said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations for Georgia, during a press conference Friday.

A total of 475 workers were detained, a majority of whom were Korean nationals, the official said. The arrests included many subcontractors, and no formal charges had been filed at the time of the press conference, the official added.

Hyundai, based in Seoul, is one of the world's largest automobile manufacturers by revenue.

The Georgia battery factory that was raided is still under construction and due to open in the first half of next year. It is part of a larger, $7.6 billion operation that includes a production plant for Hyundai's electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, as well as autos for its Genesis luxury brand and sister company Kia.

""Hyundai Motor Company is aware of the immigration enforcement action that took place at the construction site of its supplier, the HL-GA Battery Company, in Bryan County, Georgia,"" the company said in an updated statement. ""We are closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances. Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company.""

The company said that it is ""committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate,"" including employment verification and immigration laws.

Chris Susock, the North America chief manufacturing officer, is taking over the Georgia site, according to Hyundai, and ensuring that subcontractors are following regulations.

""As we continue to invest in American manufacturing and create thousands of jobs, we will do so in full accordance with US law and in a manner that reflects our values of treating all people with dignity and respect,"" the company added in its updated statement.

""We are closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details,"" an LG spokesperson said. ""Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities.""

South Korea's foreign ministry had on Friday voiced its ""concern and regret"" over the matter, Yonhap reported.

""The economic activities of our companies investing in the US and the rights and interests of our nationals must not be unfairly violated,"" ministry spokesperson Lee Jae-woong said, according to the report.

Since the start of Donald Trump's second presidency in January, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have made arrests at a range of worksites across the country, including a meat-processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, a fire-equipment company in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, and a Louisiana racetrack. Day laborers outside of Home Depot locations have also been targeted. Trump administration officials have reportedly pushed for a goal of making a minimum of 3,000 immigration-related arrests per day.

The Hyundai raid comes after President Trump signed a bill into law in July that provides ICE with additional funding and resources to assist in the arrests of immigrants living in the US illegally, including enough detention capacity to maintain an average daily population of 100,000 individuals.

The raid comes more than a month after Trump announced a new trade agreement between the US and South Korea. The deal imposes a 15% tariff on most US imports from South Korea, including automobiles, in exchange for duty-free treatment on many American products.

Update: 9/5/2025 — This story now contains an updated statement from Hyundai.

Among the many places Kathy White, 66, has called home over the last decade are Mount Rushmore, New York's Hudson Valley, South Texas, and Kentucky. The only constant has been her 30-foot Itasca Sunstar motorhome.

After White's husband died, she didn't have the money to take vacations, but living in her RV while traveling the country and working seasonal jobs offered a way to pay the bills and live the life of exploration that she craved.

""You're on vacation in a way,"" she said, despite working relatively low-paid jobs, mainly managing activities and administrative tasks at campgrounds and parks.

White is among many Americans living itinerant lives and paying the bills with seasonal work. So-called ""work camping"" has become popular among a broad swath of Americans, including retirees volunteering in exchange for an RV hook-up, Gen Z influencers pursuing #vanlife, and would-be retirees who need to fund their travel bucket list.

The lifestyle can offer a sense of freedom, but it can be logistically challenging, and isn't necessarily cheaper than living in ""sticks and bricks,"" as so-called ""workampers"" call traditional homes.

Laurie and Matt DuShane had long dreamed of ""living tiny and being able to go and see this country,"" Laurie said. So the Michigan couple bought an RV in 2020 to use for short trips planned around Matt's work schedule as a law enforcement officer. But the RV suddenly became their primary home when Matt left his job while struggling with health issues, Laurie said.

""I knew that we couldn't continue in our current lifestyle without his income,"" she said. So the couple applied for work camping jobs from Montana to California. Their first seasonal job was five months working in a campground just outside Yellowstone National Park. They did administrative work, helped orient visitors, and cleaned cabins. They quickly fell in love with the lifestyle.

""My view from the campground office was Electric Peak,"" said Laurie, 51. ""It was just such a world of difference"" from their lives in Blissfield, Michigan.

It hasn't always been easy. They've had jobs fall through weeks before they were supposed to start, leaving them scrambling for work at the last minute. Their RV has broken down, putting them in a hotel for weeks. And they've felt too far from their adult children at times.

""A lot of people argue in the work camping space that you can't make good money, you don't have health benefits, all of this stuff. Well, we don't give up,"" Laurie said. ""We fight as hard as we can to find what we need to make it work, no matter the area that we're in.""

Many work campers are older volunteers who do work in exchange for a place to park their camper and a hookup.

Patty and Shane Gill, who are in their 50s, are among them. They sold their Texas home and most of their belongings before traveling full-time by RV. They will reach their five-year ""nomad anniversary"" in October and plan to maintain this lifestyle for at least the next few years.

Business Insider is covering the ways people are living outside traditional housing.

When their house was still for sale, a Texas campground owner offered them unpaid work positions in exchange for a free campsite and electricity. They've since traveled beyond the state and done more unpaid work in exchange for a free site, food, and laundry. Patty said they mainly live off Shane's retirement money from the Air Force, but social media earnings also help cover living expenses.

""We will work camp for a few months, and then we go and just travel for a few months without work camping,"" Patty said. ""So we just kind of do a little of both now."" She loves that work camping lets her get to know an area and meet lots of new people.

The rise of remote work since the pandemic has also opened up possibilities for camping and traveling without committing to taking relatively low-paid seasonal jobs.

Victoria Childers and Lamont Landrum Jr. have been work camping across the country since 2021, after they bought and renovated a 1992 Tiffin Allegro motorhome and sold their house in a suburb of Detroit. Their leap into RV life was made possible by Childers' remote job as a customer success representative for a software education company.

After several months on the road, Landrum, who worked as a handyman back in Detroit, began taking paid work camping jobs, including maintenance and cleaning at campgrounds and helping with American Crystal Sugar's annual sugar beet harvest in eastern North Dakota. But it helped to have Childers' steady income to buoy them.

These days, both Childers, 50, and Landrum, 40, are working seasonal work camping jobs since Childers was laid off from her remote job in February. The couple doesn't know whether they'll ever be able to afford to retire, but they said work camping had given them some freedom to live their lives as they'd like to and travel places they never otherwise would.

""We get to stay in these amazing places that we could never afford for even a week, let alone staying for months at a time,"" Childers said.

So far, they've lived and worked in a dozen different locations, some of which they've returned to multiple times. In early September, they'll head back to North Dakota for their fifth consecutive beet harvest. In their free time, the couple hikes with their dogs and has gotten into off-roading in their Jeep.

""I may be working a job that I may not be exactly happy about,"" Landrum said, but ""I usually don't let that affect what I'm doing after work.""

When Dave Hatton retired from 18 years as an elementary school teacher in Phoenix this past spring, he launched right into his next career as a photographer. Hatton, who just turned 60, began exploring his passion for landscape photography in the rural Southwest during the pandemic, and eventually realized that to do his best work in an affordable way, he needed to live on location.

""I wanted to be able to be on location for days at a time, but on the teacher's salary and on a teacher's pension, I knew that I wasn't going to be able to afford motels every time I went to these locations,"" he said.

So he bought a tiny trailer for $2,800, and now lives in it for days or weeks at a time. Hatton sells his prints at festivals across the region, and has plans to travel farther and for longer. He wants to explore much of the West and Southwest. ""I absolutely love it,"" he said. But with his wife still working as a teacher back in Phoenix, he doesn't have plans to live on the road full time.

The work camping lifestyle doesn't come without significant challenges. And living in a tiny space and constantly traveling often gets harder in older age. And while many work-campers hope to stick to their lifestyle into their 70s and 80s, some acknowledge they'll need to slow down at some point and perhaps find a permanent location to call home.

These days, Kathy White said she's looking for one place, or maybe two, to settle down in. But she hasn't found ""that perfect place"" yet. Her requirements are hard to meet.

""It's gotta be somewhere warm enough in the winter but cool enough in the summer,"" she said. ""There are so many more places to see.""

More than 300 South Korean workers detained following a massive immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia will be released and brought home, the South Korean government announced Sunday.

Presidential chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik said that South Korea and the U.S. had finalized negotiations on the workers' release. He said South Korea plans to send a charter plane to bring the workers home as soon as the remaining administrative steps are completed.

U.S. immigration authorities said Friday they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean nationals, when hundreds of federal agents raided Hyundai's sprawling manufacturing site in Georgia where the Korean automaker Hyundai makes electric vehicles. South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun later said that more than 300 South Koreans were among the detained.

The operation was the latest in a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda. But the one on Thursday is exceptionally distinct because of its large size and the fact that it targeted a manufacturing site, state officials have long called Georgia's largest economic development project.

Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday showed a caravan of vehicles driving up to the site and then federal agents directing workers to line up outside. Some detainees were ordered to put their hands up against a bus as they were frisked and then shackled around their hands, ankles and waist.

Agents focused their operation on a plant that is still under construction, at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce batteries that power EVs.

Most of the people detained were taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line. None has been charged with any crimes yet, Steven Schrank, the lead Georgia agent of Homeland Security Investigations, said during a news conference Friday, adding that the investigation is ongoing.

The South Korean government, a close U.S. ally, expressed ""concern and regret"" over the raid targeting its citizens and sent diplomats to the site.

Undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea disrupted internet access in parts of Asia and the Middle East, experts said Sunday, though it wasn't immediately clear what caused the incident.

There has been concern about the cables being targeted in a Red Sea campaign by Yemen's Houthi rebels, which the rebels describe as an effort to pressure Israel to end its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But the Houthis have denied attacking the lines in the past.

Undersea cables are one of the backbones of the internet, along with satellite connections and land-based cables. Typically, internet service providers have multiple access points and reroute traffic if one fails, though it can slow down access for users.

Microsoft announced via a status website that the Mideast ""may experience increased latency due to undersea fiber cuts in the Red Sea."" The Redmond, Washington-based firm did not immediately elaborate, though it said that internet traffic not moving through the Middle East ""is not impacted.""

NetBlocks, which monitors internet access, said ""a series of subsea cable outages in the Red Sea has degraded internet connectivity in multiple countries,"" which it said included India and Pakistan. It blamed ""failures affecting the SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.""

The South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe 4 cable is run by Tata Communications, part of the Indian conglomerate. The India-Middle East-Western Europe cable is run by another consortium overseen by Alcatel-Lucent. Neither firm did not immediately responded to requests for comment.

Pakistan Telecommunications, a telecom giant in that country, noted that the cuts had taken place in a statement on Saturday.

Saudi Arabia did not immediately acknowledge the disruption and authorities there did not respond to a request for comment.

In the United Arab Emirates, home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, internet users on the country's state-owned Du and Etisalat networks complained of slower internet speeds. The government did not immediately acknowledge the disruption.

Anchors can cut subsea cables dropped from ships, but can also be targeted in attacks. It can take weeks for repairs to be made as the ship and crew must locate themselves over the damaged cable.

The lines' cut comes as Yemen's Houthi rebels remain locked in a series of attacks targeting Israel over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Israel has responded with airstrikes, including one that killed top leaders within the rebel movement.

In early 2024, Yemen's internationally recognized government in exile alleged that the Houthis planned to attack undersea cables in the Red Sea. Several were cut, but the Houthis denied being responsible. On Sunday morning, the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel acknowledged that the cuts had taken place, citing NetBlocks.

From November 2023 to December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 ships with missiles and drones over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In their campaign so far, the Houthis have sunk four vessels and killed at least eight mariners.

The Iranian-backed Houthis stopped their attacks during a brief ceasefire in the war. They later became the target of an intense weekslong campaign of airstrikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump before he declared a ceasefire had been reached with the rebels. The Houthis sank two vessels in July, killing at least four on board, with others believed to be held by the rebels.

The Houthis' new attacks come as a new possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war remains in the balance. Meanwhile, the future of talks between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran's battered nuclear program is in question after Israel launched a 12-day war against the Islamic Republic in which the Americans bombed three Iranian atomic sites.

Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced Sunday he will step down as leader of the world's fourth-largest economy amid growing political discord within his party.

""I made a difficult decision to step down,"" Ishiba said during a press briefing, in comments translated by Japan's public broadcaster NHK. He added that it is his ""strong wish"" for members of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to overcome the ""difficult divide"" within the party.

Ishiba indicated that he had been thinking about his position as prime minister since last year's election, but that it was a matter of finding the right timing.

Ishiba described the U.S. tariff measures as a ""national crisis."" He added that he believes a ""significant milestone"" has been reached, after receiving a report from Japan's tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, on Saturday. 

""I have consistently stated that I do not intend to cling to this position, and that I would make a decision at the appropriate time after accomplishing what needed to be done.... Now that negotiations concerning U.S. tariff measures have reached a conclusion, I believe this is precisely the appropriate timing. I have therefore decided to step aside and make way for my successor,"" he said in comments translated by NBC News.

The prime minister called for the LDP to hold an emergency leadership vote. Ishiba will continue his duties until a new successor has been found, he told reporters.

The world's fourth-largest economy has been plagued with political uncertainty since the LDP lost its parliamentary majority in a snap election late last year. The election marked the first time since 2009 that the LDP has lost its majority. Pressure mounted when Japan's ruling coalition lost control of the upper house in July.

Japan had struggled to reach a trade agreement with the U.S. and protect its massive auto sector from high duties. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to implement a trade deal with Japan, imposing 15% baseline tariffs on most Japanese goods, including autos.

The deal was agreed to after months of negotiations, with Washington and Tokyo continuing to haggle over details for weeks before it was signed. On Sunday, negotiator Akazawa stated that the agreement was still ""not settled"" as the U.S. had yet to issue the expected presidential orders on duties for pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, Reuters reported.

Earlier this week, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party released a long-awaited report on why it lost seats in the upper house election in July.

The report ascribed the loss to the lack of appeal for the party's measures aimed at taming inflation, previous political scandals and weak mobilization of young voters.

Local media reports suggested many key members of the LDP had signaled their intention to resign to the prime minister, while Ishiba had said that he intended to stay on amid calls within his party for choosing another leader.

To join the CNBC Technology Executive Council, go to cnbccouncils.com/tec

Current CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Antonio Neri rose from call center agent at the company to chief executive officer. Doug McMillon, Walmart CEO, started off with a summer gig helping to unload trucks. It's a similar story for GM CEO Mary Barra, who began on the assembly line at the automaker as an 18-year old. Those are the kinds of career ladder success arcs that have inspired workers, and Hollywood, but as AI is set to replace many entry-level jobs, it may also write that corporate character out of the plot.  

The rise of AI has coincided with considerable organizational flattening, especially among middle management ranks. At the same time, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei is among those who forecast 50% of entry-level jobs may be wiped out by AI as the technology improves, including being able to work eight-hour shifts without a break. 

All the uncertainty in the corporate org chart introduced by AI — occurring at a time when college graduates are struggling to find roles — raises the question of whether the career ladder is about to be broken, and the current generation of corporate leaders' tales of ascent that have always made up an important part of the corporate American ethos set to become a thing of the past. If the notion of going from the bottom to the top has always been more the exception than the rule, it has helped pump the heart of America's corporations. In the least, removing the first rung on the ladder raises important questions about the transfer of institutional knowledge and upward advancement in organizations.

Looking at data between 2019 and 2024 for the biggest public tech firms and maturing venture-capital funded startups, venture capital firm SignalFire found in a study there was a 50% decline in new role starts by people with less than one year of post-graduate work experience: ""Hiring is intrinsically volatile year on year, but 50% is an accurate representation of the hiring delta for this experience category over the considered timespan,"" said Asher Bantock, head of research at SignalFire. The data ranged across core business functions — sales, marketing, engineering, recruiting/HR, operations, design, finance and legal — with the 50% decline consistent across the board. 

But Heather Doshay, partner at SignalFire, says the data should not lead job seekers to lose hope. ""The loss of clear entry points doesn't just shrink opportunities for new grads — it reshapes how organizations grow talent from within,"" she said. 

If, as Amodei told CNBC earlier this year, ""At some point, we are going to get to AI systems that are better than almost all humans at almost all tasks,"" the critical question for workers is how the idea of an entry-level job can evolve as AI continues to.

Flatter organizations seem certain. ""The ladder isn't broken — it's just being replaced with something that looks a lot flatter,"" Doshay said. In her view, the classic notion of a CEO rising from the mailroom is a perfect example since at many company's it's been a long time since anyone worked in an actual mailroom. ""The bottom rung is disappearing,"" she said, ""but that has the potential to uplevel everyone.""

The new ""entry level"" might be a more advanced or skilled role, but with the upskilling of the bottom rung, pressure is being created for new grads to acquire these job skills on their own, rather than being able to learn them while already on a job they can't land today. That should not be a career killer, though, according to Doshay.

""When the internet and email came on the scene as common corporate required skills, new grads were well-positioned to become experts by using them in school, and the same absolutely applies here with how accessible AI is,"" she said. ""The key will be in how new grads harness their capabilities to become experts so they are seen as desirable tech-savvy workers who are at the forefront of AI's advances,"" she said.

But she concedes that may not offer much comfort to the current crop of recent grads looking for jobs right now. ""My heart goes out to the new grads of 2024, 2025, and 2026, as they are entering during a time of uncertainty,"" Doshay said, describing it is a much more vulnerable group entering the workforce than ones further into the future.

Universities are turning their schools into AI training grounds, with several institutions striking major deals with companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.

""Historically, technological advancements have not harmed employment rates in the long run, but there are short-term impacts along the way,"" Doshay said. ""The entry-level careers of recent graduates are most affected, which could have lasting effects as they continue to grow their careers with less experience while finding fewer job opportunities,"" she added.Anders Humlum, assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago, says predictions about AI's long-term labor market impact remain highly speculative, and firms are only just beginning to adjust to the new generative AI landscape. ""We now have two and a half years of experience with generative AI chatbots diffusing widely throughout the economy,"" Humlum said, adding ""these tools have really not made a significant difference for employment or earnings in any occupation thus far.""

Looking at the history of labor and technology, he says even the most transformative technologies, such as steam power, electricity, and computers took decades to generate large-scale economic effects. As a result, any reshaping of the corporate structure and culture will take time to become clear.  

""Even if Amodei is correct that AI tools will eventually match the technical capabilities of many entry-level white-collar workers, I believe his forecast underestimates both the time required for workflow adjustments and the human ability to adapt to the new opportunities these tools create,"" Humlum said.

But a key challenge for businesses is ensuring that the benefits of these tools are broadly shared across the workforce. In particular, Humlum said, his research shows a substantial gender gap in the use of generative AI. ""Employers can significantly reduce this gap by actively encouraging adoption and offering training programs to support effective use,"" he said.

Other AI researchers worry that the biggest issue won't be the career ladder at the lowest rung, but ultimately, the stability of any rung at all, all the way to the top. 

If predictions about AI advancements ultimately leading to superintelligence are proven correct, Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute, says the issue isn't going to be about whether the 50% entry-level jobs being wiped out is accurate, but that percentage growing to 100% for all careers, ""since superintelligence can by definition do all jobs better than us,"" he said.

In that world, even if you were the last call center, distribution center or assembly line worker to make it to the CEO desk, your days of success might be numbered. ""If we continue racing ahead with totally unregulated AI, we'll first see a massive wealth and power concentration from workers to those who control the AI, and then to the machines themselves as their owners lose control over them,"" Tegmark said.

In this article

Many pundits are expecting major indices to be volatile due to macro uncertainty. Moreover, on average, September has historically been the worst month for U.S. stocks.

Investors seeking consistent income despite a volatile market can consider adding dividend-paying stocks to their portfolios. To this end, they can rely on the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts, who with their expertise can help select attractive dividend stocks with strong fundamentals.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

This week's first dividend pick is Archrock (AROC), an energy infrastructure company with a primary focus on midstream natural gas compression. The company paid a dividend of 21 cents per share for the second quarter, an increase of about 11% over the first-quarter dividend. At an annualized dividend of 84 cents, AROC offers a yield of 3.3%.

In a recent research note, Mizuho analyst Gabriel Moreen updated the models and price targets for master limited partnerships (MLPs) and midstream companies. Moreen reiterated a buy rating on Archrock stock and modestly raised the price forecast to $32 from $31. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on AROC stock with a price target of $27.

Moreen said AROC continues to ""distinguish itself with exceptional balance sheet flexibility,"" which allows it to deliver not only solid capital returns like its $28.8 million share repurchase in the second quarter, but also supports higher capital spending and dividend expansion.

Notably, the 5-star analyst highlighted that AROC indicated that it expects its dividend to increase consistently with recent dividends per share growth, if the business performs. Consequently, Moreen increased his dividend per share estimates for fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027 to 83 cents, 93 cents and $1.02, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 20%, 12% and 10%, respectively.

The analyst stated that AROC demonstrated strong operational momentum by raising its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) guidance for the second consecutive quarter, although there were some one-time items. Moreover, Moreen believes that Archrock's aggressive capex outlook stands out, as it clearly indicates that the company is seeing solid demand for new orders despite the volatility following ""liberation day.""

Moreen ranks No. 112 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 76% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.9%. See Archrock Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Next up is Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP), a leading global infrastructure company that owns and operates diversified, long-life assets in the utilities, transport, midstream and data sectors. BIP declared a quarterly distribution of 43 cents per unit payable on Sept. 29, reflecting a 6% year-over-year increase. BIP stock offers a dividend yield of 5.6%.

Recently, Jefferies analyst Sam Burwell resumed coverage of Brookfield Infrastructure stock with a buy rating and a price target of $35. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a price target of $34 but a ""neutral"" rating.

Burwell stated that BIP remains a ""unique beast"" with an expanding footprint. He noted three significant acquisitions since April – the Colonial Pipeline, rail car leasing with GATX, and the Hotwire fiber-to-home business, all of which were U.S.-focused and highly contracted. Additionally, all three have strengthened BIP's midstream, transport, and data businesses, respectively.

""While BIP's broad footprint remains complex, we tend to view positively that the YTD acquisitions have been in the US and that most of the divestitures have been ex-North America,"" said Burwell.

The top-rated analyst contended that while BIP stock has stagnated over the last few years, its upcoming investor day provides an opportunity to help the market better understand the transactions made in 2025. Burwell expects BIP's funds from operations (FFO) to grow at a nearly 9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), excluding to-be-announced capital recycling. Burwell also expects solid distribution growth at about 6.5% CAGR through 2027.

Burwell ranks No. 848 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 15.7%. See Brookfield Infrastructure Statistics on TipRanks.

Another dividend-paying energy stock is Permian Resources (PR). It is an independent oil and natural gas company having assets in the Permian Basin, with a concentration in the core of the Delaware Basin. The company declared a base dividend of 15 cents per share for the third quarter of 2025, payable on Sept. 30. At an annualized dividend per share of 60 cents, PR stock offers a dividend yield of 4.3%.

Recently, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reaffirmed a buy rating on Permian stock with a price forecast of $17. Likewise, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on PR stock with a price target of $16.50.

Mehta highlighted that Permian Resources continued to ramp its operations in the second quarter across the acquired assets from APA Corp. and other smaller bolt-on acquisitions. Moreover, the company announced new transportation and marketing agreements to enhance oil and natural gas netbacks, which are estimated to drive incremental free cash flow of over $50 million in 2026 compared with 2024.

Despite the uncertainty around oil prices, the 5-star analyst remains bullish on Permian Resources, given its cost optimization efforts and focus on delivering higher free cash flow per share. The analyst noted management's commentary about PR's solid balance sheet, which allows it to make strategic investments without disrupting its capital allocation priorities, such as increasing cash on the balance sheet, share repurchases, and debt reduction.

""We believe PR's focus on opportunistically acquiring high-quality assets along with consistent grassroots acquisitions can drive long-term shareholder value,"" said Mehta.

Mehta ranks No. 670 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 59% of the time, delivering an average return of 9%. See Permian Resources Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Two types of story dominated the chatter in the newsroom this week.

The watercooler favourite? The antics of high-profile CEOs, with the departure of Nestle's boss over an undisclosed affair with a subordinate and the resignation of Suntory's CEO over the possible purchase of illegal substances both causing a stir in the London and Singapore newsrooms.

But what kept the news desks busiest was bond market volatility, which could well spill over into next week. Over the last few days, we've had a slew of guests sharing their views on some of the most significant yield moves seen in the U.K. gilt market and across Europe in decades.

And more could be to come next week…

At the epicenter of European bond yield uncertainty is France.

On Monday, there will be a confidence vote in the government, called by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou — and the ruling party is almost certain to lose.

Rivals France Insoumise, National Rally and the Socialist Party have all claimed they will vote against the government. This raises the prospect of President Emmanuel Macron calling a snap election, although it is more likely he will seek to assign another centrist caretaker government.

In a straw poll of clients, Nomura found that yields of French government bonds — or OATS — would need to move even more dramatically to cause a ""major loss of international investor confidence."" In a note, the bank pointed to the next rating review of France's sovereign debt by Fitch, due to take place on Sept. 12, as a key date to watch.

Another inflection point this week will come when the ECB meets on Thursday amid the heightened market volatility.

The central bank is expected to keep rates on hold at 2%, with HSBC predicting President Christine Lagarde will maintain a ""dovish bias."" The ECB itself stressed the need to stay ""deliberately uninformative about future interest rates decisions"" in its July account of its policy meeting.

Market watchers expect Lagarde to be questioned about the uncertainty in France during her press conference, but economists predict she will avoid answering directly.

Embattled Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba will resign to avoid a split within his ruling party, Japanese media reported on Sunday, pitching the world's fourth-largest economy into fresh political uncertainty.

A spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office did not immediately have a comment when contacted by Reuters, but the government said Ishiba would hold a press conference at 6 p.m. (0900 GMT).

Since he came to power in September last year, Ishiba's coalition has lost its majorities in elections for both houses of parliament amid voter anger over rising living costs.

He had refused calls from within his Liberal Democratic Party to step down and take responsibility for the upper house loss in July.

Concern over political uncertainty led to a sell-off in the yen and Japanese government bonds last week, with the yield on the 30-year bond hitting a record high on Wednesday.

Speculation over Ishiba's fate increased when the LDP scheduled a vote for Monday on whether to hold an extraordinary leadership election.

While the policy paralysis could add pain for an economy hit by U.S. tariffs, markets are focusing more on the chance of Ishiba being replaced by an advocate of looser fiscal and monetary policy, such as Sanae Takaichi, who has criticised the Bank of Japan's interest rate hikes.

Ishiba narrowly defeated Takaichi in the LDP leadership run-off.

If Ishiba resigns, his last act as premier will have been to finalise details of a trade deal with the United States last week, under which Japan pledged $550 billion of investments in return for lower tariffs from U.S.

Bitcoin's illiquid supply—the portion of coins held by entities with little history of spending—has climbed to a new record high, surpassing 14.3 million BTC in late August, according to Glassnode. 

With 19.9 million BTC currently in circulation, around 72% of the total supply is now illiquid, held by entities such as long-term holders and cold storage investors. This growth highlights a sustained accumulation trend, even during recent market volatility.

In mid-August, bitcoin hit an all-time high of $124,000 before retreating roughly 15%. Despite the price pullback, the illiquid supply continued to rise, showing that holders remain undeterred by short-term corrections. 

Over the past 30 days alone, the net change in illiquid supply has increased by 20,000 BTC, underscoring persistent investor conviction.

The ongoing increase in this category suggests tightening supply dynamics that could set the stage for renewed momentum once sentiment recovers. For now, the trend reflects growing confidence in bitcoin as a long-term store of value.

 Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino says the firm “didn't sell any Bitcoin” and is still allocating profits into BTC, gold and land. 

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has denied recent rumors that the stablecoin issuer is offloading its Bitcoin holdings to buy gold. 

In a Sunday post on X, Ardoino said the company “didn't sell any Bitcoin,” and reaffirmed its strategy of allocating profits into assets like “Bitcoin, gold, and land.”

The comments came in response to speculation from YouTuber Clive Thompson, who cited Tether's Q1 and Q2 2025 attestation data from BDO to claim the firm had reduced its Bitcoin (BTC) position. Thompson pointed to a drop from 92,650 BTC in Q1 to 83,274 BTC in Q2 as evidence of a sell-off.

However, Jan3 CEO Samson Mow debunked the claim, noting that Tether transferred 19,800 BTC to a separate initiative called Twenty One Capital (XXI) during the same period. That included 14,000 BTC sent in June and another 5,800 BTC in July.

In early June, Tether moved over 37,000 BTC, worth approximately $3.9 billion, across numerous transactions to support XXI, a Bitcoin-native financial platform led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers. 

“Tether would have had 4,624 BTC more than at the end of Q1 if the transfer is accounted for,” Mow explained, adding that the firm actually increased its net holdings.

Ardoino echoed the explanation, saying the Bitcoin was moved, not sold. “While the world continues to get darker, Tether will continue to invest part of its profits into safe assets,” he wrote.

Tether, the issuer of the USDt (USDT) stablecoin, holds over 100,521 BTC, worth around $11.17 billion, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET.

Tether's Bitcoin sell-off rumors came as El Salvador revealed it has added 13,999 troy ounces of gold worth $50 million to its foreign reserves, marking its first gold acquisition since 1990. The central bank said the move is part of a diversification strategy to reduce reliance on the US dollar.

Before turning to gold, El Salvador built a $700 million Bitcoin reserve, holding 6,292 BTC. However, an International Monetary Fund report in July claimed that the Central American country has not made any new Bitcoin purchases since February.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin's elusive, pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto has remained in the shadows since his last message in 2011, saying that he had “moved on to other things.”

But SharpLink Gaming co-CEO Joseph Chalom has a “wild theory” that Nakamoto will reveal himself once the original cryptocurrency faces an existential threat from quantum computing.

Some experts believe that quantum computing could become an “existential crisis” for Bitcoin within the next decade, as the community has started to discuss ways to quantum-proof the network. To do this, some have floated the idea of a quantum-proofing hard fork, while others have proposed freezing Satoshi's quantum-vulnerable coins.

'Existential Crisis': Bitcoin Quantum Computing Threat Is Fast Approaching, Experts Say

Chalom, who co-leads the $3.6 billion Ethereum treasury company, told Decrypt last week that he believes the Bitcoin founder may reveal himself as this hurdle is attempted.

“I have a wild idea that at some point—five, 10 years from now—when the Bitcoin network needs to be quantum-proofed, there will be some really important decisions around standards and encryption,” Chalom explained. “There'll be decisions about whether you need to hard fork the protocol [and] what you do with wallets that are dormant.”

“When that quantum moment comes, somebody is going to wake up and say: ‘I don't want to be forked.' Or someone's going to wake up and say: ‘Fork me.' That's a lot of money to leave on the table,” he added.”

This theory, Chalom added, is not based on any facts and is just another bold theory to add to the 17-year mountain of Satoshi speculation. However, Chalom did say that if his theory is right, then he believes Satoshi will reveal himself through “some old, OG accounts” that haven't been active in a long time.

These old accounts could include any of the wallets that many attribute to being owned by Satoshi—identified via a method called the Patoshi Pattern. At the time of writing, these wallets hold 1.096 million BTC, which is worth approximately $121.9 billion, according to Arkham data.

That makes the elusive founder the 12th richest person in the world, according to Forbes, while a 23% move to $150 billion would put him in the top 10. Predictors at Myriad think that such a move is unlikely to be made soon, with 90% voting against Satoshi hitting a $150 billion net worth in September. (Disclosure: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

SharpLink Will Explore Staking Portion of $3.6 Billion Ethereum Treasury on Linea, CEO Says

Old accounts waking up could also include any of the known Satoshi-linked email addresses or his account on the Bitcointalk forum. These accounts springing back to life to voice Satoshi's opinion may not necessarily mean revealing his true identity.

Thousands of theories about Satoshi's real identity have spawned since the Bitcoin white paper was first penned in 2008. Fingers have been pointed at early Bitcoin adopters, government organizations, and even Elon Musk. But Bitcoin backers have yet to agree on a single person.

HBO attempted to unmask the elusive crypto creator in a 2024 documentary, which made the claim that Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd was Satoshi.

Bitcoin Blockbuster? 'Killing Satoshi' Film to Star Casey Affleck, Pete Davidson

“Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery” director Cullen Hoback highlighted a forum post from Todd to Satoshi, which the director believed was Todd speaking as if he were in control of both accounts. The documentary also pointed to other clues, such as Todd's writing style, his previous experiments with digital currencies, and his level of computer programming.

Ultimately, however, the crypto community dismissed the theory as speculative and based on false assumptions. Todd also pushed back by posting on social media, “I'm not Satoshi.”

As of now, the mystery remains—but if Chalom is right, then maybe the looming quantum threat will bring Bitcoin's creator back out from the shadows.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum Foundation's Oldest Wallet? $17 Million Wake-Up Call","https://www.tradingview.com/news/u_today:905915cb3094b:0-ethereum-foundation-s-oldest-wallet-17-million-wake-up-call/","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 10:55:00 GMT","

The market is alarmed after an Ethereum wallet connected to the Ethereum Foundation unexpectedly came back to life after almost 10 years of inactivity. The recent transfer of 4,000 ETH (worth $17.13 million) to a new address by wallet 0x0F08 has sparked conjecture that additional movement of its holdings may have an effect on Ethereum's price.

The history of Ethereum is closely linked to this wallet. In 2015, when the total value of the tokens was only $91,000, or about $0.93 per ETH at the time, the Ethereum Foundation sent 97,500 ETH directly to the address. The wallet then sent its first Ethereum to Kraken at $4.65, a move that, looking back, hardly touched the surface of Ethereum's potential for long-term value.ETHUSDT Chart by TradingView"">

Two factors make the nine-year reawakening noteworthy. It first draws attention to the extent to which early ETH allocations are dormant and subject to abrupt reintroduction into the market. Second, because investors perceive them as possible selling pressure, big transfers like these frequently cause market anxiety. The psychological effects of old Ethereum moving after almost 10 years tend to affect sentiment, even though a $17 million transfer might not seem like much given Ethereum's market capitalization.

Technically speaking, Ethereum is currently consolidating at $4,307, hovering just above the 50-day moving average, or short-term support at $4,144. Major downside protection is located at $3,190 (200-day EMA), while stronger support is located close to $3,607 (100-day EMA). The intensity of whale activity from dormant wallets may test these levels.

The timing is crucial, even though the transfer does not ensure an instant sale.

Because markets are sensitive to whale behavior, periods of increased volatility have historically corresponded with the resurgence of early Ethereum addresses. The movement of these funds to centralized exchanges, which would validate selling intent, will be closely monitored by traders.

Finally, the resurgence of wallet 0x0F08, a part of Ethereum's founding history, serves as a reminder to the market that supply that has lain dormant for a long time can suddenly come back to life. The hypothetical 4,000 ETH transfer adds short-term downside risk to Ethereum's otherwise bullish structure, even if it doesn't immediately impact exchanges.

 Crypto traders are weighing which major asset might lead the next upward move as risk appetite cools, according to Santiment. 

Crypto market sentiment has slipped into Fear, with signs showing that investors are temporarily stepping back from moving further down the risk curve, according to sentiment sources.

“It's clear traders are less interested in obscure altcoins and are instead debating which major asset will break out next,” sentiment platform Santiment said in a report on Saturday. 

Santiment said that the crypto market is increasingly focused on larger-cap crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and XRP (XRP). “A heavy focus on large-caps can indicate a more cautious or ‘risk-off' sentiment among traders,” Santiment said.

It comes amid growing calls from traders for an altcoin season. However, Bitfinex analysts recently said it may not arrive until more crypto ETFs potentially launch later this year.

Meanwhile, on Sunday, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures overall crypto market sentiment, posted a “Fear” score of 44, after posting “Neutral” readings over the previous two days.

Some traders are also questioning the near-term direction of major cap assets. On Saturday, crypto trader Daan Crypto Traders said that Bitcoin's price “remains undecisive [sic].”

“My base case scenario remains to see a sweep of the monthly lows, which should then cause some panic and fear of it losing $100K,” Daan Crypto Trades said.

Over the month, Bitcoin is down 5.38%, while Ether is up 9.44%, according to CoinMarketCap.

However, other indicators suggest that the market is still moving down the risk curve.

On Sunday, CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index posted an “Altcoin Season” score of 56 out of 100. The indicator tips between Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season based on how the top 100 altcoins have performed against Bitcoin over the past 90 days.

Crypto trader Rekt Fencer said, “This is the final shakeout for altcoins.” 

Meanwhile, MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe said that altcoins are “extremely undervalued.”

“The cycle has proven that this cycle is completely different than previous cycles,” van de Poppe said.

On Friday, Bitcoin analyst PlanC echoed a similar sentiment. 

“Anyone who thinks Bitcoin has to peak in Q4 of this year does not understand statistics or probability,” the analyst said in an X post, arguing that relying on the three previous halving cycles doesn't provide enough statistically significant data.

Christian Catalini, co-creator of Facebook's Libra project, warned on Friday that Stripe's Tempo and Circle's Arc could succeed commercially but at the cost of crypto's decentralization ideal.

Launched in 2019, Libra was Meta's bold bid to create a global digital currency backed by a basket of stable assets. The project promised to make payments as seamless as messaging, but it triggered immediate backlash from regulators concerned about financial sovereignty, systemic risk, and user privacy. By 2022, Libra — renamed Diem in a bid to reset its image — was shuttered and its assets sold off.

Catalini, who served as Libra's chief economist, used his Sept. 5 thread on X to revisit the project's early compromises and explain why they matter now. He said the original open design, developed with Harvard economist Scott Kominers, was reduced to a short appendix after months of regulatory negotiations.

The first major retreat, he wrote, was abandoning non-custodial wallets. Regulators insisted on a “clear perimeter,” meaning a responsible intermediary they could contact — and penalize — if problems arose. 

For supervisors used to intermediated finance, a world where users truly held their own money was unmanageable. “For them, killing self-custody wasn't a choice, it was an obvious necessity,” he recalled.

Catalini noted the irony: today, open networks are developing compliance tools native to blockchain that could have addressed these concerns more effectively than traditional frameworks. But back then, Libra was forced to strip away decentralization, a change he described as an early signal of where corporate-led projects were heading.

His broader lesson was stark: “As long as there is a single throat to choke — or a committee of them — you can't truly rewire the system. Worse, any network with an architect is living on borrowed time.”

Catalini placed Stripe's Tempo and Circle's Arc in that context. Both are new blockchains designed explicitly for payments, promoted as stablecoin-first infrastructure for enterprises and fintechs.

Circle launched Arc on Aug. 12, presenting it as a Layer-1 network purpose-built for stablecoin finance. Unlike public chains that rely on volatile gas tokens, Arc uses USDC for fees, offering predictable, dollar-denominated costs. 

It integrates a built-in foreign exchange engine, promises sub-second finality, and includes opt-in privacy features. Circle said Arc will support cross-border payments, onchain credit systems, tokenized capital markets and programmable, automated payments.

Just weeks later, Stripe and Paradigm unveiled Tempo on Sept. 4, describing it as a payments-first blockchain capable of handling over 100,000 transactions per second. 

The network is EVM-compatible, features a dedicated payments lane with support for memos and access lists, and allows users to pay both transactions and gas in any stablecoin. Stripe said early design partners include Visa, Deutsche Bank, Revolut, Nubank, Shopify, OpenAI, Anthropic and DoorDash.

Both projects were marketed as steps toward mainstreaming stablecoin payments. But for Catalini, they raised a deeper concern.

Catalini argued that corporate-led chains like Arc and Tempo risk simply rebuilding the old financial system with new players in charge. Instead of displacing card networks and banks, he warned, they could elevate fintech giants to the same position of dominance. “The throne will have new occupants, but it will be the same throne,” he wrote.

He also predicted such networks would fracture geopolitically, with Western and Eastern blocs unlikely to share a single corporate-led infrastructure. The result, he said, would be competing financial empires rather than the borderless system crypto's early advocates envisioned.

Ultimately, Catalini described Stripe's Tempo as a “referendum on the ghost of Libra.” If it thrives, he suggested, it may prove Libra failed because of timing, not design — and show that the dream of open, permissionless money has been overtaken by more pragmatic, centralized solutions.

 As AI floods hiring with polished but hollow applications, blockchain-based credentials offer verifiable proof of skills over artificial eloquence. 

Opinion by: Ignacio Palomera, co-founder and CEO of Bondex

The global hiring landscape is changing rapidly. Today's job seekers are increasingly turning to generative AI to draft cover letters, tailor resumes and even simulate interview prep. 

Agentic AI is auto-applying, generative AI is drafting personalized applications at scale, and AI auto-apply tools enable candidates to apply to thousands of roles in minutes. Employers are inundated with applications that look polished, persuasive and tailored — but often lack any real signal of effort, capability or authenticity.

When anyone can crank out a polished, high-quality application with just a few AI prompts, the traditional cover letter — once seen as a chance to stand out and show real intent — becomes a commodity. It stops signaling effort or enthusiasm and starts looking more like standardized output. 

Hiring managers are now staring at inboxes filled with slick, personalized applications that all feel strangely similar. And that's where the real problem kicks in: If everyone sounds qualified on paper, how can you tell who has the skills and knows how to game a prompt? It's not about who writes best but about who can prove they can deliver in the real world.

Traditional hiring has long relied on trust-based signals such as resumes, references and degrees, but these have always been weak proxies. Titles can be inflated, education overstated and past work exaggerated. AI blurs things even more, cloaking unverifiable claims in artificial eloquence.

For fast-paced, remote-native industries like crypto or decentralized autonomous organization ecosystems, the stakes are even higher, as there's rarely time for deep due diligence. Trust is extended quickly and often informally — risky in a pseudonymous, global environment. More HR tooling or AI detection won't solve this. What's needed is a stronger foundation for trust itself.

Consider a hiring manager trying to verify work history, social handles or onchain contributions. 

Today, decentralized identity (DID) systems help you prove that you're a real human — that you exist and are not a bot. That's useful, but it's only the start.

What they don't address is the deeper layer: What have you actually done? There's a new frontier emerging — one where your professional history, credentials and contributions can be verified and made portable. It's not just about checking a box to prove that you exist. It's about codifying your experience so your reputation is built on what you've done, not just what you say.

Related: Blockchain needs regulation, scalability to close AI hiring gap

In this model, your resume becomes a programmable asset. It is not a static PDF but something that can evolve, be queried and, in some cases, be privately verified without revealing every detail. That's where tools like zero-knowledge proofs come in, giving users control over how much they reveal and to whom.

Some might argue that this all feels a little too invasive. In practice, however, and especially in Web3, most serious contributors already operate through pseudonymous identities built on provable actions, not job titles. DIDs got us to “real humans.” Verifiable reputation gets us to “real contributors.” And that's the fundamental shift worth paying attention to.

As reputation becomes programmable, entire industries stand to be reshaped. Grants, hiring rounds and even token sales could use provable credentials as filters. No more guessing who's qualified or compliant. You can't fake a pull request merged into a core repo or pretend you completed a course linked to a non-fungible token (NFT) issued by a smart contract.

This makes trust composable — something that can be built into protocols and platforms by default. What's provable today includes contributions, learning history and verifiable credentials. Soon, entire work histories could be onchain.

The AI-generated job application is just a symptom of a larger trust breakdown. We've long accepted unverifiable self-reporting as the default in hiring, and now we're facing the consequences. Blockchain-based identity and credential systems offer a path forward — where individuals can prove their work and hiring decisions can be based on verifiable data, not guesswork.

We need to stop pretending that polished language equals proof of skill. If hiring — and broader reputation systems — are to survive the coming AI wave, we need to rebuild the foundation of trust. Onchain credentials are a compelling place to start.

The crypto industry is full of flamboyant players who monopolize attention. But some build in the shadows of the spotlight, patiently, before bursting onto the scene. Stripe belongs to this category. Long present in the world of digital payments, the company is no stranger to betting on disruption. With Tempo, a blockchain designed for stablecoins, Stripe and its partner Paradigm are reshaping the future of global transactions.

When Solana went after e-commerce, Stripe joined the crypto adventure. A surprise considering that Patrick Collison had long expressed his skepticism. On Hacker News, the CEO of Stripe explained: ” There are many crypto skeptics on HN (and we ourselves have been disappointed by the utility of crypto payments for much of the past decade). So it might be interesting to share what made us change our minds over the past years: we began to notice that many real businesses found utility in stablecoins“. 

This shift is not theoretical. Stripe acquired Bridge in 2024, and since then, major clients have launched projects. SpaceX uses it to manage flows in hard-to-reach areas. The Latin American fintech DolarApp relies on it to offer banking services. And an Argentine bike importer pays its suppliers via the Stripe dashboard. 

Collison insists: 

It is important to emphasize that none of these companies use crypto because it is crypto or for any speculative benefit. They conduct real financial business and have found that crypto (via stablecoins) is simpler, faster, and better than the status quo. 

Stripe and Paradigm don't want to just participate: they want to build the infrastructure. Tempo is a blockchain designed to operate behind the scenes, like SWIFT or ACH. Collison even described it as a ” decentralized SWIFT at internet scale“. The analogy is not perfect, but it illustrates the ambition.

The technical features are impressive: 100,000 transactions per second, finality in less than a second, EVM compatibility via Reth. Fees are payable directly in stablecoins, with no native token. Tempo also offers optional privacy, a dedicated “payment lane” with memos and access lists.

Stripe has gathered a lineup of partners that lend credibility to the project: Visa, Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank, Nubank, Revolut, Shopify, OpenAI, and Anthropic. 

The vision is clear: enable payments, remittances, tokenized deposits, and microtransactions to go on-chain, without imposing blockchain complexity on end users. For many, this is a serious attempt to transform stablecoins into global payment rails.

The launch of Tempo was not unanimous. Some praise it as an ambitious project, others denounce it as one blockchain too many. Joe Petrich, engineer at Courtyard, reacted bluntly: 

No one wants another blockchain. The problems you mention are already solved for those determined to use blockchains, so there is no need for a new chain that claims to “fix” these problems. 

Technical criticisms also emerged. Helius Labs stated that Collison was mistaken about Solana's capabilities, calling his analysis “wrong on several dimensions”.

Others, like Devansh Mehta from the Ethereum Foundation, wonder why Tempo was not built as a Layer 2. According to him, an L2 would have allowed benefiting from the security and interoperability of Ethereum.

Stripe defends its choice: its volumes already exceed 10,000 transactions per second at peak activity. For Collison, no current blockchain is calibrated for this scale. Tempo would thus be the necessary tool for the crypto payments world to shift into a new dimension.

Last May, Patrick Collison said that banks are very interested in stablecoins. Four months later, Stripe appears as one of the most committed players in their adoption. With Tempo, the company is not just following the trend: it is trying to shape it, placing stablecoins at the heart of a future global payment system.

With lawmakers back in session, one of the most divisive questions in U.S. finance has returned to center stage: should America issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC)?

Opponents argue that a retail CBDC could erode civil liberties. Representative Tom Emmer has warned such a system might give Washington direct oversight of citizens' spending habits. His Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act – already passed in the House – seeks to prevent what he calls “programmable money” without cash-like privacy protections.

Policy voices counter that the debate often ignores key realities. Sheila Warren of the Project Liberty Institute notes that the Federal Reserve cannot launch a CBDC without congressional approval, and any privacy features would be determined by design choices, not by default. She believes much of the rhetoric reflects politics rather than genuine technological risk.

Other regions are not waiting. China's e-CNY is already in circulation, while Europe and India are piloting their own versions. The U.S., by contrast, has made little progress. Warren suggests wholesale CBDCs, which settle payments between banks, may hold some potential domestically, but she remains skeptical of a retail digital dollar ever launching.

Part of the reason urgency is fading is the booming role of stablecoins. The recently passed GENIUS Act gave dollar-backed tokens a clear regulatory framework, effectively legitimizing their place in the financial system. Warren calls them the “jet fuel” of the digital economy, driving payments and settlement without requiring a government-built alternative.

Ironically, while lawmakers warn about future state overreach, data collection by private corporations is already pervasive. From AI firms to automakers selling driver information, Warren argues the real privacy risks are present today — long before any digital dollar enters circulation.

ECB advisor warns euro stablecoins face strategic risk amidst rising dollar dominance

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

The following is a guest post and opinion of Eneko Knörr, CEO and Co-Founder of Stabolut.

Months ago, in an op-ed for CryptoSlate, I warned that the EU's flagship crypto regulation, MiCA, would achieve the opposite of its goals. I argued it would strangle euro innovation while cementing the US dollar's dominance for a new generation.

At the time, some thought this was alarmist. Today, with grim validation, the same concerns are being echoed from within the European Central Bank itself. In a recent blog post, also highlighted by the Financial Times, ECB advisor Jürgen Schaaf described the state of the euro-denominated stablecoin market as “dismal” and warned that Europe risks being “steamrollered” by dollar-based competitors.

This warning comes at a critical time. In the traditional global economy, non-USD currencies are the lifeblood of commerce. They account for 73% of global GDP, 53% of SWIFT transactions, and 42% of central bank reserves. Yet, in the burgeoning digital economy, these same currencies are nearly invisible. The world's second most important currency, the euro, has been reduced to a digital rounding error.

The data reveals a startling disconnect. While privately issued, dollar-denominated stablecoins command a market capitalization approaching $300 billion, their euro-denominated counterparts struggle to reach $450 million, according to data from CoinGecko. That's a market share of just 0.15%.

This isn't a gap; it's a chasm. It means that for every €1 of value transacted on a blockchain, there are nearly €700 in US dollars. This dollarization of the digital world presents a profound strategic risk to Europe's monetary sovereignty and economic competitiveness.

The EU's landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation was intended to create clarity, but in its ambition to control risk, it has inadvertently built a cage. While its framework for E-Money Tokens (EMTs) provides a path to regulation, it contains a poison pill for any euro stablecoin with global ambitions.

The single biggest limitation is the €200 million cap on daily transactions for any EMT deemed “significant,” as detailed in the official MiCA text. This isn't an accident or a simple oversight; it's a feature designed to ensure no private euro stablecoin can ever truly succeed.

For context, the leading dollar stablecoin, Tether (USDT), regularly processes over $50 billion in daily volume. A €200 million cap isn't a safety measure; it's a declaration of non-ambition that makes it mathematically impossible for a euro stablecoin to function at the scale required for international trade or decentralized finance.

The motivation seems clear: policymakers are intentionally sabotaging the private sector to clear the field for their own project—the Digital Euro.

By stifling private innovation, the EU is placing all its bets on a state-controlled Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This is not only a slow, centralized answer to a fast-moving, decentralized market, but it also poses a fundamental threat to the privacy of European citizens.

Physical cash offers anonymity. A transaction with a €5 note is private, peer-to-peer, and leaves no data trail. A CBDC is the opposite. It would move all transactions onto a centralized digital ledger, creating a system of granular surveillance. It gives the state the potential power to monitor, track, and even control how every citizen uses their own money. Building the euro's future on this foundation means swapping the freedom of the wallet for a transparent digital piggy bank—a trade-off most citizens would rightly refuse.

While Brussels focuses on building its walled garden, other major economic powers have recognized the strategic importance of privately issued stablecoins. They see them not as a threat but as a vital tool for projecting monetary influence in the digital age.

Even China is reportedly exploring the role a CNY-backed stablecoin could play in internationalizing the yuan. In Japan, regulators have already passed a landmark stablecoin bill, creating clear pathways for the issuance of yen-backed stablecoins. These nations understand that the digital currency war will be won by empowering private innovation, not by centralizing control. Europe's current path makes it a spectator in a race it should be leading.

If the euro is to compete, Brussels must execute a radical policy U-turn. The goal shouldn't be to contain stablecoins but to make the EU the premier global hub for issuing them. This requires a clear-eyed strategy that recognizes private innovation will always outpace centralized solutions.

Here is a playbook for how Europe can win:

The choice is stark: Europe can continue down its path of self-imposed digital irrelevance, or it can unleash its innovators to build the future of finance. Right now, that future is being built almost entirely with American digital dollars, and time is running out to change that.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Crypto Payroll's Bumpy Road Ahead","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/future-of-crypto-payroll-navigating-risks-and-opportunities","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 07:47:47 GMT","

With the advent of digital currencies, the integration of cryptocurrencies into payroll systems is slowly gaining traction among startups. But let me tell you, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. As businesses dip their toes into altcoins like Fetch.ai (FET), they're wading through a sea of risks—from market volatility to regulatory compliance. So, let's break down the current landscape of crypto payroll solutions and see how startups can make the most of them while dodging potential pitfalls.

The cryptocurrency market is a wild beast, with altcoins swinging in value more wildly than Bitcoin or Ethereum. This isn't just a casual rollercoaster ride; it's a full-blown theme park of risks. First off, altcoins rely on intricate blockchain technology, which can go haywire. We're talking outages, congested networks, and smart contract bugs. And don't even get me started on oracles or bridges. These hiccups can disrupt services and lead to financial losses that are pretty much irreversible thanks to the immutable nature of blockchain.

Then we've got the regulatory and compliance risks. Sure, places like the UAE have their act together with regulations, but the unregulated P2P and OTC markets are still thriving. This little detail can throw a wrench in your plans if you're relying on altcoins without proper oversight.

And last but not least, market and liquidity risks. Altcoins like FET tend to have lower liquidity and higher volatility than the big players, which can put a strain on operations and financial stability.

But wait! It's not all doom and gloom. Crypto payroll is emerging as a viable option for startups, and there are some silver linings. For one, it's cost-effective. You can cut down on transaction fees that come with traditional banking, especially if you're making international payments. This is a boon for startups that are playing in the global sandbox.

Then there's the instant stablecoin payments. They help take the edge off the volatility that comes with cryptocurrencies, giving employees a more stable income.

And let's not forget the flexibility. Crypto payroll allows employees to get paid in digital currencies, which is perfect for the growing number of tech-savvy workers who would rather be paid in crypto.

Now, with FET's bullish trend showing a cautious optimism, we might see some moderate price growth through late 2025. But let's not forget that this mixed outlook can be a double-edged sword. While interest in crypto banking solutions might hang on, it heavily depends on how regulatory frameworks and the broader crypto market play out.

As we move forward, startups that want to dive into this trend will need to be strategic, especially in a market as volatile as this. Diversification and risk management will be key, while partnerships and aggressive marketing can help gain traction.

While the future of crypto payroll looks promising, it's fraught with challenges. If startups can navigate these risks, they may just find a goldmine waiting for them in the digital currency revolution.

The launch of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) in 2025 is not just a bureaucratic development; it is a turning point. 

The story of Pakistan's economy has always been intertwined with its struggle for stability, growth, and adaptation to global trends. For decades, the rupee has served as the primary anchor of financial identity, but it has also been a silent witness to persistent inflation, currency depreciation, and widening fiscal deficits. As the world steps into the digital age, Pakistan is now confronted with a historic opportunity: the integration of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies into its financial system. What once seemed like a distant innovation is now shaping itself as a potential lifeline.

The launch of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) in 2025 is not just a bureaucratic development; it is a turning point. Backed by the government, with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb at the helm and guided by the expertise of Bilal Bin Saqib and international figures like Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, Pakistan has signaled that it is no longer a passive observer of the digital revolution. Instead, it aims to position itself as a competitor in the global blockchain economy. The numbers alone reflect the urgency—over 40 million Pakistanis are estimated to hold cryptocurrency, while annual crypto trading volumes have surpassed $300 billion. This silent revolution has already taken place among citizens; the task now is for the state to harness it.

In this direction, a significant breakthrough came when the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) held its first meeting and announced the formal end of the State Bank's 2018 ban on cryptocurrencies. This decision has removed a major hurdle for the industry, signaling to investors and innovators that Pakistan is finally ready to move towards a regulated digital asset ecosystem.

“If the 20th century belonged to oil, the 21st century belongs to data and digital value.” This idea echoes in the global transformation we see around us. For Pakistan, where remittances form the backbone of the economy, blockchain-based financial channels can reduce costs, increase transparency, and ensure efficiency. Today, migrant workers often lose 6–8% of their hard-earned remittances to transaction fees when sending money home. Blockchain promises to cut this down to almost negligible amounts, potentially adding billions of dollars annually into the hands of Pakistani households.

The adoption of blockchain also means more than just cheaper transactions. It offers Pakistan an escape from the recurring cycle of IMF bailouts and dependency on foreign reserves. By legalizing and regulating digital assets, the country can open new avenues of foreign investment. Crypto startups, blockchain-based supply chain monitoring, decentralized finance (DeFi), and tokenized microloans for small businesses can create jobs for the youth bulge that currently struggles with unemployment. As Bilal Bin Saqib noted, blockchain is not merely an alternative currency; it is a “parallel economy waiting to be unlocked.”

Still, critics are not wrong to raise alarms. Cryptocurrencies, despite their promise, remain deeply volatile—prices swing wildly, fortunes are made and lost overnight, and the absence of intrinsic value makes many digital tokens look more like speculative assets than stable currencies. For a fragile economy like Pakistan's, overreliance on such an unpredictable market could bring as much risk as opportunity. The recent collapses of global exchanges and scams in the crypto space also serve as reminders that unchecked enthusiasm can easily turn into disaster. Pakistan's challenge is to embrace the technology without being blinded by the hype.

Skeptics argue that cryptocurrencies are too volatile to be trusted. Their concern is valid, but volatility can be managed through a state-backed digital currency or central bank digital currency (CBDC). Countries like China and Nigeria have already moved ahead in this regard. For Pakistan, introducing a digital rupee backed by blockchain can reduce black-market transactions, widen the tax net, and build public trust in formal institutions. It could also reduce corruption by creating immutable, transparent records of transactions.

Beyond currency, blockchain can redefine governance. Imagine a land registry system where ownership records cannot be manipulated, or a public procurement system where contracts are executed automatically through smart contracts, eliminating the middleman. These are not abstract theories; these are practical solutions to Pakistan's age-old governance challenges.

The youth, who make up 64% of Pakistan's population, are already adapting. Thousands of freelancers and IT professionals are earning through blockchain-related projects, while universities are beginning to include blockchain courses in their curriculum. If guided with proper regulation, this demographic can turn Pakistan into a regional hub for blockchain innovation. “A nation that misses the technological wave of its time risks being left behind for generations.” Pakistan must heed this warning.

Of course, challenges remain. The shadow of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) looms large, and ensuring that blockchain does not become a tool for money laundering or terror financing is essential. But outright bans, like the one attempted in the past, only push the industry underground. Instead, a smart regulatory framework—aligned with international standards—can both protect Pakistan and allow innovation to flourish.

The way forward is clear. Pakistan must invest in digital literacy, partner with global crypto leaders, and incentivize local entrepreneurs to develop blockchain-based solutions. Tax policies must be restructured to support rather than punish innovation. Above all, trust between state and society must be rebuilt through transparent practices that blockchain itself enables.

“The rupee may define our past, but blockchain can define our future.” For a country often trapped between crisis and survival, this is not just an option—it is a necessity. If Pakistan embraces this wave with foresight, discipline, and innovation—while remaining cautious of its risks—blockchain could indeed become the game changer that transforms the rupee economy into a digital powerhouse.

ByMax (Chong) Li,

Contributor.

In 2025, two of the most transformative technological forces—artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency—are converging. AI is rapidly reshaping the way humans live, work, and interact with technology. Crypto, meanwhile, has matured from a speculative experiment into a robust infrastructure for trust, payments, and decentralized coordination. The most exciting opportunity ahead lies at their intersection: using crypto to unlock and secure the world's AI data, currently the bottleneck of AI development. 

The AI development has always rested on three core pillars: compute power, algorithms, and data. Each plays a distinct role in the development of intelligent systems, but only one remains genuinely open for community-driven innovation.

Computing has become the domain of industry giants. NVIDIA, with its near monopoly on GPUs, dominates the hardware layer. While startups occasionally push boundaries with optimization techniques—squeezing more efficiency out of existing silicon—barriers to entry are overwhelmingly high. Competing directly in the chip business is unrealistic for most companies.

Algorithms, specifically the design of large language models (LLMs), are also controlled by tech behemoths like Google, OpenAI, and Meta. These firms pour billions of dollars into research and engineering talent, making it nearly impossible for smaller players to compete head-on. Iterating on new architectures or scaling models to trillion-parameter size is simply out of reach for early-stage ventures.

Data, however, tells a different story. Despite its centrality to AI development, no single company has managed to monopolize the space. Public internet data has already been scraped, filtered, and fed into today's leading AI models. The next wave of breakthroughs will depend on specialized, high-quality, domain-specific datasets. Consider agriculture AI: training a robust AI model to detect early signs of crop disease requires tens of thousands of labeled images of greenhouse tomatoes with specific infestations. Even Google would struggle to source such niche, real-world data at scale and speed.

That bottleneck is where crypto can make a transformative impact.

The growing demand and competition for AI data are already evident. Scale AI, a data labeling and annotation platform, was recently acquired for over $14 billion. This acquisition highlights the intensity of competition in the AI data sector—and the recognition that whoever controls access to high-quality datasets will control the future of AI itself.

But unlike chips or algorithms, the long tail of data is not naturally centralized. Millions of individuals and organizations across the globe hold valuable fragments of the world's knowledge. From farmers with smartphone cameras to doctors with anonymized medical records, the capacity to generate AI-ready data is widely distributed. The challenge is building infrastructure that can rapidly coordinate and reward this global community of contributors.

That is where crypto and blockchain step in.

To create a scalable AI data marketplace, two problems must be solved simultaneously: payments and trust.

1. Payments:
 Collecting data globally means working with data contributors from diverse countries, many of which lack robust financial infrastructure. Paying individuals in traditional fiat currencies involves friction, high fees, and in some cases, outright impossibility. Crypto solves this elegantly. With digital wallets, micro-payments can be sent instantly and cost-effectively to anyone, anywhere in the world. Data contributors no longer need bank accounts; all they need is internet access. This dramatically lowers the barrier for participation, allowing data collection platforms to tap into truly global networks.

2. Trust:
 Data is only as valuable as it is reliable. How can AI companies be confident that contributions are authentic, accurate, and free from manipulation? Blockchain technology provides the solution. By recording the provenance of each data point on a transparent ledger, platforms can verify its origin, timestamp, and submission process. Smart contracts can enforce quality checks, reputation scores, and dispute resolution mechanisms. In short, blockchain ensures that datasets are not only large but also trustworthy.

Together, these two features—crypto payments and blockchain verification—create the foundation for a decentralized AI data ecosystem.

Imagine a platform where a researcher in Kenya can be paid instantly in tokens for uploading annotated images of local agriculture pests, or where a medical student in Brazil contributes anonymized X-rays and earns rewards tied to the verified quality of her submissions. These contributors would be part of a global data supply chain, coordinated not by a central corporation, but by cryptographic protocols and community governance.

Such platforms could evolve into “data launchpads,” enabling any AI project to issue tasks, collect targeted datasets, and distribute rewards. By leveraging the social and financial dynamics of crypto, these ecosystems would grow virally—attracting both contributors seeking income and companies seeking scarce data. Over time, the most active platforms could resemble the TikTok of data: vibrant, participatory, and indispensable to the AI economy.

The marriage of crypto and AI data also has geopolitical significance. AI dominance is increasingly viewed as a national security priority, with countries competing to secure access to computing power and talent. Data, however, is inherently tied to geography and culture. A truly global, decentralized approach to data collection can prevent monopolization by a handful of nations or corporations.

By democratizing access and rewards, crypto-enabled platforms can ensure that individuals worldwide benefit from—and contribute to—the AI revolution. This inclusivity not only accelerates innovation but also helps avoid the risks of bias and narrow representation in AI systems trained on limited datasets.

Over the next decade, as AI permeates every aspect of human life, the demand for fresh, specialized, and verifiable data will only intensify. Startups that successfully harness crypto to incentivize and secure this data will occupy a strategic position at the heart of the AI economy.

While crypto has endured cycles of hype and disillusionment, its actual utility may finally find its most potent expression in AI data markets. By resolving the payment and trust issues that have long hindered global coordination, crypto can unlock the datasets that AI desperately needs to continue advancing.

For investors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers, the message is clear: the next frontier of crypto innovation will not be in speculative trading or meme coins, but in powering the invisible fuel of the AI age—data.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin's illiquid supply—the portion of coins held by entities with little history of spending—has climbed to a new record high, surpassing 14.3 million BTC in late August, according to Glassnode. 

With 19.9 million BTC currently in circulation, around 72% of the total supply is now illiquid, held by entities such as long-term holders and cold storage investors. This growth highlights a sustained accumulation trend, even during recent market volatility.

In mid-August, bitcoin hit an all-time high of $124,000 before retreating roughly 15%. Despite the price pullback, the illiquid supply continued to rise, showing that holders remain undeterred by short-term corrections. 

Over the past 30 days alone, the net change in illiquid supply has increased by 20,000 BTC, underscoring persistent investor conviction.

The ongoing increase in this category suggests tightening supply dynamics that could set the stage for renewed momentum once sentiment recovers. For now, the trend reflects growing confidence in bitcoin as a long-term store of value.

 Michael Saylor's net worth has jumped almost 16% since the beginning of the year, as Strategy's stock price climbed 12% over the same period. 

Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has seen his net worth soar by $1 billion since the start of the year, coinciding with his debut on the Bloomberg Billionaire 500 Index.

Saylor ranks 491st on the Bloomberg Billionaire Index with an estimated net worth of $7.37 billion, up 15.80% since Jan. 1. Over the same period, shares of his company, Strategy (MSTR), have gained nearly 12%, as per Google Finance.

According to the Index, which tracks the world's richest 500 people based on their net worth, approximately $650 million of Saylor's fortune is in cash, while the remaining $6.72 billion is tied up in Strategy equity. 

Saylor joins other crypto billionaires on Bloomberg's list, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who is ranked 234th with a net worth of $12.8 billion, and Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, holding the 40th spot with $44.5 billion.

Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was also on the list before the crypto exchange collapsed in November 2022.

Strategy is best known for its aggressive Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation strategy. The firm currently holds approximately 659,739 BTC, worth $72.9 billion at the time of publication, or about 3.42% of Bitcoin's circulating supply, according to StrategyTracker.

However, Strategy insists its significant Bitcoin buying doesn't sway the market. “The way we buy Bitcoin is we do not move the price of the Bitcoin,” Strategy's corporate treasurer and head of investor relations, Shirish Jajodia, recently said.

On Friday, Strategy stock closed the day 2.53% higher, though it remains down 12.4% over the past 30 days.

It comes as Strategy was left out of the S&P 500 in August — a disappointment for some market participants who had expected the Bitcoin-accumulation company to make the cut.

On Friday, Cointelegraph reported that despite the company meeting all the requirements and already being included in the Nasdaq 100, it may still be denied inclusion if the committee tasked with evaluating companies rules against adding it after taking a “holistic” view of the prospective candidate.

 Crypto traders are weighing which major asset might lead the next upward move as risk appetite cools, according to Santiment. 

Crypto market sentiment has slipped into Fear, with signs showing that investors are temporarily stepping back from moving further down the risk curve, according to sentiment sources.

“It's clear traders are less interested in obscure altcoins and are instead debating which major asset will break out next,” sentiment platform Santiment said in a report on Saturday. 

Santiment said that the crypto market is increasingly focused on larger-cap crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and XRP (XRP). “A heavy focus on large-caps can indicate a more cautious or ‘risk-off' sentiment among traders,” Santiment said.

It comes amid growing calls from traders for an altcoin season. However, Bitfinex analysts recently said it may not arrive until more crypto ETFs potentially launch later this year.

Meanwhile, on Sunday, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures overall crypto market sentiment, posted a “Fear” score of 44, after posting “Neutral” readings over the previous two days.

Some traders are also questioning the near-term direction of major cap assets. On Saturday, crypto trader Daan Crypto Traders said that Bitcoin's price “remains undecisive [sic].”

“My base case scenario remains to see a sweep of the monthly lows, which should then cause some panic and fear of it losing $100K,” Daan Crypto Trades said.

Over the month, Bitcoin is down 5.38%, while Ether is up 9.44%, according to CoinMarketCap.

However, other indicators suggest that the market is still moving down the risk curve.

On Sunday, CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index posted an “Altcoin Season” score of 56 out of 100. The indicator tips between Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season based on how the top 100 altcoins have performed against Bitcoin over the past 90 days.

Crypto trader Rekt Fencer said, “This is the final shakeout for altcoins.” 

Meanwhile, MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe said that altcoins are “extremely undervalued.”

“The cycle has proven that this cycle is completely different than previous cycles,” van de Poppe said.

On Friday, Bitcoin analyst PlanC echoed a similar sentiment. 

“Anyone who thinks Bitcoin has to peak in Q4 of this year does not understand statistics or probability,” the analyst said in an X post, arguing that relying on the three previous halving cycles doesn't provide enough statistically significant data.

 Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino says the firm “didn't sell any Bitcoin” and is still allocating profits into BTC, gold and land. 

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has denied recent rumors that the stablecoin issuer is offloading its Bitcoin holdings to buy gold. 

In a Sunday post on X, Ardoino said the company “didn't sell any Bitcoin,” and reaffirmed its strategy of allocating profits into assets like “Bitcoin, gold, and land.”

The comments came in response to speculation from YouTuber Clive Thompson, who cited Tether's Q1 and Q2 2025 attestation data from BDO to claim the firm had reduced its Bitcoin (BTC) position. Thompson pointed to a drop from 92,650 BTC in Q1 to 83,274 BTC in Q2 as evidence of a sell-off.

However, Jan3 CEO Samson Mow debunked the claim, noting that Tether transferred 19,800 BTC to a separate initiative called Twenty One Capital (XXI) during the same period. That included 14,000 BTC sent in June and another 5,800 BTC in July.

In early June, Tether moved over 37,000 BTC, worth approximately $3.9 billion, across numerous transactions to support XXI, a Bitcoin-native financial platform led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers. 

“Tether would have had 4,624 BTC more than at the end of Q1 if the transfer is accounted for,” Mow explained, adding that the firm actually increased its net holdings.

Ardoino echoed the explanation, saying the Bitcoin was moved, not sold. “While the world continues to get darker, Tether will continue to invest part of its profits into safe assets,” he wrote.

Tether, the issuer of the USDt (USDT) stablecoin, holds over 100,521 BTC, worth around $11.17 billion, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET.

Tether's Bitcoin sell-off rumors came as El Salvador revealed it has added 13,999 troy ounces of gold worth $50 million to its foreign reserves, marking its first gold acquisition since 1990. The central bank said the move is part of a diversification strategy to reduce reliance on the US dollar.

Before turning to gold, El Salvador built a $700 million Bitcoin reserve, holding 6,292 BTC. However, an International Monetary Fund report in July claimed that the Central American country has not made any new Bitcoin purchases since February.

 Bitcoin retesting $100,000 would match previous BTC price dips since the end of 2024, Fibonacci retracement analysis shows. 

Key points:

Bitcoin sees a modest rebound into the weekly candle close, but traders see key resistance overhead.

BTC price action risks a much deeper drop if bulls fail to reclaim that resistance zone.

Fibonacci analysis hints that such a drop may not pass more than 10%.

Bitcoin (BTC) returned above $111,000 into Sunday's weekly close as analysis saw “promising” recovery signs.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD gaining about 1% on the day to hit local highs of $111,369.

The pair's latest dip, which followed US macroeconomic data, saw bulls preserve $110,000 support.

“This is actually promising on $BTC,” crypto trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe responded on X.

Market participants continued to hold diverging views over short-term BTC price action. Popular trader Cipher X suggested that $112,000 could spark new lows should bulls fail to reclaim it next.

“We either flip $113,000 and pump to new highs, or if we reject here we drop to $100,000,” fellow trader Crypto Tony added on the day, adopting a more categorical perspective based on the weekly chart.

Trader TurboBullCapital referenced the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs) at $115,035 and $101,760, respectively, as important levels to watch going forward.

“Lose the $107k area & the downside target becomes the $101k level which also happens to coincide with the MA200,” part of an X post concluded. 

As Cointelegraph reported, one theory on longer timeframes involves market makers on exchange order books.

Short sellers and bears, it suggests, could be the victims of manipulation prior to a giant short squeeze event taking the market to new all-time highs. This would echo price action in late 2024.

In the meantime, Fibonacci retracement levels imply a maximum drop of 10%, again based on historical behavior since the end of last year.

“$BTC usually bottoms at 0.382 Fibonacci level. This happened in Q3 2024, Q2 2025 and will probably happen again,” popular trader ZYN observed.

People Want AI To Help Artists, Not Be The Artist

We surveyed people in the U.S. about artificial-intelligence-generated art. Their answers told us a lot about how we value human creativity

By Deni Ellis Béchard & Gabriel Kreiman 

Eva Bee/Science Source

Think of your favorite piece of art—a painting, a song, a novel, a movie or even a video game—and try to remember why it made such a strong impression on you. Was it the color, the cadence of notes, the way the writer made you feel understood, the deep emotion of the actors?

Now imagine that artificial intelligence created it.

The question might seem flippant, yet this is the future toward which we are racing. Over the past few years, AI developers have improved the technology's ability to create art across nearly every field: not just writing, digital art, photos and videos but also three-dimensional models, dance choreography and architectural designs. With AI so rapidly learning to produce art forms previously considered the exclusive domain of human ingenuity, we thought it important to understand how people view this transformation.

We each approached this question from different backgrounds. One of us (Béchard) is a journalist and fiction writer who has been publishing novels for 20 years, and the other (Kreiman) is a professor at Harvard Medical School who researches the intersection between biological and artificial systems. Earlier this year we conducted a survey on AI art using Prolific, an online platform that pays people to participate in research. The only restriction we placed was that the respondents reside in the U.S. We enrolled 150 people. What we found has not yet been published or peer-reviewed.

The results were striking. The majority of people who participated disliked the idea of AI-generated art and held the view that human art has an emotional depth that machines either can't or shouldn't reproduce. Yet they were open to AI-generated art so long as there was an artist involved, heavily guiding and prompting their chosen platform. At a moment when we face a deluge of AI-generated content, we believe that AI companies should heed these data and focus on what people value—rather than create systems that generate large volumes of art, they should design better tools to give people the power to convey their unique artistic visions. In doing this, their platforms could make creative expression more accessible and egalitarian in a world where creating art comes with barriers for many people. In this way, AI could emerge as another path for human expression.

We first asked people to name their favorite work of art. Answers included J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, J.R.R. Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring, Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night and Gustav Klimt's The Kiss, as well as the musical Hamilton, the TV shows Gilmore Girls, Twin Peaks and Game of Thrones, and music by the Beatles, Metallica and Cat Stevens. Then we asked how they would feel upon learning that their favorite work of art was generated by AI with no humans involved, not even real actors in films. Responses ranged from outrage to enthusiasm. More than 62 percent said they would like the art less, 32 percent said that their feelings wouldn't change, and nearly 5 percent said that they would like it more.

In comments, a devotee of Good Will Hunting expressed horror, calling the movie “a masterpiece of the human experience” that “no AI could ever come close to replicating.” Many bluntly declared that AI art isn't “real,” that it is manipulative, inauthentic and, of course, artificial. Then there were the pragmatists, who shrugged and argued that if the artwork touches your soul, why fuss about the creator—or lack thereof? One respondent even welcomed the idea of AI-generated TV, envisioning the dream scenario for an insatiable binge-watcher: endless episodes churned out by algorithms.

The reactions, however, went deeper. When asked if there is a difference between the emotional value of human and AI art, 81 percent said yes, reminding us that we seek the human experience in art. We want to know if an artist drew from personal experience or imagination. We pause while reading a book to learn about its author, and we follow the lives of singers and actors. Art, after all, is a way humans communicate. To wit: art “is the most universal and freest form of communication,” philosopher John Dewey said in his book Art as Experience; “You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read,” civil rights activist James Baldwin told Life magazine in a 1963 interview.

But if great art is forged from human hope, desire, disappointment and sorrow, what does creativity mean in a world with increasingly powerful AI? Are people who use AI, versus paint, film or even a word processor, artists? We asked this. Thirteen percent said yes, another 13 percent were unsure, and 31 percent said no, whereas 42 percent selected “yes, but only if they are providing significant guidance to the AI; otherwise, no.” These responses shed light on why so many people, in person and online, complain about AI-generated “slop.” What participants are often pointing out is the impersonal, almost meaningless nature of AI: the online posts hyping an idea in generic language, the onslaught of images that say little about the person posting them beyond their ability to write a short prompt and hit send. But many of the respondents in our survey appeared more open to the idea of people using AI as a tool—an electronic quill or paintbrush—to help bring their artistic vision into the world.

This is important.

Art is not accessible to everyone. Many people with ideas for films or music or stories may never have the resources to create them—the lyricist who wants to put music to words, the scriptwriter who craves to see their lines spoken on a screen. Art supplies and studio space are expensive, and people can be limited by geography, finances, physical disability or industry gatekeepers. Darren Aronofsky, award-winning director of Black Swan, founded the AI film studio Primordial Soup to lower barriers for emerging storytellers and to develop scripts that remain unproduced because of high costs and technical limitations. Increasingly, though, consumer AI systems are becoming so powerful that people can create films with them on their phone or desktop.

In the few years that commercial AI, such ChatGPT and Midjourney, have been available, certain ideas about AI art may have been normalized. When asked which kinds of art AI could acceptably create, more than one third of respondents listed digital art, which was closely followed by poetry and fiction. It's no coincidence that early commercial AI systems could rapidly generate these types of content, and it's likely this is what our participants are most familiar with. The observation that mass production decreases value (both perceived and actual) isn't new. In the 1899 book The Theory of the Leisure Class, economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen wrote, “The marks of hand labor come to be honorific, and the goods which exhibit these marks take rank as of higher grade than the corresponding machine product.” We also tend to appreciate tasks that are challenging—to place more value on a film that required years to create or even simply on handmade clothes. “Effort is used as a heuristic for quality,” wrote social psychologist Justin Kruger and his colleagues in a 2004 study. We believe that digital art, poetry or fiction, rather than having lost their value, require a clearer connection to the author's story for people to be willing to trust them.

By contrast, the types of AI art that respondents rated as least acceptable were podcasts, TV shows and movies—art forms that AI still struggles to convincingly emulate. In recent years podcasts have soared in popularity and clearly embody the urge to communicate. Recent surveys have even found that many people prefer watching podcasts so that they can see the speakers' facial expressions and gestures. Research on the new creative economy shows that the strongest driver for podcasting success is a clear personality with which the audience can connect. Whether these trends are in response to the recent deluge of impersonal media, we can't say, but they tell us that even if artists choose to embrace AI, they should consider doing so as a means to more clearly convey the uniqueness of their vision. Still, creators must keep in mind copyright violations when human art is used to train systems and whether the AI tools they use will generate content such as deepfakes that inflict harm on people. People should invest in platforms that build safeguards and set ethical standards, such as the video-generation platform Moonvalley, which trains its model using only licensed data.

In the near future, as AI conquers more artistic domains and creates entire films or video podcasts indistinguishable from those made by and with humans, what people find acceptable may shift. But we do know that people still value art as a means of communication and connection, and taking the pulse of what society thinks about AI art can help align AI developers not only with artists but with the millions of people who find meaning and connection in art.

These Ants Are Different Species but Share a Mother

Ant queens of one species are sexual parasites that clone ants of another species to create hybrid workers that do their bidding

By Max Kozlov & Nature magazine 

Queen Iberian harvester ants (Messor ibericus) can give birth to ants of their own species (left) and, using a cloning trick, offspring of a different one (Messor structor, right).

A common type of ant in Europe breaks a fundamental rule in biology: its queens can produce male offspring that are a whole different species. These queen Iberian harvester ants (Messor ibericus) are sexual parasites that rely on the sperm of males of the ant species Messor structor. They use this sperm to breed an army of robust worker ants, which are hybrids of the two species.

Data now show that, in the absence of nearby M. structor colonies, M. ibericus queens can clone male M. structor ants by laying eggs that contain only M. structor DNA in their nuclei. The findings were published in Nature on 3 September.

“It's an absolutely fantastic, bizarre story of a system that allows things to happen that seem almost unimaginable,” says Jacobus Boomsma, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen.

Iberian harvester ants co-exist with M. structor in some parts of Europe, which has historically given M. ibericus queens an abundant supply of M. structor males to mate with.

But evolutionary biologist Jonathan Romiguier at the Institute of Evolutionary Science of Montpellier in France and his colleagues noticed something strange on the Italian island of Sicily: they found Iberian harvester ants everywhere but not a single colony of M. structor.

When the researchers peered inside colonies of the Iberian harvester ant, they found two types of ant that looked very different. Genetic analyses confirmed that the colonies contained both M. ibericus and M. structor, despite the lack of M. structor populations on the island.

Further analyses solved the mystery: Iberian harvester queens clone M. structor ants to maintain a supply of their sperm. They then mate with those M. structor ants to produce hybrid workers that take care of the colony, including by building the nest and foraging for food. In effect, M. ibericus has domesticated M. structor and its genome, Romiguier says.

The two species diverged more than five million years ago, so it's wild to see one species producing the other, Romiguier adds. “That's almost how long ago humans and chimpanzees diverged.”

Intriguingly, when the researchers put the M. structor ants cloned by the Iberian harvester ants into a regular M. structor colony, the insects were killed for being foreign invaders, despite looking nearly identical to those in the colony. That's because the cloned ants carried the pheromones of their Iberian cousins, so they were treated as enemies, Romiguier says. Another way that they are different from the ants in the M. structor colony is that, although the clones have only M. structor DNA in the nuclei of their cells, they carry M. ibericus DNA in their mitochondria — the cells' energy-producing units.

Romiguier says that this domestication of the M. structor genome resembles the beneficial partnership that led to mitochondria becoming part of the eukaryotic cell more than one billion years ago after a primitive host cell engulfed a bacterium. Today, eukaryotes — which include all animals, plants and fungi — also have two distinct genomes in their cells: one in the nucleus and one in the mitochondria. But Boomsma does not expect M. ibericus's rare sexual parasitism to be nearly as evolutionarily successful as eukaryotes' acquisition of mitochondria and spread to other organisms.

“Ants are just amazing and force us to be open-minded to allow the discovery of unorthodox mating systems,” says Claudie Doums, an evolutionary ecologist at the Practical School of Advanced Studies in Paris.

But that's absolutely the limit.

Even if you somehow manage to make it through decades of old age without a single major health issue—evading cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and so on—scientists say there's a ceiling on how long you can extend your life, throwing cold water on the ambitious Silicon Valley goal to outsmart death. 

But the thing that's keeping the human body from reaching immortality is surprisingly mundane: over time, your body loses the “physiological resilience,” or the ability to bounce back, that you once had in your younger years. That, scientists say in a study published in Nature Communications, is enough to limit our lives to 120 to 150 years at the most.  

Lead researcher Timothy Pyrkov is part of a Singapore-based biotech company called Gero (yes, the name itself is the prefix meaning “old age”). Gero's stated goal is “hacking complex diseases and aging,” setting a clear agenda for the research. For this longitudinal analysis, Gero collaborated with Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York and studied large groups of people in the U.S., U.K., and Russia.  

The team broke down all the age groups in detail, differentiating between ""early adulthood"" (16- to 35-year-olds), ""middle ages"" (35- to 65-year-olds), and ""older ages"" (older than 65). Then, they examined both changes in blood cell counts and the number of steps the groups took, treating the two factors as ""hallmarks of aging"" that could help them chart the subjects' progress (or deterioration) over several months. 

Both blood cells and steps might remain co​​nstant, the researchers found, if ​​not for periodic interruptions in the form of health setbacks. Specifically, they noticed the problem wasn't some steady decline with age, but instead, a series of step-downs in which the subjects' bodies could not return to their previous level of health. 

Let's say when you're younger, your body could normally recover 100 percent from a bad cold, or repair your skin 100 percent of the way after a bad fall. As you age, your ability to claw back to full health may be inhibited to a max of, say, 95 percent. And with more time, that resiliency will only continue to decrease as your body faces repeated obstacles. Basically, it's the opposite of gaining more health in a video game as you progress further—your stamina bar becomes smaller and smaller, even when it's full.   

By plotting the ""recovery time"" for all three age group cohorts over decades' worth of life, the researchers were able to find the point at which the body would ultimately disintegrate as a result of the loss of resiliency. Every year, for example, think of the risk of cancer as a kind of coin toss with a certain likelihood of happening. The longer you live, the more coin flips you must take. The point at which you take that last coin flip, they say, is somewhere between 120 and 150 years—a value that likely puts a hard limit on human life.

""We conclude that the criticality resulting in the end of life is an intrinsic biological property of an organism that is independent of stress factors and signifies a fundamental or absolute limit of human lifespan,"" the authors note in the paper.\

Why study those two variables? Blood cell counts, for their part, have a predictable healthy range that is dependent on your age and gender. Generally speaking, the normal range for red blood cells is between 4.5 to 5.5 million cells per cubic millimeter if you're male, and between 4 to 5 million cells per cubic millimeter if you're female, according to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. For white blood cells, the normal range is between 5,000 and 10,000 cells per cubic millimeter. For platelets, the typical range is 140,000 to 400,000 per cubic millimeter.  

Deviations from these ranges could signal some kind of disorder. A low red blood cell count, for example, could point to anemia, while a low white blood cell count could mean you have neutropenia, a disease that damages the bone barrow at puts you at increased risk for infections.

Steps taken is a far murkier variable, though, as it's somewhat subjective. The general consensus, and the recommendation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is to aim for 10,000 steps per day. Still, that's highly personal, and the number of steps that a person needs to take to achieve positive health impacts actually declines with age: A 2019 study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine showed the more steps a person took, the lower their mortality rate, but the effect leveled off after 7,500 steps per day. 

The differences between these two variables make the team's results more interesting. Peter Fedichev—one of the study's coauthors, and a cofounder of Gero—told Scientific American that despite how most biologists would see blood counts and step counts as ""pretty different,"" the sheer fact that both ""paint exactly the same future"" means the steady decline of physiological resilience is very real.

So, what does it mean to have a hard limit on human life? Without intervention in the form of body part replacements or other supplemental procedures, it means even the most zealous life-extenders can only do so much. And while 120 to 150 years may not sound super long, it's still up to nearly twice the life expectancy of people living today in the U.S. 

And considering the late Jeanne Louise Calment—who holds the record for the longest-living person—died at the age of 122 years and 164 days, it seems like they're onto something.

The buried treasure reveals the financial strategies behind ancient battles.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Mercenary armies weren't cheap in the Greek city of Notion during the fifth century B.C.—especially with the Persian and Athenian fighters waging a front-line battle in the area. Getting a little extra muscle in the conflict likely required having a bit of spare cash on hand, and archaeologists recently uncovered some of that loot in the form of a hoard of gold coins, which they found buried in a small pot in western Turkey. 

According to researchers led by the University of Michigan, the gold coins—which were originally discovered in 2023, but only recently okayed for publication by the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism—depict a kneeling archer. The archer was a key signature of the Persian daric, issued by the Persian Empire and potentially minted during the fifth century B.C. about 60 miles northeast of Notion in the ancient city of Sardis. 

The fact that this literal pot of gold was even found shows that an unlikely scenario befell the owner. 

“The discovery of such a valuable find in a controlled archaeological excavation is very rare,” said Christopher Ratte, professor of ancient Mediterranean art and archaeology and director of the Notion Archaeological Survey, the project that discovered the coins, in a statement. “No one ever buries a hoard of coins, especially precious metal coins, without intending to retrieve it. So only the gravest misfortune can explain the preservation of such a treasure.” 

That grave misfortune could have come in the form of the very thing that experts believe the coins were intended for: war. 

According to the Greek historian Xenophon, a single daric was equivalent to a soldier's pay for one month. Finding a hoard of the coins indicates the possibility that it may have been part of the payment to mercenary troops around Notion.

While Ratte admitted that the evidence for the mercenary theory is “circumstantial,” he believes the timing adds up. Notion—along with other Greek cities on the west coast of present-day Turkey—became part of the Persian Empire in the mid-sixth century B.C. Then, come the early fifth century B.C., it came under Greek control. That didn't last too long, however, as the early fourth century B.C. saw it  return to Persian command until the conquest of Alexander the Great in 334 B.C. 

All this back-and-forth rule made Notion the front lines of conflict, with Greek historians chronicling the use of barbarian mercenaries during Athenian vs. Persian skirmishes. It is battles like these that could have warranted an army collecting enough daric to pay for additional assistance, but any sort of defeat could have meant that the owners of the coins weren't able to retrieve them, leaving... say... a pot of coins to be found centuries later.

Of course, the mercenary idea isn't the only theory in play. As Notion was an important military harbor, the coins could have been part of payment to help build out the waterfront. If a tragedy befell the owner of the hoard, the coins would have simply remained secretly buried. 

The history of the daric started in the sixth century and lasted until Alexander the Great's control began around 330 B.C. The design of the coins remained relatively similar, with only minor stylistic differences in play. Using the new coins—and the independent dating of the coins, thanks to additional artifacts found nearby—to help highlight those style shifts should help set up a distinct timeline for the daric. 

“This hoard,” Ratte said, “will provide a firm date that can serve as an anchor to help fix the chronology of the [entire sequence of coins].”

“If it can be established accurately by other means, to allow us to fine-tune the chronology of the Achaemenid gold coinage,” said Andrew Meadows, former curator of coins at the British Museum and the American Numismatic Society and now at Oxford University, in a statement. “This is a spectacular find […] of the highest importance.”

The trial, led by Professor Robert Bals, Director of the Department of Internal Medicine V at Saarland University Medical Center and Professor of Internal Medicine at Saarland University, divided the 450 participants into two groups. The treatment group of 227 individuals used an azelastine nasal spray three times a day over a 56-day period. During that same period, the 223 participants in the control group used a placebo spray three times a day. Robert Bals summarized the key finding as follows: 'During the observation period, 2.2% of the participants in the azelastine group became infected with SARS-CoV-2; in the placebo group, it was 6.7% -- three times as many.' All infections were confirmed by PCR testing.

In addition to showing a marked reduction in coronavirus infections, the azelastine group also displayed fewer symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, a lower overall number of confirmed respiratory infections, and, unexpectedly, a reduced incidence of rhinovirus infections, another major cause of respiratory illness. In the treatment group, 1.8% developed a rhinovirus infection, compared to 6.3% in the placebo group -- a proportion similar to that seen for SARS-CoV-2.

Azelastine nasal spray has been available for decades as an over-the-counter treatment for hay fever. Previous in vitro studies on azelastine had already suggested antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. 'This clinical trial is the first to demonstrate a protective effect in a real-world setting,' says Professor Bals.

For Robert Bals, the results suggest practical applications: 'Azelastine nasal spray could provide an additional easily accessible prophylactic to complement existing protective measures, especially for vulnerable groups, during periods of high infection rates, or before travelling.' But Professor Bals also stressed the importance of further research: 'Our results highlight the need for larger, multicentre trials to continue exploring the use of azelastine nasal sprays as an on-demand preventive treatment, and to examine its potential effectiveness against other respiratory pathogens.'

Besides Professor Bals, the randomized, double-blind phase 2 study 'CONTAIN' also involved the Institute of Clinical Pharmacy (Professor Thorsten Lehr, Dr. Dominik Selzer), the Institute of Virology (Professor Sigrun Smola), and the Saarbrücken-based pharmaceutical company URSAPHARM Arzneimittel GmbH, which sponsored the study and manufactured the investigational product. The Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland (HIPS) contributed through the research groups of Professor Smola and Professor Bals. The project serves as an excellent example of successful collaboration between academic research, industry partners and public health initiatives in the Saarland region.

A small team led by Sihao Cheng, Martin A. and Helen Chooljian Member in the Institute for Advanced Study's School of Natural Sciences, has discovered an extraordinary trans-Neptunian object (TNO), named 2017 OF201, at the edge of our solar system.

The TNO is potentially large enough to qualify as a dwarf planet, the same category as the much more well-known Pluto. The new object is one of the most distant visible objects in our solar system and, significantly, suggests that the empty section of space thought to exist beyond Neptune in the Kuiper Belt is not, in fact, empty at all.

Cheng made the discovery alongside colleagues Jiaxuan Li and Eritas Yang from Princeton University, using advanced computational methods to identify the object's distinctive trajectory pattern on the sky. The new object was officially announced by the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center and in an arXiv pre-print.

Trans-Neptunian objects are minor planets that orbit the Sun at a greater average distance than the orbit of Neptune. The new TNO is special for two reasons: its extreme orbit and its large size.

""The object's aphelion -- the farthest point on the orbit from the Sun -- is more than 1600 times that of the Earth's orbit,"" explains Cheng. ""Meanwhile, its perihelion -- the closest point on its orbit to the Sun -- is 44.5 times that of the Earth's orbit, similar to Pluto's orbit.""

This extreme orbit, which takes the object approximately 25,000 years to complete, suggests a complex history of gravitational interactions. ""It must have experienced close encounters with a giant planet, causing it to be ejected to a wide orbit,"" says Yang. ""There may have been more than one step in its migration. It's possible that this object was first ejected to the Oort cloud, the most distant region in our solar system, which is home to many comets, and then sent back,"" Cheng adds.

""Many extreme TNOs have orbits that appear to cluster in specific orientations, but 2017 OF201 deviates from this,"" says Li. This clustering has been interpreted as indirect evidence for the existence of another planet in the solar system, Planet X or Planet Nine, which could be gravitationally shepherding these objects into their observed patterns. The existence of 2017 OF201 as an outlier to such clustering could potentially challenge this hypothesis.

Cheng and his colleagues estimate 2017 OF201's diameter to be 700 km, which would make it the second largest known object in such a wide orbit. The diameter of Pluto, meanwhile, is 2,377 km. Further observations, potentially using radio telescopes, are needed to determine the object's exact size.

Cheng discovered the object as part of an ongoing research project to identify TNOs and possible new planets in the outer solar system. The object was identified by pinpointing bright spots in an astronomical image database from the Victor M. Blanco Telescope and Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), and trying to connect all possible groups of such spots that appeared to move across the sky in the way a single TNO might. This search was carried out using a computationally efficient algorithm produced by Cheng. Ultimately, they identified 2017 OF201 in 19 different exposures, captured over 7 years.

The discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the outer solar system. The area beyond the Kuiper Belt, where the object is located, has previously been thought to be essentially empty, but the team's discovery suggests that this is not so.

""2017 OF201 spends only 1% of its orbital time close enough to us to be detectable. The presence of this single object suggests that there could be another hundred or so other objects with similar orbit and size; they are just too far away to be detectable now,"" Cheng states. ""Even though advances in telescopes have enabled us to explore distant parts of the universe, there is still a great deal to discover about our own solar system.""

The detection also demonstrates the power of open science. ""All the data we used to identify and characterize this object are archival data that are available to anyone, not only professional astronomers,"" says Li. ""This means that groundbreaking discoveries aren't limited to those with access to the world's largest telescopes. Any researcher, student, or even citizen scientist with the right tools and knowledge could have made this discovery, highlighting the value of sharing scientific resources.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Earth's safe zones are vanishing fast","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250906155053.htm","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 04:17:06 GMT","

A new study maps the planetary boundary of ""functional biosphere integrity"" in spatial detail and over centuries. It finds that 60 percent of global land areas are now already outside the locally defined safe zone, and 38 percent are even in the high-risk zone. The study was led by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) together with BOKU University in Vienna and published in the renowned journal One Earth.

Functional biosphere integrity refers to the plant world's ability to co-regulate the state of the Earth system. This requires that the plant world is able to acquire enough energy through photosynthesis to maintain the material flows of carbon, water and nitrogen that support the ecosystems and their many networked processes, despite today's massive human interference. Together with biodiversity loss and climate change, functional integrity forms the core of the Planetary Boundaries analytical framework for a safe operating space for humanity.

""There is an enormous need for civilization to utilize the biosphere - for food, raw materials and, in future, also for climate protection,"" says Fabian Stenzel, lead author of the study and member of the PIK research group Terrestrial Safe Operating Space. ""After all, human demand for biomass continues to grow - and on top of that, the cultivation of fast-growing grasses or trees for producing bioenergy with carbon capture and storage is considered by many to be an important supporting strategy for stabilizing climate. It is therefore becoming even more important to quantify the strain we're already putting on the biosphere - in a regionally differentiated manner and over time - to identify overloads. Our research is paving the way for this.""

Two indicators to measure the strain and the risk

The study builds on the latest update of the Planetary Boundaries framework published in 2023. ""The framework now squarely puts energy flows from photosynthesis in the world's vegetation at the center of those processes that co-regulate planetary stability,"" explains Wolfgang Lucht, head of PIK's Earth System Analysis department and coordinator of the study. ""These energy flows drive all of life - but humans are now diverting a sizeable fraction of them to their own purposes, disturbing nature's dynamic processes.""

The stress this causes in the Earth system can be measured by the proportion of natural biomass productivity that humanity channels into its own uses - through harvested crops, residues and timber - but also the reduction in photosynthetic activity caused by land cultivation and sealing. The study added to this measure a second powerful indicator of biosphere integrity: An indicator of risk of ecosystem destabilization records complex structural changes in vegetation and in the biosphere's water, carbon and nitrogen balances.

Europe, Asia and North America particularly affected

Based on the global biosphere model LPJmL, which simulates water, carbon and nitrogen flows on a daily basis at a resolution of half a degree of longitude/latitude, the study provides a detailed inventory for each individual year since the 1600, based on changes in climate and human land use. The research team not only computed, mapped and compared the two indicators for functional integrity of the biosphere, but also evaluated them by conducting a mathematical comparison with other measures from the literature for which ""critical thresholds"" are known. This resulted in each area being assigned a status based on local tolerance limits of ecosystem change: Safe Operating Space, Zone of Increasing Risk or High Risk Zone.

The model calculation shows that worrying developments began as early as 1600 in the mid- latitudes. By 1900, the proportion of global land area where ecosystem changes went beyond the locally defined safe zone, or were even in the high-risk zone, was 37 and 14 percent respectively, compared to the 60 and 38 percent we see today. Industrialization was beginning to take its toll; land use affected the state of the Earth system much earlier than climate warming. At present, this biosphere boundary has been transgressed on almost all land surface - primarily in Europe, Asia and North America - that underwent strong land cover conversion, mainly due to agriculture.

PIK Director Rockström: Impetus for international climate policy

""This first world map showing the overshoot of the boundary for functional integrity of the biosphere, depicting both human appropriation of biomass and ecological disruption, is a breakthrough from a scientific perspective, offering a better overall understanding of planetary boundaries,"" says Johan Rockström, PIK Director and one of the co-authors of the study. ""It also provides an important impetus for the further development of international climate policy. This is because it points to the link between biomass and natural carbon sinks, and how they can contribute to mitigating climate change. Governments must treat it as a single overarching issue: comprehensive biosphere protection together with strong climate action.""

As you've probably noticed, Google has gotten … weird lately. Weirder? It can be hard to find the search results you're looking for. Between AI summaries and algorithm changes resulting in unexpected sources, it can be tricky to navigate the most popular search engine in the world. (And publishers are feeling the strain, too.)

Earlier this year, Google updated its algorithm. This is nothing new—Google updates its algorithms hundreds of times per year, with anywhere from two to four major “core updates” that result in significant changes. And while it's tricky to determine exactly what changed, publishers and websites large and small noticed significant traffic drops and lower search rankings—even for content that had previously been doing well. “Google Zero” (as Nilay Patel of The Verge first called it) is thought to be caused, at least in part, by AI overviews.

Google Search has shown a slow crawl toward this for a couple of years, but the most recent blow was delivered over the summer. When you search for something and you get a neat little summary of various reporting completed by journalists, you're less likely to visit the websites that actually did the work. And, in some instances, that summary contains incorrect AI hallucinations or reporting from websites you might not trust as much. It's hard to say whether the next core update will make your search results show what you expect, but in the meantime, there's a tweak that can help it feel more tailored to your preferences.

Take back control of your Google search results with the new Google “Preferred Sources” tool. This can help you see more of WIRED, from our rigorous and obsessive Reviews coverage to the important breaking stories on our Politics desk to our Culture team's “What to Watch” roundups. (And, yes, this works for other publishers you know and trust, too.)

Preferred Sources are prioritized in Top Stories search results, and you'll also get a dedicated From Your Sources section on some search results pages.

To set WIRED as a Preferred Source, you can click this link and check the box to the right. You can also search for additional sources you prefer on this page and check the respective boxes to make sure they're prioritized in your Google searches.

You can also set a Preferred Source from within your Google searches themselves. When you see a Top Stories module on your search results page, you can click the icon to the right of the section title (it looks like a starred folder). Enter your favorite sources, check the box, and refresh to see those prioritizations take place.

The ways in which we all use the internet are subject to change all the time, and it's hard to know what the future holds. But for now, there's still a way to see more of what you want to and less of what you don't.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The New Math of Quantum Cryptography","https://www.wired.com/story/the-new-math-of-quantum-cryptography/","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

Hard problems are usually not a welcome sight. But cryptographers love them. That's because certain hard math problems underpin the security of modern encryption. Any clever trick for solving them will doom most forms of cryptography.

Several years ago, researchers found a radically new approach to encryption that lacks this potential weak spot. The approach exploits the peculiar features of quantum physics. But unlike earlier quantum encryption schemes, which only work for a few special tasks, the new approach can accomplish a much wider range of tasks. And it could work even if all the problems at the heart of ordinary “classical” cryptography turn out to be easily solvable.

But this striking discovery relied on unrealistic assumptions. The result was “more of a proof of concept,” said Fermi Ma, a cryptography researcher at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing in Berkeley, California. “It is not a statement about the real world.”

Now, a new paper by two cryptographers has laid out a path to quantum cryptography without those outlandish assumptions. “This paper is saying that if certain other conjectures are true, then quantum cryptography must exist,” Ma said.

You can think of modern cryptography as a tower with three essential parts. The first part is the bedrock deep beneath the tower, which is made of hard mathematical problems. The tower itself is the second part—there you can find specific cryptographic protocols that let you send private messages, sign digital documents, cast secret ballots, and more.

In between, securing those day-to-day applications to mathematical bedrock, is a foundation made of building blocks called one-way functions. They're responsible for the asymmetry inherent in any encryption scheme. “It's one-way because you can encrypt messages, but you can't decrypt them,” said Mark Zhandry, a cryptographer at NTT Research.

In the 1980s, researchers proved that cryptography built atop one-way functions would ensure security for many different tasks. But decades later, they still aren't certain that the bedrock is strong enough to support it. The trouble is that the bedrock is made of special hard problems—technically known as NP problems—whose defining feature is that it's easy to check whether any candidate solution is correct. (For example, breaking a number into its prime factors is an NP problem: hard to do for large numbers, but easy to check.)

Many of these problems seem intrinsically difficult, but computer scientists haven't been able to prove it. If someone discovers an ingenious algorithm for rapidly solving the hardest NP problems, the bedrock will crumble, and the whole tower will collapse.

Unfortunately, you can't simply move your tower elsewhere. The tower's foundation—one-way functions—can only sit on a bedrock of NP problems.

To build a tower on harder problems, cryptographers would need a new foundation that isn't made of one-way functions. That seemed impossible until just a few years ago, when researchers realized that quantum physics could help.

It started with a 2021 paper by a graduate student named William Kretschmer that drew attention to a strange problem about the properties of quantum systems. Researchers soon showed that Kretschmer's problem could replace one-way functions as the foundation for a new tower of cryptographic protocols. The following year, Kretschmer and others proved that this alternative approach could work even without hard NP problems. Suddenly, it seemed like it might be possible to construct a cryptographic fortress that would be far sturdier.

But where to build it? The quantum problem Kretschmer used as his foundation involved hypothetical computing devices called oracles that can instantaneously answer specific questions. Oracles can be useful theoretical tools, but they don't actually exist. Kretschmer's proofs were like a blueprint for building a castle in the sky. Was there a way to bring it down to earth?

In the fall of 2022, that question caught the attention of Dakshita Khurana, a cryptographer at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and NTT Research. Khurana and her graduate student Kabir Tomer set out to build a new tower of cryptography. Her first step was to build a new foundation using quantum building blocks instead of classical one-way functions. She would then need to prove that this new foundation could support a tower of other cryptographic protocols. Once she proved that the foundation could support the tower, she would have to find a solid place for the whole thing to sit—a bedrock of real-world problems that seem even harder than the NP problems used in classical cryptography.

Dakshita Khurana set out to find mathematical building blocks that could replace one-way functions as a foundation for quantum cryptography.

For the first step, Khurana and Tomer focused on a quantum version of a one-way function, called a one-way state generator, that satisfied the three properties that make one-way functions useful. First, the function must run quickly so that you can easily generate a cryptographic lock and the corresponding key to open it for each message you want to send. Second, each lock must be secure, requiring great effort to break open without the right key. Finally, every lock must be easy to open with the right key.

The crucial difference lay in the nature of the locks. Classical one-way functions generate mathematical locks made of bits—the 0s and 1s that store information in a classical computer. Quantum one-way state generators would instead generate locks made of units of quantum information called qubits. These quantum locks could potentially remain secure even if all classical locks are easy to break. Khurana and Tomer hoped to start with this new quantum foundation and build a tower of cryptographic protocols on top of it. “This turned out to be quite hard,” Khurana said. “We were stuck for many, many months.”

“We're just trying to understand this new landscape.”

By July 2023, Khurana was nearly nine months pregnant and planning for parental leave. Tomer was out of ideas. “I'm much more pessimistic than Dakshita,” he said. “She's always the one who believes that things will work.”

Then they made a breakthrough. The crucial step was defining another mathematical building block that served as something like a basement floor: a structure that would connect the foundation of one-way state generators to a tower of cryptographic protocols. When Khurana and Tomer worked out what properties that building block would need to have, they found that it resembled a one-way function with a perplexing mixture of quantum and classical characteristics. As in an ordinary one-way function, both locks and keys were made of classical bits, but the procedure for generating these locks and keys would only run on a quantum computer. Stranger still, the new building block satisfied the first two defining properties of one-way functions, but not the third: It was easy to generate locks and keys, and every lock was hard to break. But a key wouldn't easily open its lock.

Khurana and Tomer dubbed these perplexing new building blocks one-way puzzles. Intuitively, it's hard to imagine how they could possibly be useful: What good is a key that you can never use? But the two cryptographers showed that one-way puzzles combined with other quantum trickery would actually enable many cryptographic protocols. If you can generate locks and keys that fit together in principle, it doesn't matter whether the unlocking procedure is wildly inefficient.

Kabir Tomer and Khurana connected the new quantum building blocks to real-world problems harder than the ones used in classical cryptography.

“Just knowing that there exists some algorithm that can be arbitrarily slow is sufficient,” said Kretschmer, who is now a researcher at the Simons Institute. “That is very surprising.”

With that missing piece in place, they quickly finished the proof on August 4. Khurana's daughter was born just days later.

By November, Khurana was back at work and ready to attempt the second phase of her plan. She and Tomer had shown that many kinds of cryptography could be built upon one-way puzzles, and that one-way puzzles could in turn be built upon a new quantum foundation made of one-way state generators. The next step in their original plan was to connect that quantum foundation to a new bedrock—some relatively unassailable set of math problems that are even more intractable than those in NP.

But as Khurana and Tomer grappled with that task, they decided to take a more direct approach: Forget about the one-way state generators, and instead anchor one-way puzzles directly to the mathematical bedrock.

William Kretschmer showed that in theory, quantum cryptography could be secure without the one-way functions that are essential to all classical encryption.

From one perspective, that seemed like an odd choice. One-way puzzles were mathematical oddities that Khurana and Tomer had used in an intermediate step of their proof.

Yet one-way puzzles had some advantages. For one thing, while they're quantum, the locks and keys that they generate are classical. Khurana thought that might make it easier to connect them to a bedrock of classical mathematics. In addition, one-way puzzles generate keys that are too unwieldy to actually open locks. That could make it easier to link them to problems so tricky that even checking solutions seems hopelessly hard.

But what specific problems would work? Khurana had a candidate in mind: calculating a specific combination of the entries in a table of numbers called a matrix. This problem, known as the matrix permanent problem, is notoriously difficult to solve for large matrices, and there's no simple way to check whether a calculation is correct. The matrix permanent problem also has other special mathematical properties that cryptographers find appealing.

“This would be a beautiful problem to base cryptography on,” Khurana said.

The matrix permanent problem also connects to a different problem that quantum computers can easily solve but classical computers seemingly can't. Researchers are working on proving this quantum computational advantage in a precise theoretical sense. Khurana and Tomer showed that such a proof would also let them build secure one-way puzzles—and thus the whole tower of quantum cryptography—on top of the permanent problem.

“They were able to do this from these well-studied assumptions,” Kretschmer said. “I was really happy to see that.”

With their new result, Khurana and Tomer have effectively reduced two open problems to one. If researchers complete the proof that quantum computers truly surpass classical ones at a specific task, that will automatically put quantum cryptography on much stronger theoretical footing than practically any kind of classical cryptography.

Alas, you won't be able to use Khurana and Tomer's new approach to send secret messages any time soon. Despite recent progress, quantum computing technology is not yet mature enough to put their ideas into practice. Meanwhile, other researchers have devised quantum cryptography methods that could be used sooner, though more work will be needed to establish that they're truly secure.

Quantum cryptography has already proved full of surprises, and researchers have only recently begun exploring the possibilities. “We're just trying to understand this new landscape that really existed the whole time,” Zhandry said.

                              What happens here matters everywhere.

There's been a lot of chatter heading into the new NFL season about how artificial intelligence will be an innovative new sideline tool for coaches and players, thanks to the league's partnership with Microsoft.

We checked back in with the NFL to clarify just how AI can and will be used during games, just to make sure humans and not chatbots will still be the deciding force when it comes to calling plays. And along the way it made us want to revisit one of the most painful plays in Seattle Seahawks history — sorry!

First, the NFL stresses that its Sideline Viewing System, with a new GitHub Copilot feature from Microsoft, is mainly a filtering tool for the sideline and booth Surface tablets used by players and coaches. The filtering function connects play data to still images, allowing users to rapidly reach a category or subsection of plays for review. 

Copilot is also enabled in analytics devices used in the coaches booth, where teams have access to specific game data within a “bespoke build” of Microsoft Excel. The Copilot function offers a sounding board to check the accuracy of formulas and generate visualizations, according to the league.

Here's more nitty-gritty from the NFL regarding the use of tech:

“The technology tools coaches use on game days are primarily governed by the NFL's electronic device policy which states that only league-issued technology can be used by team staffs on sidelines/the coaches booths (prohibiting devices like smartwatches, cellphones, and personal computers). Club committee guidance informs the approval process of what is league-issued. Our committees of coaches, front office executives, and owners have historically focused on innovations that serve all clubs equitably and emphasize enhancing processes over determining in-game outcomes. Through our Microsoft partnership, we feel AI can streamline these processes, but cannot be a substitute or supplement for coaches developing adjustments and strategies on game day.”

So while you might be using AI to craft your next clever work email, or your kid is using it to cheat on his math homework, NFL coaches won't be using it (yet) to decide whether to pass or punt on 4th and five.

But that doesn't stop us from using AI to second-guess — or at least revisit how the internet summarizes all the second-guessing.

And there's no bigger play in Seattle football history to revisit than the play that cost the Seahawks a second Super Bowl title 10 years ago. 

If you don't pay attention to football, or time has successfully erased that memory, it's the play where the Seahawks were trailing 28-24 against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX. There was 26 seconds left in the game. It was 2nd-and-goal at the 1-yard line, and the Hawks had one timeout remaining.

Rather than hand the ball to running back Marshawn Lynch, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll opted for a pass play, and quarterback Russell Wilson's throw was intercepted. Game over. Dynasty denied.

The Seahawks have a new coach now and the team has come a long way from not being back-to-back world champs. But AI is such a hyped commodity now it makes sense to use it for its take on that play, and much like the human analysts, fans and players who have dissected Carroll's decision, AI wishes he would have run it to Lynch, too.

Here's the prompt we fed to OpenAI's ChatGPT-5 and Google's Gemini 2.5:

Should the Seattle Seahawks have run the ball with a chance to win Super Bowl XLIX against the New England Patriots?

Both bots do a good job of quickly generating the facts around the play and analysis of Lynch's power in such a situation. The bots then offer arguments for why running the ball and passing the ball both could have made sense.

But the “verdict” from ChatGPT and the “conclusion” from Gemini both lean toward Lynch and the run. 

“In hindsight — and even at the time — running the ball was the higher-percentage play,” ChatGPT said. “The risk of an interception on a short slant in a crowded goal-line situation didn't justify the potential reward. It remains one of the most second-guessed play calls in NFL history.”

“In the end, while the play call was strategically justifiable, especially in a worst-case scenario, the immediate result — a game-ending interception — made it seem like a monumental mistake,” Gemini said. “The universal consensus among fans and many analysts is that, given the talent and the game situation, the Seahawks should have simply run the ball.”

As the NFL kicks off a new season, and AI becomes even more ingrained in certain aspects of team decision making, here's to hoping Seattle fans have reason for more positive prompts about future play calls.

Microsoft said Saturday that clients of its Azure cloud platform might experience increased latency after multiple undersea cables were cut in the Red Sea, as reported in Bloomberg.

In a status update, the company said traffic going through the Middle East or ending in Asia or Europe had been affected. It did not say who had cut the cables or why.

“Undersea fiber cuts can take time to repair, as such we will continuously monitor, rebalance, and optimize routing to reduce customer impact in the meantime,” the status update said.

By Saturday evening, Microsoft said it was no longer detecting any Azure issues.

Mistral AI, the French company behind AI assistant Le Chat and several foundational models, is officially regarded as one of France's most promising tech startups and is arguably the only European company that could compete with OpenAI. 

It is reportedly in the process of raising another round that would value it at $14 billion, up from about $6 billion in June, 2024. While Mistral AI describes itself as “the world's greenest and leading independent AI lab” it is still not as well known as its biggest competitors.  

“Go and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI — or something else,” French president Emmanuel Macron said in a TV interview ahead of the AI Action Summit in Paris in February 2025.

Mistral AI, which offers open-source AI models, has raised significant amounts of funding since its creation in 2023 with the ambition to “put frontier AI in the hands of everyone.” While this isn't a direct jab at OpenAI, the slogan is meant to highlight the company's openness versus OpenAI's typically closed approach.

Its alternative to ChatGPT, chat assistant Le Chat, is available on iOS and Android. It reached 1 million downloads in the two weeks following its mobile release, even grabbing France's top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store.

In July 2025, Mistral AI updated Le Chat with new features that bring it closer to rival full-stack AI chatbots: a new “deep research” mode, native multilingual reasoning, and advanced image editing. This update also includes the addition of Projects, which lets users group chats, documents, and ideas into focused spaces.

As of September 2025, Le Chat also has the ability to remember previous conversations with the introduction of Memories.

This comes in addition to Mistral AI's suite of models, which includes: 

In March 2025, the company introduced Mistral OCR, an optical character recognition (OCR) API that can turn any PDF into a text file to make it easier for AI models to ingest.

In June 2025, Mistral AI also released a vibe coding client, Mistral Code, to compete with incumbents like Windsurf, Anysphere's Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.

Mistral AI's three founders share a background in AI research at major U.S. tech companies with significant operations in Paris. CEO Arthur Mensch used to work at Google's DeepMind, while CTO Timothée Lacroix and chief scientist officer Guillaume Lample are former Meta staffers.

Co-founding advisers also include Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve (also a board member) and Charles Gorintin from health insurance startup Alan, as well as former digital minister Cédric O, which has caused persistent controversy due to his previous role.

Not all of them. Mistral AI differentiates its premier models, whose weights are not available for commercial purposes, from its free models, for which it provides weight access under the Apache 2.0 license.

Free models include research models such as Mistral NeMo, which was built in collaboration with Nvidia that the startup open sourced in July 2024.

While many of Mistral AI's offerings are free or now have free tiers, Le Chat also has paid tiers. Introduced in February 2025, Le Chat's Pro plan is priced at $14.99 a month.

On the purely B2B side, Mistral AI monetizes its premier models through APIs with usage-based pricing. Enterprises can also license these models, and the company likely also generates a significant share of its revenue from its strategic partnerships, some of which it highlighted during the Paris AI Summit.

Overall, however, Mistral AI's revenue is reportedly still in the eight-digit range, according to multiple sources.

In 2024, Mistral AI entered a deal with Microsoft that included a strategic partnership for distributing its AI models through Microsoft's Azure platform and a €15 million investment. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) swiftly concluded that the deal didn't qualify for investigation due to its small size. However, it also sparked some criticism in the EU. 

In January 2025, Mistral AI signed a deal with press agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) to let Chat query the AFP's entire text archive dating back to 1983.

Mistral AI also secured strategic partnerships with France's army and job agency, Luxembourg, shipping giant CMA, German defense tech startup Helsing, IBM, Orange, and Stellantis.

In May 2025, Mistral AI announced it would participate in the creation of an AI Campus in the Paris region, as part of a joint venture with UAE-investment firm MGX, NVIDIA, and France's state-owned investment bank Bpifrance.

In June 2025, it was announced that beginning in 2026, Mistral will launch a European platform dedicated to AI and powered by Nvidia processors, Mistral Compute. The initative was hailed as ‘historic' by Macron, who shared the stage with Mensch and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at the VivaTech conference shortly after the announcement.

In July 2025, it announced AI for Citizens, “a collaborative initiative to help States and public institutions strategically harness AI for their people by transforming public services, catalyzing innovation, and ensuring competitiveness.”

In May 2025, Mistral AI released the Mistral Agents API to “empower enterprises to use AI in more practical and impactful ways,” according to its Head of Developer Relations, Sophia Yang.

In September 2025, the company unveiled a revamped Connectors directory, showcasing Le Chat's integrations with some 20 enterprise tools including Asana, Atlassian, Box, Google Drive, Notion, Zapier, as well as emails and calendars; and soon, Databricks and Snowflake.

As of February 2025, Mistral AI raised around €1 billion in capital to date, approximately $1.04 billion at the current exchange rate. This includes some debt financing, as well as several equity financing rounds raised in close succession.

In June 2023, and before it even released its first models, Mistral AI raised a record $112 million seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Sources at the time said the seed round — Europe's largest ever — valued the then-one-month-old startup at $260 million. 

Other investors in this seed round included Bpifrance, Eric Schmidt, Exor Ventures, First Minute Capital, Headline, JCDecaux Holding, La Famiglia, LocalGlobe, Motier Ventures, Rodolphe Saadé, Sofina, and Xavier Niel.

Only six months later, it closed a Series A of €385 million ($415 million at the time), at a reported valuation of $2 billion. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with participation from existing backer Lightspeed, as well as BNP Paribas, CMA-CGM, Conviction, Elad Gil, General Catalyst, and Salesforce.

The $16.3 million convertible investment that Microsoft made in Mistral AI as part of their partnership announced in February 2024 was presented as a Series A extension, implying an unchanged valuation.

In June 2024, Mistral AI then raised €600 million in a mix of equity and debt (around $640 million at the exchange rate at the time). The long-rumored round was led by General Catalyst at a $6 billion valuation, with notable investors, including Cisco, IBM, Nvidia, Samsung Venture Investment Corporation, and others.

According to Bloomberg, Mistral AI is now finalizing a €2 billion investment at a post-money valuation of $14 billion. This follows earlier reports that the company was in talks to raise $1 billion in equity from investors including Abu Dhabi's MGX fund, as well as hundreds of millions of euros in debt. But

Mensch was part of a group of European CEOs who signed an open letter in July 2025 urging Brussels to ‘stop the clock' for two years before key obligations of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act enter into force. The European Commision is sticking to its original timeline.

Mistral is “not for sale,” Mensch said in January 2025 at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Of course, [an IPO is] the plan.” 

This makes sense, given how much the startup has raised so far: Even a large sale may not provide high enough multiples for its investors, not to mention sovereignty concerns depending on the acquirer. 

However, the only way to definitely squash persistent acquisition rumors — lately naming Apple — is to scale its revenue to levels that could even remotely justify its valuation. Either way, stay tuned.

I've been chasing flimsy but very annoying stability problems (some, of course, due to overclocking during my younger years, when it still had a tangible payoff) enough times on systems I had built that taking this one BIG potential cause out of the equation is worth the few dozens of extra bucks I have to spend on ECC-capable gear many times over.Trying to validate an ECC-less platform's stability is surprisingly hard, because memtest and friends just aren't very reliably detecting more subtle problems.

This is the annoying part.That AMD permits ECC is a truly fantastic situation, but if it's supported by the motherboard is often unlikely and worse: it's not advertised even when it's available.I have an ASUS PRIME TRX40 PRO and the tech specs say that it can run ECC and non-ECC but not if ECC will be available to the operating system, merely that the DIMMS will work.It's much more hit and miss in reality than it should be, though this motherboard was a pricey one: one can't use price as a proxy for features.

I would assume your particular motherboard to operate with proper SECDED+-level ECC if you have capable, compatible DIMM, enable ECC mode in the firmware, and boot an OS kernel that can make sense of it all.

Also: DDR5 has some false ecc marketing due to the memory standard having an error correction scheme build in. Don't fall for it.

That is an improvement I am willing to stomach the extra risk of effectively overclocking the memory module beyond its comformt zone for, given that I can fully mitigate it by virtue of properly working ECC.

Also, could you share some relevant info about your processor, mainboard, and UEFI? I see many internet commenters question whether their ECC is working (or ask if a particular setup would work), and far fewer that report a successful ECC consumer desktop build. So it would be nice to know some specific product combinations that really work.

reply

Also: Could you not have just bought slightly faste RAM, given the premium for ECC?

reply

And no, as ECC UDIMM for the speed (3600MHz) I run mine at simply does not exist - it is outside of what JEDEC ratified for the DDR4 spec.

Edit: it's probably because I switched it to ""energy efficiency mode"" instead of ""performance mode"" because it would occasionally lock up in performance mode. Presumably with the same root cause.

reply

I wish AMD would make ECC a properly advertised feature with clear motherboard support. At least DDR5 has some level of ECC.

reply

When you do not have a bunch of components ready to swap out it is also really hard to debug these issues. Sometimes it's something completely different like the PSU. After the last issues, I decided to buy a prebuilt (ThinkStation) with on-site service. The cooling is a bit worse, etc., but if issues come up, I don't have to spend a lot of time debugging them.Random other comment: when comparing CPUs, a sad observation was that even a passively cooled M4 is faster than a lot of desktop CPUs (typically single-threaded, sometimes also multi-threaded).

I think a lot of it boils down to load profile and power delivery. My 2500VA double conversion UPS seems to have difficulty keeping up with the volatility in load when running that console app. I can tell because its fans ramp up and my lights on the same circuit begin to flicker very perceptibly.

It looks completely bonkers to me. I overclocked my system to ~95% of what it is able to do with almost default voltages, using bumps of 1-3% over stock, which (AFAIK) is within acceptable tolerances, but it requires hours and hours of tinkering and stability testing.Most users just set automatic overclocking, have their motherboards push voltages to insane levels, and then act surprised when their CPUs start bugging out within a couple of years.Shocking!

I'd rather run everything at 90% and get very big power savings and still have pretty stellar performance. I do this with my ThinkStation with Core Ultra 265K now - I set the P-State maximum performance percentage to 90%. Under load it runs almost 20 degrees Celsius cooler. Single core is 8% slower, multicore 4.9%. Well worth the trade-off for me.(Yes, I know that there are exceptions.)

This anecdote perfectly describes my few generation old Intel laptop too. The fans turn on maybe once a month. I dont think its as power efficient as an M-series Apple CPU, but total system power is definitely under 10W during normal usage (including screen, wifi, etc).

reply

One of the many reasons why snapdragon windows laptops failed was both amd and Intel (lunar lake) was able to reach the claimed efficiency of those chips. I still think modern x86 can match arm ones in efficiency if someone bothered to tune the os and scheduler for most common activities. M series was based on their phone chips which were designed from the ground up to run on a battery all these years. AMD/Intel just don't see an incentive to do that nor do Microsoft.

If nothing else, it very clearly indicates that you can boost your performance significantly by sorting out your cooling because your cpu will be stuck permanently emergency throttling.

That said, there's a difference between a laptop cpu turbo boosting to 90 for a few minutes and a desktop cpu, which are usually cooler anyway, running at 100 sustained for three hours.

reply

On desktop PCs, thermal throttling is often set up as ""just a safety feature"" to this very day. Which means: the system does NOT expect to stay at the edge of its thermal limit. I would not trust thermal throttling with keeping a system running safely at a continuous 100C on die.100C is already a ""danger zone"", with elevated error rates and faster circuit degradation - and there are only this many thermal sensors a die has. Some under-sensored hotspots may be running a few degrees higher than that. Which may not be enough to kill the die outright - but more than enough to put those hotspots into a ""fuck around"" zone of increased instability and massively accelerated degradation.If you're relying on thermal throttling to balance your system's performance, as laptops and smartphones often do, then you seriously need to dial in better temperature thresholds. 100C is way too spicy.

Smartphones have no active cooling and are fully dependent on thermal throttling for survival, but they can start throttling at as low as 50C easily.

I'd say that even crashing at max temperatures is still completely unreasonable! You should be able to run at 100C or whatever the max temperature is for a week non-stop if you well damn please. If you can't, then the value has been chosen wrong by the manufacturers. If the CPU can't handle that, the clock rates should just be dialed back accordingly to maintain stability.It's odd to hear about Core Ultra CPUs failing like that, though - I thought that they were supposed to be more power efficient than the 13th and 14th gen, all while not having their stability issues.That said, I currently have a Ryzen 7 5800X, OCed with PBO to hit 5 GHz with negative CO offsets per core set. There's also an AIO with two fans and the side panel is off because the case I have is horrible. While gaming the temps usually don't reach past like 82C but Prime95 or anything else that's computationally intensive can make the CPU hit and flatten out at 90C. So odd to have modern desktop class CPUs still bump into thermal limits like that. That's with a pretty decent ambient temperature between 21C to 26C (summer).

Servers and running things at scale are way different from consumer use cases and the cooling solutions you'll find in the typical desktop tower, esp. considering the average budget and tolerance for noise. Regardless, on a desktop chip, even if you hit tJMax, it shouldn't lead to instability as in the post above, nor should the chips fail.If they do, then that value was chosen wrong by the manufacturer. The chips should also be clocking back to maintain safe operating temps. Essentially, squeeze out whatever performance is available with a given cooling solution: be it passive (I have some low TDP AM4 chips with passive Alpine radiator blocks), air coolers or AIOs or a custom liquid loop.> What Intel is doing and what they are recommending is the act of a desperate corporation incapable of designing energy-efficient CPUs, incapable of progressing their performance in MIPS per Watt of power.I don't disagree with this entirely, but the story is increasingly similar with AMD as well - most consumer chip manufacturers are pushing the chips harder and harder out of the factory, so they can compete on benchmarks. That's why you hear about people limiting the power envelope to 80-90% of stock and dropping close to 10 degrees C in temperatures, similarly you hear about the difficulties of pushing chips all that far past stock in overclocking, because they're already pushed harder than the prior generations.To sum up: Intel should be less delusional in how far they can push the silicon, take the L and compete against AMD on the pricing, instead of charging an arm and a leg for chips that will burn up. What they were doing with the Arc GPUs compared to the competitors was actually a step in the right direction.

Besides AMD CPUs of the early 2000s going up in smokes without working cooling, they all throttle before they become temporarily or permanently unstable. Otherwise they are bad.I've never had a desktop part fail due to max temperatures, but I don't think I've owned one that advertises nor allows itself to reach or remain at 100c or higher.If someone sells a CPU that's specified to work at 100 or 110 degrees and it doesn't then it's either defective or fraudulent, no excuses.

If I have O operations (e.g. evaluate, stringify) and T types, then I need O•T implementations.  If I fix O, I can add types until the cows come home by adding O implementations per new type. If I fix T, I can add new operations with T implementations per operation.  If I want to let O and T vary, then the number of implementations I need to add per additional operation/type varies depending on what I've added before.  No amount of programming language magic will change this basic count.ISTM what's really going on in the article is that the author is using the programming language as a registry of implementations. Those O•T implementations need to be stored somewhere so their callers can find them.  In C++ this can be done when very verbose inheritance and virtual calls. In other languages, it's less verbose. If multiple dispatch is built in, then one can use it directly.  One can, of course, also build an actual table indexed on operation and type as a data structure in just about any language and use it, and in a language like C++ the result may well be quite a bit nicer than using a class hierarchy.

It's refreshing to see this very clear problem statement, which feels like an ideal anti-thesis that reveals the hidden glory of Rust's traits/impls:> It turns out that adding new operations isn't as easy as adding new types. We'd have to change the Expr interface, and consequently change every existing expression type to support the new method(s). If we don't control the original code or it's hard to change it for other reasons, we're in trouble.> In other words, we'd have to violate the venerable open-closed principle, one of the main principles of object-oriented design, defined as:> software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modificationApologies for the self link, but this came up very recently in a sub thread about Rust & I'm so glad to close the loop & find a name for this. I said there & I'll say again, I think this is one of Rust's Greta superpowers, that we are not trapped by the design parameters of the libraries we consume, that Rust allows us to layer in more and more to our types, as we please. An amazing superpower of Rust that imo gets way too little attention, where-as the borrow-checking tends to soak all the attention/fixation for the language. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45041286#45045202There's a whole chapter of the Rust book on Rust & OOP, btw, which provides a side-ways look at how Rust & OOP and the Expression Problem relate. https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-00-oop.htmlC# and others have extension methods, where you can add operations. But most of the language & it's use is pretty conventional OOP; it's a feature not the core.

The expression problem is about being able to extend both data types (new cases) and operations (new functions) without modifying existing code while preserving static type safety.C#'s extension methods can't be virtual, so you can't use them to actually add any new operations which can be dispatched on. They're just syntactic sugar for adding static methods which in non-OOP languages can be accomplished by declaring a free function.Rust traits let you add new types (just impl the Trait), but it doesn't let you add new functions, so it doesn't do anything to solve the problem.

Is it a backup if the magnet for closed lid detection fails? Is it some kind of input for the brightness sensor or True Tone? Is it for warranty investigation, that if the hinge breaks they can figure out if it was physically pushed too far, or was repeatedly slammed open and shut like a toy?

reply

The sensor used for detecting if the lid is closed is an “angle” sensor, although really it's an Hall effect sensor and a magnet in the hinge. If you have a Hall effect sensor, getting angle data from it is pretty much free, because the Hall effect produces a continuously varying signal, you need thresholding logic to turn it into a binary output.Given Hall effect ICs are so cheap and plentiful there no reason to use anything else. Also given they mass-produced ICs it's probably cheaper to buy a fully featured Hall Effect IC, because the manufacturing cost between a basic IC and an advanced IC is almost certainly zero these days.In short, modern IC manufacturing has just made magnetic angle sensors as cheap, if not cheaper, than dump non-angle sensing Hall sensors. After all you can always use an angle sensing Hall sensor as binary switch if you want, but the reverse isn't true, so if the ICs basically cost the same, you can expect the less capable ICs to be completely outcompeted by the more capable ICs.

It's maddening that only Apple gets this right 100% of the time, and it's among the things keeping me on Apple's platform for the moment.

reply

That's due to ""connected standby""[1], which is to have laptops behave more like a phone when in sleep. This is in contrast to S3 sleep, which basically halts all activity. Sounds all good in theory, but as soon as you allow code to be run while in sleep, it's easy for some runaway app (OS or third party) to eat through your battery even while your laptop is ""sleeping"". Worse is that there's no way to force sleep, so your only choice is hibernate, which is even worse than S3 sleep before.[1] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/de...

There will be no foldable iPhone on Tuesday, Sept. 9—that's supposedly not coming until next year—but there will be four new iPhone 17 phones announced at Apple's “Awe Dropping” event. Gizmodo's own Senior Editor of Consumer Editor, Raymond Wong, and our amazing Social Media Editor, Adriano Contreras, will be parachuting into the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park to play with the anticipated iPhone 17, 17 Air, and 17 Pros (especially the orange one).

New iPhones won't be the only thing they'll be getting their hands on. They'll be among the first to also check out the new Apple Watches (Series 11 and Ultra 3), as well as any new AirPods (Pro 3?). Tim Cook could also pull a “one more thing…” if he wants. He's CEO; he can do whatever he so desires. Wall Street would go wild if he invoked Steve Jobs' favorite phrase.

The keynote starts at 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT, but we'll have started long before that. So grab your favorite beverage and get down in the comments section to let us know what you're most excited to see Apple announce. Or, you know, what really grinds your gears. Millions of people love new iPhones—they stop their whole lives to see what's new—but also, Android is doing some interesting stuff. Have you seen Samsung's gorgeous, folding Galaxy Z Fold 7? How about Google's AI-stuffed Pixel 10 phones? At the end of the day, the only person who should care about your phone choice is yourself. Don't let others bully you into any ecosystem.

Last week's disappointing jobs report showed U.S. job growth stalled significantly in August, with just 22,000 new jobs added, and an unemployment rate that has risen to 4.3%.

It was the worst August report since the pandemic and the market treated it accordingly, welcoming it for the potential rate cuts it may herald but wary of the slower growth it may portend.

“The labor market is showing signs of cracking,” Heather Long, Navy Federal Credit Union senior economist, wrote in a note to investors on Thursday. “It's not a red siren alarm yet, but the signs keep growing that businesses are starting to cut workers.”

Recent employment data confirms an increasingly uneven landscape within the technology sector, reflecting a shift away from the rapid job growth that characterized the early post-pandemic years.

According to a recent analysis by research think tank CompTIA, the sector has experienced a net decline of approximately 2,700 jobs over the past year, a 0.1% decrease.

This contrasts sharply with the period from late 2020 through 2022, when tech companies collectively added over 628,400 jobs across 29 months.

However, the last two years have seen almost 100,000 of those positions cut, indicating a recalibration amid the broader economic and geopolitical shifts.

“Unevenness in the data means acknowledging the employers and job seekers struggling with a multitude of challenges but also recognizing it is not all doom and gloom,” Tim Herbert, chief research officer, CompTIA, said. “Hiring intent data continues to show employers pursuing tech talent across a range of disciplines, from AI and data science to tech support and cloud engineering.”

The hottest spot for hiring was unsurprisingly in the AI skills job listings, which leapt 94% year-over-year according to CompTIA's AI Hiring Intent Index.

For job postings themselves, 16% were for workers with eight or more years of experience; 21% for workers in the zero to three year range; and almost a third were for workers with four to seven years of experience.

Who is hiring and where is also an interesting standout.

Large tech companies showed signs of large hiring sprees: Software publishers like Microsoft and Oracle have collectively added 16,100 jobs in the past year, signaling ongoing strength in areas linked to cloud computing and enterprise software.

But other marquee-name companies like computer-systems designers such as IBM and Booz Allen Hamilton have shed 28,800 roles, reflecting a tilt toward automation and project-specific staffing.

“Only three states, Maine, Delaware and Idaho, saw tech job postings increase in August. In each instance, the increase was less than 100 new postings,” the report found.

“The story was similar at the metro level, with just four markets recording growth. San Jose saw an increase of 127 job postings, from 5,808 in July to 5,935 in August. Little Rock had the biggest percentage increase (+ 10%) in job postings, from 987 in July to 1,090 in August.”

Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, attributes this trend to increased corporate investment in technology infrastructure and automation rather than direct employment.

“Companies are investing in technology instead of human capital,” she notes in the report.

While some segments remain resilient, the disparate nature of job growth is clear.

The CompTIA analysis underscores the broader narrative of an industry undergoing structural transformation, shifting gears from hiring sprees to strategic investments in technology.

As firms prioritize capital over traditional labor, questions about the future of tech employment and how the workforce can adapt to these changes remain central for policymakers and industry leaders alike. For more details, consult the full report at Morningstar here.

The divergence in employment trends within the tech sector highlights a fundamental shift in how companies are approaching growth.

The slower hiring rate and outright layoffs suggest that firms are reassessing their workforce strategies, likely driven by economic uncertainties, geopolitical tensions, and an intensifying focus on automation and AI.

This trend mirrors broader economic patterns, where companies seek to optimize efficiency and reduce reliance on human labor in areas where technology can provide cost-effective solutions.

Moreover, the sector's uneven employment landscape indicates that not all technology subsectors are impacted equally. Software publishing and cloud-based services, exemplified by Microsoft and Oracle, continue to grow, driven by demand for digital transformation and remote work solutions.

These companies are capitalizing on the necessity for scalable, cloud-based infrastructures, which require ongoing talent acquisition. Meanwhile, hardware-centric or systems integration firms are trimming headcount, perhaps due to supply chain disruptions, or as they shift toward more automated, project-based work models.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Here's How Much More AI-Skilled Workers Make","https://gizmodo.com/heres-how-much-more-ai-skilled-workers-make-2000653586","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 14:05:13 GMT","

Employers are increasingly offering pay boosts for workers with artificial intelligence skills, even in roles beyond tech. How much more? We looked at three different studies to see just how much more artificial intelligence skills will pay.

According to CNBC, roles specifying AI competencies are trending across job postings, with employers adding salary incentives for candidates who bring the right mix of AI know-how—even in traditionally non-technical roles.

The emerging trend reflects the growing importance of AI literacy across industries, as companies race to keep pace with automation while shoring up talent gaps.

 This echoes findings from tech industry research group Lightcast, which analyzed more than 1.3 billion job ads and found that jobs requiring AI skills advertised a 28% premium, equivalent to nearly $18,000 per year. The premium skyrocketed to 43% when job listings specified two or more AI skills.

“Job postings are increasingly emphasizing AI skills and there are signals that employers are willing to pay premium salaries for them,” Elena Magrini, head of global research at Lightcast, told CNBC.

A study by Foote Partners supports this shift. It showed that employers pay 19% to 23% more for practical AI skills compared to a modest 9% to 11% lift for AI certifications, reflecting the value of demonstrated ability over credentials.

Global data from PwC's 2025 AI Jobs Barometer suggests that workers with AI skills earn up to 56% more, a steep rise from the previous year. This trend holds across sectors: even roles in marketing, finance, human resources, and education are increasingly AI-enabled, and rewarded accordingly.

In the United Kingdom, CIO Dive reports that job postings with AI skill requirements offered a 23% wage premium, surpassing the value of master's degrees (13%), though still trailing PhD-level pay (33%). Men and women with AI proficiency were shortlisted with salaries about 12%–13% higher than candidates without.

Experts argue this reflects a broader shift toward “task-based hiring”, where AI-enabled work automates tasks and demands adaptability from human workers. Skills like prompt engineering, critical thinking, and AI judgment increasingly outweigh traditional credentials.

However, the transition raises concerns about equity.

Research shows that while AI-skilled roles now command significantly higher salaries, most workers, especially outside tech, have yet to upskill. A former OpenAI executive recently warned that AI talent has become the “new star athlete” of the workforce, with HR systems struggling to keep pace.

Perhaps more tellingly, the research increasingly supports the idea that AI is no longer a niche technical specialty: it's becoming a widespread professional credential.

Employers are rewarding workers who can harness these tools across business functions, signaling a long-term shift to a skills-first economy. Those who adapt may command top-of-market compensation; those who don't may find themselves left behind.

IFA, short for Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin, meaning “International Radio Exhibition Berlin” because it started in 1924 when radios were the hottest things in tech, doesn't see as many major gadget announcements as CES. Still, it's Europe's largest tech show to close out summer, and this year the show doubled down on the stuff its Messe Berlin convention halls are typically known for: smart home gear and robots. That's not to say there weren't the usual new laptops, speakers, and wacky concepts—there were!

We're still stomping through Berlin to bring you the best tech we can find from IFA 2025. For now, here's our Best of IFA 2025 Awards for every gadget that the Gizmodo squad found innovative, well-designed, or just plain fun.

Lenovo Legion Go 2

The Legion Go 2 will cost you an arm and a leg, and then Lenovo will still demand more than $1,050 for its revised handheld PC. And still, the device is enticing thanks to its 8.8-inch OLED screen and variable refresh rate (VRR) between 30Hz and 144Hz. The more ergonomic controls may make it easier to hold for longer—which may help considering the upgraded 74Wh battery should let you game for longer.

Ecovacs Deebot X11 OmniCyclone

The Deebot X11 OmniCyclone has a few things going for it that make it stand out from Roombas and the suddenly very competitive market of robovacs. There's an onboard AI model that Ecovacs says helps the X11 better understand when to clean based on your habits; improved motors help it get over gaps where different floor materials meet; and there's a built-in GaN fast-charging technology that supposedly lets it recharge while it's rinsing its mop. The Deebot X11 should also clean corners and wall edges better. It seems to have it all.

Eufy MarsWalker

Eufy's MarsWalker is straight out of a sci-fi movie. When a Eufy robot vacuum slips on the “mech suit,” it can then use the arms and legs to climb up and down stairs, eliminating the need to manually haul the bot between floors to vacuum. The MarsWalker is cute, a little creepy, but damn, come on, technology that levels up our laziness is too good to ignore!

Acer Swift 16 Air

When light is right, the Acer Swift 16 Air is your best choice for a laptop that has more screen real estate than any 13- or 14-inch notebook. It clocks in at 2.18 pounds for the version with an IPS LCD display, but the heavier AMOLED will barely weigh you down at 2.43 pounds. The major caveat here is the Swift 16 Air sacrifices battery life for the sake of a thin and light 16-inch device. If you can stomach being near a charger, the Swift 16 Air will barely register as anything in your backpack.

Lenovo Legion Pro 7

Lenovo's new version of its Legion Pro 7 is very enticing since now it comes with AMD's Ryzen 9 9955X3D. The CPU promises to beat Intel's high-end offerings exclusively for gaming performance with the same GPU. The Legion Pro 7 is already a great gaming laptop; the better chip will just make a good computer better.

Tecno Slim

Tech giants like Samsung say you need to sacrifice battery life for the sake of a super-thin phone. Tecno responded “hold my beer” with the two versions of the Tecno Slim phone. They're each barely any thicker than a USB-C port, and yet Tecno claims they have enough battery life to last more than a full day.

Max Headphones Charging Stand

Apple doesn't make a wireless charging stand that charges both AirPods Max and a pair of AirPods earbuds so Mophie did. The Max Headphones Charging Stand is what every Apple fan has been waiting for and displays your Apple over-ear headphones while juicing them up. You do need a little USB-C dongle to magnetically charge the AirPods Max, but seriously, why didn't anybody make this sooner?

Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra

If there's one thing Samsung is an expert at, it's making big-ass tablets, and the 14.6-inch Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra is the largest one that matters. Thinner than even Apple's thinnest iPad Pro, Samsung's Android tablet is better as a laptop or desktop replacement thanks to the new DeX Extended Mode and four desktop workspaces to spread windows across. It's truly made for working as opposed to watching Netflix, though that'll look great on the massive screen, too.

Anker Soundcore Nebula X1 Pro

There are projectors, and then there's Anker's Soundcore Nebula X1 Pro, which is basically an upright party speaker with a 4K, U-shaped optical laser system to splash a massive picture of up to 3,500 ANSI lumens of brightness onto any wall. It's such a tank of a projector that it may as well be called R2-D2. As if that weren't enough, the Nebula X1 Pro hides four wireless speakers inside that you can set up in any room or backyard for a 7.1.4 surround sound system that'll shoot you into hyperspace.

Anker Prime 300W Power Bank

Finally, there's a power bank that's got enough juice and throughput to charge up your entire mobile office. Anker claims its Prime 300W Power Bank can charge two laptops and your phone all at once. The Anker app will also let you determine which devices you want to prioritize during an emergency charge.

Laifen T1 Pro

Nothing says high-end like some aerospace-grade, sand-blasted aluminum alloy. Laifen knows that, which is why it made the T1 Pro with one single piece of airplane-grade metal. The result is a sleek but sturdy shaver that is designed to last—and would probably make Jony Ive proud as hell.

Polar Loop

As much as fitness bands like those made by Whoop are great for anyone that doesn't want another screen in their life, adding another subscription is just as bad. If you want a screenless fitness wearable, this one from Polar does what Whoop does but without the annual fee. It looks comfier, too.

Inmo Air 3

The sprint towards functinal and powerful AR glasses is in full swing and Inmo's AIr 3 is proof. Inmo officially launched a kickstarter campaign to make 1080p glasses with a smart ring that controls UI for apps and multiple interactive windows. It's a different approach from Meta and its alleged wristband, and unlike anything we've seen yet.

SwitchBot Kata

SwitchBot's Kata asks, “What if a stuffed animal had an on-device LLM?” That may not be a question most have thought to ask, but this wheeled robot is pushing boundaries. According to SwitchBot, this little guy even experiences jealousy. Can your non-AI-equipped plushie feel jealousy? We thought so.

Lenovo ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept

Lenovo stands on its own when it comes to showing off wild computer concepts that may never see the light of day—and we love them for it because the ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept is something you won't find from other companies. The screen flips from horizontal to landscape, which is useful for developers and honestly just for reading a website or social feed without having to constantly scroll the trackpad. It's just a concept, but there's even room to prop up a phone when the screen is flipped so you can always keep an eye on TikTok, though you may wanna just doomscroll on the bigger vertical display instead.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","I Used a $400 Smart Toaster to Make Pop-Tarts and All I Got Was a Tummy Ache","https://gizmodo.com/i-used-a-400-smart-toaster-to-make-pop-tarts-and-all-i-got-was-a-tummy-ache-2000649893","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 11:00:32 GMT","

As much as I love my makeshift smart home, the idea of a house where everything is internet-connected sometimes borders on the absurd. In today's age, we have smart everything: smart fridges, smart ovens, smart vacuums, smart microwaves, smart coffee makers, and, of course, the venerable smart toaster. It's tales of this last one that I'm going to regale you with today, since I know you're simply burning up inside (pun intended), not knowing whether you should throw your tried-and-true toasting machine of choice in the trash and take one giant, crumb-laden step into the future.

To help us explore said future, we have before us Revolution's R180 Connect Plus Smart Toaster. Like any smart gadget worth mentioning, the R180 centers around a giant touchscreen slapped on the front of the toaster. This is where the smarts come in. Here you'll find all sorts of options for toasting that include an eye-watering 38 bread types, all with seven levels of doneness displayed in varying shades of brown. To be honest, I didn't even realize how many different things there were to toast until I started tapping through the pages on the R180. There's an option for white bread, of course, but also waffles, hamburger buns, English muffins, bagels, and (my favorite) LARGE bagels. There's even an option for pancakes, which I'm told can be bought frozen at the store, a fact I did not know. And speaking of frozen stuff, there are options when you're getting toasty to cook something that's fresh, frozen, or to reheat.

Revolution R180 Connect Plus Smart Toaster

You don't need a smart toaster. No one does.

Pros

Cons

It's hard to say what separates all of these options from one another, but it's clear that Revolution did actually focus on the heating element of the R180 and not just the flashy screen stuff. That's evidenced by the fact that this toaster has a copyrighted heating tech called InstaGLO, which Revolution claims “heats in seconds” and sears bread rather than roasting the life out of it. The subtlety of the R180's heating coils is meant to toast the outside of the bread without drying it out, according to Revolution, and I will say, at first glance, the coils do look different than your run-of-the-mill toaster. Namely, they're more slight and spindly, which may be how they get so hot so fast. And as to the claim that it toasts bread without drying it out, I think it does a decent job, though not all the time.

For your bread-and-butter white toast (I'll see myself out for that double entendre), it does a good job. The brioche I cooked with the “white bread” setting was nice and browned on the outside using the default doneness setting, but was actually a little steamy on the inside. When I switched that setting to “gluten-free,” however, it kind of burned the crap out of the bread, though maybe that's more to do with the bread than the toaster. It did an okay job with Pop-Tarts, but let's be honest, that's pretty hard to mess up. Unrelated to the toasting process, I did wind up with a tummy ache, but I think that's what's supposed to happen when you put that many preservatives in your body. This level of variability between toast outcomes, while not ideal if you don't choose the right setting, is kind of a sign that the toaster is working. There are differences in the preset toast settings, and they have a demonstrable difference on the final product. I'll give you an example.

See R180 Connect Plus Smart Toaster at Amazon

For shits and giggles, I decided to try and toast a piece of the brioche bread under the artisan bread setting. I mean, what is “artisan,” anyway? How do I know who made this bread? Maybe it came from a family of bakers in Brooklyn. Maybe there's an independent bread seller going door-to-door trying to grow their gluten empire. Whatever. Maybe I was bending the rules. The important part is I tried it, and the results were… smokey. Trying to toast the brioche under the artisan bread setting was not a good idea, since it started to burn the toast to the point that I cancelled the function early for fear that I would smoke my office kitchen out. On one hand, yikes, but on the other, there's clearly a major difference in heat and timing between settings that makes presets more tailored to certain things. And that's the whole damn point.

Altogether, I tested three different things: Pop-Tarts (since there's a specific pastry setting for that), gluten-free bread (there's also a setting for that), and brioche white bread. It did a pretty decent job toasting all three of those and was responsive when I selected the browness level. I'm not sure who needs to optimize their Pop-Tart toasting, but if that's your jam, then your time has finally arrived. An unexpected perk of toasting with this thing is that there are no jump scares. When you press “start” on the screen, the bread descends into the depths of the toaster like Han Solo post-carbonite. Similarly, when the toast is done (there's a circle countdown on the screen, and it flashes the last 10 seconds like the ball in Times Square is about to drop), it rises, born again as slightly burned bread.

Again, as with any proper smart appliance in 2025, there are lots of things you absolutely do not need, but since the internet is inside this thing… why not, I guess. One of those things that you don't really need is the weather. By entering your city into the toaster, you can get local weather. Revolution claims that this toaster does not collect data on you, though I can't verify if that's true or not. If you're buying this smart toaster, you're going to have to just take their word for it. Another frivolous but fun (I guess?) smart feature is a digital photo album that you can set to cycle through pics when you're not busy toasting stuff. I uploaded some of myself to the toaster using the provided QR code, and, honestly, this screen is kind of nice? No one needs this, but this toaster panel is not total garbage. Good job, Revolution!

One thing I don't love about the smart features is that there's no way to do certain stuff via an app or some kind of web-based interface. Using the touchscreen works surprisingly fine, but sometimes there are things you'd rather do on your phone, like enter your Wi-Fi network. When I went to enter my office Wi-Fi into the toaster, it said that it was connected, but I couldn't actually go online because of added security. With a phone, I may have been prompted to enter the necessary credentials and would have been able to get online without using my colleague's hotspot. That's a minor complaint, to be clear. Most people won't encounter that problem since they'll be setting these things up at home, but the option to use a phone or another device would have been nice.

I'll be honest, I'm not sure what anyone wants out of a smart toaster or if anyone wants anything at all. There are mostly two camps of people when they witness the R180. One of them is intrigued (i.e., wow! what is that?) and then mildly entertained by the existence of a smart toaster. The other is near-viscerally offended that smart appliances have gone this far (i.e., did we really need to reinvent toast?). One friend of mine told me he “had to go to the doctor” after seeing me post about it on my Instagram. No matter which camp you belong to, both share one thing: they're equally as disgusted by the price.

This, at the end of the day, is a $400 toaster, and there's just no getting around that. For everything that it does right, or does uniquely, no one needs a smart toaster, and no one needs to spend hundreds of dollars toasting bread. Okay, maybe if you buy one of those fancy Japanese ones that steams at the same time (those are notably $100 less than this, by the way). But if you want one, who am I to stop you? You can tap and swipe your way into a bready bliss. I'll be on the sidelines turning bread into that nice crumbly stuff the old-fashioned way, one toasty jump scare at a time.

          This is the tech that most impressed us at IFA 2025 in Berlin.
        


          Dog got out? Left your phone somewhere? Those can be automation triggers.
        


          The Deebot X11 OmniCyclone can't climb stairs, but it should make your floors less dusty.
        


          The Eufy MarsWalker could let your robot vacuum slip into something more comfortable (for climbing stairs).
        


          What's next? A smart bulb that's also a security camera? Oh, wait, Wyze already did that.
        


          Govee also has a new TV backlight with a camera that will look at the TV as intensely as you do.

The big reason we have a Deadpool film trilogy is because of leaked test footage for the first movie back in 2014. It's since become generally agreed upon that leading man Ryan Reynolds probably had something to do with it, and now the actor himself has gone and said he leaked it, yeah.

Talking to Entertainment Weekly at TIFF, Reynolds said the leak may have been “cheating,” but done with the best of intentions. “I think I was onto something that people would be interested in,” he told the outlet. As he and director Tim Miller went about shooting the footage, Fox became squirrely about doing an R-rated superhero movie starring an obscure character, particularly one they'd already done badly once before.

For Reynolds, the appeal of Deadpool was that he wasn't an upper-tier character, and his fourth wall-breaking self-awareness. “It was kind of new,” he said of the character's demeanor. “The test footage…really was a case study of how this could work. And they just wouldn't do anything with it.” When said footage leaked, he recalled thinking about “the asshole [that] leaked it, and I'm looking at the guy in the mirror brushing my teeth. And I'm like, ‘Dude, what have you done? This could be punishable by law!' But the internet forced the studio to say, ‘We're gonna make this movie,' and 24 hours later, that movie had a green light.”

Since the first Deadpool, Reynolds has become a key creative force in the character's live-action outings, which have gone on to make a lot of money and help start a wave of R-rated superhero material. Now, people know Deadpool like they do Spider-Man (and both may be in the next Avengers movies), and has become the actor's definitive role. So congrats to Reynolds for his foresight and hustle?

Fast food firm quickly fixed vulnerabilities of whopping proportions, but didn't acknowledge the white-hat hackers.

Ethical hackers BobDaHacker and BobTheShoplifter have detailed their claim that they uncovered “catastrophic” vulnerabilities in multiple platforms hosted by Restaurant Brands International (RBI). While RBI may not be a very familiar name, this lax security means that systems powering mega brands like Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes, with over 30,000 locations worldwide, and all were almost trivially easy to hack. “Their security was about as solid as a paper Whopper wrapper in the rain,” snarks the BobDaHacker blog, sharing the full technical exposé (the blog has since been taken down, but it's archived here).

 




The vulnerabilities found were a big deal, as we will detail below, including allowing the duo to access employee accounts, ordering systems, and listen to recorded drive-thru conversations, among other exploits. Despite this, the ethical hacking duo that responsibly informed RBI of the flaws were never acknowledged.

We mentioned the three big fast food brands in the intro, and the two Bobs found that every one of their assistant platform domains shared the same vulnerabilities. The domains were https://assistant.bk.com, https://assistant.popeyes.com, and https://assistant.timhortons.com, and they could all be easily exploited, across all the group's 30,000+ locations worldwide. Once in the systems, a hacker could easily:

The BobDaHacker blog makes the discovery of the multitude of gaping security holes seem almost trivial. Firstly, it is claimed that the ‘Anyone Can Join This Party' signup API allowed anyone in, as the web dev team had “forgot to disable user signups.”

Subsequently, using GraphQL introspection, an “even easier signup endpoint that completely bypassed email verification” was unearthed. The resulting email of the password – in plain text – meant the two Bobs were “impressed by the commitment to terrible security practices.”

After authentication, the white-hat hackers were able to uncover store employee personal information, internal IDs, configuration details, and more. Furthermore, a GraphQL mutation called createToken allowed the (thankfully) ethical due to “promote ourselves to admin status across the entire platform.”

RBI's catalog of security errors didn't end there. A quick detour to RBI's equipment ordering website earned the prize of discovering a self-install device ordering system where the password was hard coded into the HTML.

A similar security gaffe was found in the drive-through tablet interfaces in outlets. They had password protection, but the two Bobs show this was also hard coded as ‘admin' – who'd've guessed that?

 




Adding another teetering cherry to this deliciously vulnerable cake, the ethical hackers discovered they could access the full raw audio files of people ordering food at the outlet drive-throughs. Sometimes that audio included personally identifiable information. Interestingly, RBI feeds these recordings to AI-based systems to weigh customer and employee metrics.

It didn't end there, as the hackers found the code for the restaurant chains' bathroom rating screens. It apparently crossed their minds to “give a 5-star review to a bathroom in Tokyo while sitting in your pajamas in Ohio,” but as staunchly white-hat operatives, that, of course, didn't happen.

Last but not least, the BobDaHacker blog insists that “no customer data was retained during this research,” with responsible disclosure protocols followed throughout the process. However, we wonder whether these recent experiences influenced their parting shot, which cheekily asserts that “Wendy's is better.”

Undersea breaks on SEA-ME-WE 4 and IMEWE systems disrupted Microsoft's Middle East transit over the weekend.

Microsoft was forced to reroute Azure traffic on Saturday, September 6, after two major submarine cable systems were severed in the Red Sea, triggering latency spikes and degraded performance for cloud users across South Asia and the Gulf. The company confirmed the disruption via Azure system status messages just before 06:00 UTC, saying customers whose traffic normally passes through the Middle East “may experience service disruptions.”

Those reroutes currently remain in effect, with Microsoft noting that they expect “higher latency on some traffic” into September 7 as regional carriers continue to triage routes. Cloud operations outside the affected path remain unaffected, but workloads relying on Asia-Europe connectivity may still feel the impact.

The damage occurred on the SEA-ME-WE-4 and IMEWE cable systems, both of which run through the high-risk corridor near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The location and systems were first flagged by NetBlocks, which attributed the disruption to a “series of subsea cable outages” causing Internet slowdowns in Pakistan, India, and parts of the Gulf. Microsoft has not named the specific cables involved.

From a technical perspective, these aren't just any cables: They're two of the main long-haul systems connecting Asia to Europe, carrying traffic not only for consumer Internet but also hyperscalers like Google and Meta. Losing just one of these critical pathways can overload alternate routes, spike latency, and increase packet loss across various cloud-dependent applications, such as multiplayer gaming and large file downloads.

Microsoft engineers have rerouted traffic via alternative, longer paths while monitoring network telemetry. Repair ships for undersea cables are scarce, however, and the Red Sea remains a geopolitically sensitive area, making any physical repairs an inevitably slow process. Such repairs can take weeks because repair crews must precisely locate themselves above the damaged cable.

This isn't the first time that the Red Sea has caused headaches. In February 2024, multiple submarine cables, including AE-1, SEACOM, and EIG, were damaged by an unknown cause. Due to the sensitivity of the location, cable operators are currently unable to give a timeline for full repairs, but it was reported in July 2024 that repairs were completed on the AAE-1 cable. In January 2025, the same cable suffered a shunt fault off the coast of Qatar, which was resolved two weeks later.

As of now, Azure remains operational, but enterprises reliant on cross-region connectivity between Europe, South Asia, and the Middle East should brace for slower connections in the meantime.

Just the latest in the series of hollow 4090s.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


It's not often we see a repair video that includes no repairing, but that's exactly what happened when an Asus TUF RTX 4090 landed on the legendary desks of Northridge Fix. We've covered their escapades before, how they revived a RX 7800 XT and brought a dead 4090 back to life, but this 4090 befell a fate worse than death — it was a hollow scam.

The unlucky customer, who got the card second-hand off eBay, couldn't get their GPU to post no matter what. As such, they sent it in for repair with a brief note explaining: ""The device does not display from any output."" When it was opened up to be inspected, Alex, our host, found something truly harrowing. There were no GPU core or VRAM chips on the PCB. While the card looked fine from the outside, it was really just a skeleton.

Alex went on to explain how this has become a common occurrence, saying that his repair shop receives dead RTX 4090s like these all the time with stripped internals. These cards are sold for cheap on used marketplaces, where uninformed buyers often fall for the unrealistic prices. Even then, some of these bad actors have started to price these hollow 4090s ""properly"" such that no one would expect a too-good-to-be-true scam, so the trap evidently still works.

GPUs like this largely come from underground modding operations in China, where many high-end GPUs are not easy to import. Skilled technicians take existing gaming-grade GPUs, like a 4090, and surgically remove their core and VRAM so put them on custom PCBs with upgraded components-most often higher VRAM capacity. Stripped donor cards subsequently make their way onto online marketplaces and trick buyers into buying useless graphics cards.

 




There's a whole history of such incidents, like last year when someone received an MSI RTX 4090 in Hong Kong without a cord and only two VRAM chips onboard. In China itself, a repair person received 4090s that were just modified 3090s and 3080s with engravings made to look like a 4090. Perhaps the most insane case was when someone bought a working 4090 from eBay, removed its core and VRAM, and returned it to the seller, essentially performing a reverse-scam of sorts.

Therefore, it's important to stay vigilant while buying used GPU, especially high-end ones. That's what Alex reiterated at the end of his video. If you're dealing with someone you don't know, exercise caution and try to go for extended warranties if you can for peace of mind. Make sure to stress-test the GPU to ensure there's no hidden weaknesses that might pop up later and spoil your purchase.

A more powerful ‘Tiny11 core Builder' has also been released, but this 'quick and dirty development testbed' won't be for most users.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Windows bloat hater NTDEV has released an updated version of Tiny11 Builder, a tool which facilitates the creation of minimal and decluttered Windows 11 installs. The headlining changes presented here are the tool's ability to remove Copilot, the new Outlook client, and Teams. But there's much more. NTDEV says that Tiny11 Builder is now ready for Windows 11 25H2, despite Microsoft's whack-a-mole attempts to push unwanted apps onto your storage.

It's been quite a while (and for that I deeply apologize), but the new release of tiny11 builder is finally here!simplifying the process a bit while also tackling apps like Copilot, the new Outlook and Teams (they're like whack-a-mole!). It also makes the entire image smaller! pic.twitter.com/RL2bAO4ypCSeptember 5, 2025

The latest release of Tiny11 Builder is claimed to be compatible with “all Windows 11 SKUs, all languages (at least in theory), for both x64 and arm64.” Moreover, it has been tested on the latest Windows 11 24H2, 25H2, as well as Canary Build 27934 releases.

The developer notes that, as well as the new features mentioned, this latest release fixes a few bugs, and promises updated script generated disk images will be “much smaller.” It is explained that the space-saving is largely due to the use of Microsoft's LZMS compression.

If you are interested in the goings-on behind the scenes of this tool, we recommend that you visit the Tiny11 Builder GitHub page. There it is explained that this tool is simply a PowerShell script dubbed tiny11maker.ps1. When executed, the script will pare down a fresh official Windows ISO which can be grabbed directly from Microsoft.

There is just one executable required, if you wish to sidestep the Windows 11 system requirements. In such a case, you will use oscdimg.exe, which is provided in the Windows ADK, and is used to create bootable ISO images.

Last but not least, an “unattended answer file” is included in the distribution, so that users can enjoy a zero-friction bypass of the Microsoft Account OOBE.

There's also a more powerful ‘Tiny11 core Builder' being made available alongside this new release. But please be aware that this core release is flagged as being “for testing purposes only,” and “a quick and dirty development testbed.” The core release can make Windows 11 images much smaller, it is claimed, but sacrifices some serviceability features.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","Keto diet may affect aging speed differently in males and females","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/keto-diet-may-affect-aging-speed-differently-males-females-estrogen-inflammation","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 07:36:48 GMT","

The popular ketogenic, or keto, diet may accelerate the aging process, suggest studies in animals. According to a new murine, or mouse, study, this effect of the diet is primarily restricted to males.

The study suggests that estrogen protects female mice consuming a keto diet from the risk of accelerated aging.

The authors of the study say the keto diet produces excess oxidative stress, which speeds up cellular aging through the production of senescent cells. They found that treating the male mice in their study with estrogen or estradiol and antioxidant agents eliminated this rapid cell aging.

The study is published in Cell Reports.

“The keto diet is a very low-carbohydrate, high fat way of eating that shifts the body's primary energy source from carbohydrates to fat. Under normal conditions, carbohydrates are the body's preferred fuel, especially for the brain,” explained Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, preventive cardiology dietitian at EntirelyNourished.com.

When the body lacks the carbohydrates it normally uses for fuel, it breaks down dietary fats into molecules called “ketones.” She said these “serve as an alternative energy source for both the brain and the body.”

To reduce the intake of carbohydrates and support the supply of fats, therefore, the keto diet promotes consumption of “high fat, very low-carbohydrate foods such as animal proteins, full-fat dairy, healthy fats, and non-starchy vegetables,” according to Routhenstein.

People on the keto diet are encouraged to eat fewer carbohydrate-rich foods such as grains, fruits, starchy vegetables, legumes, and added sugars.

As a long-term eating regimen, the keto diet is associated with several risks.

Routhenstein noted the keto diet limits “fruits, whole grains, some vegetables, and legumes, limiting intake of essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which can affect negatively gut, brain, and heart health.”

There are also concerns regarding increased cholesterol and soft arterial plaques, strained kidney and liver function, and an increased risk of bone loss.

In addition, the diet may lead to disordered eating and social isolation.

The keto diet has also been linked to increased oxidative stress, and the resulting increase in cellular senescence was investigated in the current study.

Much of the research regarding diets has focused on males' responses to their effects. This is at least partially due to the relative complexities of female and male bodies and how they may affect responses to diets. An example would be the dynamic changes that occur within the female body across a woman's estrous cycle, as opposed to a man's body, which appears to be hormonally much the same all the time.

Jason Ng, MD, BA, teaches endocrinology and metabolism in the Department of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.

“It would be interesting,' he said, “to assess the effects of diet on male and female sex hormones, such as estrogen for women and testosterone for men, and how diets may play a role in increasing or decreasing levels to a certain extent, and how that impacts the role these hormones have on their specific genders' physiology.”

Ng noted that the insights suggested in this study of mice, however, must be viewed as preliminary.

“Although we can gain insight into metabolic processes through studies defining effects of a keto diet in mice, we do not yet extrapolate those findings in humans,” Ng said.

“There is much more heterogeneity in the findings of effects in humans, and gender effects are likely more varied as well, compared to mice data across genders,” he noted.

“If these results can be replicated in human beings, there is the possibility of this specific effect reducing the age acceleration in males, although this would, of course, have to be weighed against known side effects of estrogen therapy in men,” said Ng.

He added that it is unknown whether this therapy would need to be continued after the person had discontinued a keto diet.

Considering that the mechanism behind the increase in senescent cells appears in the study to be oxidative stress, might a purely antioxidant therapy be similarly effective for men on a keto diet?

“I think a purely anti-oxidant approach could also help reduce the aging effect to some degree,” hypothesized Ng.

“Maybe not as much of an influence as estrogen,” he suggested, “but certainly something that would be worthy of investigating more, as this approach could have a potentially lower side effect profile.”

“In some cases, particularly for specific medical conditions like epilepsy, a medically supervised keto or modified low carb approach can be beneficial,” Routhenstein pointed out.

“A cyclical or more flexible low carb plan may also work for certain individuals when guided by a qualified healthcare provider,” she said.

“[T]o remain in true ketosis, carbohydrate intake must stay extremely low, something that is very difficult to maintain long term without compromising nutritional adequacy. As a cardiovascular dietitian and based on the current research, I do not recommend a ketogenic diet as a long-term heart-healthy strategy.”— Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD

“The potential risks outweigh the benefits, especially when more balanced, sustainable approaches are available and have been shown to improve heart health, inflammation, and longevity,” Routhenstein concluded.

It probably did not take a formal ceremony this weekend to ensure no San Diego Wave player would ever wear the number 13 again. Not when that player—Alex Morgan—was the club's first big star, first to score a hat trick and 15 goals in a season, and first former player to join the ownership group. And that is just a quick overview of Alex Morgan's life since 2022.

The reality of Alex Morgan is that she has been in our lives since the turn of the 2010s, and there is no sign of her leaving any time soon. Women's soccer first came to the forefront three decades ago and the game in the United States has seen many stars come and go on the field. Few have had the staying power of Morgan.

It has been a year since Morgan walked away as a player. At the time she was struggling to score goals and retirement came with news she was pregnant. It still came as a shock. She has since found time to become a Wave minority owner, and it certainly appears she will be more than a figurehead.

It is remarkable to think about all the ways Morgan has delivered for the game of soccer. It is easy to remember the famous Megan Rapinoe to Abby Wambach equalizer against Brazil in the 2011 World Cup quarterfinals. But buried in that history is how close the United States came to missing that World Cup altogether. The most important goal along the way came from a 21-year-old Alex Morgan, a stoppage time winner in November of 2010 to lift up a wrecked U.S. team in the intercontinental playoff away leg in Padua.

Remember the epic Olympic semifinal at Old Trafford when Canada led three times only to be undone by a resilient U.S. side and some questionable officiating? It was Morgan who beat Erin McLeod with a header in stoppage time of extra time to send the U.S. through a gold medal match they would win over Japan.

When the National Women's Soccer League kicked off in 2013, Morgan was a clear choice to be one of the faces. The Thorns made her one of three Americans “allocated” by U.S. Soccer. The Thorns immediately became the model club in the league and took down the inaugural championship.

The Thorns were the first of three NWSL clubs to hitch their early fortunes to Alex Morgan. The initial plan called for Orlando to join the league in 2017. But the new owners knew that it was time for Morgan to move on from Portland, and they wanted her as the cornerstone. Her tenure in Orlando was a bit hit-and-miss from a soccer perspective, but her presence in the inaugural Pride team made the club an immediate marquee attraction.

Six years after the Pride, in came the Wave. And they wanted Morgan. And Morgan wanted to live in California again. It was a match made in heaven. In the Wave's first regular season home match, Morgan scored four goals. By season's end she had scored 15 for the Golden Boot and the expansion side not only made the playoffs but won its quarterfinal on an extra time goal—by Alex Morgan. In 2023 the Wave won the Shield.

Along the way, Morgan was the pretty, marketable face of the NWSL and U.S. national team where she was rarely out of favor through the 2023 World Cup. She was always smiling, always accommodating. She rarely turned down an interview, even in the worst of times after big losses. Time will tell the story, but early on in her life as an owner, it appears Morgan will still be available, still willing to put her face on the sport she has carried at times.

But perhaps Morgan's greatest contribution to the NWSL was carved out behind a keyboard. As the league reeled from the bombshell reports of sexual coercion from Paul Riley's tenure with the Thorns, the usual bevy of statements, denials, and promises were being slung around the Internet. Morgan posted a screenshot of an email then-commissioner Lisa Baird had sent to Mana Shim, informing her that a prior investigation into Riley was closed and would not be revisited.

From that moment on, there were no more denials. The league had not covered up the story, but had actively attempted to keep it buried. Baird's tenure as commissioner was no longer viable and she soon resigned under pressure. Much of the NWSL's explosive growth in the four years since can be traced to that moment of reckoning.

It was just Alex Morgan, delivering for the sport as she has always done.

The USMNT's woes continue, as they fall 2-0 to South Korea in a friendly played in New Jersey on Saturday. (0:43)

HARRISON, New Jersey -- You can say this about the United States men's national team: They are singing from the same songbook of positivity, even as the players looked like they're far from being on the same page in a 2-0 defeat to South Korea.

U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino said his team was ""better than South Korea"" because it created more chances and allowed just one shot on target in the second half. Midfielder Tyler Adams added that getting new faces into the national team and bringing back some old standbys was a positive. ""I don't think it was a bad performance,"" the U.S. captain added.

This isn't to say that Pochettino & Co. should be ripping each other in front of the assembled press, but the public pronouncements flew in the face of the available evidence.

The Taegeuk Warriors stretched the U.S. defense from the outset, going direct at first to Son Heung-Min, but that only served to soften up the Americans' midfield and back line, and soon enough there was space underneath to be exploited. Lee Jae-Sung, under zero pressure, found U.S. defender Tristan Blackmon on an island, and his through ball found Son in stride to fire past goalkeeper Matt Freese in the 18th minute. Then just before halftime a clever combination put Son through on goal. He was upended by Freese, only for Lee Dong-Gyeong to backheel the loose ball into the net.

On both goals, the U.S. backline was stretched too far apart, leaving defenders isolated. U.S. defender Tim Ream didn't dispute that assertion.

""There were moments where guys were getting pulled [out] a little bit more than we usually do and a little bit more than we work on,"" Ream said. ""And again, it's one of those things that you look at a few guys who it's their first game back with the national team. Tristan [Blackmon], it's his very first game, first cap, so it was bound to happen a little bit, I think a little bit of eagerness to try to get to areas that we maybe necessarily couldn't get to.""

While Blackmon is deserving of criticism, this goes beyond one player making his U.S. debut. Sergiño Dest didn't offer much help defensively, showing that for all of his attacking ability, he can still be a defensive liability. The midfield was at fault as well, offering little in terms of backline protection, and was much too passive.

""I think our roles got a little bit twisted,"" Adams said. ""They found solutions pretty easily in the first half. We talked about it at halftime. ... And I think we just missed our [defensive] triggers on a lot of them and we were a little bit too late to jump, and when you're too late to jump, you end up chasing shadows, and that's what it felt like at times.""

There was improvement in the second half, especially around the hour mark, when the U.S. brought in defender Chris Richards -- who Pochettino said wasn't fully fit -- and went to a three-man back line (a formation the coach hinted that he might use again in the future.) But the U.S. could never find the one goal to make South Korea sweat -- with Richards and fellow substitute Folarin Balogun missing clear chances -- even as the home side finished the match with a 17-5 shot advantage. With the two-goal cushion, South Korea never had to open up and have its defense exposed.

All of this is why it's hard to take too many positives away from the match. It's also difficult to not feel alarm over the direction this U.S. team is heading. Ask yourself, when was the last time the U.S. delivered an impressive performance against a World Cup-caliber opponent? The 0-0 draw against England at the 2022 World Cup? The subsequent 1-0 win over Iran? It's hard to think of any match since then. Certainly not in the year that Pochettino has been in charge.

Pochettino tried to explain the defeat by pointing out that players like Son are world-class. Indeed, the LAFC attacker is, and he tormented the U.S. defense. But the 2026 World Cup will be littered with such players. It's not like the U.S. will get a break from that kind of competition next summer.

Pochettino even went so far as to say that results won't be important until next summer's World Cup, recalling how the 2002 Argentina team he was part of entered the tournament on a roll, only to flame out in the group stage. Granted, pre-World Cup form isn't a guarantee of anything. But hosting a World Cup on home soil is a rare opportunity to drive the sport forward in this country. Generating some momentum will not only do that, but also instill some confidence in a side that is at a low ebb.

""I mean, I love the feeling of winning, so I would like to win games before the World Cup,"" Adams said. ""But I understand [Pochettino's] thought process and we talked about it in there is you could still have good performances and not necessarily get the result. But yeah, I think at a certain time it's important to have some results.""

Part of the issue is that preparation time for the World Cup is evaporating, yet Pochettino seems to think that there is time to still hunt for different players. That's a laudable goal, and one that would make perfect sense in a normal World Cup cycle. But this cycle has been compressed from the get-go, given that the last World Cup didn't happen until the end of 2022. Combined with the coaching change that saw Pochettino hired, this cycle is anything but normal.

The combinations of players aren't always making sense, either. Last cycle, the pairing of Tim Weah and Dest on the right side worked because Weah is a player willing to track back and provide some defensive protection. Pairing Christian Pulisic and Dest on the same side risks exposing the U.S. defense. You don't want Pulisic having to track back anyway. But it was no accident that South Korea's first goal came from Dest's side. He was left ball-watching on the second.

In many ways, Pochettino is taking an immense gamble. He's betting that he'll find the necessary on-field chemistry before the clock on his World Cup preparations runs out. That runs the risk of encountering scenarios at the tournament that he didn't prepare for with his first-choice players, all because he's giving reps to performers that are long shots to make the squad.

For now, Pochettino insists that wins are just around the corner.

""I think the results will arrive soon for sure,"" he said.

What's still unknown is which corner. The hope is that it starts on Tuesday against Japan.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Mauricio Pochettino couldn't help but love American college football when he experienced the vibrant atmosphere at the opening weekend clash between Ohio State and Texas, as he pleaded with supporters of the U.S. men's national team to try replicate that sensation.

A week after his college football trip, the USMNT head coach found himself behind the podium after a 2–0 loss to South Korea, practically begging American fans to come out and support the team at home. 

“Please come more [to the games],” Pochettino urged fans after the match, the USMNT's seventh loss against a top 30 opponent in their last eight games. “My message to the fans is that we're going to arrive at the World Cup in the best condition and we're going to be difficult to defeat.”

While the USMNT have played plenty of home matches through the Concacaf Gold Cup, Nations League and international friendlies, their own fans are often outnumbered by those supporting other teams. 

The American results aren't lending themselves to inspiring new support, either.

Oftentimes, it's Mexico or other North and South American opponents, but on Saturday, Sports Illustrated Stadium was packed to capacity, the majority of which were supporting South Korea, roaring in excitement in particular when LAFC superstar Son Heung-min touched the ball. 

“It was like a home match,” South Korea head coach Hong Myung-bo admitted through a translator. “I appreciate the fans.”

Playing in front of “away crowds” at home games has become commonplace for the USMNT, and for Pochettino, addressing the supporters has also become a habit. 

At the Concacaf Nations League in March, where the U.S. lost to Panama and Canada, he urged fans to have patience after his players were booed off the pitch. 

“I don't want that the people feel pessimistic,” he said at the time, before the USMNT was booed again by Guatemala and Mexican supporters on American soil at the Gold Cup later on in the summer. “We are all dissapointed and the fans need to feel the disappointment that we didn't win. But I don't want to allow [them] to feel pessimistic, because I think we have good players.”

But, it was the idea of a college football atmosphere which piqued Pochettino's interest. For him, it's a dream for the USMNT in the leadup to the 2026 World Cup on home soil, an event which will utilize several college and NFL stadiums. 

“The fans have one year to realize how important fans are in soccer,” Pochettino said ahead of the South Korea match. “I think I feel a little bit of responsibility. It's our responsibility to translate to all these people that maybe are more focused on another sport like American football. It's to try to convince them to share that passion with soccer.

“If only a little bit we can translate to our sport, I think our players will appreciate it a lot, and for sure the fans will help us to achieve or earn what we want.”

USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino is ‘jealous' of college football atmospheres — and wants to see the same at USMNT games, after going to the Ohio State vs. Texas game.“For me, it was a massive surprise. I'm 53. It's difficult to have this type of surprise. But to live the… pic.twitter.com/2qeaT70yQW

While Pochettino's dream of marching bands and crowds cresting 70,000 may be a fantasy at this point, it is based in reality, but could come with several challenges. USMNT matches can see high prices for tickets, making it often unaffordable for casual fans and those not enticed by the current run of form. Meanwhile, other detractors often surround matches. 

The Argentine head coach is unequivocally correct in wanting greater home support, but that is a challenge easier to wish for than achieved, and is an age-old question when it comes to the USMNT, given the interest in soccer from the multicultural makeup of the United States. 

However, if there is an opportunity for growth, it's now. The World Cup is looming, and Pochettino–– in some sense–– knows how important it could be as a formative moment. Now, he just wants fans to see the project, and maybe then, things could start going right on the pitch as well. 

“We need the people. We need the fans,” Pochettino said at the Gold Cup. “Football without fans? It's impossible.”

U.S. Open Men's Final

NFL Themed Connections: Sports Edition 

Today's News

HARRISON, N.J. — In the shadow of America's biggest city, nine months before America's World Cup, at 7:05 p.m. on a muggy Saturday evening here at Sports Illustrated Stadium, Tyler Adams wandered.

He wandered, alone, after his U.S. men's national team lost 2-0 against South Korea. He wandered, and looked around, and surely saw stands full of World Cup hype.

But the hype wasn't for the USMNT. The thousands of fans still there were Koreans. Many were Americans, too, but they'd stuck around to salute only one team, their team, the Korean national team — the away team in technical terms only.

“It was like a home match,” South Korea head coach Hong Myung-bo said through an interpreter after the match.

And it fell in line with a trend that now spans the globe.

The USMNT, over the past three years, has now been a quasi-away team on home soil against opponents from all five major soccer continents, with respect to Oceania. Its fans were outnumbered by Morocco supporters in Cincinnati, by Colombia supporters in Maryland, by Turkey supporters in Connecticut, by Guatemala supporters in St. Louis, by Mexico supporters wherever they go, and now by South Korea supporters in New Jersey.

Those Korean fans enlivened Saturday's game with chants and inflatable boom sticks, with flags and joy.

They drowned out one solitary section of USMNT supporters, who, with the help of a stadium emcee and a drum, tried to build up to the game with a rhythmic clap; several seconds in, the claps could not be heard.

The Korean fans came in red T-shirts with “Korea” spelled in both English and Korean. They came in national team jerseys with the names of their heroes, Son Heung-min or Park Ji-sung, printed on the back. They came in Tottenham Hotspur and LAFC jerseys for Son. There were Bayern Munich and Napoli kits for Kim Min-jae. There was a Hwang Hee-chan Wolves jersey and a Lee Kang-in PSG shirt..

Occasionally, amid the seas of red, a Christian Pulisic jersey would appear. But roughly 75 or 80 percent of the 26,500 people who packed this MLS stadium seemingly had no interest in the USMNT. They roared when Korean players emerged for warmups and bowed to all sides of the arena. “Dae-han-min-guk,” clap clap, clap clap, clap, they chorused.

They were everywhere, in the stadium's upper deck, in the two sections either side of the U.S. supporters, in the expensive seats behind the benches. They were families and friends, young and old, boys and girls.

Some had split allegiances. One, for example, donned a U.S. kit with a Korean flag attached to his collar. But when the game began, they only had one team to cheer for.

U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino was asked about them after the match, and a couple months ago, during the Concacaf Gold Cup, he might have launched into a spiel about how U.S. fans needed to bring more passion. But here, he changed his tune.

“I want to be positive for now,” he said. “I want to say thank you to the fans that were here, our fans were amazing.”

Perhaps he changed his tune because he knows that to reverse this trend, to bring more stars and stripes to the stands, it's on him and his players to be better. Part of the trend is irreversible, inescapable in a country as diverse as the U.S., a country with so many immigrant communities that feel drawn to their native country's team because it represents a touchpoint with home. But part of it, too, is about the dullness of this current USMNT and its monotonous, meaningless runway toward the World Cup. Part of it is apathy.

On Saturday, stadium video boards played a U.S. hype video that hyped up no one. And the U.S. team played soccer that was equally uninspiring.

Korea, meanwhile, launched a regular cadence of attacks, and fans leapt from their seats each time.

They then erupted when Son scored the opening goal. They erupted again when Lee Dong-gyeong doubled the lead. They made noise all night.

And then, for minutes after the final whistle, they stayed put. They whipped out cameraphones as the Korean players took a lap of honor. They waved, and screamed, and craned their necks for a clear sight of those players, who clapped back at them, then bowed to acknowledge the support.

One team (and their fans) seem ready for the World Cup…

And their U.S. counterparts, outnumbered and beaten, trudged back to a locker room, far removed from any World Cup excitement.

HARRISON, N.J. — If ever there were an example of statistics not telling the story of a soccer game, then what we saw on Saturday was it. 

Based solely on the numbers, it would be easy to think that the Americans were done in by two goals that came against the run of play. The USMNT out-shot the Taegeuk Warriors 17-5. They had more efforts on target, more possession of the ball, more total passes and better pass accuracy. They had twice as many corners and fouls.

""Overall, I think we were better than South Korea,"" U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino said afterward.

Unfortunately for Pochettino and his players, that's not even close to being true. The visitors' superstar forward, Son Heung-min, put his side ahead just 17 minutes into the contest, much to the delight of the mostly red-clad crowd of 26,500 at Sports Illustrated Stadium. Son then set up a second goal for Lee Dong-gyeong before the first half was even finished. 

The Koreans were on cruise control the rest of the way, with the U.S. mustering mostly speculative half-chances before the final whistle mercifully blew, extending the Americans' run of futility over FIFA's 25 highest ranked sides. 

The day before Saturday's match, Pochettino said that results during this international window — the U.S. will face Japan in Columbus, Ohio on Tuesday — were secondary to ""how we are going to compete."" Yet while the Americans showed more fight than they did the last time European-based stars like Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah were with the squad in March, when they were upset by Panama in the Concacaf Nations League semifinals, they looked every bit as disjointed.

The Koreans, to be fair, are a far tougher foe. Pulisic was as ineffective as he was last spring despite skipping the Gold Cup over the summer to physically and mentally refresh, and despite another strong start to the season with Italian titan AC Milan. Except for second half substitute Folarin Balogun, who had three good chances to pull one back for the home side, the rest of the U.S. players also had a night to forget.

""We need to be sharp at all times, you know?,"" said Sergino Dest, who made his first international appearance since undergoing ACL surgery 18 months ago. Even though you play a pretty decent game, if you're not sharp for one second, you can get the goal against.""

Or in this case, two. On both Korean tallies, the U.S. back line was carved open far too easily. With No. 1 center back Chris Richards on the bench because of what Pochettino suggested was a minor physical issue, 29-year-old MLS lifer Tristan Blackmon made his USMNT debut and was caught out on Son's opener. (Richards eventually came on with 28 minutes of regular time remaining.) He  and Tim Ream, the Americans' 37-year-old captain, were both guilty of ball-watching on the backbreaking second strike.

""We utilized our speed,"" said Korean manager Hong Myung-bo. ""The opponent wasn't prepared for this, maybe.""

""Now,"" Ream said, ""You're having to chase the game.""

The U.S. was better in the second half but still couldn't pull even one goal back, let alone two.

""I am very disappointed about the result,"" Pochettino said. ""When you lose, it's difficult to find positive things.""

(Photo by John Dorton/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty Images) 

He tried his best anyway. When I asked Pochettino when winning some of the nine remaining friendlies before next summer's U.S. co-hosted World Cup becomes more important than competing or moral victories, the former Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain boss didn't hesitate.

""We need to start to win when the World Cup starts,"" noting that the Argentine squad he represented as a defender at the 2002 event beat all comers before that tournament, only to be eliminated in the group stage when it mattered most. 

""We want to grow, and we want to learn from this game,"" Pochettino said. ""We have talented players, we are going to be much better.

""That is my message to the fans,"" he added. ""We are going to arrive [at the World Cup] in a very good condition. And with the help of the fans, I think we are going to be very, very difficult to beat.""

That certainly wasn't the case on Saturday. On Tuesday, they'll get a chance to end the September window on a high. 

""I would like to win games before the World Cup,"" Adams said. ""I think at a certain time, it's important to have some results.""

Mauricio Pochettino insisted his United States side was the “better” team despite falling 2-0 to South Korea on Saturday in the latest demoralizing setback of the head coach's reign.

The USMNT has struggled since Pochettino took over just shy of a year ago, dimming optimism ahead of next summer's World Cup, and first-half goals from Son Heung-min and Lee Dong-gyeong set the tone for more disappointment in Harrison, N.J.

However, when quizzed in his post-match press conference, Pochettino had a rosy view of the defeat and claimed his team had outplayed the visitors.

“Overall, I think we were better than South Korea, but then if you are not clinical in your own area, and in the opposite box, it's difficult,” Pochettino said. “Because we create more chances, we have, you know, the feeling that we control the game.”

He continued: “I think we need to be positive, because in the second half the team played really well. We only conceded one shot on target and then the team showed character. I am so pleased in the way that we are evolving, from the Gold Cup today with different players, but also the players start to understand what we expect from them.

“I think the attitude was great, The capacity to be on the game after 2-0, that was difficult. I think it is (normal) to be disappointed with the result because you want to win, but I think we need to take the positive things and prepare now the game in Japan that is going to be similar.”

The USMNT meets Japan on Tuesday in Columbus, and has fewer than 10 matches with his full squad until the World Cup begins. This was Pochettino's third straight friendly defeat, having lost to Turkey and Switzerland prior to the Concacaf Gold Cup, which ended in a final defeat to archrival Mexico.

The World Cup is nine months away and the U.S. has not beaten a team in the top 25 of the FIFA ranking since the 2022 World Cup, according to TruMedia, but Pochettino was keen to stress that believes his squad will be ready to shine when the tournament arrives.

“We need to start to win when the World Cup starts,” he said. “(There are) too many examples of teams that win during (the previous) five years and then arrive at the World Cup and they don't arrive in the best condition. I was involved in 2002 with Argentina, we were beating (teams for) years and then (at) the World Cup and we were out in the group stage.”

He added: “I think for sure we have talented players and we are going to be much better and we are going to prove and for sure we are going to arrive in the best condition.

“That is my message to the fans. We are going to arrive in a very good condition and with the help (of) with the fans, I think we are going to be very, very difficult to beat.”

Pochettino added that he was “happy” with the performance of central defensive newcomer Tristan Blackmon, the Vancouver Whitecaps journeyman who was caught out by Son for Korea's opening goal.

“First game [for] Tristan, playing with Tim (Ream), I think he was really really good,” Pochettino said.

Ream, the veteran center back, echoed Pochettino's positivity.

“Yeah, we are,” Ream said, when asked if the team was making progress. “There's a lot of things that are going in the right direction and we feel as players that its starting, and things are really clicking in games. That second half is a good example.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","‘When the World Cup Starts'—Mauricio Pochettino Makes Bold Claim After Latest USMNT Loss","https://www.si.com/soccer/mauricio-pochettino-bold-claim-latest-usmnt-loss","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 09:05:00 GMT","

With less than 10 months until they kick off the 2026 FIFA World Cup at SoFi Stadium in LA, the U.S. men's national team doesn't have much confidence, but manager Mauricio Pochettino remains adamant things will turn around before the tournament begins.

On Saturday, they dropped their seventh of their last eight games against opposition ranked in the top 30, losing 2–0 to South Korea in a largely listless performance, with goals from Son Heung-min and Lee Dong-gyeong.

Looking exhausted and dejected, Pochettino seemed at a loss as well as his record in charge dipped to seven losses in 17 matches, with wins only against primarily weaker nations. 

“Overall, I think we were better than South Korea, but in the end, if you are not clinical, it's difficult,” he said post-match. “Because we created more chances and we had the feeling that we controlled the game.

“I am very disappointed about the result, but I think overall the performance is a massive improvement... I am so pleased in the way that we are evolving, from the Gold Cup today with different players, but also the players start to understand what we expect from them.”

While the U.S. held more possession, they struggled to control the tempo of the game and were caught on South Korea's counter attacks. At the same time, the American starters struggled to find rhythm, with debutant Tristan Blackmon appearing overwhelmed by his first cap and striker Josh Sargent managing just 17 touches in 64 minutes. 

The substitutes and adjustments saw some brighter moments for the U.S. in the second half, but the result only crept to its dejected end, even with a strong chance from Tim Weah in the fleeting minutes.

Even with some bright moments, Pochettino expressed his lack of desire for the team to get wins in friendlies, even as the U.S. Soccer Federation has lined up a bounty of top-tier opponents for the group to fine-tune themselves against in the lead-up to the World Cup.

“We need to start to win when the World Cup starts,” the Argentine manager said, seemingly dismissing the importance of building a winning rhythm before the tournament. 

“[There are] too many examples of teams that win during five years [before the tournament] and then arrive at the World Cup and they don't arrive in the best condition. I was involved in 2002 with Argentina, we were winning [for] years and then at the World Cup, and we were out in the group stage.”

However, that sentiment isn't shared entirely around the roster, with AFC Bournemouth midfielder and USMNT captain from Saturday, Tyler Adams, admitting: “I love the feeling of winning, so I'd like to win games before the World Cup. I understand his thought process, you can still have good performances and not get the result. But at a certain time, it's important to have some results.”

While the USMNT will likely have a different-looking lineup when they open the World Cup, the concerns around squad building and team cohesion were as evident as ever against South Korea. They will once again be tested against Japan on Tuesday. 

In the end, a coach and a team will be measured by their wins and losses, and that rings especially true for the USMNT in the lead-up to the World Cup, with no competitive matches to dispel the form in friendlies; however, Pochettino wants to see it.

“They need to believe, the message [to the fans] is they need to believe,” Pochettino said. “The important thing is at the start of the World Cup, we need to have everyone who is going to be on the roster in their best condition.”

International Football

HARRISON, N.J. — Mauricio Pochettino has been trying to solve what was a very real problem within the U.S. men's national team.

After March's Nations League debacle, the flaws of this U.S. group were laid bare. There was complacency. There needed to be a reset in mentality. There couldn't be untouchables.

Pochettino wanted to generate more competition within the squad. He needed his best players to not take their place for granted and his depth players to believe they had a chance to win a job.

“If we want to be a team, really competitive, we cannot nominate, OK, 13, 14, 16 players, these guys for sure they're going to arrive to the World Cup and the rest [only have] a few places to fight [for],” Pochettino said last week. “Come on. That is not the real sport that, for me, I call football, but now I start to call soccer because I work for (the) USA. … When you see different national teams that won World Cups, I think you really understand what (that means). Players need to feel the threat from your teammate, and they need to defend their place in every single possibility that you join the national team.”

But what we have to acknowledge after the Gold Cup — and after Saturday's 2-0 loss to South Korea at Sports Illustrated Stadium — is that the deeper problem, the reason the complacency started to set in, is the lack of true depth in the U.S. pool.

The U.S. isn't Argentina. It isn't a world power. It doesn't have the number of high-level players that the World Cup-winning countries have. And so there has to be trade-offs. You have to acknowledge the flaws of your best players and coax the best out of those individuals — and the team — despite them.

Pochettino's tinkering may have introduced a few new faces into the squad and even yielded a starter in Malik Tillman, but now it's time to bring together his full-strength team and find a way to motivate those players while he has them in camp.

Pochettino spun a positive take on Saturday's loss. He said the U.S. was the better team. It's hard to agree with that conclusion. Until wholesale changes in the second half, Korea felt in control of the match. But a truer assessment of Pochettino's outlook could be found in another answer, when he was asked what he would tell a fan base that is finding it increasingly difficult to believe this team can do something special at a home World Cup.

“Believe. You have to believe. The message is to believe,” Pochettino said. “The important thing is that we have to have all the best players we think should be on the roster at the start of the World Cup in top condition. … I think the possibility we have of calling up players who could be important in the World Cup, maybe today w're not in the best condition. I was just talking with Heung-min Son. We were talking about that situation. Right? That maybe we're a little short in some things and we need to have time for all those players to reach their best. So that when they can come and are called into the national team here, they can perform at their best.”

Pochettino left players at home so they could get settled at their new clubs, like Johnny Cardoso, Matt Turner, Tillman and Yunus Musah. He left players out so they could fight their way into more playing time or heal up completely from injury, such as Antonee Robinson and Weston McKennie.

A U.S. team with those players in the squad should make a significant difference.

You can debate the merits of some battles on the World Cup roster. There are very real conversations we can have about how competition is impacted by choices like Sean Zawadzki, Sebastian Berhalter and Jack McGlynn over Tanner Tessmann and Aidan Morris, or Tristan Blackmon over Mark McKenzie. But there is little room to question who the best players are in this pool.

We still haven't seen the optimal lineup for this U.S. team under Pochettino. Some of that has been by choice. Some of it is situational. Saturday's loss reinforced that it's long past time for that group to come together.

It doesn't feel like anything is being gained anymore by leaving people at home. It's no longer having the intended effect of fostering competition. With nine games left until the World Cup, we have to start seeing the team Pochettino alluded to in his answer about why fans should believe. If Pochettino trots out a team next month with Turner, Robinson, Tim Ream, Chris Richards, Sergiño Dest, Tyler Adams, McKennie, Tillman, Christian Pulisic, Folarin Balogun and Tim Weah and the same problems still exist, then the real panic can set in.

For now, though, the performances of this U.S. team for the last year-plus — pre-dating Pochettino's hire — have tempered expectations for what it is possible. Something has to be done to reverse that energy. Pochettino is asking the fans to believe. To believe that he has a plan. To believe that when the full squad is together it will look different. To believe that they can arrive in their best form for next summer's World Cup.

But to build that belief, they have to start showing something different on the field – and fast.

HARRISON, N.J. – Nine months out from a World Cup, it is unrealistic to expect most national teams to be the finished product, especially in a friendly where experimentation should be encouraged. World Cup-bound teams, though, should be offering a preview of what that finished product might be and in the U.S. men's national team's case, that might be the organized chaos head coach Mauricio Pochettino described as the ideal look for his team. As the USMNT dragged themselves through a 2-0 defeat to South Korea on Saturday, though, organization and stylistic chaos were in short supply.

Nearly a year into the job, Pochettino's USMNT have started to move to a familiar rhythm. The starting lineup is an unusual mix of veterans and players who few would have guessed would be in the mix when the Argentine officially accepted the job. Each game essentially becomes a sink-or-swim test for whichever fringe players take to the field, the varying levels of individual performance almost completely muddying the team's tactical plan in the process. The cast of characters rotates and the in-game errors change but with seven losses in 17 matches, watching Pochettino's version of the USMNT has become an arduous experience.

""I think we should learn a lot,"" Pochettino said post-match – before trying to focus on the positives.

He was not necessarily wrong when listing some sources of optimism. The USMNT outshot South Korea 17-5 and generated 2.27 expected goals to the opponent's 0.74, and in a second half that saw Pochettino form a back three with Tim Ream and Tristan Blackmon and substitute Chris Richards, the hosts conceded just one shot on target. It was a game of moments in some ways, the visitors making the most of their four shots on target with two first half goals and the USMNT perhaps unlucky not to have a goal of their own.

""Overall, I think we were better than South Korea but [in] the end, if you are not clinical in your own area and then in the opposite box, it's difficult and because we create more chances, we have the feeling that we controlled the game but in some actions, we concede,"" Pochettino said. ""I am so pleased, if I put the result on another side. I am so pleased in the way that we are evolving from the Gold Cup today with different players, different roster from the Gold Cup but also the players [are] starting to understand what we want from them. I think the attitude was great. The capacity to be [in] the game after 2-0, that was difficult against a team that was really good.""

Those small moments were costly, though, and did nothing to help Pochettino's case on Saturday. The head coach had deemed this month's friendlies, which includes a Tuesday clash against Japan, as the last chance to vet inexperienced players but Saturday's performance suggested that Pochettino's experiment has perhaps already run its course. The performance offered fresh reminders of well-known USMNT habits, both in defense and attack. The USA's backline still looks fairly uncomfortable without Richards, who could not start because of a small issue he arrived to camp with, and Antonee Robinson, who got this international break off. Sergino Dest is a thrill to watch with the ball at his feet and the opponent's goal in his sights but is lax in defense, most notably on Son Heung-min's 18th minute goal.

The player singled out the most was Blackmon, who did not impress on either goal in his USMNT debut and has done little to unseat Ream or Richards. The Vancouver Whitecaps defender was the latest in a string of fringe players who have earned playing time during Pochettino's time at the helm, the results mixed – at best – for the inexperienced contenders thrown into the deep end of playing for a national team stuck in a yearslong rut. Midfielder Tyler Adams argued that first impressions are can be deceiving, using himself as an example.

""I think it's up to the leaders in the group and the core guys in the group to get them feeling comfortable and have them playing at their best,"" Adams said. ""It's not always easy to come into a national team. I remember what it was like when I came into my first national team camp and I played like shit so I understand what it's like right now in the lead-up. Only nine months until a World Cup, they might feel pressure, they might feel nerves. That's the environment. That's the difference of playing with the national team compared to playing in your club in Europe where you can get comfortable every single day.""

Pochettino, perhaps fairly, that playing time is the only way to truly vet their talents, the disjointed performances a natural result of the mix-and-match approach the head coach has taken to preparing this team for a World Cup on home soil.

""We are testing too many things,"" Pochettino said. ""You say today, 'Why Tristan?' But Tristan, we wanted to see because we'd seen in Vancouver, I think, [he] has the profile to be in the national team but also he needs to live the experience to be in this level.""

Pochettino has taken an extreme approach to tinkering, listing 14 different starting lineups in his 17 matches in charge. Sometimes the changes work, like the back three Pochettino said could be an option for the team in the future. Sometimes, though, those tinkers come when it's too late and for a notable chunk of time, create an untenable game state. Pochettino's USMNT may have recovered well from a 2-0 deficit but the 2-0 deficit itself raised alarm bells, the organized chaos he teased pushed to the wayside by chaos from a lack of defensive organization.

There is a constant sense of catch-up the USMNT seems to be playing in this period of experimentation, a valiant project but one that may have lasted a few weeks too long. With each passing performance, preconceived notions seem to be winning the battle.

""We knew the idea, I think our rules got a little bit twisted,"" Adams said. ""They found some issues pretty easily in the first half. We talked about it at half time. We said if we would go three in the back -- Diego [Luna] stepped out, Josh [Sargent] joined them in, Christian [Pulisic] to man-to-man and I think we were just missing triggers on a lot of them and then we were a little bit too late to jump. If you're too late to jump, you end up chasing shadows. That's what it felt like at times.""

Saturday's outing deserves some of the leniency of a friendly match but even then, it is the latest sign of a worrying trend – the USMNT have been outscored 11-2 in their last seven first halves against opponents ranked in the top 25 and Pochettino has just one win against a team ranked in FIFA's top 30. The trend predates Pochettino, his predecessor Gregg Berhalter not boasting a terrific record against top 20 opponents – he had five wins in that category, four against Mexico.

It forces the question: Was there anything new and of value to be gathered from the USMNT's latest loss, or was it another bump in the road that only added additional hand-wringing as this group's high-stakes summer inches closer and closer?

Sweden manager Jon Dahl Tomasson has revealed why he decided to leave Alexander Isak out of the side that drew 2-2 with Slovenia on Friday (September 5).

Isak finally got his move to Liverpool on transfer deadline day, joining the Premier League holders from Newcastle for a reported British record fee of £125 million.

Despite his blockbuster move, the 25-year-old was an unused substitute in Sweden's 2-2 World Cup qualifier draw against Slovenia.

Speaking to ViaPlay after the game, Tomasson revealed why he decided to leave the impressive striker on the bench.

Tomasson said, ""He had only done three training sessions with the team. He had no preseason with the team and of course, no playing time. The risk was probably a bit too great to use him today.""

Asked whether the striker could feature in Sweden's next qualifier against Kosovo on Monday, Tomasson added: “Hopefully, hopefully. He could come in as a game-changer.”","{'href': 'https://www.tribalfootball.com', 'title': 'TribalFootball'}","soccer"

Home > Headlines > Turkey vs Spain: When, How to Watch World Cup Qualifier

The game will take place this evening.

Rabat — Spain and Turkey are meeting today in a World Cup 2026 qualifier game that will take place at 7:45 p.m. Moroccan time.

Both teams are in Group E, which also includes Georgia and Bulgaria.

Live streaming platforms like Fubo PPV will air the match. ViX will also stream the game.

Turkey's predicted lineup could include Cakir as the main goalkeeper, in addition to teammates Muldur, Demiral, Bardakci, Elmali, as well as Akturkoglu.

As for Spain, sports-focused outlets predict starting lineups to include Le Normand, Huijsen, Curcureella, Pedri, Lamine Yamal, and N Williams.

Sports Mole predicts Spain to secure a win, despite Turkey's stellar attacking capabilities.

“This has all of the makings of a very interesting match, and we are expecting it to be tight,” Sports Mole said, adding that Turkey's attacking quality “should see them find the back of the net.”

However, Spain has enough quality to “pick up a huge three points in group E.”

On Thursday, Spain collected its first Group stage win against Bulgaria 3-0. Turkey also succeeded in winning its first match 3-2 against Georgia.

NEW YORK — President Donald Trump is attending the U.S. Open on Sunday as a guest of Rolex despite imposing steep tariffs on the Swiss watchmaker's home country and with organizers seeking to keep off-court disruptions — like audience members booing him — from being seen on the TV broadcast.

Trump has built the bulk of his second term's domestic travel around attending major sports events rather than hitting the road to make policy announcements or address the kind of large rallies he so relished as a candidate.

He'll be watching the men's final between second-seeded Carlos Alcaraz, a 22-year-old Spaniard, and No. 1 seed and defending champion Jannik Sinner, 24, of Italy, from Rolex's suite.

The president's acceptance of Rolex's invitation comes mere weeks after the Trump administration imposed a whopping 39% tariff on Swiss products.

The levy is more than 2 1/2 times higher than the one the Trump administration agreed to for European Union goods exported to the U.S. and nearly four times higher than on British exports to the U.S. It has raised questions about Switzerland's ability to compete with the 27-member bloc that it neighbors.

The White House declined to comment on Trump accepting a corporate client's invitation at the tournament, but the president has had few qualms about blurring lines between political and foreign policy decisions and efforts to boost the profits of his family business.

That includes tirelessly promoting cryptocurrency interests and luxury golf properties around the country and the world that bear his name. He announced Friday that the U.S. will use its turn hosting the Group of 20 summit in December 2026 to stage the sweeping event at Trump National Doral in South Florida.

Any negative reaction to Trump's presence won't be shown on ABC's national telecast, per standard policy, the U.S. Tennis Association says.

“We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions,” the organization said in a statement.

Trump was once a U.S. Open mainstay, but hasn't attended since he was loudly booed at a quarterfinals match in September 2015, months after launching his first presidential campaign.

The Trump Organization once controlled its own U.S. Open suite, which was adjacent to the television broadcasting booth in Arthur Ashe Stadium, but suspended it in 2017, during the first year of Trump's first term. The family business is now being run by Trump's sons with their father back in the White House.

Trump was born in Queens, home of the U.S. Open, and for decades was a New York-area real estate mogul and, later, a reality TV star. Attending the tournament before he was a politician, he usually sat in the suite's balcony during night matches and was frequently shown on the arena's video screens.

In recent years, however, including between his presidential terms, Trump primarily lived at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago.

Alcaraz said before the final that having Trump on-hand would be a privilege and “great for tennis,” but also suggested that such sentiment went for any president watching from the stands.

“I will try not to be focused, and I will try not to think about it,” Alcaraz said of Trump's attendance. “I don't want myself to be nervous because of it.”

Trump golfed at the Virginia club outside Washington on Saturday, as he has many recent weekends once the summer weather turned too hot for playing near Mar-a-Lago. But the president has also frequently attended sporting events — where the roar of the crowd sometimes features people booing the president while others cheer him.

Since returning to the White House in January and prior to Sunday's U.S Open swing, Trump went to the Super Bowl in New Orleans and the Daytona 500, as well as UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia and the FIFA Club World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Having a sitting president attend is unusual and, before Trump, hadn't happened since Clinton went to the 2000 tournament. Former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, attended the event's opening night in 2023.","{'href': 'https://spectrumlocalnews.com', 'title': 'Spectrum News'}","soccer"

Jude Bellingham could make a partial return to Real Madrid training in the coming days as he continues his recovery from shoulder surgery, a report has revealed.

Following the conclusion of this summer's Club World Cup, Bellingham went under the knife to address an injury which dates back as far as November 2023, with club officials accepting the fact they would lose the midfielder for the start of the current campaign.

A return towards the end of October has been suggested and all the signs suggest Bellingham is making a healthy recovery.

While most of his teammates are away on international duty, MARCA state Bellingham is planning to step up his return to the grass. Monday's training session is expected to see the 22-year-old start to do his first work with the ball since the surgery.

If all goes according to plan, Bellingham could even feature in light team training, having insisted to club officials that he is feeling in excellent shape after his surgery.

Indeed, it is claimed that medical staff have even had to try and calm Bellingham down and delay his comeback plans, fearing the Englishman's optimism could actually work against him. They do not want to risk aggravating an issue which could require another lengthy spell on the sidelines.

All eyes will be on Bellingham's role in the Madrid side under Alonso. Having played in an advanced midfield role at the Club World Cup, he is expected to take on a deeper position this year following the departure of Luka Modrić.

“I see him as a midfielder,” Alonso said of Bellingham when asked whether there could be more minutes as a second striker this year.

The process of getting your US visa approved can be quite difficult and anxious. However, one Indian couple has opened up about their interview experience following approval of their B1/B2 visas for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Like many other candidates, their visa interview at the US embassy in New Delhi started with a lengthy wait as hundreds of applicants waited in queues for interviews and biometric scans.

“We spent about 3.5 hours at the embassy,” the applicant stated in a social media post. “I saw many people fainting because of the heat, which was concerning. I really hope it didn't affect anyone's interview,” they said.

Having applied together, the couple went to the window with great expectations of obtaining their visas. The interviewer, a US consular official, gave them a cordial welcome and asked a series of direct questions.

The applicant boldly stated that they intended to attend the FIFA World Cup 2026 in the United States when questioned about the purpose of their trip. “We'd really love to visit for the World Cup next year,” they stated.

The applicant further said that “I went to Qatar for the last World Cup, but this time I want to go with my wife to the US. We're both really looking forward to it.” The officer seemed content with the response.

Following that, the officer inquired about the applicant's occupation and what they performed for a living. The applicant mentioned that they had been working for four months and provided a quick overview of their function and duties there.

“I also told her about my previous work experience, which spans over six years,” the applicant revealed in the post.

The next topic of the query was their income. When the officer inquired, “how much do they earn?”, the applicant promptly replied in both US dollars and Indian rupees, making sure to give a comprehensive account of their financial circumstances.

The officer turned to the applicant's wife and asked about her profession and earnings as well. She responded that she is a housewife who assists in taking care of her single mother.

The applicant spoke of their love of travel and claimed that they had just returned from a honeymoon trip to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and the United Arab Emirates.

“I joked that since getting married, my solo travel days are over,” they joked. The officer smirked and stated, “So it's your fault.”

During the interview, the applicant acknowledged that they have no family in the United States, with the exception of a younger brother who resides and works in Dubai. The official finally responded, “Congratulations, your visas have been approved.”

          / CBS San Francisco
        

The Mexico and Japan National Soccer teams battled it out in a friendly game at the Oakland Coliseum Saturday night. 

The arena was nearly sold out as the two teams prepare ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Alexis Nacaspaca felt he needed to attend the game. 

""It's been years since Mexico played here,"" Nacaspaca stated. 

He has lived in the Bay Area for about half his life, moving here from Mexico when he was 14 years old.  He says he loves it here, but the Mexican National Team represents home.

""We always support Mexico,"" said Nacaspaca. 

While this is supposed to be just a fun event, in the current political climate, he can't help but still be concerned about immigration authorities showing up to an event like this.

""Of course, yeah, definitely,"" Nacaspaca admitted. ""We all come from Mexico, and we all worry about it. We're not doing anything wrong. But of course, we are worried about it.""

Back in June, when Mexico played a Gold Cup match in Los Angeles, the Mexican President urged U.S. officials not to target people attending the game.

CBS Bay Area's Amanda Hari asked Nacaspaca if he feels safe at the game.

""Um, that's a difficult question,"" Nacaspaca said. ""I don't know how to answer that.""

Kanata is on the other side of the match-up, excited to show up and rally for Japan.

""We are born and raised in Japan, so we have to show support,"" Kanata exclaimed. 

He lives in San Francisco now. Kanata says it's amazing to see his original team playing in his new home. He believed Japan could win, but ultimately, it didn't matter.

""At the end of the day, I don't care who's winning,"" said Kanata. ""I just want to see a good game.""

Nacaspaca agrees, saying it's about the experience and being together.

""It's a friendly game, we just get to hang out, have fun, enjoy the music, enjoy the food,"" said Nacaspaca. 

The game ended in a tie. 

Both teams could end up back in the Bay Area in 2026 for the FIFA World Cup.

Carlos Alcaraz will have a chance Sunday to become the first man in the Open Era to win the US Open without losing a set.

The Spaniard has not dropped a set through six matches in New York and has lost just 58 games in 18 sets, for an average of just more than three games per set. He has only needed two tie-breaks.

""For me it's great. It's something that I'm working on, just the consistency in the matches, in the tournaments, in the year in general,"" Alcaraz said. ""Just not having ups and downs in the match. Just the level that I start the match [with], just wanted to keep that level really high during the whole match.

""So I'm thinking I'm doing that in this tournament, which I'm really proud about. Yeah, let's see. But probably I'm just getting mature. I just getting to know myself much better, what I need on, off the court. The things that I'm doing off the court I think I'm doing really, really well, which helps a lot, and to play my best tennis. I think it's getting better.""

Only five men in the Open Era have won a major without losing a set: Ken Rosewall (1971 Australian Open), Ilie Nastase (1973 Roland Garros), Bjorn Borg (1976 Wimbledon, Roland Garros 2x), Roger Federer (2007 Australian Open, 2017 Wimbledon) and Rafael Nadal (Roland Garros 4x).

Men to win a major without losing a set (Open Era)




Alcaraz is a five-time major champion and the least number of sets he has dropped during a championship run is four, when he claimed glory at Wimbledon in 2023. The second seed will take on Jannik Sinner or Felix Auger-Aliassime for the trophy.

The last player to win the tournament without dropping a set was Neale Fraser in 1960, when it was known as the US Championships and not open to professionals.

Even in defeat, Amanda Anisimova's two-week surge -- from upsetting Iga Swiatek in the quarters to outlasting Naomi Osaka in the semis -- underscored a transformation that has vaulted her back into the game's elite.

She had just lost in a Grand Slam final for the second time in less than two months. 

Amanda Anisimova was understandably gutted, but when she thanked the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd for their support they let loose a warm, sustained ovation. Anisimova, the pride of nearby New Jersey, leaned back, closed her eyes and let the love wash over her.

She never gave up, never stopped fighting. And that can only sustain her going forward.

With Sabalenka serving for the match at 5-4 -- and only two points from the title -- Anisimova summoned one more brave effort. She broke Sabalenka and forced a tiebreak. And while she lost the match, 6-3, 7-6 (3), it was a far better result than the 6-0, 6-0 defeat in the Wimbledon final at the hands of Iga Swiatek.

“I just felt like throughout the match I wasn't playing my best tennis,” Anisimova told reporters. “I feel like with finals I have a lot of nerves, and it's something I'm trying to work on, but I just wish I played more aggressive. 

“I didn't win today, so of course I didn't do enough. That's just the reality, and I have to accept that.”

Despite the loss, this was one of the more memorable Grand Slam runs in recent years. After losing that Wimbledon final, in one of the truly memorable pivots, the 24-year-old Anisimova came back to stun Swiatek 6-4, 6-3 in the US Open quarterfinals. And then she took out four-time major champion Naomi Osaka in the semifinals. Osaka, incredibly, had never lost a major quarterfinal, semifinal or final.

A win over Sabalenka would have made it three in a row over former No. 1 players and multi-Grand Slam winners.

Sabalenka embraced Anisimova after the match and had kind words for her during the trophy presentation.

“Congrats, Amanda, on reaching back-to-back finals in the Slams,” Sabalenka said. “I know how much it hurts losing in the finals. But trust me, the moment you win your first one -- and you're going to win it -- you play incredible tennis.

“Girl, you're going to enjoy it even more after these tough losses.”

So much to be proud of, Amanda! ❤️ pic.twitter.com/PIiB9tP0qG

Think about how far she's come -- and how fast.

She stepped away from tennis in 2023 and returned to Wimbledon the following year with a No. 189 ranking. On Monday, she'll zoom to No. 4 in the PIF WTA Rankings.

“Listening about Wimbledon every single day of the last two weeks, I mean, I've done really well with that,” Anisimova said. “I've tried to turn everything around for myself. 

“I was really trying to do all the right things to give myself the best possible chance of winning today, but just wasn't enough.”

Four years after her first major, Aryna Sabalenka has learned to steady her emotions, adjust her tactics and defend her US Open title -- proof that the lessons of past finals are paying off.

Nearly four hours after her straight-sets win over Amanda Anisimova in the US Open final, Aryna Sabalenka was still in Arthur Ashe Stadium -- under it, actually -- sitting in the glitz-and-glam chair in preparation for an on-court trophy shoot.

“Not sure if we can get on the court for pictures -- the rain is coming in,” Sabalenka said with a real sense of urgency.

No matter, for the hard work was done. 

Sabalenka had just won her fourth Grand Slam singles title, equaling Naomi Osaka. Only Iga Swiatek, with six, has more among active players not named Venus Williams.

How has Sabalenka's success the past three years raised her own expectations?

“I think we all have really high expectations, but I'm trying to shift my focus on myself and developing as a player,” she said. “Every time, I'm trying to play my best and see how far I can go in this sport. 

“Hearing this number, it's crazy -- it's crazy to actually realize I was able to do it four times. I hope to do it many more.”

Which, of course, begs the question: At the age of 27, very much in the prime of her career, how many more can she win?

“I don't know -- I don't want to think about that,” Sabalenka said. “I don't want to put a limit on it. I just want to focus on becoming a better player and see how far I can get. Hopefully, I can win many more, but who knows? 

“I'm pretty sure that I'll put in the hard work and I'll do everything possible to experience these emotions many more times.”

After winning her first major title of the year, Sabalenka repeatedly said she was speechless in interviews on-court, with ESPN interviews and reporters, yet she somehow managed to find the words to express her thoughts on this emotional victory.

Here's what she told wtatennis.com:

You were more emotional when the match ended than I've ever seen you on court. What exactly were you feeling and thinking at that moment?

After earlier this season in the Grand Slam finals, it was super emotional. I learned really tough lessons. For me, winning this title means a lot. I was just super proud that I really handled my emotions so well. I didn't let them take control of me. I was just fighting and playing really great tennis on court today. I was proud, in the end, that I was able to defend my title.

By your standards, you were a little conservative today -- only one ace and 13 winners. More body serves, too. Knowing how she plays, how much was that part of your gameplan? 

We definitely have a tactic against Amanda. I've played her [10 times]. I felt like giving her some space and stopping my arms, making the game slower, would only benefit her. She would go for her shots and make crazy winners that she always does. And this match I was just trying to put back all the speed and pressure she was putting on me. And the serve, whenever you give her an angle she's a great returner. So I was just trying not to give her so much space.

Winning the title is half the fun, the other half is the photo shoot 💅🏆 pic.twitter.com/VMmQ9QJUlt

Even though you were playing an American in the American Grand Slam, the crowd supported you. How much do you appreciate that?

I appreciate it a lot. And I feel like that throughout the years. I remember coming here for the first time, making the final for the first time. Crowd was definitely not on my side. I feel like I really built a good connection with people. They see more of me through social media and they know me better. Every year I come, it's more and more support, so I'm really excited for the next years and I hope it's going to be even more than it was today.

I saw you sipping some champagne earlier. How will you celebrate with your team tonight? 

[Laughing] We're definitely going to go out, we're going to have some drinks. We're going to enjoy it, because I think we put in really hard work and we all learned tough lessons earlier this season and we all deserve to enjoy this moment for a little bit.

What does your fall schedule look like?

I'm going to stay in New York for a little while. Then I'll go back [home] to Miami and then I think to Dubai in preparation for the Asia Swing. For now, we are planning to attend both [WTA 1000s in Beijing and Wuhan, China].

Jeline Vandromme, 17, became the first Belgian in 14 years to win a girls' Grand Slam title -- and extended her winning streak at all levels to 23 matches and 33 sets -- after defeating Lea Nilsson in the US Open final. Czech sisters Alena and Jana Kovackova took the girls' doubles crown.

No. 14 seed Jeline Vandromme continued her superb summer form by capturing the US Open girls' singles title with a 7-6(2), 6-2 defeat of qualifier Lea Nilsson in the final, coming back from 4-2 down in the first set.

Watched by compatriot and former World No. 1 Kim Clijsters, 17-year-old Vandromme became the first Belgian girl to lift a major trophy since An-Sophie Mestach at the 2011 Australian Open, and first to do so at the US Open since Kirsten Flipkens in 2003. She is the fifth Belgian girls' singles Grand Slam champion in the Open Era following Mestach, Flipkens, Justine Henin (Roland Garros 1997) and Nancy Feber (Wimbledon 1993).

A classically-trained pianist who was a student at the Conservatory of Bruges, Vandromme has said that only one thing links her two passions: ""You have to be disciplined in both things, and you have to practice a lot, every day,"" she told itftennis.com this week. ""I don't know for sure that piano helps tennis, but I love playing both.""

The discipline has been on show in her nascent tennis career lately, as Vandromme is now on a 23-match winning streak at all levels. She spent July and August playing the ITF World Tour, collecting three consecutive titles -- the Roehampton ITF W35 as a qualifier, then back-to-back ITF W15s in Monastir -- and cutting her PIF WTA Ranking from No. 754 to No. 495 in four weeks.

She's also now won 33 sets in a row. Vandromme last dropped a set in the Roehampton final, in which she defeated Shi Han 7-6(4), 5-7, 7-5. Following that, she won both Monastir events and the US Open title without the loss of a set. Her run in Flushing Meadows included a 6-3, 6-2 third-round defeat of Australian Open girls' finalist Kristina Penickova and a 6-3, 6-2 semifinal win over Roland Garros girls' finalist Hannah Klugman.

A post shared by US Open (@usopen)

Vandromme conceded only 22 games in five matches to reach the final, but faced her stiffest opposition with the title on the line. Nilsson was the first player to stretch her as far as a tiebreak since the Roehampton final -- appropriately, given the 17-year-old Swede's battling run this week.

After losing a 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 heartbreaker to Nadia Lagaev in the third round of the Repentigny junior event in Canada the previous week, Nilsson caught a 7 a.m. flight to New York the following morning -- and had to play her first qualifying match that afternoon, which she eked out 5-7, 6-1, [10-7] over Ireland O'Brien. 

But she still had the energy to dish out two of the main draw's biggest upsets, taking out No. 1 seed Julieta Pareja 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the third round and defending champion Mika Stojsavljevic 0-6, 6-1, 6-1 in the semifinals. Nilsson was the first Swedish girl in a junior Slam final since Sofia Arvidsson at the 2001 Australian Open, and was bidding to become the first qualifier ever to win the US Open junior title. She has a WTA ranking of No. 992.





 Jimmie48/WTA
                        

A nip-and-tuck first set saw Vandromme struggle to find the balance between power and safety as Nilsson delivered solid defense with a few excellent net forays mixed in. Vandromme fired five winners -- nearly half her first-set total of 11 -- in the first game alone but was nonetheless broken, and reined in her aggression to reel Nilsson in from 4-2 down.

Once Vandromme had the tiebreak under her belt, though, she loosened up and showed what she was capable of in full flow. Boasting a major weapon in her forehand, Vandromme danced around it with beautiful footwork to unload repeatedly and raise her tally of winners to 25. 

""I think I played a very good opponent, to start with,"" Vandromme told press afterwards. ""Lea played an incredible week and today also. I had a bit of nerves before the match, I would say, but I think I handled them good. I tried to play my level, my game, and it worked out really great.

""I just tried to not focus on the fact that I'm 2-4 or 0-2 down. I just tried to focus on every point, every shot that I make, on my plan, and my tasks on court. Then I kind of forgot the score. I mean, I'm just trying to play every point and doing what I have to do. Then I don't have extra pressure or I don't feel the negative emotions coming up when I'm down.

""Of course you start to feel the legs a bit when you go far into the tournament, like in the final now. But when the adrenaline takes over, then all I just felt was energy. Yeah, the will to win every point was so big that I don't feel any fatigue or pain.""

Vandromme didn't have much time to celebrate her singles win: it was into the shower, a change of clothes and a quick bite to eat on the exercise bike before she was back out on court for the girls' doubles final alongside Lithuania's Laima Vladson as the No. 4 seeds.

However, Vandromme was denied the double crown by Czech sisters Alena and Jana Kovackova, the No. 3 seeds, who raced to a 6-2, 6-2 victory. It's a second major girls' doubles title for 17-year-old Alena, who was the 2023 Wimbledon champion alongside Laura Samson, and a first for her younger sister Jana.

The 15-year-old becomes the first 2010-born player to claim a junior Grand Slam title; she's already the highest-ranked 2010-born player at No. 642, having compiled a 24-7 pro record including two ITF titles this year. Alena, meanwhile, is ranked at No. 640, and qualified for her first WTA main draw in July in Prague.

The Kovackovas are the second sister act to lift a Grand Slam girls' doubles trophy this year after American twins Annika and Kristina Penickova were victorious at the Australian Open -- defeating the Kovackovas in the final -- and the first to do so in US Open history.

Back in January, Aryna Sabalenka was looking for her third straight Australian Open title but lost a three-set final to Madison Keys.

Sabalenka won a first-set tiebreak against Coco Gauff in the Roland Garros final, but stumbled badly, losing a second consecutive major championship match in three sets.

“After French Open I figured that, ‘OK, maybe it's time for me to sit back and to look at those finals and to maybe learn something,'” Sabalenka said Saturday night. “Because I didn't want it to happen again and again and again.

“I thought that if I made it to the final, it means that I'm going to win it, and I sort of didn't expect players to come out there and to fight. I thought that everything going to go easily my way, which was completely wrong mindset. Going into this final, I decided for myself that I'm going to control my emotions.”

And that's precisely what she did. With a 6-3, 7-6 (3) win over Amanda Anisimova, Sabalenka became the first woman to defend her US Open since Serena Williams in 2014.

The 27-year-old has been the PIF WTA Rankings No. 1 player all season long, but she broke through with her first major title of the year in the final Grand Slam. 

“There was a few moments when I was this close [pinching together thumb and index finger] to just letting go,” she said afterward. “But I was like, `Come on, you cannot do that. You have to stay focused and keep going, keep trying.'

“All those tough lessons worth this one,” she said, succinctly summing up her year in seven words.

For context, consider this: Of the 11 majors she's played across the past three years, Sabalenka has now won four, reached three finals, three semifinals and one quarterfinal.

She now has two titles each at the US Open and Australian Opens, reminiscent of Naomi Osaka's run from 2018-21, except she accomplished it in three years instead of four.

Appropriately, this was Sabalenka's 100th Grand Slam match-win. She received a record prize of $5 million for the effort. Her winning percentage is an impressive .794, second only to Iga Swiatek among active players.

“I'm in awe of what you've accomplished,” Anisimova said, addressing Sabalenka in the trophy ceremony. “Congratulations to you and your team, you guys are amazing.”

Of her swift ascent to the top of tennis -- she'll be No. 4 in the new PIF WTA Rankings -- Anisimova acknowledged, “It's been a crazy, crazy journey.”

Anisimova came in with a 6-3 head-to-head record against Sabalenka, but their 10th meeting was something different. In the past, Anisimova's superb timing, clean ball-stroking and technique kept Sabalenka pinned behind the baseline. Anisimova typically plays an all-or-nothing, hit-or-miss game and in deep runs at Wimbledon and this US Open, it's been working.

But playing opposite Sabalenka, Anisimova was constantly under pressure and the result was too many errors. Anisimova finished with 29 unforced errors and 22 winners. 

Sabalenka wisely took a little bit off her powerful game -- she hit only a single ace -- and produced a more conservative stat line: 13 winners and 15 unforced errors. Ultimately, the difference was Sabalenka's execution on break-point opportunities, winning five of six.

It was hard not to think back to that Wimbledon final when Anisimova lost the first two games -- the last point was a nervous-looking forehand that gave Sabalenka a service break. Ominously, that meant Anisimova had lost all 14 games of the only two major finals of her career.

Sabalenka, having won nine of 11 points, was up 2-0, 30-love when Anisimova settled down. Let the record show that a fierce forehand down-the-line winner gave her a breakthrough game at the 15-minute mark.

After a routine hold (and a blistering body serve that nearly hit Sabalenka), Anisimova held -- and then broke Sabalenka's hefty serve again.

Sabalenka came right back with a second break to even it at 3-all. She then won the next three games to seal the set.

Winning the first set is often pivotal, but doing it at the US Open is critical. Of the past 30 women's champions at the US Open, 28 won the opening set.

With Sabalenka serving for the match at 5-4, 30-all -- two points from the title -- Anisimova hit a running lob and Sabalenka responded with an awkward overhead into the net. Anisimova broke and held, forcing Sabalenka to serve her way into a tiebreak.

Coming in, Sabalenka had won 20 of 21 tiebreaks this year. That one loss came back in February. The final result was predictable -- Sabalenka converted her third match point when Anisimova's service return missed.

Sabalenka immediately collapsed to the court and when she stood up there were tears in her eyes.

“I think because of the finals earlier this season, this one felt different,” Sabalenka said. “This one felt like I had to overcome a lot of things to get this one. The hard work we put in, like, I deserved to have a Grand Slam title this season.

“So when I fell, it was like truly emotions, because it means a lot to defend this title and to bring such a great tennis on court. And to bring the fight and be able to handle my emotions the way I did in this final, it means a lot. I'm super proud right now of myself.”

The American was broken five times by Aryna Sabalenka, and said the closed roof on Arthur Ashe Stadium made it impossible to see her serve.ByStephanie LivaudaisPublished Sep 07, 2025 copy_link

NEW YORK — The bright lights of Arthur Ashe Stadium proved too much for Amanda Anisimova, who fell to a locked-in Aryna Sabalenka 6-3, 7-6 (3) in Saturday's US Open final.The match was played under the closed roof due to rain and thunderstorms, creating an unexpected wrinkle for Anisimova as she faced the world No. 1 in her second Grand Slam final.The American stopped play several times to complain to chair umpire Mirjana Veljovic that the stadium lights were literally too bright, but was told nothing could be done.Read More: Aryna Sabalenka thunders to 2025 US Open title defense, defeats Amanda Anisimova“I haven't played on the court during the day with the roof closed, and it was literally white,” Anisimova said in her post-match press conference. “I couldn't see the ball when I was serving, like, the whole match.“I think starting from the warmup, I was, like, this is really going to be a problem for me.

“I think starting from the warmup, I was, like, this is really going to be a problem for me. I didn't know what to do.”

Anisimova said she effectively had to serve blind, going off feel and hoping for the best against Sabalenka, who capitalized on the openings. Her serve was broken five times—three in the first set and twice in the second. Another telling stat: she won only 10 points on her second serve (36%) all match, including just two in the lopsided opening set.“There was no way of adjusting, because I could not see the ball when I was serving,” she said. “That was a huge shock to my system, because I knew if I can't hold my serve, it was going to be very tough to stay in the match.”Despite her struggles, Anisimova kept herself competitive with her ground game, hitting more winners than Sabalenka (22 to 13). But she also racked up more errors and never settled into a rhythm as Sabalenka powered to her fourth Grand Slam title.

‘Today was an incredible day' – Verstappen thrilled with victory at Monza

Norris insists McLaren's swap with Piastri for P2 was ‘the most fair thing'

A pulsating Qualifying session at Monza ended with Red Bull's Max Verstappen beating the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri to pole position.

Red Bull driver Max Verstappen pulled another lap out of the bag to claim pole position for the Italian Grand Prix, pipping McLaren rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in an incredibly close Qualifying session at Monza.

Following their “very tough” weekend at the Temple of Speed last season, Verstappen and Red Bull have looked much more competitive at this year's event, with the Dutchman emerging as a genuine threat to McLaren's supremacy.

As a heart-stopping Qualifying hour drew to a close, Verstappen initially led the way in the decisive Q3 phase, before being overhauled by Norris but then fighting back with a blistering lap of 1m 18.792s to seal P1 by 0.077s.

Piastri was 0.190s back in third, from the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton, who could not quite deliver enough for the front row – the seven-time World Champion nonetheless losing five places with his pre-event grid penalty.

Mercedes used a different tyre strategy to their rivals when Qualifying began, starting out on the medium tyres, before the transition to softs yielded sixth and seventh on the grid for George Russell and home driver Kimi Antonelli respectively.

Qualifying results

FORMULA 1 PIRELLI GRAN PREMIO D'ITALIA 2025

Gabriel Bortoleto was one of Saturday's stars en route to eighth for Kick Sauber, continuing the outfit's positive trajectory under new team boss Jonathan Wheatley, while Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda completed the top 10.

Ollie Bearman led the Haas team's charge in 11th, missing out on a Q3 spot by just one hundredth of a second, with Nico Hulkenberg 12th in the second of the Kick Sauber machines after struggling to match the pace of high-flying team mate Bortoleto.

Williams caught the eye during Friday practice but slipped down the order through FP3 and failed to make an impression in the grid-deciding session – Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon having to settle for 13th and 14th places from the other Haas of Esteban Ocon.

After his dream run to a maiden podium finish at the Dutch Grand Prix last time out, Isack Hadjar suffered a painful Q1 exit, having made a mistake on his final run, leaving the Racing Bulls rookie 16th for Sunday's race over the other Aston Martin of Lance Stroll.

Franco Colapinto experienced a difficult start to the Monza weekend but managed to out-pace Alpine team mate Pierre Gasly in Qualifying, on the day of the Frenchman's contract renewal, while Liam Lawson (Racing Bulls) lost a lap to track limits and wound up slowest.

After three practice sessions around Monza, one topped by home favourites Ferrari and two by McLaren, attention turned to the all-important Qualifying hour, which got under way in front of a passionate capacity crowd at 1600 local time.

When the green light switched on at the end of the pit lane, there was a slight divergence in tyre strategy, with the majority of the field opting for Pirelli's soft compound tyres from the outset but Mercedes pair Antonelli and Russell initially running mediums.

While McLaren, Racing Bulls and Williams driver Albon bided their time in the pit lane, Leclerc brought the first cheers from the Tifosi by clocking an early benchmark of 1m 19.801s, before Hamilton slotted into second by lapping just over a tenth slower.

McLaren made their first move a few minutes later, Norris going quickest on a 1m 19.611s and Piastri making it a papaya 1-2, while there was trouble for Williams as both Sainz (exiting Lesmo 2) and Albon (at the first chicane) lost track limes for exceeding track limits.

As the McLarens headed to the pits for a reset, a host of drivers got second runs on the board – medium-shod Russell moving to the top with a 1m 19.414s, Sainz bouncing back to go third for Williams, and Alonso, Bortoleto and Leclerc all getting ahead of Piastri.

At the other end of the order, the Alpines of Gasly and Colapinto, Antonelli, the Haas of Ocon and the Racing Bulls of Lawson were all in the drop zone. “The balance was okay, I just had no grip,” reported Antonelli after that first sequence on mediums.

“Guys, I'm alone in front, exactly what we said we shouldn't do,” sighed Ocon as he led the field back out for the decisive final runs, the Frenchman having to punch a hole in the air ahead while drivers behind positioned themselves for distant tows.

With green and purple sector times being pumped in, there were changes all over the timing screen through to the chequered flag and beyond – just over four-tenths of a second ultimately separating pace-setter Russell and the Q2 cut-off.

Hadjar was the driver who narrowly missed out after an out-lap tussle with Sainz and a moment exiting Lesmo 2, which yielded a hugely frustrated radio message, while Stroll, Colapinto, Gasly and Lawson (who ran wide at Lesmo 1 and lost a lap time) also dropped out.

Russell remained in the pits and in P1 as the opening phase drew to a close, ahead of Verstappen, Norris, Tsunoda and Sainz, with Alonso, Bortoleto, Bearman, Leclerc and Piastri completing the top 10. Antonelli and Hamilton made it through in P11 and P12 respectively.

Knocked out: Hadjar, Stroll, Colapinto, Gasly, Lawson

There was a slightly longer break than usual between segments as marshals cleared away gravel from various sections of the track, only for Albon to run too deep at the Ascari chicane on his first Q2 effort and flick more stones onto the tarmac – heavily compromising that lap.

Drama followed for Norris when he locked up heavily into the first chicane, took to the run-off area and abandoned his lap. “We need to box,” his race engineer commented over the radio, while Verstappen moved into P1 on a 1m 19.140s from Russell and Piastri.

Bortoleto held an impressive fourth following his Q2 opener, from Leclerc, Tsunoda, Antonelli and Hamilton, with Sainz and Bearman occupying the final top 10 positions. That meant Alonso, Ocon, Albon (via his own lock-up into Turn 1), Hulkenberg and Norris were the drivers in danger.

Norris unsurprisingly rejoined the action as quickly as he could to get a banker on the board, but a 1m 19.451s only put him seventh. While the Briton could cool his tyres and go again, would he be able to deliver any more time on that used set compared to his rivals' new ones?

After falling into the drop zone and raising heart rates on the McLaren pit wall, the out-of-sync Norris produced a lap when it mattered to shoot up to fifth, behind Russell, team mate Piastri, a much-improved Antonelli and Verstappen, whose low 1m 19s time remained the benchmark.

With just under three-tenths this time covering that P1 lap to the Q3 cut-off, Leclerc, Bortoleto, Alonso, Hamilton and Tsunoda were the final drivers to make it through to the pole position shootout, denying both Haas cars, Hulkenberg and both Williams drivers.

Knocked out: Bearman, Hulkenberg, Sainz, Albon and Ocon

A few minutes later, it was time for the Q3 segment everyone had been waiting for, and the opening runs brought a vintage Monza experience – Piastri initially leading the way for McLaren, Leclerc taking over for Ferrari and Verstappen then storming to P1 in his Red Bull.

Norris endured another tricky start to the phase, only going seventh with his first effort, behind the other Ferrari of Hamilton, the lead Mercedes of Russell and Bortoleto's Sauber, as Antonelli, Tsunoda and Alonso provisionally rounded out the order.

Following a pause in the pit lane, the 10 cars fired back into life and gave fans another treat across the final runs to the flag – Norris putting those aforementioned dramas behind him to take P1 away from Verstappen on a 1m 18.869s.

All eyes then turned to Verstappen, who brilliantly got down to a new lap record time of 1m 18.792s and brought pole position back into his hands, leaving Norris to settle for second over Piastri and the two Ferraris.

Hamilton was just over a tenth slower than team mate Leclerc in fifth but will take a five-place grid penalty on race day, promoting Russell (who requested medium tyres for his last lap but was given softs), Antonelli, Bortoleto, Alonso and Tsunoda.

“I try!” Verstappen said, when asked if that was the usual ‘Verstappen magic'. “I think around here with the low downforce, it's always very difficult to nail the lap – under braking it's easy to make mistakes also, but Q3 felt good. I was happy with the laps, and of course to be on pole here for us is fantastic. The car's been working a lot better the whole weekend, and to be able to fight for pole, I'm very happy with that.”

The 2025 Italian Grand Grand Prix is set to begin at 1500 local time on Sunday. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can catch the action from Monza.

‘Today was an incredible day' – Verstappen thrilled with victory at Monza

Norris insists McLaren's swap with Piastri for P2 was ‘the most fair thing'

Max Verstappen claimed his third win of the 2025 season with a commanding display at Monza on Sunday.

Red Bull driver Max Verstappen converted pole position into victory during Sunday's Italian Grand Prix, leading home McLaren pair Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri after a dramatic start and end to proceedings at Monza.

Verstappen and Norris went wheel-to-wheel almost immediately when the lights went out, getting close to each other down the start/finish straight before the Dutchman skipped the first chicane to keep the lead.

Although Verstappen gave up the position to Norris at the start of the second lap to avoid a potential penalty, he was soon back on his rival's tail and took only a couple more tours to reclaim P1 and surge clear.

From there, Verstappen appeared to have everything under control, managing the gap back to both McLarens across their opening stints, pitting earlier than Norris and Piastri to strengthen that advantage and then cruising to the chequered flag.

While Verstappen's run to the finish was relatively serene, amid repeated messages from the Red Bull pit wall to avoid any unnecessary risks, drama developed at McLaren when a slow pit stop for Norris allowed team mate Piastri through for second.

Given the unusual circumstances, McLaren asked Piastri to move aside for Norris, after which they would be free to race. It was an instruction the championship leader initially questioned, but ultimately obeyed, thanks to a well-orchestrated swap.

Piastri settled for third, meaning his points margin over Norris came down from 34 to 31, with Charles Leclerc a few seconds further back in the lead Ferrari – the Tifosi's dreams of a home win, or even a podium, not materialising this year.

George Russell delivered another strong drive aboard his Mercedes to finish where he started in fifth, while Lewis Hamilton recovered from his five-place grid penalty to cross the line sixth and at least give the Scuderia a solid double points finish.

After a tough Qualifying session, Alex Albon earned Williams some important points in the midfield fight with a fine recovery to seventh, followed by Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto and the other Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli, who served a five-second time penalty for driving erratically.

Isack Hadjar was another Sunday star as he turned his pit lane start into 10th, leading home Carlos Sainz's Williams and Ollie Bearman's Haas (who banged wheels at the Roggia chicane late on), the second Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda and Racing Bulls team mate Liam Lawson.

Esteban Ocon was another penalised driver – after he was deemed to have forced Lance Stroll wide early in the race – en route to 15th position, with Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto taking 16th and 17th respectively on a quiet afternoon for Alpine.

Aston Martin at one point had both cars in the points-paying positions, but their afternoon turned sour with a late slump for Stroll and an apparent suspension failure for Fernando Alonso, while Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg failed to start due to a hydraulics problem.

After a thrilling Qualifying session around the historic Temple of Speed, which saw Verstappen brilliantly pull a lap out of the bag to pip McLaren pair Norris and Piastri, drivers and teams reconvened for Sunday's main event: the Italian Grand Prix.

Two changes to the grid were confirmed in the hours before the race, with both Hadjar (who had qualified 16th) and Gasly (in 19th) being sent to the pit lane for taking on a host of new power unit elements beyond their respective allocations for the season.

As such, Stroll, Colapinto and Lawson all gained spots towards the back of the pack, while further up, Hamilton's pre-event five-place grid penalty meant he fell from fifth to 10th and promoted Russell, Antonelli, Bortoleto, Alonso and Tsunoda.

With the race start approaching, attention turned to tyre choices for what Pirelli were expecting to be a straightforward one-stop race. As blankets came off, it was revealed that the majority of the field had opted for medium rubber, while Albon, Ocon, Stroll, Hadjar and Gasly took hards and Lawson went aggressive on softs.

When the lights went out, with Hulkenberg absent after being told to pit and retire his car, Norris jumped off the line to immediately put pressure on Verstappen – the Red Bull man squeezing his McLaren rival onto the grass as they charged towards the first chicane.

Under braking for Turn 1, Norris had a look up the inside of Verstappen's car and the pair went wheel-to-wheel again, only for the reigning World Champion to skip the chicane and maintain the lead. “What's this idiot doing?” Norris shouted over the radio. “He put me in the grass and cut the corner.”

There was more drama just behind when Piastri initially lost out to Leclerc, a move that prompted huge cheers from the Tifosi in the grandstands and on the grass banks, before the Australian fought back with a stunning pass around the outside of Lesmo 1.

Heading onto Lap 2, Verstappen appeared to back off down the start/finish straight to let Norris through and avoid a possible penalty, which allowed Piastri to have a look at the Red Bull before getting caught in a Turn 1 bottleneck and being overtaken by Leclerc again.

Verstappen maintained his composure and quickly returned to the rear of Norris' McLaren, enjoying a smooth exit out of the Parabolica, tucking into the slipstream for the start of Lap 4 and then smartly passing Norris around the outside of the first chicane.

As Verstappen set about consolidating P1, Leclerc and Piastri continued to battle it out for third place. “Leclerc is all over the place under braking; I had to avoid him,” reported Piastri after a couple of close calls, before finally reclaiming the spot into Turn 1 on Lap 6.

In fifth, Russell was doing well to maintain his starting position and keep Leclerc on his toes, while Hamilton had already charged his way from 10th to sixth, moving past Bortoleto, Alonso, Tsunoda and Antonelli, who had endured a difficult start.

Elsewhere, Ocon was given a five-second penalty for forcing Stroll off track in a wheel-to-wheel moment at the Roggia chicane. “There was no space,” Ocon argued in a message to the Haas pit wall, with his efforts to challenge for the points being dented.

After his decisive early-race pass, Verstappen lit up the timing screens to post fastest lap after fastest lap and build a comfortable advantage at the head of the pack – the gap between him and Norris reaching five seconds by Lap 18 (aided by the latter running wide at Lesmo 2).

Bearman was the first man to pit for fresh rubber on Lap 19, triggering a flurry of midfield stops over the next couple of tours, with drivers either moving from mediums to hards or hards to mediums, apart from Lawson on his alternate soft-to-hard approach.

One of the highlights of this sequence was a head-to-head fight between Bortoleto and his manager Alonso, after the Kick Sauber entered the pit lane just ahead of the Aston Martin but left it just behind, thanks to some slick work from the Silverstone-based team.

That hard work was undone just a few moments later, though, when Alonso's car clattered the kerbs exiting the Ascari chicane and suffered an apparent suspension failure. “This is unbelievable,” lamented the two-time World Champion while he limped back to the pits.

As the race reached its halfway mark, Russell became the first of the front-runners to pit from fifth, releasing Hamilton, Antonelli, Albon and Sainz – the Williams duo making progress and swapping places following some back-and-forth over the radio.

McLaren, meanwhile, were pondering options and whether they could pounce on a potential Safety Car. Piastri was asked if he could go 15 laps longer than originally planned. “I think so, yes,” came his response. Norris was then asked about extending and fitting a soft tyre towards the end. “We might as well continue,” he said.

A few drivers had drawn the attention of the stewards at this point; Sainz for failing to follow the Race Director's escape road instructions at the Roggia chicane; Antonelli due to repeated track limits violations; and Lawson and Tsunoda for some midfield wheel-banging.

On Lap 33, Verstappen found himself leading Norris by six seconds, with the same margin separating the two McLarens, before Leclerc added another front-running stop to the mix by pitting from fourth and seemingly protecting against an undercut from Russell.

Emerging from the pits a few seconds ahead of Russell, Leclerc was not so sure, commenting over the radio: “If we are not under threat, why did we stop now?” He nonetheless made good use of his fresh tyres and began to pump in some rapid lap times.

On Lap 37, race leader Verstappen decided that enough was enough and swapped his medium tyres for hards, releasing Norris and Piastri into the lead as McLaren bided their time – Norris repeating that he would be happy to go for softs to the finish.

As the papaya cars continued to circulate, there were more fireworks in the midfield when Bearman and Sainz collided at the Roggia chicane. “He just turned in in front of me like I wasn't there,” reported the Haas rookie over the airwaves.

Then, on Lap 45, with just eight tours to go, McLaren finally decided to bring their cars in. Intriguingly, it was Piastri who stopped first. “As long as he doesn't undercut,” said Norris. “There will be no undercut,” the Briton was promised.

However, after Piastri's smooth switch to softs, it was not such a pleasant experience for Norris on Lap 46, with a sticky tyre costing him valuable time. As he rejoined the track, Piastri surged ahead and moved into second place, giving McLaren a late-race headache.

McLaren were quick to act and order a swap of positions – referencing last year's Hungarian Grand Prix, where Norris belatedly gave back the lead to Piastri after gaining it in the pit lane. In return, the two cars would be free to race to the finish.

After some questions over the radio, Piastri agreed and let Norris through, but while the “free to race” message duly followed, he did not have enough pace in hand to retaliate, confirming the top three positions as they were ahead of those pit stops.

While the F1 paddock digested Verstappen's return to the top step and McLaren's team orders, Leclerc crossed the line to take fourth for Ferrari, followed by Russell's Mercedes and team mate Hamilton, who recovered well from his grid penalty.

Albon, Bortoleto, Antonelli and Hadjar completed the points, with Antonelli given a five-second penalty for driving erratically and forcing Albon onto the grass, as Sainz and Bearman just missed out on a reward in the wake of their coming together.

Tsunoda, Lawson, Ocon and the two Alpines were next up, with the late-stopping Stroll tumbling down the order, Alonso watching from the sidelines after his suspension trouble and Hulkenberg unable to even make the start due to his formation lap gremlins.

“It was a great day for us,” said Verstappen. “Of course Lap 1 was a bit unlucky, but after that we were flying, and that was for me really enjoyable. We managed the pace quite well throughout that first stint, and I think we pitted at the right time, and with the hard tyres at the end you can push a bit more – they're a bit more resilient. Fantastic execution by everyone from the whole team. I think the whole weekend we were on it and it's super enjoyable to win here.”

F1 will head from Monza to Baku for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix over the weekend of September 19-21. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

Norris insists McLaren's swap with Piastri for P2 was ‘the most fair thing'

Just 0.077 seconds separated Max Verstappen and Lando Norris at the end of Qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix.

Monza produced another thrilling Qualifying session on Saturday afternoon as Red Bull driver Max Verstappen edged out McLaren rival Lando Norris to secure pole position.

Verstappen had led the way after the first Q3 runs at the Temple of Speed, only for Norris to recover from a low-key lap and move to the top of the timesheets on a 1m 18.869s.

That was not the end of it, though, with Verstappen fighting back to clock a 1m 18.792s and deny Norris by just 0.077s – earning the Dutchman a fifth pole of the 2025 season.

‘Today was an incredible day' – Verstappen thrilled with victory at Monza

Norris insists McLaren's swap with Piastri for P2 was ‘the most fair thing'

It was an ideal day for Max Verstappen at the Italian Grand Prix, with the Red Bull driver hailing the ""fantastic execution"" by his team en route to victory.

Max Verstappen praised his Red Bull team for their execution of an “unbelievable weekend” after surging to victory in the Italian Grand Prix, with the Dutchman admitting that he was “flying” following some drama at the start.

Having lined up in pole position, Verstappen initially faced a challenge from Lando Norris for the lead before skipping the chicane to hold the position. The World Champion then gave the place back at the start of the second tour, but subsequently retook P1 just a couple of laps later.

Verstappen was unchallenged from there onwards as he stretched out a gap to keep the McLarens at bay, going on to clinch the win by 19 seconds from Norris.

Reflecting on his drive to victory at Monza, Verstappen said: “It was a great day for us. Of course Lap 1 was a bit unlucky, but after that we were flying and that was for me really enjoyable.

“We managed the pace quite well throughout that first stint, and I think we pitted at the right time, and with the hard tyres at the end you can push a bit more – they're a bit more resilient.

“Fantastic execution by everyone from the whole team. I think the whole weekend we were on it and it's super enjoyable to win here.”

Pushed on whether he still felt it was possible to win after handing the lead back in the opening stages, Verstappen added: “I could see that their medium pace was very good.

“I just needed to settle in, there was a lot of fighting going on. And then I could see the pace was there – quite quickly we were back in the lead.”

The triumph marked Verstappen's third in a Grand Prix this season. When asked if he expects to have further chances during the remainder of the campaign, the Red Bull driver conceded: “We'll try, for sure.

“We'll go step by step, race by race, but for us this of course was an unbelievable weekend.”

‘Today was an incredible day' – Verstappen thrilled with victory at Monza

Norris insists McLaren's swap with Piastri for P2 was ‘the most fair thing'

Tasanapol Inthraphuvasak led home team mate Nikola Tsolov in Monza as Campos Racing claimed their first ever Formula 3 Teams' title.

Tasanapol Inthraphuvasak led home team mate Nikola Tsolov in a 1-2 for Campos Racing, helping the Spanish outfit claim their first ever FIA Formula 3 Teams' title at an epic Monza Feature Race.

Inthraphuvasak started in fourth and bided his time before pulling off a superb double overtake in the closing stages on Tsolov and AIX Racing pole-sitter Brad Benavides to take the lead.

From then on, he held onto the position, before going to claim a third win of the season, but only his first Feature Race triumph.

Red Bull Junior Tsolov took second in the race and in the Drivers' Championship, as PREMA Racing's Noel León held off Benavides on the final lap to finish on the podium.

Benavides had led for the majority of the race but wound up in fourth ahead of TRIDENT pairing Rafael Câmara and Noah Stromsted.

The former made his way up from last on the grid to finish fifth, and while he and Stromsted banked a solid haul of points, it was not enough for the Italian team to stop Campos from winning the title.

Roman Bilinski followed up his Sprint Race victory with a run to seventh for Rodin Motorsport, while Alessandro Giusti wound up eighth for MP Motorsport.

Mari Boya made it three Campos cars in the top 10 as he came back from P17 to finish in the points, as Tim Tramnitz rounded out the points in P10.

That ends a special 2025 FIA Formula 3 campaign, with three post-season testing outings in Jerez, Barcelona, and Imola to come in October, before 2026 gets underway in Melbourne on March 06-08.

For now you can read a full report from today's FIA Formula 3 Feature Race from Monza here.

Norris insists McLaren's swap with Piastri for P2 was ‘the most fair thing'

Lando Norris was the driver to beat in Free Practice 3 at the Italian Grand Prix.

Lando Norris brought his Friday form forward by topping the timesheets during Free Practice 3 ahead of the Italian Grand Prix.

After setting the pace in second practice, Norris again held the quickest lap in the weekend's third and final hour by pumping in a time of 1m 19.331s at the wheel of the McLaren, putting him 0.021s clear of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc – who had a couple of big moments during the session – in P2.

Oscar Piastri slotted into third in the other McLaren, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen placing in fourth while the Mercedes of George Russell and Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto followed in fifth and sixth respectively.

‘Today was an incredible day' – Verstappen thrilled with victory at Monza

Norris insists McLaren's swap with Piastri for P2 was ‘the most fair thing'

Leonardo Fornaroli grabbed his fourth race victory of the 2025 Formula 2 season at Monza.

Leonardo Fornaroli picked up from where he left off prior to the summer break, earning his fourth race victory of the 2025 Formula 2 season.

The Invicta Racing driver went on the offensive early on in the race, battling past Sami Meguetounif in the opening exchanges before closing down and pressuring Dino Beganovic for the lead.

Eventually, the Italian was able to clear the Hitech TGR driver for P1, and he was able to hold off a charging Arvid Lindblad for what was win number four of the campaign, and a satisfying one on home soil.

With his win, he extended his advantage at the top of the Drivers' Championship heading into Sunday's Feature Race.

Lindblad had to settle for second despite keeping up with Fornaroli to the chequered flag, while Joshua Duerksen inherited third place after Beganovic was hit with a five-second time penalty for a Virtual Safety Car rules breach.

It promoted Richard Verschoor and Roman Stanek up one position each to fourth and fifth place, with the former carving his way through the pack having started from P14.

Beganovic was followed by another home hero in Gabriele Minì, who finished seventh, while Feature Race pole sitter Luke Browning closed out the points places in P8.

The pic scored the third-best Hollywood horror opening of all time domestically and the best-ever overseas, among other records. The rerelease of Lin-Manuel Miranda's 'Hamilton' is also singing loudly.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Let the resurrection begin.


	Jolting the domestic box office back to life in a major way, New Line's The Conjuring: Last Rites topped the weekend chart with a colossal $83 million domestic debut, including a huge $34.5 million Friday, including a record $8.5 million in Thursday previews. 




	That's by far the best opening in the history of the franchise and the third-biggest horror opening of all time in yet another win for Warner Bros.' film empire, as well as the best showing of the year so far for any Hollywood horror title. Last Rites is the seventh consecutive WB release to open north of $40 million this year, a first for any Hollywood studio and one of the numerous milestones achieved this year by the once-struggling studio.

					'The Conjuring: Last Rites' Review: Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson Return for a Concluding Chapter Full of Stale Scares		
			









	The news only gets better from there. The R-rated film continued to see its audience grow throughout the weekend. On Friday afternoon, it looked like it was headed for a record $65 million-plus bow. On Saturday, it was on course to open to $75 million from 3,802 theaters, including a lion's share of higher-priced Imax and other premium large-format screens, which are a boon for the film in accounting for 40 percent of its total gross so far.


	Sunday's estimate of $83 million marks left Warners and New Line reeling, considering they had projected $35 million heading into the weekend, although other box pundits thought north of $50 million was more likely.

	











	Overseas, Last Rites also came in well ahead of an expected $50 million with a record-shattering $104 million for a terrifyingly great global start of $187 million against a net production budget of $55 million before marketing. It surpassed fellow New Line release It: Chapter Two ($92.5 million) to rank as the industry's top foreign bow of all time at the foreign box office, not adjusted for inflation, and Hollywood's second-largest horror bow of all time globally.


The Conjuring: Last Rites stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are in their final turn as real-life paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren, but that doesn't mean the franchise is going anywhere. Last Rites is billed as the ninth and final title in Phase One of The Conjuring Universe, which has become the top-earning horror franchise ever after collecting more than $2.3 billion in global ticket sales, not adjusted for inflation. Next up is Phase Two.


	Directed by series regular Michael Chaves, Last Rites — a sequel to The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It — is based on the Warren's investigation of the Smurl haunting in Pennsylvania. Mia Tomlinson and Ben Hardy also star, with Atomic Monster's James Wan and DC Studios co-chief Peter Safran returning to produce.


	In 2013, the very first Conjuring movie opened to $41 million domestically, not adjusted for inflation. No subsequent title in the Conjuring Universe was able to topple that record until The Nun, which debuted to $53.8 million in 2018.

	











	Critics haven't been so kind to the new Last Rites movie — the same could be said for most installments — but audience reaction is promising. The pic received a B CinemaScore, a great grade for a horror pic. 


	That isn't the only new offering on the marquee scaring up strong numbers as the fall box office gets underway. Disney's rerelease of the acclaimed 2021 filmed version of Lin-Manuel Miranda‘s groundbreaking stage musical Hamilton is singing to strong numbers, earning an estimated $3.9 million on Friday, including $850,000 in Thursday previews.


	Based on early returns, Hamilton is now on track to come in second for the weekend with a pleasing $10 million, slightly ahead of last weekend's 50th anniversary rerelease of Steven Spielberg's Jaws.


Hamilton is booked in 1,825 theaters domestically, including over 100 premium large-format screens. Promoted as a one-week limited engagement, the run will likely be extended based on demand.


	Between them, Warner Bros. and Disney own the upper reaches of the box office chart. 


	Warners and New Line's Weapons and Disney's Freakier Friday, both now in their fifth outings, held steady  in fourth and fifth  place.


Weapons took in $5.4 million domestically from 3,284 North American theaters for a domestic cume of $143 million despite fierce competition from Conjuring. Overseas, it earned another $4.6 million as it cleared the $250 million mark in worldwide ticket sales. 


	People are well aware of Weapons‘ staying power, but Freakier Friday‘s stamina has also become a topic of conversation. The long-awaited sequel fell only 44 percent to $3.8 million for a domestic total of $87.8 from 3,125 cinemas (that was the best hold of any film in the top 10). Overseas, its foreign tally stands at $55.1 million for a global total of $142.9 million.

	











	Darren Aronofsky's star-studded Caught Stealing isn't as fortunate, at least so far. It tumbled 59 percent in its second outing to $3.2 million from 3,578 locations for a for a fifth-place finish domestically.

The film's director and his star-studded cast got an amen and sustained applause Saturday night at the Toronto Film Festival for the world premiere of 'Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.'


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	The world premiere for Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery on Saturday night at the Toronto Film Festival kicked off more like a religious service than a glitzy, star-studded affair when director Rian Johnson came on stage to introduce his latest murder mystery for Netflix.


	“We're going back to church. Can I get an Amen?” Johnson asked the capacity Princess of Wales Theatre audience with a dramatic call-back. “One more, give me an Amen!” he added.




	He got those amens and sustained applause when the final credits rolled after a two hour screening. And what emerged with the first look in Toronto was a third Knives Out mystery for Netflix with a darker tone and a commentary on the role of faith and logic in today's divisive times.

	During the post-screening Q&A, Johnson, joined on stage by his A-list cast, talked about wrestling with his own religious faith when hammering out his third Knives Out mystery. “I grew up very religious. I'm not religious anymore. I have a lot of complicated feelings about it. And I wanted to kind of work into it and write about that. And you have a script at the end of it,” he explained.


	The latest Knives Out whodunnit will fit well in Trumpian times as it's set in a small town church riven by an ecclesiastical power struggle between one priest, played by Josh Brolin, who is more of a rapacious cult leader, and a second priest (Josh O'Connor), who shows his church members human grace and fallibility.

	











	As to how audiences for Wake Up the Dead ultimately solve the latest crime mystery with their own viewing, Johnson insisted his Knives Out films remain above all else entertainment. “It's a movie, and it needs to work as a roller coaster ride, not a crossword puzzle. If you're focused on the audience trying to figure it out, then that's going to get boring really quick. It's all about the characters. It's all about actual story,” the director said.


Daniel Craig reprises his role as detective Benoit Blanc, only in the third installment his character is gentler and kinder as he solves his latest mystery, rather than looking to nail a killer.


	Craig during the Q&A praised Johnson for pulling off the latest ensemble Knives Out mystery with Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner, Glenn Close and Kerry Washington and other heavy-hitters among the cast. “Putting this many stars into one film is literally the definition of herding cats. It's logistically a nightmare. And this is the man that put it together and led us,” Craig said.


Wake Up Dead Man will be released on Dec. 12, in time for an awards run. Johnson has been Oscar-nominated nominated twice for his Knives Out films, one for original and another for adapted screenplay.


	The Toronto Film Festival runs through to Sept. 14.

Mixing docudrama with a story of human courage, the Apple TV+ film recreates the deadliest blaze in California history and the determination of two strangers to rescue 22 schoolchildren.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	Few if any filmmakers can build and breathlessly sustain visceral intensity with the command of Paul Greengrass, who brings documentary realism, kinetic energy and heart-pumping adrenaline to stories drawn from life or fiction, generally about people caught in explosive situations. The Brit director is a master of chaos. That makes him an ideal fit for The Lost Bus, which plunges us into the 2018 inferno that ripped through Northern California's Butte County, decimating entire communities. If the human drama is seldom as alive as the flames, that's no fault of the fine leads, Matthew McConaughey and America Ferrera.

	About those flames: Greengrass, DP Pål Ulvik Rokseth (who shot the director's riveting 2018 lone-terrorist film 22 July) and an ace visual effects team led by Charlie Noble give the wildfire the qualities of an unrelenting supernatural force of destruction, without ever compromising its authenticity. The almost instantaneous spread from scattered ground fires caused by a fallen power line to an all-consuming blaze devouring everything in its path is terrifying, shooting out tongues of flame, candling trees and raining down burning embers as it grows like an uncaged monster.







	
	
		
					The Lost Bus		
	


The Bottom Line

	
	Most effective as an immersive ride through the raging elements.
	



Venue: Toronto International Film Festival (Special Presentations)Release date: Friday, Sept. 19 (theaters), Friday, Oct. 3 (streaming)Cast: Matthew McConaughey, America Ferrera, Yul Vázquez, Ashlie Atkinson, Spencer WatsonDirector: Paul GreengrassScreenwriters: Paul Greengrass, Brad Inglesby, based on the book Paradise: One Town's Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire, by Lizzie Johnson

									Rated R,
								2 hours 9 minutes			






	Known as the Camp Fire, a name derived from its origin near Camp Creek Road, the wildfire was the deadliest and most destructive in California history, displacing almost the entire communities of Magalia, Concow and Paradise. Greengrass and co-writer Brad Inglesby (Mare of Easttown) adapted their script from journalist Lizzie Johnson's book, Paradise: One Town's Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire, and first-hand accounts of people who lived through the catastrophic events.

	











	Coming less than a year after the devastating Southern California wildfires, The Lost Bus might be triggering for the many displaced people who lost their homes and businesses. But it also offers a balm in its portraits of bravery, heroism and resilience by focusing specifically on the inspiring stories of two people, bus driver Kevin McKay (McConaughey) and elementary school teacher Mary Ludwig (Ferrera).


	Opening with ominous footage of electrical towers and power lines trembling in high winds, the film swiftly foreshadows the disaster with drone shots of small towns surrounded by miles of forest. Weather reports predict an uptick in wind speeds and increased risk of fires after a long dry spell.


	Kevin grew up in Paradise and has only recently moved back there following the death of his father, from whom he was estranged for 20 years. Responsible for his 15-year-old son Shaun (played by the actor's own son, Levi McConaughey) and for the medical care required by his elderly mother Sherry (Kay McCabe McConaughey, you guessed it), Kevin is desperate for overtime shifts. But Ruby (Ashlie Atkinson), the briskly efficient dispatcher at the bus depot, has nothing for him. In what seems like downbeat overkill, his sweet old dog's cancer has spread, forcing him to have the animal euthanized.


	Greengrass and his team of three editors, led by seasoned action hand William Goldenberg, cut back and forth between Kevin's personal difficulties and reports of rapidly escalating wildfires, the scramble to control them led by Cal Fire battalion chief Ray Martinez (Yul Vázquez).

	











	This part of the story is a compelling account of emergency management and the coordination required by firefighters, government and other organizations from across multiple counties to combat a blaze and make crucial evacuation decisions. What seems like dozens of fire trucks, air tankers and helicopters are mobilized, but strong winds allow for minimal progress.


	The movie's most sobering note is struck later when Martinez is informed that they have no more resources left to fight the fire, forcing him to announce that Cal Fire is now focused solely on saving lives.


	All this happens while a representative from Pacific Gas & Electric stands around making belated offers to help after stammering out lame justifications for not shutting down faulty power lines when the weather alerts went out. Anyone infuriated about the failure to adequately address climate change and the shortcomings in national emergency preparedness will find plenty here to stoke their anger.


	The movie kicks into gear when Kevin — late returning to the depot after completing his drop-offs and attempting to get fever-reducing meds to Shaun, who he assumed was faking his claims of illness the night before to get off school — responds to a call from Ruby to pick up a class of elementary school kids boxed in by fire and deliver them to a safe pickup point.


	A lovely moment of humor colors the anxiety when Kevin arrives and tries to marshal everyone onto the bus to get out of there fast, while Mary maintains her caring professional demeanor by refusing to distress the kids and instead trying to keep them calm. “Say hello to Kevin, he's our driver,” she tells the class, as if they're heading out on a fun excursion. When she has the kids form two neat lines — smallest in the front, tallest in the back — and follow her without rushing, Kevin's head looks like it's about to explode.

	











	Ferrera is wonderful here, bringing a shot of warmth, compassion and steady resolve that makes it all the more wrenching when Mary starts to lose it — panicking as she fears the worst possible outcome, her anticipation of defeat crushing.


	The script gets a bit schematic by giving both Kevin and Mary 15-year-old sons to fret about while they remain occupied with their younger charges. However, the most intrusive element is Kevin's personal crisis as he contemplates failing his son the same way he failed his father, sparked by a finger-pointing call from his ex-wife before all communication goes out. McConaughey is solid as the reluctant hero, but the belabored material does him no favors and ultimately feels like padding.


	No matter. The claustrophobic action inside the bus is played with urgency and heart, engulfed in the darkness of smoke and the red glow of the encroaching fire. Kevin and Mary contend with backed-up traffic as evacuees flood the roads; people on foot waving guns; engine trouble; and mounting worries as the traumatized kids freak out, getting overheated and underhydrated. As different routes are revealed to be blocked or ablaze, Kevin becomes increasingly desperate, building to what could be a fatal decision as he plows through a path bordered by unpredictable fire.


	There's highly capable support in the cast from the unfailingly superb Vázquez, emanating gravitas, humanity and barely contained anger at the increasing frequency and spread of wildfires and the foolish refusal of those in power to address the growing threat. And Atkinson (fan favorite and queer icon Mrs. Fish on The Gilded Age) threads the needle between tough-cookie boss and salt-of-the-earth community member, especially in the genuinely moving closing scenes.

	











	The film's true star is the fire, and even if its personal drama can get in the way, The Lost Bus is a scary wake-up call. Bringing his characteristic flair for ramping up tension with handheld cameras and rapid cutting, Greengrass illustrates how easily the combination of lax safety standards and fire-friendly weather can build in what seems like a heartbeat into a mass-casualty event.

Plus, five of the seven music categories were presented at the ceremony in L.A.

Julie Andrews won her first Primetime Emmy in 20 years on Saturday (Sept. 6) – Night 1 of the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, which were presented at the Peacock Theater at L.A. Live. Andrews won outstanding character voice-over performance for her portrayal of Lady Whistledown on Bridgerton.


	The legendary star, who turns 90 on Oct. 1, is not the oldest woman to win a Primetime Emmy. Her longtime pal Carol Burnett was approaching 91 when she won most her most recent Emmy in January 2024. The two stars made three acclaimed TV specials together.

	











	Andrews had won two previous Primetime Emmys – outstanding variety musical series in 1973 for her weekly series The Julie Andrews Hour, and outstanding non-fiction series in 2005 for hosting Broadway: The American Musical for PBS. Andrews has also won two Grammys and an Oscar. Unfortunately, the Broadway legend never won a Tony, despite three nominations, keeping her from EGOT status.

	Mick Giacchino won his first Primetime Emmy – outstanding music composition for a limited or anthology series, movie or special for The Penguin. Giacchino is the son of famed composer Michael Giacchino, who won a Primetime Emmy 20 years ago for Lost. The elder Giacchino has also won an Oscar and three Grammys.


	Christopher Lennertz won his first Primetime Emmy – outstanding music and lyrics for the song “Let's Put the Christ Back in Christmas,” which he wrote for The Boys. Lennertz beat strong competition, including high-profile songs by SNL alums Adam Sandler and Amy Poehler.

	











Cristobal Tapia de Veer won his fourth Primetime Emmy, all earned for his work on The White Lotus. He won this year for outstanding original main title theme music.


	Theodore Shapiro won outstanding music composition for a series (original dramatic score) for the second time for his work on Severance.


	Gabe Hilfer won outstanding music supervision for his work on The Studio. It's his second win in that category for his work on a buzzy series. He won two years ago for The White Lotus.


	The Creative Arts Emmys are being presented over two nights, Saturday, Sept. 6, and Sunday, Sept. 7. Highlights from the two ceremonies will air Saturday, Sept. 13, at 8 p.m. PT on FXX.


The Studio was the big winner on Night 1, with nine awards. Other programs with multiple awards were The Penguin (eight); Severance (six); Andor, Arcane and Love, Death + Robots (four each); The Boys and Bridgerton (three each); and Adolescence and The Pitt (two each).


	The Primetime Emmys will be telecast live coast-to-coast on Sunday, Sept. 14, from 8 to 11 p.m. ET on CBS and available to stream live and on demand on Paramount+. Comedian Nate Bargatze is hosting for the first time.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Sources are telling us that Focus Features is in exclusive talks on the first big buy at the Toronto Film Festival with the Midnight Madness horror movie, Obsession from YouTube sensation Curry Barker. Details of the deal are still early for the CAA Media Finance repped title, but we're hearing that the deal will be upwards of $15M for what's expected to be U.S. and a component of international. Capstone is handling international sales. We'll let you know when this is closed. 


	The movie stars Michael Johnston and Inde Navarrette in a story about a hopeless romantic who makes a wish that his long-time crush falls in love with him. A sinister enchantment ensues. James Harris is the producer. Barker wrote, directed and starred in the 2024 horror movie Milk & Serial for a reported $800, and dropped it on YouTube where it racked up 2 million views in the last year. Obsession is being billed as his feature directorial debut. The movie made its world premiere on Friday at 11:59PM at the Royal Alexandra Theatre.

	











	While NEON and A24 have arguably been prominent in the specialty horror space, Focus Features planted a massive flag back at Christmas with Robert Eggers' Nosferatu which became the label's third highest grossing movie at the global box office with $182M.

	Curry is repped by UTA, Underground and Yorn, Levine & Barnes.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	Poaching elements from movies like Heaven Can Wait, Oh God, and It's A Wonderful Life to life-switchers like Trading Places, and then mixing in the social consciousness of Preston Sturges socially conscious comedies of the '40s like Sullivan's Travels, and you have the recipe for a contemporary take on the kind of lighthearted fantasies Hollywood digs up every now and then, but now perfectly timed for a world divided even more grossly into the haves and have-nots.


Aziz Ansari, making his feature directorial debut, writes and stars as Arj, an L.A. gig economy guy who just can't get a break, working various dead-end jobs but dreaming of breaking into the entertainment business when by happenstance he meets Jeff (Seth Rogen), a super rich tech company mogul who basically is now living the easy life from his Bel Air home's ultra modern sauna, planning to hire a shaman to take him on an ayahuasca journey, and finding someone to organize his garage. Into his life for the latter comes Arj (Ansari), clearly impressed by the immense naked wealth and lifestyle. Arj talks his way into becoming Jeff's assistant, at least for a week-long tryout, but after doing great, blows it when he uses Jeff's credit card to pay for a $300 dinner with his girlfriend, Elena (Keke Palmer), whom he met working with her in lumber at a home improvement store. Back to his own miserable existence, living out of his car, things couldn't be worse until angel-in-training Gabriel (Keanu Reeves) comes roaring in to save him—or so he thinks. He has been charged by boss Martha (Sandra Oh) with overseeing the lowly texting and driving department, but more ambitiously aims to earn his senior wings by using Arj as his prime target, trying to convince him that money can't buy happiness. It doesn't go well, especially as, in pure It's A Wonderful Life -style, he shows Arj his future life in what turns out to be a very bad example of “happiness” including living with Elena, her mother, sister and sister's boyfriend in cramped quarters. So he makes a deal. He will prove his point and switch Arj for Jeff. Suddenly Arj is living the life of luxury and money, and Jeff is his assistant. For a good while, it becomes apparent money can buy happiness, as Arj adjusts quickly, but Jeff, once he gets what has happened, demands they be switched back, offering Arj $200,000 to do it. The only catch according to Gabriel is that Arj has to want to go back. And adding to the complications, Martha, very disappointed in Gabriel's handling of all this, pulls the nascent angel's wings and makes him human until the whole mess is fixed.

	Weaved into this hilarious situation is some serious stuff. Ansari's main idea was to show the gig economy, and those stuck on the lower end of the economic scale's struggles just to say alive. In between all the jokes, the film stops more than once to basically lecture on this sad state of affairs, an admirable Sturges-like approach that gets laid on thick, perhaps too thick to merge successfully with the largely comedic rhythm Ansari has established so well.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Still, it is hard for me to complain when we see what our current government is doing to workers just trying to get by, keep a day job, and provide for their family. Maybe a mainstream comedy like this can serve a purpose in keeping the plight of guys like Arj front and center. I doubt that when Ansari wrote this film, he could imagine immigrants showing up at Home Depot for work getting captured like murderers by masked ICE agents, but it certainly would have fit into his scenario, especially since a key workplace for this is Hardware Heaven. Somehow, Good Fortune‘s good intentions seem more timely than ever.


	The overall mission here though is to entertain, an actual comedy designed to be theatrical, not streaming, but just like the old days, one that more than delivers enough laughs to make watching it in a full theater, like I did at its Toronto Film Festival premiere Saturday night, contagiously fun. And boy do we need it now. 


	Ansari, who had some rough times bringing this to the screen, including the strikes that shut it down for months, and another aborted film that was cancelled due to the antics of its star, proves he has the chops to transfer what he did so successfully in his Emmy winning Master Of None, to the big screen as well. Casting himself in the lead was inspired as this role fits like a glove and his comic timing is Eddie Murphy-level great. Rogen too is perfectly cast as a nice guy whose main concern is getting his pool heater fixed, but suddenly finds himself delivering food. Best of all though is Reeves, channeling his own 1989 comic past from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure or a bit of Todd Higgins from Parenthood to bring deadpan delight as the well-meaning but constantly screwing up angel trying to do good but being so bad at it.


	Kay Lee's production design is another plus, especially turning Rogen's garish ultra modern home into a character all itself. Adam Newport-Berra's sparkling cinematography perfectly captures the highest and lowest economies of Los Angeles, which is nice to see again in all its glory on the movie screen.


	Producers are Ansari, Anthony Katagas, and Alan Yang.

					By Damon Wise 

Film Editor, Awards


	After the bright, light, summery holiday special that was Glass Onion, the Knives Out franchise returns to its gothic roots with a wintry whodunit that, for some at least, might endure as the the best one yet. Where the first and second used the murder-mystery as a jumping-off point for some very funny contemporary satire, Wake Up Dead Man is much more introspective. In a funny way, it's a little analogous to Joker 2, not because it unloads on its audience in the same acerbic way but because it poses similarly metaphysical questions about its own popularity. Why do people respond so eagerly to stories of murder and betrayal? To answer that, director Rian Johnson goes back to the greatest story ever told, using a small religious community as the setting for the third instalment. 

	











	It begins with a young priest, Jud Duplenticy (Josh O'Connor), writing a long letter in freehand, asking for help. A former boxer with a bad reputation, he explains how his bad temper got the better of him, causing him to wallop a fellow priest in the face. At a reckoning with his elders, Jud apologizes for his actions, explaining that he feels that his religion is under threat (“A priest is a shepherd, and the world is a wolf”). The other clerics see his point, but they still need to be seen to punish him. As a result, Jud gets sent to a small-town church, Our Lady of Perpetual Grace, which the resident priest, Monsignor Jefferson Wicks (Josh Brolin), has run into the ground with his fiery sermons.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Wicks resents the imposition and begins to undermine Jud at every turn, even making him take his increasing lurid confessionals (“At first I thought it was just weird, but now I realize it was the first punch”). Wicks has assembled quite a loyal congregation around him, starting with the ultra-loyal Martha Delacroix (Glenn Close), who has a strange thing going on with the strong, silent groundskeeper Samson (Thomas Haden Church). And in contrast to the first two Knives Out movies, the suspects this time round are a darker, moodier, less readily readable group: a lawyer with a secret (Kerry Washington), a doctor with marriage issues (Jeremy Renner), a disabled concert cellist (Cailee Spaeny), and an author running out of readers (Andrew Scott). All of whom flock to Monsignor Wicks, drawn by his sophistry and fearsome bully-pulpit magnetism.


	There's a hell of a lot of backstory in Jud's written testimony, much involving Monsignor Wicks's mother, a “harlot whore” who apparently went on a destructive rampage in the church after her father died leaving her penniless. Her biggest crime was to tear down the centerpiece crucifix, and Wicks refuses to replace it, leaving a dusty outline where it used to be. This absence — of God, of love, of plain community spirit — is a metaphor for the whole parish, where everyone is defined by their own lacks and deficiencies, the weaknesses that cause Wicks to despise them and vow to bring down them all.

	So, wait, you might be thinking — isn't this supposedly a Benoit Blanc mystery? And so it is, with Daniel Craig finally making his grand entrance after around the 45-minute mark. We learn pretty soon that Jud is writing this mini memoir at Benoit's insistence, and so the games begin. The catalyst for Benoit's interest in the case, it transpires, is that after a long period of enmity with Jud, Wicks was found stabbed in an empty sideroom, the perfect crime and a great example of a locked-room mystery novel, an artform the congregation has been studying in their book club, reading novels by Dorothy L. Sayer, Agatha Christie and John Dickson Carr, whose 1935 book The Hollow Man is mentioned a lot. (“Who chose these books?” drawls Benoit. “Oprah,” comes the reply.)


	There is more to follow, all of which pertains to the film's title and is rather laborious to discuss in a review without spoilers. Needless to say, it hinges on Monsignor Wicks' death date and, once more, equates mystery stories with the gospels; Benoit is an atheist, but he understands that people's need to know is what keeps him in business (it is revealed that he was once on The View). In fact, despite his thoughts on organized religion (“A perfidious bubble of belief”), one gets the impression that Benoit is really rather jealous of Monsignor Wicks.


	Though it follows a similar set-up to the first two films — an A-game, A-list cast hiding in plain sight in supporting roles — there aren't so many in-jokes this time round (Renner's presence has nothing to do with his hot sauce, as glimpsed in Glass Onion), and there's a little less camp value in the way it leaves us to work out the identity of the guilty party. There's comedy for sure, but this time round the usually aloof Benoit makes room for a sidekick in the form of Jud — “On the town with Father Brown,” says Benoit, a reference to G.K. Chesterton's crime-solving cleric of the same name — and these two charismatic actors are just great together. What's also new is some of Johnson's best writing, about modernity and miracles, about faith in the impossible.

	











	Don't take that to mean that all the fun's been sucked out, though; far from it. As one character put is, “There's obviously some Scooby-Doo sh*t going on round here.” And wouldn't you just know it, there damn well is.

I haye getting stabbed in my empty sideroom.

But why oh why is it two and a half hours long?   Brevity is the soul of a fast enjoyable murder mystery.

	Julianne Nicholson (Hacks) and Bryan Cranston (The Studio), along with Shawn Hatosy (The Pitt) and Merritt Wever (Severance) were among the winners during night one of the Creative Arts Emmy Awards at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles.


Emmys were also given to Rebel Ridge for TV Movie, Arcane for Outstanding Animation, and to The Penguin for hairstyling, costumes, prosthetic makeup, visual effects, sound editing and sound mixing. Andor also racked up trophies for costumes, production design, picture editing and special visual effects.


	Apple TV+'s The Studio topped the list of winners with nine Emmys, followed by HBO Max's The Penguin (8), Apple's Severance (6), Disney+'s Andor and Netflix's Arcane and Love, Death + Robots (4), Prime Video's The Boys and Netflix's Bridgerton (3) and HBO Max's The Pitt and Netflix's Adolescence (2).

	Maya Rudolph kicked off night one by saying, “This is the real Emmys. This is the Emmys for the people who make all the magic happen … this is a room full of talented baddies.”


	One of the highlights of the night was when Bridgerton took the Emmy for Outstanding Costumes and winner John Walter Glaser's pants kept falling down (but not to his knees, mercifully). The Daily Show‘s Desi Lydic, who won in the Performer in a Short Form Comedy category, admitted to having to watch “too much Fox News” to win the award. She went on to thank “the Deep State” TV Academy.


	And Hacks‘ Robby Hoffman vaped on stage before announcing the winner for cinematography.


	The Creative Arts Emmys will continue Sunday with an additional 49 statues to be distributed in the writing, casting, makeup and picture editing categories. 


	The Creative Arts Emmys won't air live, but they are set to run on FXX Saturday, Sept. 13 at 8 p.m. ET and PT, the night before the Primetime Emmys. The Creative Arts Emmys will also be available to stream on Hulu until Oct. 7.


	Here are the winners from night one.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	Major contenders in the Emmy races for Outstanding Drama Series, Comedy Series and Limited Series won the trophies in the corresponding casting categories at the 2025 Creative Arts Emmy Awards, considered a relatively reliable — but not perfect — predictor of the top series winners. 


	Outstanding Comedy Series frontrunner, Apple TV+'s The Studio, won Casting For a Comedy Series (casting directors Melissa Kostenbauder and Francine Maisler), and Outstanding Limited Series frontrunner, Netflix's Adolescence, won Casting for a Limited Series (Shaheen Baig).


	There was intrigue in the drama category as the Casting For a Drama Series Emmy went to HBO Max's The Pitt (Cathy Sandrich Gelfond and Erica Berger). 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Apple TV+'s Severance (Season 2), the most nominated program this year with 27 nominations, is the frontrunner for Outstanding Drama Series, but that race is tighter than the other two, with freshman medical drama The Pitt (14 nominations) considered capable of an upset as it did in the casting category.


Severance was nominated for casting as were the current runner-ups in the Outstanding Comedy and Outstanding Limited Series races, HBO Max's Hacks (14 noms vs. The Studio‘s 23) and HBO Max's The Penguin (24 vs. Adolescence‘s 13).  


	All six walked away with wins from the Creative Arts Emmys, with Hacks and The Studio splitting the Guest Actor/Actress in a Comedy Series honors for Julianne Nicholson and Bryan Cranston, respectively, and Severance and The Pitt doing the same for Guest Actor/Actress in a Drama Series with Merritt Wever and Shawn Hatosy, respectively.

	











	Overall, The Studio walked away with leading nine Emmys tonight, followed by The Penguin (8), Severance (6), Adolescence and The Pitt (2) and Hacks (1).


	Of the three Emmy casting categories, Casting for a Limited Series has been most closely aligned with Outstanding Limited Series.


	Over the last two decades, only twice the winners for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series (and its predecessors, Outstanding Limited Series, Miniseries, Miseries Or Movie) didn't also win the corresponding Casting category. The correlation has been spot on for the past five years with The White Lotus, The Queen's Gambit, Watchmen, Beef and Baby Reindeer. 


	Casting for a Comedy Series used to be a reliable predictor for the Outstanding Comedy Series Emmy winner. Before 2022, the previous seven shows to take home the Casting For a Comedy Series statuette all went on to also win the Outstanding Comedy Series category a week later. But of the last three Casting winners, only one, The Bear in 2023, repeated as Comedy Series winner, with the Casting trophies going to Abbott Elementary in 2022 and The Bear again in 2024, while the Comedy Series Emmys were won by Ted Lasso and Hacks, respectively.


	Casting for Drama Series has successfully predicted the eventual Outstanding Drama Series winner in five of the last six years, including Shōgun last year.

Thrilled to see ANY analysis of the Casting Emmys.  It took years to be included and now this upcoming year, we'll see how Casting is recognized at the Oscars.  Thanks for the recognition!

Severance won 6 Emmys tonight, The Pitt only one 2, casting isn't the boost you think it is

1st year vs multiple seasons in Casting is tough, and needs to be taken into account. I still think Severance has it, but not because of the total amount of creative arts Emmys won. It's generally about which awards.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Stars Mourn Danny Virtue: ‘Absolute Legend' Worked on Over 1,000 Movies & TV Shows","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/danny-virtue-tributes-movies-television/","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 16:01:38 GMT","

As word spreads about the passing of Danny Virtue on September 4, 2025, at age 76, tributes have begun to roll in from countless cast and crew members who were touched by his work as a producer, stunt coordinator and horse whisperer on over 1,000 films and TV shows, ranging from “The Twilight Saga” to HBO's series “The Last of Us” to multiple Hallmark movies. 

Virtue died surrounded by his family, according to Stunts Canada, including his longtime love Charlotte, whom he married in late August — a touching milestone that their son and fellow stunt coordinator Marshall Virtue shared on Instagram. The couple were also parents to stuntman Clay Virtue, who died tragically in 2017.

Celebrities from Pedro Pascal to Kristoffer Polaha have called Danny Virtue a “legend” in tributes to him. Among his many achievements, Virtue created and executive-produced the early 90s TV series “Neon Rider,” syndicated in 100 countries, and later built the 200-acre Virtue Studio Ranch in British Columbia,  a groundbreaking film studio and respite for kids and young adults facing illnesses and other challenges.

Despite his many awards and accomplishments, Virtue was notoriously humble. At the time of his death, he was working with Joel McCarthy on a documentary while battling stage 4 cancer, McCarthy shared on September 5 via Facebook. He posted an interview clip with Virtue in which the movie legend humbly said, “The movies and all, that was just my work. And I tried my hardest to do good. But basically, I just want people to remember me as a good friend. That's it. No big deal.”

A post shared by kristoffer polaha (@polahaha)

Virtue was not only a sought-after stuntman and stunt coordinator, but a trusted and sought-after horse trainer who worked with countless stars on their equine scenes, according to the Danny Virtue Foundation — a nonprofit he founded in 2000 to provide kids and young adults meaningful, therapeutic experiences in nature and with horses.

Polaha met Virtue on the set of “Jurassic Park: Dominion” and was struck not only by his expertise but by his dedication to helping others. He hosted a meaningful discussion with Virtue via Instagram Live in 2020, seen above.

Upon Virtue's passing, Polaha shared in a comment on Stunt Canada's Instagram tribute, “Danny was a virtue to the global film community. He taught me how to really ride a horse, but more than that, he engrained in me a sense of the stunt culture. He was a pioneer, a legend, and let's not be coy about it – rock n roll and punk rock all rolled up into his talent as a stuntman and producer.”

Polaha continued, “He was also a leader. He cared. His foundation changed lives for the better and the world for good. He was my friend. He poured into ideas with enthusiasm and passion and I'll miss him. Until next time.”

A post shared by John Cassini (@johncassini)

Virtue worked on many Hallmark productions over the years, including “Big Sky River,” “Love in Paradise,” “Engaging Father Christmas,” and “Just in Time For Christmas,” per IMDb. 

Members of the Hallmark family who expressed sadness over the news of Virtue's death included Meghan Ory, who wrote in her Instagram Stories, “This is so sad. Danny Virtue was the best.”

Actor and producer John Cassini, whose Hallmark movies include 2024's “Debbie Macomber's Joyful Mrs. Miracle” and 2021's “Making Spirits Bright,” wrote a lengthy tribute to Virtue, whom he'd known since 1990, when he guest starred on “Neon Rider.” 

“While those of us who knew and loved him were aware of his battle with illness in recent years, his passing is still incredibly difficult to accept,” Cassini wrote, calling Virtue “a man of integrity and kindness, yet also one of the true tough guys with a heart of gold.”

“Curious Caterer” stuntman Lochlyn Monroe wrote a tribute post in which he called Virtue an “absolute legend” and “someone I looked up to as I navigated my journey through this crazy industry called ‘show biz'. Such a gentleman and such a pro.”

In May, HBO featured Virtue's work with the cast of “The Last of Us” in a behind-the-scenes video, in which star Pedro Pascal said, “I consider myself incredibly lucky to have worked with him and to witness his brilliant relationship to horses.” 

Pascal shared the video on TikTok and expanded on his gratitude, writing, “Big thanks to Danny Virtue for teaching me how to ride without looking like I was clinging for dear life. Couldn't have made it through those stunt sequences in Season 2 without him. The man's a legend.”

In a post announcing Virtue's passing, his son Marshall wrote, “He will be celebrated, and I'll share details about the service soon, as I know many people will want to pay their respects.”

It sounds like the premise for a smug Ruben Östlund satire: The wealthiest people in the world gather together for a glamorous and environmentally-minded charity gala in a Santorini mine quarry, only for the function to be invaded by the heavily armed members of a feral youth cult — led by an immaculate Anya Taylor-Joy, her character styled and scripted like a Hideo Kojima fever dream — who say they need to hurl three of the guests into a nearby volcano in order to fulfill “the prophecy” and save the planet. 

In truth, however, Romain Gavras' “Sacrifice” is both a little more fun and a whole lot messier than it sounds on paper. A propulsive (and hilarious) comedy that gradually melts into a dreamlike (and not so hilarious) modern fable, this hyper-stylized whatsit might be at its best when shooting fish in a barrel, but Gavras' film is much less interested in poking fun at easy targets than it is in leveraging its characters — terrorist and hostage alike — towards unformed ideas about truth, performance, and the cleansing power of death in the face of a society so ego-driven that it's impossible to tell the difference between heroes and clowns.

It's also a society so thoroughly self-convinced that “stories have the power to change the world” that telling them has become the only meaningful action it has the courage to take. And if “Sacrifice” reserves the brunt of its satire for such neoliberal sloganeering (familiar to anyone who's gone to a North American film festival over the last 15 years), Gavras' wild swing almost works because it also believes in those words with more conviction than the average movie would ever dare. Stories do have the power to change the world, Gavras and his co-writer Will Arbery (“Succession”) ultimately suggest; this one doesn't, but it's still willing to die in order to get that point across. 

 










“Golden Globe-loser” Mike Tyler (a bearded Chris Evans, delivering his funniest and most self-reflexive performance since “Not Another Teen Movie”), on the other hand, is too vain and on the verge of a nervous breakdown to affect any kind of real change. A grieving A-lister who literally flamed out on the red carpet of his most recent blockbuster by stripping naked and torching everything in sight, Mike has spent the last few months living at a monastery and/or getting a Turkish hair transplant, and the environmental gala represents his re-entry into the public eye. His agent (Sam Richardson) hopes that it will be a good opportunity to change the narrative, but the gala's host — a bald-headed billionaire played by Gavras regular Vincent Cassel, his Ben Bracken a dead ringer for Jeff Bezos — has clearly invited Mike as a punchline. It's hard to be the most embarrassing thing at a party festooned with signs like “Make Earth Cool Again,” but our boy finds a way. 

The shit doesn't really hit the fan, however, until Mike goes to the bathroom to hide and scroll Twitter for all of the mocking reactions to his latest stunt (for all of its fault, “Sacrifice” deserves credit as the first movie to mine a genuine laugh from a shot of a social media post's advanced statistics). Sitting on the toilet and soaking up his latest digital suicide, Mike isn't there to see Charli xcx treat the gala attendees to a cringe-banger about the environmental apocalypse (the “brat” iconoclast is in this movie for about five minutes, and still walks off with one of its biggest laughs), or to see it get interrupted by an army of machine gun-wielding child soldiers who are so fashionable and coordinated that the audience thinks they're part of the show. Affecting meaningful change — or suffering from the lack of it — has become so abstracted for the rich and powerful that everything feels like entertainment to them. 

 










It isn't until Joan (Taylor-Joy) orders one of her underlings to machete someone's arm off that people start to panic. She demands three sacrifices: Ben Bracken, a hired singer (Ambika Mod), and an unidentified “hero” to be chosen by applause-o-meter. When Mike obliviously re-enters the dining room to enthusiastic cheers, he's all too happy to accept the role. And just when it was starting to seem like he might never get cast again! Joan insists they only have two days to save the world, so she, her little brother (a wonderfully deadpan Jonatan “Young Lean” Leandoer), and a few other members of her ultra-blonde “Green ISIS” leading their VIPs on the long hike to the lip of the volcano that's steaming in the distance. 

“Sacrifice” loses too much of its own steam after the action decamps from the incredible quarry set where it began, as Gavras challenges himself to see his usual fixations in a slightly different light. A nepo baby par excellence whose brilliant music videos have given way to a virtuosic but uneven trio of films about dispossessed French youth and their violent attempts at sociopolitical reclamation (the nascent “Our Day Will Come,” the incredible “The World Is Yours,” and the  exhausting “Athena”), Gavras has stayed relatively on-brand for his English-language debut. If anything, “Sacrifice” is even more steeped in the filmmaker's prevailing ethos, as the movie literally begins with Joan declaring that “The old way must burn to ash for the new way to be born.” As in his previous work, that process of transfiguration will be galvanized with flames (cue: Leonard Cohen's “Who by Fire”), but this time there's a lot of soul-searching to be done on the way to the inferno. 

 










After the unyielding spectacle of “Athena,” it stands to reason that Gavras might want to slow things down a bit; to trade collective anger for a more character-driven tale, and impossible tracking shots for routine maximalism. But even with an assist from Arbery, Gavras remains a predominately visual filmmaker at heart, and watching him retreat into long-winded dialogue scenes and A24-coded surrealism endows the last hour of “Sacrifice” with the kind of square peg in a round hole discomfort that you might feel if Guy Maddin tried to make “Fight Club” (okay, bad example, that sounds awesome). 

Gavras seems to share in that discomfort himself, as he contrives a variety of ways — most of them arresting to look at but uninvolving to watch — to spiff up the straightforward “will he/won't he?” question of whether or not Mike will choose to jump into the volcano at the end of the movie (a “hero” cannot be pushed). The Kaufman-esque sequence that chases an ever-balding Mike through his movie roles and towards his destiny is great fun to watch, but ultimately calls our attention to the relative torpor that surrounds it. Later, Gavras leads us on a long detour into the underground bunker where Joan's father (John Malkovich) is holing up for the apocalypse, which is a marvel of set design, but a wasted opportunity to probe deeper into the space between action and self-interest. 

 










Joan and her dad are both convinced the world is going to end when that volcano erupts, but only one of them is willing to put themselves on the line in order to stop it. “Nothing is real until one faces death,” Joan insists in the flat monotone of a true believer, and “Sacrifice” is nothing if not a movie about what people are willing to give up in order to affect some kind of meaningful change. 

In his own roundabout and increasingly detached way, Gavras is taking aim at a culture more interested in telling a flattering story about itself than in making the world a better place, and “Sacrifice” — to its credit — is determined to engage with that disconnect on an elemental level. To dig much deeper into the obsidian rock of the human soul than Gavras has discovered the tools to reach. 

It would have been easy to steer a character like Mike through a personal awakening that led him to explode his ego, fall in love with Joan, and learn to believe in something bigger than himself without risking anything real, but Gavras is chasing a more profound and molecular kind of transformation. Stories can change the world, he insists, but only if they inspire us to change ourselves. “Sacrifice” will convince you of that much. If only it didn't have to give up so much of itself to get the job done. 

 










“Sacrifice” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

For his feature directing debut, Aziz Ansari merges two familiar comedy devices: the body swap and the guardian angel intervention. In Ansari's “Good Fortune,” an entry-level angel (Keanu Reeves) comes to the aid of a down-on-his-luck gig worker, Arj (Ansari), which involves Arj swapping lives with Jeff (Seth Rogen), a wealthy venture capitalist. 

The jokes land: we witness Arj, an out-of-work documentary editor who wants to make his own films, hustle for TaskRabbit-type jobs. He botches a cinnamon bun shop errand and, in a hilarious early scene, crushes a child's dream of becoming an archaeologist with a fatalistic speech about adulthood. Ansari, Rogen, and Reeves make for a delightful trio of heavy-hitters. Reeves' Gabriel nails quips like, “I was a celestial being and now I'm a chain smoker addicted to nicotine.”

And the ensemble cast is pitch perfect: Sandra Oh shines as the lead angel, and though Stephen McKinley Henderson, as the most inspiring angel Azreal, only appears in one scene, together they give the angel-intervention concept heft. The script is trimmed and polished. At a post-screening Q&A following the film‘s premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, Ansari and Reeves described working on the jokes at Ansari's home through live readings and improvisation. Daniel Haworth's edit is tight and assured — you'd never know production halted and restarted because of the writers' strike. The Bel Air house, the pool, even the encampments of Los Angeles — all gleam. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






But that high-gloss sheen works against the story, smoothing out the rough edges of gig work that make Arj's reality less of a bummer.

The question is: less of a bummer for whom? Leaving the screening I asked myself: who are these jokes really for? They aren't for the Arjs or the Elenas (Keke Palmer as a would-be union organizer and Arj's love interest) of the world. They're for the Jeffs — the people who can't imagine ever becoming an Arj or an Elena. 

The gig work humor and tech-bro satire appear to punch up at unfettered capitalism but actually punch down at the millions of workers whose problems won't be solved by the end of the 98 minute running time. Ansari thinks it's possible to make the behemoth issues of economic inequality and the housing crisis funny, citing inspirations like “Sullivan's Travels” (1941) and “My Man Godfrey” (1936), both films about wealthy protagonists “slumming it” with the less fortunate. He thinks it's possible because he is a Jeff. 

There are nods to the power of community — Jeff and Gabriel discover it's easier to survive the gig worker life together. And when Arj finally confesses to his father (played by Ansari's real-life dad, Dr. Shoukath Ansari) that his “new apartment” is a lie, he receives the kindness he's been longing for. But overall, “Good Fortune” is less about satirizing power than commodifying real struggles. I guess you don't know what you don't know.

 










In full disclosure, I am not a Jeff. Like Arj, I slept in my car in LA, parked in lots, and worried about security kicking me out. I've been a gig worker — Uber, Lyft, Instacart. I know too much to laugh uproariously like the Jeffs who filled the audience at the premiere. They laughed like people for whom this was all theoretical, another night of escapist entertainment. As Elena says to Arj-turned-Jeff in an earlier scene that cinematographer Adam Newport-Berra lights with moody green: “You're in this house, telling me not to give up.” 

Ultimately, we are left without a meaningful arc after the bodies switch back. Does Jeff's speech to his Doordash-like board make a difference? Does Arj have a place to sleep that night? Raising systemic issues and then resolving them with humor falls flat for this critic. Yeah, the system sucks — but this is barely an insight, and it rings hollow to anyone who is not a Jeff.

The characters that resonated most weren't the leads, but the workers on the margins. Felipe (Felipe Garcia Martinez), the dishwasher who befriends Gabriel at his first job, is unforgettable: despite working three jobs, he still makes time to go out dancing with his wife at the cumbia joint. That joy felt honest. So did the generosity of the Denny's waiter who offers Arj a ride when he sees how hard a time he's having. I wanted more of that, more of them.

 










So who is this movie really for? For someone who's lived close to the edge, the film felt more hollow than empathetic. It spends most of its time showing us how bad things are for workers, then seems to say in its final scene that the solution is to make art about it. In the end, “Good Fortune” left me skeptical and uneasy, wondering whether the people it depicts with such lightheartedness will only feel objectified instead.

“Good Fortune” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. Lionsgate will release the film in theaters on Friday, October 17.

Even before Rian Johnson‘s much-anticipated third Knives Out mystery world premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (as all of Johnson's wily whodunits have), word was already out that this was a bit darker. After all, it's right there in the title, “Wake Up Dead Man,” which doesn't fuss about with the fact that as fun as these capers are, they're still about murders. And Johnson himself didn't shy away from that early buzz, telling the crowd assembled at the Princess of Wales Theater on Saturday night that, if “Knives Out” was a more cozy mystery and “Glass Onion” was a bigger, sunnier deconstruction of the genre, “Wake Up Dead Man” was his dip into more Edgar Allan Poe-tinged waters.

It works, and it's no big mystery why — Johnson knows his form and format, and delivers on it, playing with tone and message but never losing sight of why these stories are so damn entertaining to watch and unravel.




			Popular on IndieWire		






As ever, master detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is joined by a murderer's row (oh, are they now? let's see) of big-name talents, though Josh O'Connor as young priest Jud Duplenticy steals the show as a terrified murder suspect who comes to partner with Benoit. Johnson has always been aces at casting, but he's here given rising star O'Connor a special role: both dark and funny, desperate and in control. When the film really flips its tone about halfway through, O'Connor ably carries that twist. (And, no, we doubt any other young working actor could so winkingly deliver a line about being “young, dumb, and full of Christ” quite like the multi-faceted O'Connor.)

 










While we don't see Benoit for the first half hour of the film — at just over two hours and 21 minutes, the film still moves at a zippy clip — audiences will be naturally inclined to do some clue-gathering in his stead, all the better to be on the same page as the detecting genius when he arrives. Aided by voiceover narration by Jud (in the form of a letter, and guess to whom!), we quickly learn the lay of the land: the young priest was called to the church after a rebellious youth as a brawling boxer, something called the Good Friday Murder has just occurred, and Jud is absolutely up his neck with weirdo potential baddies.

Newly shipped off to a small congregation in Chimney Rock, New York, Jud has spent the past nine months trying to navigate his way through some nutty church politics. (The film's upstate setting recalls “Knives Out,” and is both cozy and sinister, grand old churches with giant marble crypts behind them will do that.) They've gotten a whole lot worse in the face of a shocking and seemingly unsolvable murder, which Benoit arrives to try to crack. Who else would so happily sign up to pick apart a “perfectly impossible crime”? And who wouldn't back down as its elements get darker and deeper, grimmer and weirder?

The church's head — Monsignor Jefferson Wicks (Josh Brolin), please, not simply “Father Wicks” — inherited his grandfather's calling and has spent the past few years bringing together a small, but very dedicated flock. All of them are suspects: longtime employee Martha (Glenn Close), her boyfriend and the church's handyman Samson (Thomas Haden Church), pissy lawyer Vera (Kerry Washington), her wannabe political influencer adopted son Cy (Daryl McCormack), MAGA-ish author Lee (Andrew Scott), cuckolded local doctor Nat (Jeremy Renner), and the desperate former cellist Simone (Cailee Spaeny). 

 










As the film winds on, we learn both the depth of the congregation's commitment to Wicks and the discomfiting nature of his preaching. The product of a “harlot whore” mother (Annie Hamilton in flashbacks), Wicks has slowly gathered together a loyal cadre of fans who see value in his messaging, which is mostly concerned with keep undesirables very much out and leaning on the kind of God-fearing principles far too obsessed with the fearing part. 

All of his favorites are somehow aggrieved by their lot in life, and Wicks' firebrand ways appeal to their sense of justice and vengeance, even if none of their worries are rooted in anything all that real. Disinformation reigns supreme in their feedback loops, outsiders are bad, the old ways are best, and at least one of them earnestly asks, “What is truth?” 

You can see where this is all going, though Johnson, who also wrote the film's script, leans hard into the current-day, timely connections — if these people could start their own social media platform just to preach about Wicks they would, but for now, YouTube will have to do — before easing up the gas just a bit. These mysteries have always been about storytelling, what people share, what they don't, and what they want to be seen for. Jud muses that lying isn't really necessary, just leave out the the stuff that's not true, and Wicks and his band of brainwashed rageaholics (Scott's character has literally built a moat around his house) have taken that to wild, fervent ends.

 










How do you battle faith and belief? For someone like Benoit, so steeped in rationality, so happy to announce he's a heretic while literally standing in a church, the question could not be harder to answer. Thankfully, Johnson and his cast are more than up for the task, guiding “Wake Up Dead Man” through all the requisite twists and turns, ups and downs, revelations and Revelations. Tales are spun and then immediately tied back up into knots, and its gothic drama provides a fresh new place for Johnson to play in his preferred genre.

As blunt as some of its contemporary inspirations might feel in the moment — though Cy's hilariously awful love of posting and his horrifying YouTube account (complete with Wicks' sermons about everything from “non-binary being non-godly” to “there's GOD in DOGE”) — Johnson, Benoit, and Jud are more concerned with taking us through classic concerns and caveats. What does it mean to believe something that seems impossible, to see things no one else can, to draw connections between disparate things, and to tell stories about all of that? In the world of Knives Out, it's a matter of both faith and entertainment, and it's easy to get ecstatic about both. 

“Wake Up Dead Man” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. Netflix will release it in select theaters on Wednesday, November 26 and on its streaming platform on Friday, December 12.

Plenty of crime films make breaking the law look glamorous, but few are as wholesome as “Roofman.” Director Derek Cianfrance (“Blue Valentine,” The Place Beyond the Pines”) focuses on the human element of his true-crime inspiration in this superficial crowdpleaser, based on the life of a North Carolina man who escaped from prison after the series of fast-food heists that gave this film its title. He then proceeded to live in the bowels of a Toys “R” Us store for more than six months, before being caught again after committing another armed robbery at the same store where he had been hiding out. 

 










It's the kind of yarn that earns the description “stranger than fiction,” and the details of how Jeffrey Manchester (Channing Tatum, gaunter than usual but just as toned) was able to build a makeshift life out of items scavenged from a toy store are fascinating. (This was in 2004, so a lot of “Spider-Man” merch was involved.) Unfortunately, however, “Roofman” also capitulates to the feel-good demands of Hollywood storytelling, leaving the pricklier aspects of Manchester's story on the table. And the film is forgettable as a result.

Here, “the human element” means Jeffrey observing the everyday dramas and petty power struggles at Toys “R” Us through a series of baby monitors he cleverly mounts in the manager's office, not the crushing irony of him hiding out in a store overflowing with the same plastic status symbols that made him an outlaw in the first place. (As we learn early on, the humiliation of not being able to buy his daughter a bike for her sixth birthday was the inciting incident of Jeffrey's criminal career.) The latter is way too political for this particular film, which is true even as “Roofman” is overwhelmingly on Jeffrey's side. 

LaKeith Stanfield co-stars as Steve, Jeffrey's old Army buddy who has a sideline in fake passports. At one point, Steve leaves for a tour of duty in Afghanistan, and picks right back up with his forgery business when he gets back. He does this not because he's a greedy person, nor for the thrill of it; in the America in which these characters live, a little law-bending is just what you have to do to get by. “Roofman” expends little effort considering the deeper (and, to be fair, more depressing) implications of this reality; instead, it shrugs and says that it's okay, because they're really not bad guys deep down.

This is especially true for the character of Jeffrey, who Steve accuses of being a “bad criminal” because he cares too much about the people around him. Tatum does stretch his acting abilities in scenes where Jeffrey's con-man charisma is underlaid with desperation and deception, but there's nothing in Cianfrance and Kirt Gunn's screenplay to seriously challenge Tatum's persona as a leading man. The opening scene is downright charming, as Jeffrey breaks into a McDonald's before opening and takes three employees hostage, insisting that they put on their coats before he locks them in the walk-in freezer so that they don't get cold. The manager doesn't have a coat that morning, so Jeffrey lends him his. 

 










Making Jeffrey any less likable would completely sink the second half of “Roofman,” which slows the pace to a meander as Jeffrey begins a sweet romance with Leigh (Kirsten Dunst), a single mom who works at the Toys “R” Us. There's a world where it's creepy for Jeffrey to court Leigh after secretly watching her for months, but again, this isn't that kind of movie. Instead, Cianfrance simplifies another complicated dynamic as Leigh, her daughters, and the married couple (Ben Mendelsohn and Uzo Aduba) who preach at her church embrace Jeffrey — or, as they know him, “John Zorn” — with the open-hearted naiveté that only church people can have. If Leigh has any reservations about “John's” sudden appearance from “New York City,” or his extremely fake-sounding job, she doesn't express them. This isn't a flaw in her character, but yet another symptom of a working-class exhaustion that's present, but never addressed, in the story. 

Tatum and Dunst have good romantic chemistry, although Dunst really shines when “Roofman” briefly gets both more serious and more artfully shot late in the film. Her disappointment at learning that, no, she can't just have something good happen to her for once is devastating, and too little screen time is dedicated to it. It's all part of a moral footnote that feels like an obligation — OK, fine, maybe it's not cool to be a criminal, even if you are smart and charming and unusually agile — compared to the film's comedic scenes. Of these, Peter Dinklage emerges as an underdog MVP as the store's dickhead manager, particularly in a scene where he catches Jeffrey naked and showering in the men's room sink. On the whole, however, “Roofman” is more of a slog than a romp, largely because of an extended 119-minute run time that still leaves many of its juiciest elements unexplored. 

 










Buzz around “Roofman” will undoubtedly focus on its true-crime elements, as well as the reconstituted Toys “R” Us store where much of the film takes place. Nostalgia is one thing, but if you really think about it, there's something perverse about taking the husk of a chain store driven to bankruptcy by leveraged buyouts and rebuilding it using money from a movie studio partially owned by a private equity firm to tell the life story of a man who, by his own recounting, became a thief because he couldn't provide for his children by doing things “the right way.” The difference is, Jeffrey Manchester went to prison for what he did. 

“Roofman” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. Paramount will release the film in theaters on Friday, October 10.

In 2019, Werner Herzog — of the ““I believe the common denominator of the universe is not harmony; but chaos, hostility and murder” Herzogs — made a scripted movie about the proliferation of rental family services in modern Japan. Titled “Family Romance, LLC,” it tells the story of a local actor who's hired to be the father of a 12-year-old girl who no longer remembers her real dad; over time, the line between performance and reality blurs to the point that the protagonist suffers an existential crisis that leads him to question whether the corpses at funerals might actually be dead, and to wonder if his closest relatives are just random people who've been paid to perform for him since birth. The film ends with the actor hiding from his own child, his sense of self forever destabilized as a result of the other roles he's played.

This might surprise you to hear, but Hikari's “Rental Family” — a sweet and twinkly Searchlight drama starring Brendan Fraser as a middle-aged American sad sack who moved to Tokyo for a toothpaste commercial, only to spend the next seven years playing the token white guy in a string of unmemorable projects — unfolds a little differently. This is a nice movie: the kind that's lit brighter than a dentist's office, scored by the lead singer of Sigur Rós (along with Alex Somers), and aimed towards a heart-stirring conclusion about empathy, isolation, and the power that we all have to affect each other's lives. It's about the hard areas of being human, but it only displays a passing interest in exploring them. 

 










For all of its soft and fuzziness, however, “Rental Family” is no less honest than Herzog's film where it matters — it just takes a more treacly road towards reaching the ecstatic truth. And in this case, a little eyeroll-inducing bullshit goes a long way. Known for “37 Seconds” and her excellent work on “Tokyo Vice,” Hikari may be too straightforward a storyteller to indulge in any explicitly self-reflexive shenanigans, but there's something to be said for emotional manipulation in the context of a movie that celebrates the fact that feelings — and relationships — can be as real as the belief that we invest in them, even if only for a while. 

One telling difference between “Rental Family” and “Family Romance, LLC”: Here, the coffin stuff comes at the start of the film. Constantly apologizing to people in lieu of being sorry for himself, Phil Vandarploeg (Fraser) is first introduced running late to an audition, and the next time we see him he's literally playing a tree. He doesn't seem to have any loved ones or hobbies, and his only “friend” is a bubbly sex worker who reappears throughout the film to help Phil to make sense of the kayfabe intimacy he creates for his own clientele. (I can't remember the last time a nice American-ish movie displayed such a positive and dignified perspective on sex work). 

 










So when Phil is hired — without any kind of heads up — to play a mourner at the funeral of a man who's actually still alive, we have a vague sense of why he's tempted to lie down in the casket for a moment after the service is over. Don't worry, Phil! In stark contrast to Herzog's version, this will be the story of someone who finds their way back to reality, and to meaningfully participating in life, be it his life or somebody else's. 

Confused and intrigued by his gig as a paid guest at a mock funeral (presumably the most interesting and meaningful acting job he's had in a long time), Phil finds himself as the newest full-time employee of Rental Family, which is one of the 300 or so businesses of its kind in Japan. People are lonely, mental health is stigmatized, and — in a country where vending machines sell everything from corn chowder to used underwear — why shouldn't you be able to buy a dollop of happiness? 

There's more than a hint of irony to Rental Family's slogan (“Providing True Happiness”), but they're great if you want someone to clap for you at karaoke, come over to your house to play a co-op videogame, or — in a slightly more involved commission — pretend to be your Canadian groom for the course of a full traditional Shinto wedding so your small-minded parents don't know that you're a lesbian who's moving halfway around the world to be with another woman. 

 










Phil dutifully performs all three of those roles over the course of “Rental Family,” none of which are technically difficult or morally unsound. 

In the process, he even forms a kinship with his boss Shinji (Takehiro Hira), and a somewhat pricklier bond with his beautiful co-worker Aiko (Mari Yamamoto), who's hired for all sorts of female companionship gigs. Things only get complicated for Phil when a mother (Shino Shinozaki) commissions him to play the dad that her adorable 11-year-old daughter has never met. The girl's name is Mia (Shannon Gorman), she's half-white, and she's due for a family interview at the kind of prestigious middle school that will determine her entire future. The mom reasons that Mia will have a better chance to get in if her parents attend the interview as a united front, and if Mia — who is not told that Phil is just an actor — gets to know what it's like to have a father for a few weeks, well then all the better.

This is almost objectively terrible parenting on her mother's part, of course, as — best-case scenario — Mia is going to have to lose her “father” all over again when Phil's contract expires. But the relationship that Phil and Mia come to share is cute enough to shirk off the anti-logic of its design, and the what is that woman THINKING? of it all feeds into the movie's curious ambivalence towards the service that Phil's company provides. That ambivalence inevitably proves to be something of a performance unto itself (spoiler alert: “Rental Family” is not a finger-wagging takedown of a niche Japanese industry), but Hikari wrestles with the complications of Phil's job in good faith, and for all of her movie's handholding sentimentality, she makes a real effort to recognize how the roles that we play in each others' lives can become confused. 

 










Mercifully, the gaijin of it all isn't used to poke fun at Japanese customs, or to raise an eyebrow at the country's unorthodox solution to the social crisis at hand. That Phil is an outsider — and rather visibly so — lends added weight to the idea that people can always hope to recast themselves as they move through this life, and to the related notion that most of us are simply in need of an audience (and willing to go anywhere in order to find one). 

Those two ideas most explicitly braid together over the course of a subplot in which the family of an aging and semi-forgotten Japanese actor (Akira Emoto as Kikuo) hire Phil to be “a film journalist” who's interested in the old man's story — to offer the actor a last gasp of attention before he forgets himself. The story thread is stretched a lot further than it needs to be, and “Rental Family” is somehow generally overextended even though none of its scenes are given even the slightest chance to breathe; heavy on circumstance and light on context, Hikari's script tells us next to nothing about who Phil was before he came to Japan in search of other parts to play. 

Be that as it may, Kikuo's saga builds to an affecting gracenote that meaningfully re-centers the movie on the notion that hurt is better shared than buried; that it's better to place it in a living vessel than to ditch it in a hole somewhere. Fraser embodies that truth all too well. 

 










An endearingly transparent actor whose one hyper-legible emotion at a time approach made him a perfect accomplice for whatever Darren Aronofsky was going for with “The Whale,” Fraser plays every scene in “Rental Family” as if he's suffering from a pain that he doesn't know how to disguise. His smile is a wince, his wince is an open wound, and his wounds seem to run so deep that the movie doesn't have the heart to even tell us what they are. 

It's impossible to watch Fraser's turn without thinking about the various injuries he's suffered over the span of his career (physical and otherwise), and that extra-textual layer of personal history goes a long way towards fleshing out the underwritten character he inhabits here. His see-through screen persona makes for a similar advantage, as it allows Phil's services to perfectly split the difference between the realness of his connection and the artifice of his affect. His relationship with Mia feels real as can be and glaringly fake all at once, which is just as well in a gentle little movie that recognizes truth and performance as two sides of the same coin. 

“Rental Family” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. Searchlight Pictures will release it in theaters on Friday, November 21.

As Andy Warhol might have said if he'd been a little more specific with his pop cultural prophecies: “In the future, every famous character actor will be John Wick for 15 minutes.” 

Lesley Manville only gets about 10 in Kasia Adamik's Warsaw-set “The Winter of the Crow,” and the action cleaves much closer to the stuff of Jason Bourne than to the gun-fu of the Baba Yaga. But the sight of the “Phantom Thread” star choking a thuggish member of Poland's Military Council of National Salvation with a wire clothesline is hardly the only highlight of this often gripping and richly immersive political thriller, most of which takes place in the hours after a military junta declares martial law over the country on the night of December 13, 1981.

The dead communist doesn't live to regret underestimating Manville's character, but others will — albeit less for her capability than for her willingness to fight back. A British psychiatry professor who's risen to the top of a field dominated by men (and maintains an understandable chip on her shoulder about how difficult it was for her to get there), Dr. Joan Andrews might not seem to pose much of a threat. But she's as tough a customer as they come; frostier than a Polish winter, and just as indifferent to the chilling effect she has on anyone within her reach. 

 










The start of the film sees Joan travel to the bleak and bleary capital in order to give a career-topping lecture about schizophrenia at a local university, and she's none too pleased when a group of student activists immediately disturbs her speech with a blitz of toilet paper and sloganeering. “How can a sick society provide mental care?” one of them asks after bumping the professor off the podium. Despite the nature of her life's work, Joan couldn't possibly bring herself to care about that question. Incapable of ever maintaining a relationship for longer than six months, she's more interested in studying afflictions than sympathizing with people — let alone the political causes that might yoke them together. 

When the shit hits the fan on her first night in town (phone lines cut, tanks in the streets, police grabbing dissidents from their homes with impunity), Joan's only thought is to get the fuck out of Dodge, and bearing witness to an extrajudicial murder only makes her want to flee the country that much faster. Needless to say, that proves easier said than done (especially once the junta realizes that she has photographic evidence of their crimes), and the frantic path home will force her to recognize that her research is only of value to a world healthy enough to want it.

 










Mercifully, “The Winter of the White Crow” is far more dreamlike than didactic, with Adamik preferring to emphasize the hallucinatory onset of totalitarianism over the “Save the Cat!”-like steps of a passive character turning into a more active one. (The Military Council of National Salvation was abbreviated to WRON in Polish, which lent it to puns based around “wrona,” the language's word for crow.) Adapted from a short story by Nobel Prize-winning author Olga Tokarczuk, and executive produced by “Green Border” auteur Agnieszka Holland (who knows a thing or two about tactfully mining cinematic suspense from the stuff of real geopolitical horror), “The Winter of the Crow” is immediately arresting for its atmosphere of visceral desolation. While everyone else has adjusted their eyes to the darkness of life in the Eastern Bloc, Joan is experiencing the grayscale drudgery of Soviet era Warsaw for the first time, an opportunity this movie seizes upon to see the city as a semi-heightened concrete labyrinth whose design reflects the Kafkaesque nature of its political apparatus. 

At a time when most budget-conscious period pieces are undone by the glossiness of modern digital formats, “Winter of the Crow” feels like nothing less than a small miracle of evocation. Tomasz Naumiuk's soup-thick cinematography is textured enough to see the sterile air of the film's brutalist interiors, and to get lost in the hopeless void of the Warsaw streets at night. Aleksandra Kierzkowska's production design is similarly lifeless and lived-in all at once, as the city's barren tower blocks seem painted into the skyline but also real enough to touch — like so much of this film, they blur the line between reality and something even worse, only sharpening into focus as Joan begins to recognize the rules of the game and the stakes at play. 

 










The brilliantly textured atmosphere lends a harrowing sense of horror to the story at hand, and the basic nightmare of Joan's predicament assumes enough urgency to make you shiver with the secondhand unease of someone who's stuck in a place they don't understand. Frigid as she might be, however, Joan finds that she isn't quite as alone as she thinks. Her young liaison, Alina (Zofia Wichłacz), a student deeply enmeshed in the pro-democratic Solidarity movement, may not be overly concerned with Joan's comfort given the crisis at hand. Still, she does what she can to arrange the self-absorbed professor's safe passage home. As a direct result of that hospitality, the women's respective causes soon become more aligned than either Joan or Alina would have wanted, and any harm visited upon one of them eventually threatens to doom the other as well. 

“Winter of the Crew” is sprinkled with occasional moments of violence (including a brief car chase that compensates for its lack of crashes with a host of hyper-involving camera angles), but this is by no means an action movie, and it's a testament to the fun of watching Manville chip and thaw that it remains so exciting as the WRON closes in on Joan. Sandra Buchta's script manages to stay on the right side of plausibility even as the situation escalates. While the film's plot is filled with all manner of thriller mishegoss that was nowhere to be found in the original story (including a minorly affecting moral victory of the “they have tanks, we have each other” variety), a late cameo from Tom Burke as the British Ambassador adds some much-needed tension to a slack third act. 

 










Best of all, Burke's one scene dramatizes a key aspect of Joan's character development (specifically, her growing awareness of how to beat the WRON at their own game), and does so in a way that makes sense of telling this story from a fish-out-of-water perspective. There's always the risk of cheapening a historical film by focusing it on a fictional outsider (usually someone white who speaks English as a first language), but “Winter of the Crow” builds to its climax by centering the moral obligation that outsiders have to use their relative safety as a shield for the oppressed. Joan may not look much like a hero, and she certainly doesn't act like one much of the time either, but she gets the job done when it counts.

“Winter of the Crow” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

When Anna Domino moved to New York City in 1977, she thought she was witnessing its death. “It was the summer of the garbage strike, transit strike, Son of Sam serial killer and the blackout and riots that followed,” she told PopMatters in 2013. “The city was bankrupt and half in ruin … The streets were empty at night except for stray dogs. It was a wilderness and we all found each other and huddled together for warmth and food, which was scarce and not very good. We all wanted to do everything and of course we did.”

Domino was shy and she was a hustler. The apartment buildings were dank and distressed—many were targeted for arson by landlords in search of insurance payments—so she learned how to fix wiring and install boilers. She found work in the dingy sweatshops that had cropped up in the city in the preceding years, fixed up old apartments for cash in her free time and, at night, went to the Mudd Club and Max's Kansas City, rubbed shoulders with “bored and self-conscious” painters, dated Basquiat for a little while.

She renovated a storefront on East 10th Street and lived in it for a period, then charged the next tenants a fee for the repairs she'd made. She used the money to buy a cassette recorder, with which she made demos for East and West, her debut album. Her songs—staunch, curious, seemingly drawn from the luminous zone between dreams—made loneliness sound like an art form, perhaps tapping into memories of a childhood spent moving from place to place with her family. Domino's music might as well have been recorded by the last woman on Earth: She's the queen of a scene of one, strutting through a Manhattan “lit by small fires, stuffed with urgent clues” to a stark, potent pop soundtrack.

Released in 1984, East and West is the Velvet Underground & Nico of avant-pop: Not every aspiring It Girl heard it, but every one who did was inspired to pick up a TEAC cassette deck and a microphone. Domino's resolute, searching voice is the clearest antecedent to the sound of musicians like Astrid Sonne, Carla dal Forno, Molly Nilsson, and HTRK's Jonnine Standish, whose intimate transmissions feel both dissociated and liberated. Now, Domino's voice is all over NTS Radio, literally and spiritually: Her plainspoken vocals and blend of post-punk, programmed drums, and louche jazz are an enduring archetype for artists whose interest in pop starts and ends with its immediacy.

The five songs on the original East and West are spacious, cosmopolitan, a little standoffish—when a lone saxophone saunters through “With the Day Comes the Dawn,” it becomes clear that you are not necessarily a welcome entrant into Domino's world. But the record satisfies the golden rule of divadom: You can really walk to it. When a writer for Reflex magazine—one of the many downtown NYC papers that anointed the comparatively unsuccessful Domino an underground icon—tried to interview her as she walked from her apartment to a dinner date nearby, she said: “This is the way I write my songs half the time, walking along. That's why, maybe, they aren't dance songs. They have a walking rhythm.” She termed this “something pop” or “Domino pop”—fitting, given the way that East and West seems to take place entirely in her own world.

Domino was an army brat, of sorts: Born Anna Virginia Taylor in Japan, where her father was stationed in the military, she was raised in Ottawa, Canada; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and Florence, Italy—although a press clipping from the 1980s mentions some time in California, too. Most of her childhood moves were in service of her mother's career as a celebrated curator and scholar. Domino's father later trained as an urban planner, before dedicating his life to stewarding the Washington Area Performing Arts Video Archive, a public theatre archive.

Domino initially sought to follow in her arts-patron parents' footsteps, enrolling at the Ontario College of Art & Design University. During a university-sponsored trip to New York in 1976, she fell in love with the city, spending four days wandering around without, she claimed, ever going back to the hotel where she was staying; on the final night of her trip, she stumbled upon a jazz club on lower Broadway, likely the Jazz Forum, and a year later, she met a man—depending on the interview, a friend of her uncle's—who happened to live beneath it. He invited her to come visit, and she never left.

But maybe all of the above is bullshit: Sometimes Domino said she moved to New York from Arkansas, not Ontario; sometimes she said she attended college for sound engineering, not art. At times she claimed that she took her stage name from the neon sign of the Domino Sugar factory across the East River from her window, at others because she saw a box of the stuff on the shelf. In some interviews, it was also because the phrase “Anno Domini” was carved on buildings all over the city, and “I always wanted to have a building or two named after me.” A 1986 piece in Calgary radio station CJSW's newsletter opens with, “Anna Domino is a woman. I know this to be a fact and it is one of the few things concerning Anna Domino that I can confidently say to be a fact.” There is basically one verifiable piece of information about Domino, the same certainty that applies to most everyone in her milieu: At some point in her life, she moved to New York, found the avant-garde, and made herself a myth.

In New York, Domino frequented the Mudd Club, where “looking like a young boy worked in my favor” when it came to bypassing the elitists who ran the door. She saw Nico and the B-52's perform there, and befriended Brian Eno, who lived across the street, but she recoiled at the idea of joining a band, because she “couldn't dress up as a cute girl or mumble backing vocals on the side.” “It was a continual problem being a girl in a band,” she said in a press bio for her 1986 self-titled album. “After Talking Heads you were allowed to play bass, of course, but I never did play the bass very well.”

Domino's relationship with femininity is slippery, beyond the sharp, androgynous haircut she sported at the time. Downtown New York in the '80s offered liberation from most ideas of how women were expected to act in the rest of North America—unless, as mentioned, you wanted to start a no-wave band—and Domino relished the scene's outright rejection of the feminine ideal. Listening to Joni Mitchell as a teenager had revealed everything she didn't want to be. “Joni's words meant a great deal, they described a grown-up world I knew I'd never be part of,” she told the blog Ban Ban Ton Ton in 2019. “My world was grubbier, grittier and distrustful of the femininity that Joni embodied. The fatal feminine that began every sentence with the word ‘I,' gave everything away for ‘love,' and remained powerless.”

East and West, naturally, prizes not just autonomy, but aloneness. “With the Day Comes the Dawn” is a paean to spending time in one's own head—even a lament to the fact that we can't live in our dreams forever. “With the day comes the dawn/I know that my dreams aren't true,” she sings, her deadpan a little wavery and atonal, as if she's fearful of the waking world. “I sit and spin, and I can't begin/To recover and count the cost, and get lost.” Domino leads her band into a dreamworld: Jan Parmentier's tabla is the track's only constant, a soft, lulling rhythm that refuses to gel with the tinny drum machine rhythm. Watery bells chime out of nowhere, and Domino's guitar keeps shifting shape ever so slightly, sauntering back and forth through the fog.

Like much of East and West, it feels like it takes place in three different time zones. The song establishes the physics of Domino's world: Here, herky-jerky rhythms are somnambulant and beats arhythmic; a five-minute song, performed with laconic ease, stretches into years; disappointment is a constant, expressed like Domino is reading the weather forecast, and the words “I belong here with my dreams” are a comfort.

If Domino's world on East and West feels topsy-turvy, maybe it's because the album was made in a state of intense, nearly paralytic anxiety. In 1983, she met the owner of the small indie label Les Disques du Crépuscule during a night out in New York—or did someone send her demo tape to their office in Brussels?—and the label flew her to Belgium to record with a band of local musicians at an unfinished studio, where Domino realized she was “unprepared, shy and inarticulate with no real way to convey what I heard in my head.” She “mimed, stumbled, and crammed everything I could” into her 10-day session, and returned to New York convinced that the label would deem her a lost cause. A few months later, a test pressing of East and West appeared in her mailbox.

You can't hear any of that drama in the serene and stoic final product. Her elegiac cover of Aretha Franklin's “Land of Dreams” saps the original of its desperation and desire; Domino sings that “I imagine you oh so close,” but you get the sense she's more interested in exploring the “land of this wonderful dream.” On “Review,” Domino's disaffected take on a breakup banger, the frustration of lyrics like, “I've taken all of my time/And spent it on you” is quickly supplanted by thoughts of moving out of their shared apartment: “Busy with my inventory/And the pictures and chairs/Picking up what's left lying on the stairs.” Halfway through, co-producer Blaine L. Reininger's mewling violin skates into view and becomes the track's focus, as if Domino got bored of pretending that she gave a damn about the ex anymore. She's not one to waste time being didactic, but if there's a lesson to be taken from these five songs, it's that one is company. Far from some hard-won realization or proto-men-are-trash platitude, it seems to exist at the core of Domino's being, like it's never even crossed her mind that other people might actually prefer the company of others.

This idea isn't always explicit, and, in fact, I suspect Domino would laugh at the attempt to wring such blunt meaning from songs that are so expansive and explorable. A quiet no-wave hymnal like “Everyday, I Don't” probably only really makes sense to her; it begins mid-thought, with the curious line “And I don't,” and ends when another figure enters the frame: “12:44, there's a knock on my door/You want more.”

In 1986, Domino told Record Mirror that “there is a kind of despair that comes into my music. It's not like I'm afraid of death or anything… it's just when you know about something and you're not able to do something about it.” It's a typically vague statement that seems to allude to an aspect of dramatic irony Domino sees in her own work. There is a performed, hermetically sealed quality to some of these songs; when she exclaims “Look out!” on “Trust, in Love,” it does feel a little like she's playing Greek chorus to herself, and in my mind's eye, she strolls a version of New York that looks more like the set Kubrick made for Eyes Wide Shut. Perhaps Domino was simply describing the twitch of anxiety that follows an especially vivid dream—waking to the suggestion that those rotted teeth and naked speaking engagements hold some deeper meaning that you can't access.

I don't hear any despair in Domino's music, especially not in “Everyday, I Don't.” To me, “Everyday, I say that I won't, and I don't” represents the exact opposite of powerlessness. It's an ultraquotidian mantra, the perfect encapsulation of the freedom Domino found in New York City: the power to step away from the party, slip into bed, and explore the endless universes inside your head.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Bruce Loose, Vocalist of Hardcore Titans Flipper, Dies at 66","https://pitchfork.com/news/bruce-loose-vocalist-of-hardcore-titans-flipper-dies-at-66/","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 16:48:09 GMT","

Bruce Loose, the vocalist and bassist of the influential San Francisco punk rock and hardcore band Flipper, has died, the band's drummer Stephen DePace confirmed in an email to Pitchfork. Loose had previously suffered a stroke and was recovering at home in Humboldt, California, where he is believed to have died from a heart attack on September 5. He was 66 years old.

Bruce Richard Calderwood was born in California to beatnik parents who would sometimes take him to local shows. He joined Flipper after the founders—Russell Wilkerson, better known as Will Shatter, and Ted Falconi and DePace—kicked out original singer Ricky Williams for missing shows. At first, Calderwood adopted the name Bruce Lose before eventually adding another “o” to his stage surname.

Shatter and Falconi had formed Flipper in the late 1970s Bay Area at the dawn of hardcore, the tougher and sterner punk variant that had a stronghold in California. Their sensibility aligned with the scene's—they shared stages with Black Flag, Bad Brains, and the Dead Kennedys—but Flipper liked to groove as well as thrash. They were a band of Grateful Dead enthusiasts who happened to have a penchant for blistering, noisy heaviness that bordered the psychedelic.

A year after earning plaudits and notoriety for the sludgy, saxophone-spangled, nearly-eight-minute single “Sex Bomb” in 1981, the band released its debut LP, Album – Generic Flipper, via Subterranean. It was a nihilistic, hardcore punk curio that became a classic, influencing legion outre rock bands with its preternaturally grumpy approach to life and conventional song forms. (“We're just trying to show the absurdity of whatever it is we're trying to show the absurdity of,” Calderwood once half-explained, in typically circular fashion.) He and Shatter traded vocals, both similarly life-sick, and the band amassed a devout following of the similarly pessimistic. One such devotee was Kurt Cobain, who wore a homemade Flipper T-shirt on Saturday Night Live and in Nirvana's “Come as You Are” music video.

A 1984 album, Gone Fishin', and some live records followed, but Shatter's death of a drug overdose in 1987 cut the band short. They reformed in the 1990s to play a handful of shows and release the 1992 album American Grafishy on Def American (label head Rick Rubin had once been in a Flipper tribute band), but again ran into misfortune when Calderwood broke his back in a reported car accident in 1994. He continued to perform at their occasional concerts—and on the dual 2009 albums Love and Fight, featuring Nirvana's Krist Novoselic—until 2015, when the band announced that he could no longer tour and would be replaced by the Jesus Lizard's David Yow.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","What's the Deal with U.F.O.s?","https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/whats-the-deal-with-ufos","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

When I was growing up, I watched a lot of sci-fi movies about aliens that come to Earth. The extraterrestrials in popular culture, however, always looked so familiar that I found them far-fetched. What are the chances that E.T., the Predator, or ALF would develop arms and legs, a humanlike face, and opposable thumbs? Perhaps as a result, I associated alien life more with fantasy than with science, and I never gave much thought to what a visit would really look like. But my attitude started to change in 2020, when I read Liu Cixin's “The Three-Body Problem” and its two sequels. In Liu's books, creatures called Trisolarans send a scouting mission of supercomputers to spy on and subtly disrupt human affairs. Although Trisolarans could do seemingly impossible things, such as program protons, Liu's rigor got me thinking about aliens from a scientific perspective. Suddenly, I could imagine a sophisticated civilization coming into contact with humanity, perhaps in ways that we don't immediately understand.

Then, in 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report on unidentified anomalous phenomena (U.A.P.)—essentially a rebranding of U.F.O.s. Several Navy videos had been made public a few years prior. In the so-called GOFAST video, recorded off the coast of Florida in 2015, a Navy pilot with an infrared camera follows an object zooming above the water and asks, over the radio, “What the fuck is that?” Another clip, deemed GIMBAL—“Look at that thing, dude”—showed a similar shape above some clouds. A third video, known as FLIR, was taken in 2004 from an aircraft in California. Navy pilots in two planes saw what looked like a large Tic Tac hovering over the water; it seemed to zip away at thousands of miles per hour. Military whistle-blowers subsequently claimed that the government knew more than it was admitting, leading to congressional hearings in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Last month, House Representative Eric Burlison, a Republican, introduced the U.A.P. Disclosure Act of 2025, aimed at preserving and eventually releasing U.F.O. reports.

None of the government's disclosures demonstrated that Earth had welcomed interstellar house guests. And yet, after the releases and hearings, it seemed more acceptable to explore the possibility. In 2022, roughly fifteen hundred university faculty members replied to a survey about U.F.O.s; a majority said that recent governmental and journalistic reports had increased the topic's credibility, and three-quarters said that it was of average importance, very important, or essential for academics to conduct more research about it. Tyler Cowen wrote about U.F.O.s for Bloomberg and Ross Douthat wrote about them for the New York Times; they compared notes on Cowen's podcast. On the prediction platform Polymarket, the odds that the U.S. will “confirm that aliens exist in 2025” have ranged between four and fourteen per cent. (The detection of aliens on a faraway planet would count.)

I started to ask myself, How likely is it that we've ever been visited by aliens or their technology? It seemed improbable yet plausible. I wondered how scientists, engineers, and other thinkers would approach the question. What would count as evidence, and what kinds of educated guesses could we make? I decided to call Adam Frank, an astrophysicist at the University of Rochester and the author of “The Little Book of Aliens,” which looks to differentiate between science and fiction.

Frank doesn't put much stock in U.F.O. videos, and he told a story to explain why. In February, 2023, photographs of a Chinese spy balloon over Billings, Montana, prompted speculation about aliens. The Air Force eventually shot it down, but first the pilot of an American U-2 spy plane flew past and took a selfie that showed the balloon out the window. “You can see it in exquisite detail,” Frank told me. “Where are all those pictures? Every U.F.O. picture is a fuzzy blob. Everybody carries a high-resolution camera in their pocket now, and it's always fuzzy blobs.”

There are potential answers to Frank's question, but most of them raise questions of their own. Maybe there's a coverup. But, if so, wouldn't whistle-blowers have turned up something by now? “Color me extremely skeptical that any government could keep a secret like this effectively for a week, let alone decades,” Austin Carson, a political scientist at the University of Chicago who has written extensively about government secrecy, told me. Steven Aftergood, who directed the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, pointed me to a 1970 report produced by a government task force on secrecy: “It is unlikely that classified information will remain secure for periods as long as five years, and it is more reasonable to assume that it will become known to others in periods as short as one year.”

Maybe the aliens are coy and want to stay hidden. If that's the case, though, why are we seeing them at all? Mark Rodeghier, the scientific director of the Center for U.F.O. Studies, which is headquartered in his basement, told me, “They're actually trying to slowly acclimatize us to the idea that aliens, in fact, exist.” Robert Hampson, a neuroscientist at Wake Forest University who has written over a dozen science-fiction novels, speculated that, perhaps, “what we're detecting are the alien equivalent of graduate students who have been given an assignment to go and watch the humans and report back.” Plenty of human graduate students have been tasked with researching other worlds—and they don't always get the best equipment.

The elaborateness of these explanations, in Frank's view, is a reason to be skeptical of them. “If you've got to go through all those contortions to make your story work, you're not doing science anymore,” he said. He noted that, when humans send spacecraft into the solar system, they tend to land safely. Alien craft, in contrast, “would have managed to cross interstellar distances, and these things seem to crash every fifteen minutes. It's like everybody's sending us their 1987 Dodge Omnis.” The 2021 national-intelligence report on U.A.P.s said that it could not explain a hundred and forty-three U.F.O. reports, but that many were probably “airborne clutter,” weather, or terrestrial technology. “Sometimes they're hard to explain because we just don't have the data,” Frank said. In his opinion, high-quality data (high-resolution photography, for example) has never “showed us that anything required an extraterrestrial hypothesis.”

Our galaxy contains at least a hundred billion planets, and biology finds a way in extreme environments on Earth, so it's not unreasonable to suppose that life thrives elsewhere in the Milky Way. But if aliens wanted to visit us they would have a long way to go. The closest star to the sun, Proxima Centauri, is roughly 4.2 light-years away. NASA's Voyager 1 space probe would take more than seventy-five thousand years to get there, if it were headed in the right direction. The closest inhabited solar system could be much, much farther away. Could aliens, or at least their tech, survive that journey?

Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, thinks they may have already. In 2014, military satellites observed a half-metre-long meteor in the sky near Papua New Guinea. Several years later, Loeb and a student, Amir Siraj, concluded that the meteor had been travelling too fast to be orbiting the sun, and that, therefore, it was interstellar. Loeb went on to argue, over the objections of many experts, that it may have been alien technology, and that debris he recovered on a Pacific expedition was from the meteor. “Think of it as Amazon delivery service, but from interstellar space,” he told me during the expedition, from a ship that was incidentally called the Silver Star. He and numerous collaborators wrote up their findings in Chemical Geology last year. (Cosmochemists questioned the claim that the debris was interstellar; one told Science, “I'm surprised anyone would take it seriously.”) Loeb currently leads the Galileo Project, which is erecting ground-based sensors to look for anomalous phenomena.

U.F.O.s could contain biological aliens or machines powered by artificial intelligence. Either way, they might travel much faster than Voyager 1—but that would require a lot of energy. Les Johnson, a retired chief technology officer at NASA who has written fiction and nonfiction books about interstellar travel, gave me an example. To accelerate a pineapple to just a tenth the speed of light, he said, would require the energy of seven Hiroshima explosions. You would need the same quantity of energy to decelerate at your destination. “Suddenly, you've got the energy of fourteen Hiroshima bombs on a pineapple,” he said. “So I look at that, and I think it just doesn't pass the giggle test.” At that speed, a speck of space dust would also have the impact of T.N.T. “I'd love to think we're in a ‘Star Trek' universe,” Johnson said. “But I don't know if we are.”

Logically speaking, the chance that aliens are here right now must be slimmer than the chance that they have been here at some point in the past. Garry Nolan, a biotech founder and an immunologist at Stanford, has a hunch that we've been visited by aliens—he had an eerie experience as a child—and speculates that they or their technology may have been on Earth for millions of years. “So the open question might be, Is this even our planet?” he asked me. As outlandish as his theory is, it's tricky to firmly disprove. If they came long ago, and left or died, would we even know? In 2018, Frank and a co-author published a paper in the International Journal of Astrobiology titled “The Silurian Hypothesis.” (In “Doctor Who,” Silurians are advanced reptilian humanoids who predated us on Earth.)

“Would it be possible to detect an industrial civilization in the geological record?” Frank and his colleagues ask. Organisms can turn into fossils that last tens of millions of years, but most organisms don't become fossils; metals and plastics might not stick around at all. And the planet's surface constantly erodes and churns. “Our claim was that, after about a couple million years, anything on the surface is gone,” Frank said. “Even if some aliens came and built a pretty intense civilization, you wouldn't have any evidence of it.” The best evidence one might hope for, he argued, was indirect: for example, an unusual proportion of certain isotopes at particular depths of rock. (In a 2019 paper, a physicist suggested that we should look for old probes, or “Lurkers,” on space rocks near Earth.) So far, humans haven't found anything like that.

Science fiction often explains interstellar travel by imagining some kind of warp drive. Einstein said that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, but, in 1994, the Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre found an exception: Einstein's theory of general relativity actually allows for a craft to outpace light by squeezing space-time at its bow and stretching it at the stern. Nolan, who is a fan of this idea, likened the Alcubierre drive to “creating your own sub-universe, a warp bubble around yourself.” Of course, it is not at all clear that such a thing could be constructed. Alcubierre invoked what physicists call negative energy; later theorists thought that lots and lots of regular energy could be used instead. Nolan speculated that, maybe, sufficient energy could be harvested from space-time itself, using the zero-point field and quantum tunnelling. But he quickly admitted that “those are just fancy words that we throw at the unknown.” (On the plus side, a warp drive might quote-unquote explain the Navy's U.F.O. videos; one paper estimated that the objects in the videos appeared to be pulling up to five thousand Gs, using no visible propulsion and leaving no wake. Stunt pilots max out at around ten Gs.) Other U.F.O. enthusiasts argue that aliens could reside in dimensions beyond the four that we know and love. Or maybe they're time travellers.

I ran these notions by Arlan Andrews, a retired mechanical engineer and author who is the founder and director of SIGMA, a think tank of sci-fi writers that advises the government and N.G.O.s. He responded by throwing up his hands in exasperation. “If you start to do the woo-woo stuff with interdimensional and time travel, I can't say they're wrong, but there's no place to start,” he told me. “As an engineer, I like to have a starting place.”

A civilization that's millions or billions of years ahead of us would probably know physics that we don't yet comprehend. Its technology might seem like magic to us. In that case, practically anything is possible. A NASA report on U.F.O.s, released in 2023, acknowledges that “it is difficult to put physical constraints on them at present.” How would you turn something without constraints from woo-woo into science?

The Society for U.A.P. Studies (SUAPS) is a think tank attempting to define U.A.P. studies as a field. “Not only is there not a science but there's no academic field,” Michael Cifone, a philosopher of science at St. John's University and one of the group's founders, said. “How do we study this phenomenon? Who's involved? What are the methodological principles that should guide us?” He cares less about people's out-there theories than about what steps should be taken to resolve U.F.O. cases. He wants to avoid “endless, unconstrained, undisciplined speculation.” In his view, we're at “a crucial transition point between the older ‘ufology,' ” akin to forensic investigation, and modern scientific methods.

The first step to making something a science usually involves data. NASA's report focusses on the agency's potential role in collecting data, and in using A.I. to analyze it. According to the report, the agency's sensors could be supplemented with crowdsourced data from apps; one example is Enigma, which uses algorithms to rate the credibility of people's sightings and triangulate objects using video recordings. UAPx, a Florida nonprofit, has developed a suite of sensors specifically for analyzing odd aerial phenomena. And then there's the data contained in past reported sightings, which could be regularized and collated somehow. Ryan Graves, a former Navy pilot who testified about U.F.O.s in Congress, founded Americans for Safe Aerospace, which encourages pilots to report U.F.O.s. The group vets the cases and has brought them to Congress; the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which is part of the Department of Defense; and, lately, to an F.B.I. working group. But, as some argue, the plural of anecdote is not data. “I don't trust pilots' sightings,” Matt Mountain, the president of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, told me. “They're on a mission, not doing scientific exploration.” We should keep in mind, Mountain told me, that most criminal convictions that are overturned by DNA evidence were based in part on eyewitness testimony.

Graves said that he was agnostic about aliens. “I'm not jumping to conclusions,” he told me. “But I want to figure it out, damn it.” Still, he seemed skeptical of expert analysis. In November, 2024, AARO announced that it considered the GOFAST video mystery resolved; the object's altitude, it said, gave it an exaggerated appearance of speed. “Through a very careful geospatial intelligence analysis and using trigonometry, we assess with high confidence that the object is not actually close to the water, but is rather closer to 13,000 feet,” the agency's director told CBS. Graves wasn't satisfied with that explanation. “Some of these cases aren't quote-unquote debunked or no longer of interest,” he has said.

When I spoke to people who supported an alien hypothesis, I was often struck that relatively patchy evidence—what Frank had described as fuzzy blobs—had inspired such in-depth theories. I'm as puzzled by the U.F.O. videos as the next guy, but, as far as I can tell, nothing in them requires us to accept the existence of warp drives or time travel. Until someone produces high-definition videos of flying saucers and little green men, the evidence might not be extraordinary enough to demand such extraordinary explanations. And to the extent that U.F.O.s do need explanations it's worth asking whether aliens are the best one. People have seen weird stuff in the sky for thousands of years, and only in the last eighty have flying saucers been a popular interpretation. Before that, we tended to credit the supernatural.

After all my conversations, I thought the odds that aliens or their tech had visited Earth were probably south of five per cent. Most U.F.O.s. are likely balloons, airplanes, weather events, visual illusions, or technical glitches. Even so, there are enough unknowns, and unknown unknowns, that the margin of error seemed enormous. A person who thinks the odds are much higher, I'd argue, shouldn't be met with ridicule.

One more question: Why would aliens even visit us? Coming up with an answer forces us to speculate about alien motives. “I've always said that aliens are going to alien,” Andrews, the sci-fi writer who founded SIGMA, told me. “We have no idea what an alien person or being or intelligence or machine would be motivated by. . . . We don't know what motivates the Kremlin, for God's sake.” Extraterrestrials, he suggested, could be as different from us as we are from centipedes. (That could be an understatement.) Robert Powell, a chemist who serves on the board of the Scientific Coalition for U.A.P. Studies, has argued that some U.F.O.s are intelligently controlled and do not come from Earth. But, in his view, we shouldn't try to study extraterrestrials as if they're lab rats. “We're the rat, and we're trying to figure out what the doctor is doing,” he said.

It's reasonable to think that there would be commonalities among intelligent species. One is the drive for self-preservation, which motivates the Trisolarans in “The Three-Body Problem.” Hampson, the neuroscientist and sci-fi writer, didn't think that was a very good reason to come to Earth. “If they're after resources, there are easier ways to get them,” he said. “Why would you go to an already inhabited world?” Meanwhile, a warlike species would probably just wipe us out. “If the idea is conquest, then I think we would already know,” he said. But he could imagine another reason: curiosity.

Nick Pope, who ran the U.F.O. program at the U.K.'s Ministry of Defense from 1991 to 1994, told me that the ministry had considered three main motives for alien visits: military reconnaissance, scientific study, and tourism. It's not a given that aliens would enjoy travel. Maybe we've never met them because they're homebodies. Still, what kind of intelligent life form wouldn't want to see a sunrise on another world? “This might be the only place in the universe to see an elephant,” Pope said. “How many planets have a Stonehenge or a Machu Picchu or a Great Pyramids?” Aliens might want to survey the galaxy for all life forms—including us. They might even be having the same debate we are. Are we alone in the universe? The truth—whatever it may be—is still out there. ♦

Pilots reported that these craft dropped from 60,000 feet to sea level in seconds, then stopped instantly. Lazar's reactor theory, warping space instead of flying through air, offers a possible explanation.

In 2017 and 2020, the US Department of Defense officially released Navy cockpit videos showing unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). These objects performed manoeuvres beyond known aircraft capabilities.

Back in 1989, Bob Lazar described UFOs at S-4 that could hover, dart instantly, and make sharp-angle turns without inertia. He said this was due to gravity-based propulsion.

The most famous video shows a white, oval-shaped craft accelerating with no visible exhaust or wings. Its movements match Lazar's descriptions of gravity-driven propulsion systems.

Pilots reported that these craft dropped from 60,000 feet to sea level in seconds, then stopped instantly. Lazar's reactor theory, warping space instead of flying through air, offers a possible explanation.

The Pentagon videos show UFOs with no heat signatures or fuel trails. This echoes Lazar's claim that they did not rely on combustion or jet engines, but instead on a compact reactor.

Some physicists suggest the craft's ability to withstand G-forces could mean a form of inertial shielding, exactly what Lazar claimed UFOs achieved by generating a strong gravitational field around them.

Although the Pentagon has not linked the videos to aliens, the behaviour of these UAPs mirrors Lazar's decades-old testimony. For many, this coincidence keeps his claims alive in both UFO circles and scientific discussions.","{'href': 'https://www.wionews.com', 'title': 'WION'}","other"

When I was growing up, I watched a lot of sci-fi movies about aliens that come to Earth. The extraterrestrials in popular culture, however, always looked so familiar that I found them far-fetched. What are the chances that E.T., the Predator, or ALF would develop arms and legs, a humanlike face, and opposable thumbs? Perhaps as a result, I associated alien life more with fantasy than with science, and I never gave much thought to what a visit would really look like. But my attitude started to change in 2020, when I read Liu Cixin's “The Three-Body Problem” and its two sequels. In Liu's books, creatures called Trisolarans send a scouting mission of supercomputers to spy on and subtly disrupt human affairs. Although Trisolarans could do seemingly impossible things, such as program protons, Liu's rigor got me thinking about aliens from a scientific perspective. Suddenly, I could imagine a sophisticated civilization coming into contact with humanity, perhaps in ways that we don't immediately understand.

Then, in 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report on unidentified anomalous phenomena (U.A.P.)—essentially a rebranding of U.F.O.s. Several Navy videos had been made public a few years prior. In the so-called GOFAST video, recorded off the coast of Florida in 2015, a Navy pilot with an infrared camera follows an object zooming above the water and asks, over the radio, “What the fuck is that?” Another clip, deemed GIMBAL—“Look at that thing, dude”—showed a similar shape above some clouds. A third video, known as FLIR, was taken in 2004 from an aircraft in California. Navy pilots in two planes saw what looked like a large Tic Tac hovering over the water; it seemed to zip away at thousands of miles per hour. Military whistle-blowers subsequently claimed that the government knew more than it was admitting, leading to congressional hearings in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Last month, House Representative Eric Burlison, a Republican, introduced the U.A.P. Disclosure Act of 2025, aimed at preserving and eventually releasing U.F.O. reports.

None of the government's disclosures demonstrated that Earth had welcomed interstellar house guests. And yet, after the releases and hearings, it seemed more acceptable to explore the possibility. In 2022, roughly fifteen hundred university faculty members replied to a survey about U.F.O.s; a majority said that recent governmental and journalistic reports had increased the topic's credibility, and three-quarters said that it was of average importance, very important, or essential for academics to conduct more research about it. Tyler Cowen wrote about U.F.O.s for Bloomberg and Ross Douthat wrote about them for the New York Times; they compared notes on Cowen's podcast. On the prediction platform Polymarket, the odds that the U.S. will “confirm that aliens exist in 2025” have ranged between four and fourteen per cent. (The detection of aliens on a faraway planet would count.)

I started to ask myself, How likely is it that we've ever been visited by aliens or their technology? It seemed improbable yet plausible. I wondered how scientists, engineers, and other thinkers would approach the question. What would count as evidence, and what kinds of educated guesses could we make? I decided to call Adam Frank, an astrophysicist at the University of Rochester and the author of “The Little Book of Aliens,” which looks to differentiate between science and fiction.

Frank doesn't put much stock in U.F.O. videos, and he told a story to explain why. In February, 2023, photographs of a Chinese spy balloon over Billings, Montana, prompted speculation about aliens. The Air Force eventually shot it down, but first the pilot of an American U-2 spy plane flew past and took a selfie that showed the balloon out the window. “You can see it in exquisite detail,” Frank told me. “Where are all those pictures? Every U.F.O. picture is a fuzzy blob. Everybody carries a high-resolution camera in their pocket now, and it's always fuzzy blobs.”

There are potential answers to Frank's question, but most of them raise questions of their own. Maybe there's a coverup. But, if so, wouldn't whistle-blowers have turned up something by now? “Color me extremely skeptical that any government could keep a secret like this effectively for a week, let alone decades,” Austin Carson, a political scientist at the University of Chicago who has written extensively about government secrecy, told me. Steven Aftergood, who directed the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, pointed me to a 1970 report produced by a government task force on secrecy: “It is unlikely that classified information will remain secure for periods as long as five years, and it is more reasonable to assume that it will become known to others in periods as short as one year.”

Maybe the aliens are coy and want to stay hidden. If that's the case, though, why are we seeing them at all? Mark Rodeghier, the scientific director of the Center for U.F.O. Studies, which is headquartered in his basement, told me, “They're actually trying to slowly acclimatize us to the idea that aliens, in fact, exist.” Robert Hampson, a neuroscientist at Wake Forest University who has written over a dozen science-fiction novels, speculated that, perhaps, “what we're detecting are the alien equivalent of graduate students who have been given an assignment to go and watch the humans and report back.” Plenty of human graduate students have been tasked with researching other worlds—and they don't always get the best equipment.

The elaborateness of these explanations, in Frank's view, is a reason to be skeptical of them. “If you've got to go through all those contortions to make your story work, you're not doing science anymore,” he said. He noted that, when humans send spacecraft into the solar system, they tend to land safely. Alien craft, in contrast, “would have managed to cross interstellar distances, and these things seem to crash every fifteen minutes. It's like everybody's sending us their 1987 Dodge Omnis.” The 2021 national-intelligence report on U.A.P.s said that it could not explain a hundred and forty-three U.F.O. reports, but that many were probably “airborne clutter,” weather, or terrestrial technology. “Sometimes they're hard to explain because we just don't have the data,” Frank said. In his opinion, high-quality data (high-resolution photography, for example) has never “showed us that anything required an extraterrestrial hypothesis.”

Our galaxy contains at least a hundred billion planets, and biology finds a way in extreme environments on Earth, so it's not unreasonable to suppose that life thrives elsewhere in the Milky Way. But if aliens wanted to visit us they would have a long way to go. The closest star to the sun, Proxima Centauri, is roughly 4.2 light-years away. NASA's Voyager 1 space probe would take more than seventy-five thousand years to get there, if it were headed in the right direction. The closest inhabited solar system could be much, much farther away. Could aliens, or at least their tech, survive that journey?

Avi Loeb, a Harvard astrophysicist, thinks they may have already. In 2014, military satellites observed a half-metre-long meteor in the sky near Papua New Guinea. Several years later, Loeb and a student, Amir Siraj, concluded that the meteor had been travelling too fast to be orbiting the sun, and that, therefore, it was interstellar. Loeb went on to argue, over the objections of many experts, that it may have been alien technology, and that debris he recovered on a Pacific expedition was from the meteor. “Think of it as Amazon delivery service, but from interstellar space,” he told me during the expedition, from a ship that was incidentally called the Silver Star. He and numerous collaborators wrote up their findings in Chemical Geology last year. (Cosmochemists questioned the claim that the debris was interstellar; one told Science, “I'm surprised anyone would take it seriously.”) Loeb currently leads the Galileo Project, which is erecting ground-based sensors to look for anomalous phenomena.

U.F.O.s could contain biological aliens or machines powered by artificial intelligence. Either way, they might travel much faster than Voyager 1—but that would require a lot of energy. Les Johnson, a retired chief technology officer at NASA who has written fiction and nonfiction books about interstellar travel, gave me an example. To accelerate a pineapple to just a tenth the speed of light, he said, would require the energy of seven Hiroshima explosions. You would need the same quantity of energy to decelerate at your destination. “Suddenly, you've got the energy of fourteen Hiroshima bombs on a pineapple,” he said. “So I look at that, and I think it just doesn't pass the giggle test.” At that speed, a speck of space dust would also have the impact of T.N.T. “I'd love to think we're in a ‘Star Trek' universe,” Johnson said. “But I don't know if we are.”

Logically speaking, the chance that aliens are here right now must be slimmer than the chance that they have been here at some point in the past. Garry Nolan, a biotech founder and an immunologist at Stanford, has a hunch that we've been visited by aliens—he had an eerie experience as a child—and speculates that they or their technology may have been on Earth for millions of years. “So the open question might be, Is this even our planet?” he asked me. As outlandish as his theory is, it's tricky to firmly disprove. If they came long ago, and left or died, would we even know? In 2018, Frank and a co-author published a paper in the International Journal of Astrobiology titled “The Silurian Hypothesis.” (In “Doctor Who,” Silurians are advanced reptilian humanoids who predated us on Earth.)

“Would it be possible to detect an industrial civilization in the geological record?” Frank and his colleagues ask. Organisms can turn into fossils that last tens of millions of years, but most organisms don't become fossils; metals and plastics might not stick around at all. And the planet's surface constantly erodes and churns. “Our claim was that, after about a couple million years, anything on the surface is gone,” Frank said. “Even if some aliens came and built a pretty intense civilization, you wouldn't have any evidence of it.” The best evidence one might hope for, he argued, was indirect: for example, an unusual proportion of certain isotopes at particular depths of rock.

AUGUSTA, Maine (WGME) -- For Mainers seeking chills down their spine, Augusta was the place to be on Saturday. 

The Maine Paranormal and Horror Convention kicked off at the Civic Center.

Attendees came together to immerse themselves in another world, one spookier than this one.

People got to show off their spooky styles with costumes, and enjoying the infamous Annabelle doll.

It's a day of chills and camaraderie.

 The Smurl family is at the center of The Conjuring: Last Rites.


 The Smurls led a normal, quiet life in their West Pittston, Pa., duplex for over a decade until strange occurrences began.


 The horror franchise's latest release follows Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) as they take on a demon that terrorizes patriarch Jack Smurl (Elliot Cowan) and his wife Janet Smurl (Rebecca Calder), while also targeting their four daughters: Heather (Kila Lord Cassidy), Dawn (Beau Gadsdon), Shannon (Molly Cartwright) and Carin (Tilly Walker).


 The case became the last that the Warrens would take on together.


 So what happened to the family who inspired The Conjuring: Last Rites? Here's everything to know about the Smurls' experiences and where they are today, three decades after their lives were changed forever.

 Jack and Janet moved into their house in West Pittston, Pa., in October 1973, and told Lorraine in an interview that they began experiencing paranormal activity in the home in 1985.


 Janet told Lorraine the first occurrence was the night of their daughter Heather's confirmation on April 9, 1985. Janet, Shannon and Heather were in the kitchen, and Janet was pinning the collar onto Heather's confirmation robe when a ceiling light, which was affixed to the ceiling with two chains and several eye hooks into a beam, crashed down onto the kitchen table without warning.


 ""It was very frightening because it was unexpected and it wasn't like a light that had broken naturally,"" Janet recalled. ""It didn't tip, it didn't sway — it just came crashing down. It gouged Shannon in the forehead and left a mark on the refrigerator.""


 Subsequently, Janet claimed, the family heard and witnessed other unexplained activity, including doors opening, closing and unlocking by themselves and lights turning on and off. In particular, the accordion-style closet door in Jack and Janet's bedroom opened and shut rapidly on its own. They also stated hearing loud banging and pounding in threes, and items going missing.


 According to the 2020 documentary Devil's Road: The True Story of Ed and Lorraine Warren, Jack and Janet claimed that their bed shook and they saw a black shadow lurking around their bedroom. In another instance, Janet was reportedly yanked out of bed and on a different night, the couple levitated ""as high as the ceiling,"" Ed recalled.


 The Wilkes-Barre Times Leader reported that the family also experienced foul odors and heard pig grunts in the home. The occurrences grew more aggressive over time, with the Smurls' 75-pound German shepherd getting slammed into a wall and Jack getting attacked while praying.


 Jack also claimed to have been sexually assaulted by the spirit, which Ed later deemed a succubus, on several occasions.

 Jack and Janet initially sought help from their local Catholic Church.


 ""We went to our local priest and said, 'Father, there's something very strange going on here,' "" Janet recalled on Larry King Live. ""So he came over, he blessed the home and said, 'There's no one here who can help you.' ""


 They then reached out to the Warrens by phone for assistance. The Warrens attempted to vanquish the succubus with prayer, crosses, holy water and a police officer with them for protection.


 Ed claimed that the demon attacked him and ""threw [him] back 10 feet"" and was too strong for them to defeat on their own. They approached the Catholic Church again for help, but were denied once more. Ed took to the media to appeal to the church and asked for ""two or three priests"" to exorcise the demon.


 ""You can not even imagine what has gone on in this home,"" Lorraine said in a press conference.


 Lorraine determined that there were four spirits haunting the Smurl house: three human spirits and one demon.


 The public pressure succeeded, and the Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger — who would later become Pope Benedict XVI in 2005 — assigned an exorcist to the Smurl case. According to Ed, the exorcist went to the Smurls' home and performed an exorcism on the property, and the home was ""clear"" ever since.

 The Smurl family's house is still standing in West Pittston.


 According to The Citizens' Voice, the Smurls moved to Wilkes-Barre, Pa., in 1988. Richard Bridle purchased the property and initially had difficulty renting it out due to its notoriety, he told UPI.


 ""It's hurting me as far as renting the property. There is a stigma attached to the house,"" Bridle explained, adding that he thought the haunting claims were ""ridiculous.""


 Debra Owens, who moved into the West Pittston property in 1988, told the Times Leader that she never experienced anything unusual in the house, and a man who lived on the other side of the duplex home also said he had no strange occurrences while residing there.

 The patriarch of the family, Jack, led a quiet life after becoming a reluctant media sensation from the hauntings, working for the Topps Chewing Gum company in Duryea, Pa., for over 30 years and remaining active in his local church. He died at age 75 on June 22, 2017, per an obituary.


 His daughter Carin told the Citizens' Voice, ""It was so quick. We didn't expect it because he had been doing so well. He told my mom ... one of his biggest regrets was that he wasn't going to make it to their 50th anniversary.""


 Janet Smurl lives in Laporte, Pa.


 As for the couple's daughters, Heather and Dawn live private lives. Heather is a mom of two adult children, and today, she's a teacher in Wilkes-Barre. Dawn also raised her son Mark Glowinski II in Wilkes-Barre, and he has gone on to play as an offensive linebacker for the Seattle Seahawks, New York Giants and Indianapolis Colts, WVIA News reported.


 Similarly, Shannon has a life outside of the public eye — working in health, per her LinkedIn — but she revealed on X that she's still interested in the paranormal and ghost hunting.


 Carin, also a professional in the social work field, maintained that they did not fabricate the haunting.


 ""That we did it for fame or money is the most ridiculous statement ever. We were a normal family with normal lives that went through a tragedy and prevailed by staying strong and faithful,"" she told Citizens' Voice in 2016. ""It's everyone else that blew it up into a nightmare. We battled the demons inside and the public outside. They made it worse.""


 Carin added, ""We never made money from the book or movie. Who would want to go through all that media and public bashing?""


 She is also a part-time paranormal investigator, an endeavor she pursued because of what she endured as a child.


 ""The reason I have been involved in paranormal investigating is so no one has to go through what we did,"" she said. ""In me they get judge-free, discreet, legitimate, honest, professional help and counseling. No one going through tragedy should be treated like we were.""

September 7, 2025

Europa, one of Jupiter's four large moons, has long been a focal point in the search for extraterrestrial life due to its subsurface ocean hidden beneath a thick icy crust. Until recently, scientists believed Europa's surface interactions with Jupiter's intense radiation created abundant oxygen that could replenish this ocean and support life. 

However, new measurements from NASA's Juno mission suggest the quantity of oxygen produced on Europa is far lower than previously estimated. This revelation shakes up assumptions about the moon's biological potential and invites fresh scientific scrutiny.

Europa's allure as a possible cradle for life arises from several factors:

Europa's unique environment prompted space agencies to prioritize it for detailed exploration, with missions designed to uncover signs of habitability or life.

Contrary to earlier assumptions, direct measurements from the Juno spacecraft report Europa generates about 12 kilograms (26 pounds) of molecular oxygen per second from the dissociation of water ice on its surface. This is significantly less than prior estimates, which suggested up to 1,000 kilograms per second.

The lower oxygen production implies a narrower range of oxygen availability in Europa's subsurface ocean than previously assumed. While the surface continues to erode under radiation, the amount of oxygen making its way to the potential ocean habitat could be limited.

Juno's Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment (JADE) instrument detected charged oxygen and hydrogen ions emanating from Europa's surface. By flying close to Europa, Juno measured molecular species created when radiation from Jupiter's magnetosphere bombards the icy surface, splitting water molecules.

This direct measurement contrasts earlier inferences based on indirect observations and theoretical models, providing an unprecedented glimpse into Europa's atmospheric composition and its interaction with Jupiter's harsh environment.

Europa's surface is bombarded by intense ionizing radiation trapped in Jupiter's magnetic field. This radiation breaks apart water molecules in the ice (radiolysis), releasing oxygen and hydrogen. Over time, the ice shell erodes and replenishes through subsurface processes.

The balance of oxygen production and loss dictates the available oxidants that might sustain life in the ocean below. The reduced oxygen output challenges the extent of this chemical energy source.

Oxygen acts as a crucial electron acceptor in metabolic reactions. Less oxygen suggests:

Despite this, life might still thrive through other chemical processes independent of oxygen levels.

Beneath the kilometre-thick ice lies a salty ocean—one of the largest in the solar system. Scientists propose that water-rock interactions on the ocean floor could generate chemical energy sufficient to support microbial life.

Oxygen transported from the surface is one potential energy source, but the ocean's habitability now appears more complex and uncertain.

The interaction between Jupiter's magnetosphere and Europa's surface creates a plasma environment where ionized particles influence atmospheric and surface chemistry. This dynamic exchange governs molecular oxygen and hydrogen densities and affects potential transport mechanisms to the ocean.

Understanding these processes is vital for assessing the moon's overall chemical landscape.

The revised oxygen measurements influence broader astrobiological strategies:

Europa remains a primary candidate for future life-seeking missions despite these challenges.

NASA's upcoming Europa Clipper mission and ESA's JUICE mission will:

These missions aim to resolve remaining questions about hospitability thresholds and inform life detection efforts.

Detecting life faces multiple hurdles:

Innovative technologies and interdisciplinary approaches will be crucial.

The discovery that Europa produces far less oxygen than previously thought reshapes scientific perceptions of extraterrestrial habitability. It encourages cautious optimism and underscores the need for ongoing exploration. Understanding Europa's true potential will illuminate pathways for finding life beyond Earth.

Oxygen can serve as an energy source for life through metabolic processes similar to those on Earth.

NASA's Juno spacecraft directly measured charged oxygen and hydrogen ions during a close flyby.

It may limit energy sources but does not rule out alternative life forms or habitats.

NASA's Europa Clipper and ESA's JUICE missions are planned for detailed investigations.

Yes, despite lower oxygen levels, its subsurface ocean and geologic activity make it a prime target.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Forget 'Supernatural' — This Underrated Sci-Fi Series Gave Us Action, Mythology, and a Kickass Heroine","https://collider.com/lost-girl-supernatural-explained/","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 13:45:00 GMT","

Supernatural has unquestionably been the go-to resource for mythological content. The show about monster-fighting brothers was accessible and starred The WB's favorites of the time. However, it wasn't the only game in town when it came to content of that kind. A few years after Supernatural premiered, the Canadian series Lost Girl hit the airwaves. A highly underrated series that ran for five seasons, Lost Girl follows the antics of Bo (Anna Silk), a member of the Fae community. 

Though not aware of it in the beginning, Bo is a succubus, a type of Fae who feeds on chi. Since she was adopted, she never knew about her lineage. All she knew was that any time she was in a sexual situation, she ended up killing her partner. One night after killing a date rapist, her activities get noticed by the local Fae government. Bo gets pulled into a world she never realized existed, and on her way to discovering who she is, she also gets some work done.

Lost Girl functions like any good supernatural series with monster-of-the-week episodes and mythology arcs. While trying to figure out her past, Bo also works as an investigator, using her succubus powers to make a living. Lost Girl set itself apart from others of its kind by not putting moral constraints on its female characters. Bo is sexually liberated and established as bisexual in the first episode. 

Her sexuality isn't subjected to the male gaze but instead an exploration of where Bo's heart truly lies. Her best friend Kenzi (Ksenia Solo) similarly refuses to conform to anyone's perception of her. A human con artist and thief, Kenzi also lives on the fringes of society and is the rare human allowed to know about the world of the Fae. Women are not just objects like in some of Supernatural's worst mistakes. They are complex and refuse to play by anyone's rules but their own. These aspects make for an incredibly developed world, and is why Lost Girl works. After a pilot episode full of exposition, fans are free to experience the story as Bo does and find out all the secrets that have been hidden from her for her entire life.

Any good supernatural series like Buffy the Vampire Slayer needs to have an established mythology, but Lost Girl goes the extra mile. The series redefines traditional supernatural myths by adhering to an entirely new set of rules. Bo is part of the world of the Fae, defined by their magical abilities. However, each class is different. Bo is a succubus who stems from the type of Fae who feeds on the life force of others. There are many other types of classes that Bo meets along her travels, including Dyson (Kris Holden-Ried), a werewolf, and Tamsin (Rachel Skarsten), identified as a Valkyrie. Every episode, Bo meets another form of Fae, each derived from different mythologies, such as Norse and Celtic.

Lost Girl truly earns its stripes, however, through the internal conflict in the Fae world. The Fae are divided between “Light” and “Dark.” Bo's presence in the new city demands that she choose a side, but she ultimately chooses to be unaffiliated. This is forbidden by Fae law, but since no one can conclude where she came from, enticing her to one side or the other is all they can do. Bo's independence and refusal to cater to anyone else's whims defined the series, causing it to be a cult classic that tragically flew under the radar. A celebration of empowerment and sex positivity, Lost Girl didn't overstay its welcome, deciding to conclude after five seasons. The show was groundbreaking, and there has been nothing like it since. Fans can stream Lost Girl on The CW app or buy it on digital platforms.

Former PEOPLE reporter Natasha Stoynoff opens up about her decades-long friendship with psychic medium John Edward in an exclusive first-person piece

Ashley Fraser;Erica Schultz

 Former PEOPLE reporter Natasha Stoynoff opens up about her decades-long friendship with psychic medium John Edward in an exclusive first-person piece.


 “I'm connecting with your mother,” the psychic told the woman on the phone, ""and she's telling me to mention the chocolate.”


 It was early 2003, and I was on a three-way conference call for a book I was co-writing —After Life: Answers from the Other Side — with psychic John Edward, whose Syfy show, Crossing Over with John Edward, was the first-of-its-kind back then.


 After spending an intense three months following the famous medium around the tri-state area and across the Australian outback, watching him give readings in packed-to-the-rafters mega-arenas and private one-on-one sessions in hotel rooms, we were doing one last “reading” for the book, then sending the manuscript off to the publisher.


 A “reading,"" for those of you not fluent in psychic-speak, is what you get when a psychic connects with the energy of your departed loved ones on the Other Side and provides you with the specific details they are shown. You heard me, the other side. As in ... an afterlife (hence, the title of our book).


 I was a dogged news reporter, a trained fact-checker, a healthy skeptic, a science-devoted humanist and a confirmed agnostic. My cynical friends — especially the hard-nosed journalists — wanted to know: Did I actually believe in this hocus pocus?


St. Martin's Publishing Group

 I first interviewed John for a 1999 PEOPLE cover story, as the blockbuster film, The Sixth Sense (“I see dead people”) mesmerized audiences. At that time and in the years to follow, I've seen him give some wild, otherwise unexplainable readings.


 He provided unique nicknames, revealed family secrets, knew people's last words before they died. I also did my due diligence as a skeptic and reporter, checking for microphones and plants in audiences and pulling people aside to interview after the events. Everything was kosher.


 So ... did I believe?


 The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!


 A tipping point for this question would come during the phone call that night. Right around the time I first interviewed John, FBI agent Robert “Bob” Hilland, Edward's co-author of the new, crime-memoir, Chasing Evil: Shocking Crimes, Supernatural Forces, and an FBI Agent's Search for Hope and Justice, was grappling with that same question. (I am also a co-writer.)


 “I heard him on the radio and thought he was a fraud,” Bob told me, as we sifted through boxes of dusty files, diaries, photos, hand-scrawled notes and news clippings at his home in 2022 — research to help me co-write the book.


 Hilland was working on a dead-end cold case that stretched back to the 70s involving a man, John Smith, whose two wives went mysteriously missing. After hearing John on the radio, he set up a meeting with him at his Long Island office. “I was going to either bust him ... or get help on the case,” said Bob.


 Spoiler alert: He didn't bust him.


 Instead, John gave Bob details that rocked his world — specifics about the murder case that would help the agent put Smith behind bars, and the clincher: a secret about Bob's family, courtesy of his departed grandfather, who “came through” to John, that Bob verified later with his parents.


 “I arrived at John's office that day a cynic,” Bob said, “and left in a daze with my belief system shaken.” And soon, yes, a believer.


 For the next two decades, the unlikely duo secretly sleuthed together on an array of front-page crimes happening in real time — missing Yale student Annie Le; newlywed George Smith murdered on a cruise ship; missing 5-year-old Noah Thomas, who disappeared in a rural town in Appalachian Virginia.


 Each time, John doled out clues from the other side to steer Bob in the right direction like an otherworldly GPS: a child's toy, a soccer ball emblem, a newspaper headline, a name, a space by the door behind the little fridge.


 I say “unlikely” duo because it's not like you'd expect a ballroom-dancing, pop culture nerd who talks to dead people to team up with a 6'8” former football playing, no-nonsense lawman who thrived in a black-and-white, just-the-facts Dragnet world.


Courtesy of Natasha Stoynoff

 John will be the first to say that, on the surface, they made an odd couple. “Think: Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito in Twins,” he'd say, with a laugh.


 The laugh was because we three knew it was Bob who got to be Arnie in that scenario. And yet, underneath at their core, the sameness of these two men resonated. Both are wicked smart brainiacs on a tireless quest to do good in the world.


 Since he was a teen, John has tried to help people by reminding us we are all connected and that love doesn't die. (After taking my oncologist brother to a John event, he then gave several patients in the final stages of cancer comfort, describing what he saw.)


 Since he was a teen, Bob has been on a relentless pursuit for justice. He reminds me of Gary Cooper's honorable Sheriff in High Noon.


 They are also two alpha-males who get teary when talking about missing little Noah, and how they felt his sweet innocence as Bob searched for him in the dark, after midnight.


 During our Zoom interviews for the book, it was difficult not to get swept away by their determination to find truth, a body, some peace. I got so riled up by one unsolved case, I wanted us three to grab shovels, hop on a plane, and dig for one victim's body in a faraway location not yet tried.


 “Calm down, Natasha,” said John.


 I said, “But it would be a great ending for the book!”


 “Natasha has a point, John,” said Bob.


 “Yeah. Um. Let it go for now, you guys,” said John.


 Our very tight deadline was looming, that was true. No time for digging. Besides, that was one of the big lessons Bob learned during their partnership, says John—to let go when it was time and trust the universe's mysterious ways.


 Their story is not only about crime-solving, they will both tell you, but something deeper and personal — it's about their brotherhood bond, what they learned from each other and how they evolved.


St. Martin's Publishing Group

 Which leads me back to that phone call in 2003. The woman on the other line getting a reading was my friend, Norris Church Mailer — wife of literary lion, Norman Mailer — calling in from Provincetown, Mass.


 The reading was going swimmingly, as John connected with Norris's deceased father and gave her a list of specific details that awed her, until ... we hit a glitch.


 “It's your mom,” John said, “she's showing me the chocolate.”


 But Norris's mother was alive and well, she informed him. Still, John insisted. “She's saying, ‘Mom's here!'” said John. “She's saying, ‘mention the chocolate.'”


 What John didn't know was that my mother had passed a decade earlier. He didn't know that I pitched that first Sixth Sense interview with him to my PEOPLE editors in the hopes he'd connect with her. He also didn't know that a few days before the phone call with Norris, I stood at my mother's grave in Toronto and had a stern talk with her.


 “Mom, this is getting ridiculous,” I said. “I've known John for four years now and I've been working side-by-side with him on this book for the last three months. If it's real, if he can do what he says he can do, then ...”


 I fished out a Coffee Crisp, her favorite Canadian chocolate bar, from my pocket and broke it in two. Popping one half in my mouth, I placed the other on top of her gravestone. Sharing chocolate was one of our beloved mother-daughter rituals.


 “Before this book is done,” I said, spitting chocolate, “come through to John and mention the chocolate.”

 Like FBI Bob, I'm all about the facts.


 Does an afterlife exist in some energetic form, and if so, can we connect with those energies? The only indisputable evidence I've seen so far that makes me think yes is what I've seen John Edward do.

REAL TALK

Date: July 30, 2025

Byline: Investigative Desk

I. TRAUMA ENGINE: FROM TRAGEDY TO TACTICAL BRANDING

Mass casualty events—Manchester Arena (2017), Route 91 Harvest, and Astroworld—weren't just disasters; they were alleged nodes in a calculated trauma-engine psyops system. Live Nation and Clear Channel/iHeartMedia are implicated as the dual hubs of this infrastructure, producing environments where tragedy becomes a scripted rebirth followed by commercial monetization. Media saturation, crisis PR, and celebrity rehabilitation formed a coordinated post-trauma blueprint.

II.  ANOUSKA DE GEORGIOU: THE PSYOPS CATALYST

Anouska de Georgiou—a figure already linked to intelligence networks and the Epstein circle—emerged strategically in these crises. Positioned within Ariana Grande's aftermath narrative and speculation suggests she functioned as the “grief architect”: arranging public emotion through proximity to trauma. Her role bridges psyops and celebrity culture manipulation.

III. LEGAL PUPPETEERS: ALLRED, BRANCA & THE SYNDICATE

A shadowy syndicate of attorneys—including Gloria Allred and John Branca—pulled legal strings from behind the scenes. Armed with crisis lawyers, investigators, and a willingness to deploy 5150 psychiatric interventions, they allegedly turned trauma into leverage—monetizing death, silencing dissent, and commanding estate outcomes.

IV. EXTORTION & ESTATE SEIZURE: THE $213 MILLION DEMAND

Court filings show the syndicate attempted to extract $213 million from the Jackson Estate, exceeding previous settlements. Timing and narrative control—paired with the trauma engine's momentum—give the impression that public empathy was manipulated in service of estate flooding and financial extraction.

V. PSYOPS MEDIA LOOP: CONTROL WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY

From the initial tragedy report to the redemption arc, the media created a closed-loop system. Live Nation staged the event, Clear Channel amplified the approved narrative, and legal teams managed the fallout. Public grief, audiences, and even victims were channeled through corporate machinery—protected from scrutiny, sanitized for consumption. 

Born with a copy of ""Atlas Shrugged"" in hand, Justin showed early signs of his future as a conservative firebrand. Raised in a household where Rush Limbaugh's voice echoed through the halls, Justin was inspired to become a prominent figure in conservative journalism, in which he shares his support of Republican values.

In this episode of The Michael Shermer Show, Michael Shermer interviews Alan Stern, a prominent planetary scientist and astronaut. Stern discusses his recent suborbital flight, the differences between government and private space initiatives, and the scientific implications of UFO sightings. He also shares insights about the evolution and future of space exploration, including details about the rarely talked about upcoming termination of dozens of already paid-for NASA missions.

Alan Stern is a planetary scientist, astronaut, and author. NASA has selected him to be the first researcher NASA funded to fly to space as a crewmember aboard a commercial suborbital space mission. Since 2001 he has led NASA's $900M New Horizons mission that explored the Pluto system and is now exploring the Kuiper Belt—the farthest exploration of worlds in history. In 2007 and 2008, Dr. Stern served as NASA's chief of all space and Earth science programs, directing its $5B/year Science Mission Directorate (SMD), with 93 separate flight missions and a program of over 3,000 research grants. In 2022, he took part in a deep-sea expedition to explore the RMS Titanic in a submersible.

Western sanctions contributed to nearly 29 million excess deaths worldwide over five decades – a toll comparable to that of wars, according to a recent study.

The research, published last month in the Lancet Global Health, has gained attention around the world.

Examining age-specific mortality in 152 countries from 1971 to 2021, using statistics from the Global Sanctions Database, researchers compared mortality rates before and after sanctions, tracking long-term trends to estimate their toll in excess deaths. They focused on three sanctioning authorities: The UN, the US, and the EU (and its predecessor).

“We estimate that unilateral sanctions over this period caused 564,258 deaths per year, similar to the global mortality burden associated with armed conflict,” the authors noted, with a total of 28.8 million deaths across the 51-year span.

We found the strongest effects for unilateral, economic, and US sanctions, whereas we found no statistical evidence of an effect for UN sanctions.

Most excess deaths occurred among the most vulnerable – the very young and the elderly.

“Our findings reveal that unilateral and economic sanctions, particularly those imposed by the USA, lead to substantial increases in mortality, disproportionately affecting children younger than 5 years,” the study said, noting that the age group accounted for 51% of the total death toll.

The report found that the sanctions undermine economic and food security, often causing hunger and health problems among the poorest. Additionally, the dominance of the dollar and euro in global transactions allowed the US and EU to amplify the impact of their sanctions.

At last year's BRICS summit, member nations called for “unlawful unilateral coercive measures” to be eliminated, warning of their disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable. Members have increasingly avoided the dollar “to shield themselves from US arbitrariness,” Moscow has said.

At the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin this week, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a fairer global governance system based on mutual respect and opposition to Western dominance. Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed the proposal as especially relevant when “some countries still do not abandon their desire for dictatorship in international affairs.”

Rand Paul decries ‘thoughtless' comment after vice-president defends strike against alleged drug traffickers

The Republican senator who heads the homeland security committee has criticized JD Vance for “despicable” comments apparently in support of extrajudicial military killings.

“Killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military,” the vice-president said in an X post on Saturday, in defense of Tuesday's US military strike against a Venezuelan boat in the Caribbean Sea, which killed 11 people the administration alleged were drug traffickers.

Vance added: “Democrats: let's send your kids to die in Russia. Republicans: actually let's protect our people from the scum of the earth.”

Donald Trump has vowed additional military action against purported traffickers, who are not military targets, after the boat strike, saying “there's more where that came from”.

The controversial attack inflamed already-high tensions between the US and Venezuela. In August Trump dispatched war ships and marines to the Caribbean, which his supporters say is in aid of efforts to oust Venezuelan's authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. On Friday, reports revealed that Trump was sending 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico to support US military action against drug traffickers.

Some fear the developments presage full military conflict between Venezuelan and US service members. Last month, the US offered a $50m bounty for Maduro, twice what it offered for Osama bin Laden, and in July signed a secret mandate approving military action against Latin American cartels deemed terrorist organizations, such as the Venezuelan group Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns), which Trump officials have claimed Maduro leads.

Trump also framed the boat attack as military activity against “terrorists” in subsequent statements on his social media platform, Truth Social.

“The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in international waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United ​States,” he said. “The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No US Forces were harmed in this strike … Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!”

The Republican senator Rand Paul, who chairs the Senate committee on homeland security and government affairs, condemned Vance's comments.

“JD ‘I don't give a shit' Vance says killing people he accuses of a crime is the ‘highest and best use of the military.' Did he ever read To Kill a Mockingbird?” Paul wrote on X, alluding to Harper Lee's 1960 novel about a wrongly convicted Black man who is killed as he tries to escape prison.

“Did he ever wonder what might happen if the accused were immediately executed without trial or representation? What a despicable and thoughtless sentiment it is to glorify killing someone without a trial.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

            There is something my Pilates teacher says when I'm on the brink of giving up.
    


            My class will be in the middle of an inner thigh circuit, having done what feels like hundreds of micro squat “pulses.” My thighs ache. My calves are burning. A bead of sweat forms at my brow and drips down onto my mat. I'm craving the sweet release of death, or maybe just water.
    


            “Stay in your body!” he'll yell, over the blasting pop music.
    


Stay in my body, stay in my body, stay in my body, I'll chant in my head, testing the physical limits of what I feel capable of after work on a weeknight.
    


            I've been going to this same mat Pilates class at my gym for two years now. I love it, or that's what I tell myself as I count the minutes until it's over. But it was only recently that I learned of reformer Pilates, an earlier method that has come back to take the world — and my friend group — by storm.
    


            This version of Pilates, performed on a reformer machine for additional resistance and support, is blowing up amid renewed interest in the workout. Not only did Pilates become the most booked class on ClassPass two years in a row, we've seen Google searches for reformer Pilates grow since 2022.
    


            Pilates provides improvements in core strength, flexibility and balance, even when done just once a week. It can help with stress relief, as well as anxiety and depression. Among those 60 years of age and older, Pilates has even been shown to slow the process of senescence.
    


            Pilates was also treated as a sort of rich-girl, get-skinny-quick routine; a “yummy mummy” workout, as one expert quipped to me, meant more for the Margot Robbies of the world and less for me.
    


            Even as a regular practitioner of Pilates, I was suspicious of the recent interest in the reformer. Amid rising use of GLP-1s for weight loss among healthy people, reports of skinny being “back” in vogue and the retreat of the body positivity movement, the Pilates fixation struck me not only as another sign of society's changing female body standards, but also emblematic of our current political reality. It feels like a turn toward the past — a call to, quite literally, take up less space.
    


            Those concerns were not discouraging people online and around me from embracing the reformer machine. What was I missing about the allure of the workout? Armed with my best leggings and a newly acquired pair of grippy socks, I decided to find out.
    


            The Daily Pilates studio, a smaller chain based in the South, advertises itself as a place where “Pilates, design and wellness unite.” The location I picked felt less like a gym and more like a spa: The weights were not the metal dumbbells I was used to, but pleasing peach-hued cylinders. Pampas grass in ceramic vases filled the space. A swirly, luminescent light fixture on the wall read: “Keep it peachy.”
    


            My instructor for the hour was a thin woman with blonde hair, slicked into a top bun. Around me, my fellow Pilates-goers were something out of an Instagram athleisure ad: hot pink matching set, bright red matching set, navy set and so on. In my tee and leggings, I felt like a fat, sore thumb.
    


            As we set up on the reformer — a moving faux-leather bench with springs attached to create resistance, appearing less like a piece of workout equipment and more like a torture device —  I observed the woman next to me. I eyed her delicate gold jewelry, her Lululemon, her blonde updo. Later, when she glided into a split during a hamstring stretch, I decided she was my nemesis.
    


            Body dysmorphia and Pilates go hand in hand, at least to me. I was first introduced to Pilates by Blogilates on YouTube, circa 2013. Cassey Ho, the instructor behind the channel, would post videos with titles like “Muffintop Massacre,” “Flat Belly Fat Burner” and “6 Min to a Sexy Little Waist!” Here, the reasons for Pilates felt clear.
    


            As a teenager in a majority white suburb, I felt everything about my body was fair game for scrutiny, from my frizzy, Afro hair to the strip of tummy hanging over my low-rise jeans. I analyzed the size of my thighs — I didn't dare wear shorts until well into college — and examined the fat on my upper arms. Looking back, I was not a chubby kid, and my size was likely average. But the facts didn't matter. From the moment I conceptualized having a visible body, I knew it needed changing.
    


            But Pilates hasn't always been about weight loss. The exercise system was designed in the 1920s by Joseph Pilates, a German physical education instructor. He developed his ideas while training athletes and injured soldiers, and originally created the reformer machine to help those injured in WWI. Inspired by dance, meditation and breathwork, Pilates further developed his exercise regimen, known at the time as Contrology. Later, in the 1940s and 1950s, the exercises became a key part of dancer training, eventually becoming known as simply Pilates.
    


            Today, the regimen is mainly divided into mat Pilates, done on the floor, and reformer Pilates, with the machine. The classes themselves can vary in intensity depending on the studio or instructor; some leave you baptized in sweat, while others lean more into slow, intentional movements.
    


            When Faye Linda Wachs, a sports sociologist at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, has attended Pilates classes with friends, the clearly stated goal has been “lean, toned muscles,” with which the practice has become synonymous, she said. That sort of body type — not stick-thin, per se, but thin and muscular — is most usually found in white, northern European women, Wachs said.
    


            While there can be a wide range of body types in any ethnicity, there's both a racialized and social class component embedded in that “long and lean” body type, Wachs said, the very body type Pilates (incorrectly) purports to create. (In any case, a pack of two classes a week for a single month at The Daily would run you $224, almost quadruple my regular gym membership.)
    


            It's not that every Pilates class is consciously trying to idealize thinness, whiteness or wealth, as the ultimate human goal. But the “long and lean” ideal carries these connotations, even if people aren't actively thinking about them.
    


            “We have a history that carries weight in terms of our understanding of culture and cultural meanings,” Wachs said.
    


            Those cultural implications are readily seen. TikTok is replete with “Pink Pilates Princess” archetypes mirroring the aesthetic of a woman wearing a $150 sports bra and leggings set. Tyra Banks touts the benefits of the exercise for making her thick booty “tight.” In Season 4 of “Sex and the City,” when a character accidentally sees Samantha naked but compliments her body, she chuckles and shrugs: “Pilates.”
    


Ready to get active? Here are the workout clothes our editors swear by



            Pilates has lots of real benefits. Yet somehow, it always comes back to the way it makes you look.
    


            Like clothing, body styles go in and out of vogue. See the stick-thin, heroin chic look of the 1990s, and the more recent Coca-Cola bottle bodies epitomized by Black women and Black women wannabes like the Kardashians. As the cycle turns, here we are again, firmly back chasing tiny waists and jutting hip bones, exhibited in the rise of GPL-1s and increasing requests for a “ballet body” from plastic surgeons — a toned yet natural physique.
    


            Pilates, known less for muscle building and more for muscle sculpting, neatly aligns with today's body trends. That reformer Pilates is seeing a revival now, at this moment, absolutely tracks.
    


            Exercise for women has always complicated health and appearance. In the 19th century, Victorian ideas of femininity dominated in the West, but there was a growing acceptance of physical activity among women, said Louise Mansfield, professor of sport, health and social sciences at Brunel University of London. Still, there were limits: these activities had to be appropriately “feminine” — think tennis, where one could still wear a long skirt, or biking. And thinness was still prized: just imagine the tightly wound corsets popular at the time, a precursor to Spanx or the insidious rib removal surgeries of today.
    


            “The status of small and thinness has always been there,” Mansfield said. “And women seek to get there in different ways.”
    


            In the US, Pilates has shape-shifted through the years, its premises absorbed by the larger fitness culture. In the 1980s, “Jane Fonda's Workout” videos borrowed heavily from Pilates, encouraging a new generation of women to “feel the burn,” all in a plainly stated effort to improve the way they look. (Fonda has also since revealed a decades-long battle with bulimia.) More recently, we have instructors like Tracy Anderson, whose eponymous method is not specifically inspired by Pilates, although it looks similar and purports to do the same thing.
    


            Almost every trendy workout, on some level, is about reaching an idealized, society-approved body — see the numerous fat-burning spin classes or CrossFit's “functional aesthetic.” But the conversation around Pilates takes that pursuit beyond the physical and into the political. The classes themselves, with their elegant movements and light weights, are descendants of those acceptable feminine exercises of yore — think of the long tennis skirt swapped for leggings and a cute sports bra. Pilates is perfect for this politically conservative moment, with a president and administration fixated on returning the US to a glamorized prior era, when we kept our women thin, feminine and acceptable.
    


            Club Pilates is the Starbucks of Pilates studios: widely available and relatively affordable.
    


            Nestled in a strip mall by a nail salon and a Whole Foods, this specific Club Pilates studio eschewed the spa vibes in favor of a traditional fitness room. Multiple mirrors lined the walls alongside the reformers, with each machine accompanied by a mat and a Bosu ball, while a weight rack sat in a corner, no dumbbell heavier than 10 pounds.
    


            Regulars streamed in, greeting each other by name and with enthusiastic hellos. I was instructed to put away my phone, for “mindfulness.” April West, a 53-year-old woman in an “Eat, Sleep, Pilates” tank top asked me whether this was my first time — was it that obvious? — and gave me a lay of the land. Reformer Pilates is much easier than mat, she said. The machine “is your friend! It's there to help you!” she said; I was less certain.
    


            Halfway through class — lying supine on the reformer, legs in the air and feet hooked in leather pulleys for a circuit of leg lifts — I decided I was right. Still unused to the reformer machine, my body felt the movements as not necessarily difficult but definitely awkward. Each up and down motion of my legs was punctuated with a noticeable BANG as my bench slid forward, while longtimers controlled their movements toward a gentle landing. And unlike in the mat classes I was used to, I couldn't just glance around to check what other people were doing when I got confused. The reformer got in the way. That meant that more than once, the instructor had to help me specifically. I was mortified.
    


            Maybe because of its suburban location, or maybe just the cheaper price tag, the clientele at Club Pilates surprised me. At this particular weekday 9 a.m. class, the group skewed older. There was a man. There were no bright matching workout sets.
    


            Later, I was surprised when West said she wasn't familiar with the stereotypes around Pilates at all. A children's book author, West was first introduced to Pilates after reading about it in Arthritis Today, a magazine by the Arthritis Foundation. She thought the class would be mainly stretching — she didn't realize Pilates was an actual workout. If she had known, she probably wouldn't have gone, she said — “I am not a fan of exercising AT ALL.”
    


            Seven years after that first day, West still attends classes. She enjoys the community, she said, and the practice is more about feeling like she's connecting with her body and staying strong as she ages.
    


            I asked West if she ever feels uncomfortable when people bring up weight loss or appearance when working out — a feeling I've noticed in myself. But despite my questioning — and my probe for some acknowledgement of Pilates' inherent issues — West laughed me off.
    


            “I'm probably twice your age,” she said. “So if someone said that about me losing weight, I'd have been like ‘Oh, yes!'”
    


            Others I spoke to felt similarly. Rae Townsen, a 31-year-old film props assistant, first started doing Pilates at the height of Covid-19 through YouTube videos. As restrictions lifted, she began going to classes in person. Townsen has nerve damage from an autoimmune disorder, and she appreciated that the workouts accommodated physical differences, never making her feel self-conscious for adjusting certain moves to her body. As a whole, the classes feel “less like a chore and a little more fun.”
    


            “In most of the classes that I've taken, there hasn't really been any emphasis on burning calories or anything to that effect,” she said. “I've just been really fortunate to be in classes that have all kinds of different people and different body types in them.”
    


            Is it possible to divorce exercise from the connotations we've heaped upon it? Was this a both/and scenario, where contradictory ideas could stand side by side?
    


            Whenever someone asked how I stayed so dedicated to the gym, I'd make direct eye contact and crack a half-hearted joke: “Internalized fatphobia.”
    


            No one ever laughed. But it's the truth. I enjoy the benefits: the flexibility, the routine, the ability to open tight jars without help. I sometimes even find it alarmingly fun. But I would be lying if I said it was just for those reasons, and not also for the way exercise makes me look.
    


            It is not every day I spill my guts to a professor, but I poured all this out to Mansfield.
    


            It's true that two groups seem to be gravitating toward the exercise, she said: older people looking to retain their strength, and younger women seeking that long and lean look.
    


            That tension between the two, even within oneself, is natural. We all have a relationship with our bodies, Mansfield said. That includes, along with how it feels and how healthy it is, how it looks.
    


            “You try not to do it, but you do,” she said. “Even the innocuous things you think about some of the people you know, and some of the friends that you know, and the narrative that comes with them. ‘Oh, I'm going to see Jo, we're doing this,' and someone goes ‘Oh, Jo, who does all the Pilates, she just got her teaching qualification, and oh, my God, she looks amazing.'”
    


            Even as the language around Pilates shifts, our fixation on thinness and all it represents is still ingrained. Success is still based on appearance — wanting to look a certain way or stay a certain shape. We connect our value as humans to our penchant for exercise and maintaining a bodily ideal. No one celebrates lowering their resting heart rate, but they might smile when their jeans fit a little looser.
    


            “People talk a lot about body positivity, but the imagery we see in our larger culture still very heavily tells us what the physical ideal is,” Wachs said. “It's very clear to all of us.”
    


            Back in my regular Pilates class, away from the stickiness of the reformer, I hear my instructor once again say his catchphrase: “Stay in your body.” That's all we can do, for better or for worse.

            A preliminary investigation indicates that a connecting cable broke before Wednesday's deadly funicular crash in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon that killed at least 16 people and injured several others.
    


            A probe conducted by the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Accidents in Civil Aviation and Rail (GPIAAF) found that a steel cable connecting the historic Glória funicular's two carriages had “given way” shortly after they began their respective journeys along Calçada da Glória, the narrow street where the funicular operated.
    


            A scheduled inspection had been conducted on the morning of the incident, which detected “no anomalies in the vehicles' cable or braking systems,” the report, published Saturday, said. It added that it was “not possible” to see the condition of the section where the cable broke.
    


            This resulted in the carriage at the top of the street increasing in speed down the slope and later derailing, GPIAAF's report found. “The first collision occurred at a speed of around 60 km/h (around 37 miles per hour), with all these events having occurred in a timeframe of less than 50 seconds,” the report said, based on initial estimates.
    


            No firm conclusions can yet be drawn regarding the exact causes of the incident as further investigation is needed, GPIAAF said.
    


            Funiculars use a counterweight pulley system so that when one car of a funicular descends, the other car can ascend. The two Glória carriages had traveled no further than about six meters when they “suddenly lost the balancing force provided by the cable connecting them,” the probe found.
    


            The report said that it was “immediately clear” that the cable connecting the two carriages had “given way at its attachment point” inside the upper car – the one that began its journey at the top of Calçada da Glória. A photo in the report shows a large, frayed cable on the ground.
    


            When the cable broke, the report says that the upper cabin's brakeman “immediately applied the pneumatic brake and the hand brake to try to halt the movement,” but these actions had “no effect in stopping or reducing the cabin's speed, and it continued accelerating down the slope.”
    


            In their current configuration, the carriage's air brake and manual brake “do not have sufficient capacity to stop the cabins in motion without their empty masses being mutually balanced by the connecting cable,” the report added.
    


            The rest of the cable and the pulleys through which it runs were “without apparent significant anomalies,” the report said.
    


            In addition, the cable itself, which had been installed 337 days prior to the incident, was said to have a “defined useful life of 600 days.”
    


            Among those killed in the incident were five Portuguese citizens, three Britons, two Canadians, two South Koreans, and individuals from Switzerland, Ukraine, the US and France were confirmed to have died, Portugal's Judicial Police said in a statement Friday.
    


            A full preliminary report into the incident is expected to be published within 45 days, GPIAAF said, followed by a final report within a year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Macron's government is collapsing. Here's why Ukraine should worry","https://www.rt.com/news/624239-macron-government-collapsing-bayrou/","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 15:05:00 GMT","

France's government is once again on the verge of collapse. Prime Minister Francois Bayrou faces near-certain defeat in a confidence vote over a disputed austerity plan, a showdown that threatens President Emmanuel Macron's authority at home and casts doubt on Paris' ability to deliver on its ambitious promises abroad – including security guarantees for Ukraine.

Bayrou has staked his survival on a confidence vote scheduled for Monday, September 8. At issue is an austerity package worth €44 billion, meant to shrink France's deficit from 5.4% of GDP in 2025 toward 4.6% in 2026. Under EU fiscal rules, the official ceiling is 3%, so Brussels is pressuring Paris to cut deeper. But the plan – which includes reducing public holidays and raising healthcare contributions – has triggered anger at home. Trade unions are preparing strikes, while opposition parties from the far left to the far right have pledged to vote against Bayrou. With his government already in a minority, few in Paris believe he can survive.

Francois Bayrou is one of the most familiar names in French politics. He leads the centrist Democratic Movement (MoDem) and has been mayor of the city of Pau since 2014. Back in 2017, his endorsement was crucial for Macron, giving the then-upstart candidate credibility in the political center. As president, Macron briefly made him justice minister, and after Michel Barnier was forced out in late 2024, Bayrou was elevated to prime minister to hold together Macron's fragile coalition. But with his budget collapsing and support evaporating, the man once hailed as a stabilizer is now being blamed for dragging Macron further into crisis.

In France, governments can invoke Article 49.3 of the Constitution to force a bill through the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, without a vote. The mechanism has existed since 1958 and is legal, but risky: once Article 49.3 is triggered, opposition lawmakers have 24 hours to file a no-confidence motion. If that motion passes, the government falls. Bayrou's decision to use 49.3 turned his €44 billion austerity plan into a survival gamble.

  

Bayrou chose confrontation over compromise. By tying his austerity program directly to a confidence vote, he hoped to project resolve. The package included unpopular measures such as cutting public holidays and raising healthcare charges. Instead of rallying deputies behind him, the move united nearly every opposition faction. The far-right National Rally, the Socialists, and the leftist France Unbowed all declared they would vote him out, filing no-confidence motions that set up a showdown on Monday. What was meant to be a show of strength turned into political suicide.

If Bayrou falls, Macron is left exposed: he's going to have to pick between two bad options. He can install a Socialist prime minister to get a budget through parliament, effectively conceding control of domestic policy. Or he can gamble on snap elections, which polls suggest would hand more seats to Le Pen's National Rally. With Macron's approval ratings already scraping historic lows, either choice would deepen the sense of a weakened presidency. Commentators warn that if markets lose confidence in France's ability to control its 5.4% of GDP deficit and 110% debt-to-GDP ratio, the country could face a crisis reminiscent of Britain's “mini-budget” turmoil under Liz Truss.



On foreign policy, Bayrou has been a vocal supporter of Kiev. In March 2025, he openly criticized Washington for pushing Ukraine to negotiate peace with Moscow, calling such demands “unbearable.” He argued that pushing concessions would humiliate Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky and amount to rewarding Russia. Inside Macron's government, Bayrou has been one of the strongest advocates of sustained European backing for Ukraine, insisting that Paris must stand firm.

For Kiev, French instability brings real costs. 

The fallout would reach Brussels as well. The EU relies on France, the bloc's second-largest economy, to underwrite collective aid to Kiev, yet the €3 billion pledge Paris made for 2024 is in doubt. That damages the bloc's credibility as a reliable funder at a time when Germany is reluctant to shoulder the costs alone. Macron has also styled himself as the champion of “strategic autonomy,” calling together with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz for a stronger European defense role. But as the Financial Times has noted, those ambitions collide with weak finances and political divisions. With France paralyzed, the EU's claim to speak with one voice looks hollow, and existing rifts – from Hungary's open skepticism to Slovakia's resistance on energy and sanctions – are harder to conceal.



Bayrou's downfall would leave Macron weaker at home and less credible abroad. France's ability to anchor the EU's Ukraine policy looks shaky, Kiev's guarantees are cast into doubt, and Moscow can argue convincingly that Europe's talk of peace is inseparable from its rush to militarize.

Seyyed Abbas Araghchi says European nations should engage constructively and not facilitate ‘America's excesses'

A message from Tehran to Britain, France and Germany

Iran is ready to form a real and lasting agreement that includes strict monitoring and limits on its domestic uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, its foreign minister, Seyyed Abbas Araghchi, has said.

But, writing for the Guardian, he urges the European nations to change course and abandon their plan to snapback a wide array of UN sanctions at the end of the month.

He warns: “If this short opportunity to change course is missed, it will have consequences that could be unprecedentedly destructive for the region and beyond.”

Iran is still hoping Europeans can be persuaded to defer snapping back sanctions at the UN security council, arguing that Europe will not benefit from such a move since it will only leave the US in the driving seat on negotiating any new nuclear deal, and Europe isolated. However, conflicting signals are emerging from within Iran.

Araghchi said he had made progress in recent talks with the UN weapons inspectors on their terms for their return to Iran's bombed nuclear sites, one of the preconditions set by Europe before it would defer the snapback.

But the conservative-dominated Iranian parliament is still discussing a bill that would require Iran to leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if UN sanctions were restored, a move that would free Iran from all requirements to allow UN weapons inspectors into Iran and so shut off all independent access to its nuclear sites.

Araghchi's Guardian article is a reproach to the traditional European powers on Iran – France, Germany and the UK – challenging them to explain why it is in their self-interest to have shifted away from being mediators for an multilateral agreement between Iran and the US, and instead “become a facilitator of America's excesses”. Araghchi met with the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, in Doha last Thursday.

He claims European leaders have made a huge mistake if they think that by being tough with Iran, the US president, Donald Trump, will stop viewing them as secondary actors and give them a place on the world stage.

The return of UN sanctions “will only exclude the three countries from future diplomatic processes, with widespread negative consequences for the whole of Europe in terms of its credibility and global standing,” he wrote.

“President Trump has made it clear that he views the three European countries as secondary players, and this is evident in the exclusion of Europe from issues that are vital to its future, including the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Washington's message is clear: to gain a foothold, the three countries must demonstrate unwavering loyalty.”

He also claims that if Israel tries to relaunch the 12-day war on Iran it fought in June, it will have to run back to the US for help, a reference to Israel's dependence on US military hardware.

“Israel may present itself as capable of fighting on behalf of the west, but as we saw in June, the truth is that Iran's powerful armed forces are once again ready and capable of defeating Israel to the point where it will be forced to turn to ‘Grandpa' for salvation.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

18:43 JST, September 7, 2025

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Sunday announced his intention to resign as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to take responsibility for the party's crushing defeat in the recent House of Councillors election.

Ishiba made the announcement at a press conference held Sunday evening, saying that “the responsibility for the election results lies with me as the party leader.” He also said he had instructed LDP Secretary General Hiroshi Moriyama to proceed with an election to choose a new LDP president.

The prime minister cited significant progress in Japan-U.S. negotiations over U.S. tariffs as the reason for announcing his resignation at this point. Ishiba recently dispatched economic revitalization minister Ryosei Akazawa to Washington, where both countries signed a memorandum of understanding and a relevant executive order was issued by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Ishiba had previously said that he would make a decision on whether to resign at an appropriate time, “after doing what needs to be done.”

“Now that negotiations concerning U.S. tariff measures have attained certain results, I believe this is the appropriate time to step aside and make way for my successor,” Ishiba said.

Regarding the growing movement within the party calling for an extraordinary presidential election, Ishiba said: “I believed it could create a decisive split within the party. This is absolutely not my intention.”

On the issue of dissolving the House of Representatives, which had been discussed within the party, Ishiba said, “I do not deny that various ideas were floated.” He explained that he “reached the decision [to step down] because the government must never allow its functions to become stagnant for the people.”

Following the ruling parties' defeat in the House of Councillors election in July, four key LDP executives, including Moriyama, expressed their intention to resign from their posts to take responsibility.

There had been growing calls among LDP lawmakers to hold a party presidential election before Ishiba's term of office expired.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC News on Sept. 7 that the U.S. is prepared to work with European allies on new sanctions targeting countries that buy Russian oil, aiming to weaken Moscow's economy and step up pressure on Russia to reach a ceasefire.

“We are prepared to increase pressure on Russia, but we need our European partners to follow us,” Bessent said. 

“We are in a race now between how long can the Ukrainian military hold up, versus how long can the Russian economy hold up.”

Bessent argued that expanded tariffs could increase pressure and force Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin ceasefire negotiations sooner.

Bessent's remarks follow the Trump administration's recent move to impose 50% tariffs on India over its continued oil purchases from Russia.

The comments came hours after Russia carried out a record attack on Ukraine, killing at least four people and setting fire to a government building in Kyiv.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC News on Sept. 7 that the U.S. is prepared to work with European allies on new sanctions targeting countries that buy Russian oil, aiming to weaken Moscow's economy and step up pressure on Russia to reach a ceasefire.

In addition to missile production, Russia plans to manufacture a range of modern military hardware by the end of 2025, including 57 combat aircraft.

Russia launched a large-scale overnight attack on Ukraine on Sept. 7, killing at least four people and injuring more than 40, prompting swift condemnation from Kyiv's European partners.

In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur looks at the two summits that took place in China and France, delivering two starkly different messages about the future of Russia's war — and the world.

Ukrainian forces lost 5 square kilometers but regained control of 26 square kilometers in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast in August, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said.

Ukraine's Air Force said Russia launched 810 Shahed-type drones and 13 cruise and ballistic missiles during the attack.

Ukrainian forces struck the Ilsky oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar Krai and the ""8-N"" oil pipeline control station near the village of Naitopovichi in Bryansk Oblast, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed on Sept. 7.

At least eight Ukrainian regions, as well as the city of Kyiv, came under attack over the past 24 hours. Russian forces launched missiles, drones, and glide bombs across Ukraine. 

The number includes 970 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

""During this war, Ukraine has already reached the level where nearly 60% of the weapons we have, weapons in the hands of our warriors, are Ukrainian-made, and they are strong weapons, many of them cutting-edge,"" Zelensky said in his evening address.

Putin seemingly contradicted Fico on Sept. 3, a day after his meeting with the Slovak leader, again inviting Zelensky to Moscow for a meeting. Days later on Sept. 5, Putin said that he ""doesn't see much point"" in a meeting with the Ukrainian president.

Russian forces struck Zaporizhzhia with drones on Sept. 6, injuring 15 people and destroying a kindergarten, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said.

The Kyiv Independent's law enforcement source identified the suspect as Fedir Khrystenko, a 41-year-old lawmaker and a former member of the now-banned pro-Russian party, Opposition Platform — For Life.

Reuters on Sept. 5 withdrew a video in which Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping were shown discussing whether humans could live to 150 years old, after China's state broadcaster revoked permission to use the footage.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Russia carries out massive strikes, attacking Ukraine with 805 drones and 13 missiles. The attacks set fire to Ukraine's cabinet of ministers building. DW has the latest.

Here's the latest news on Russia's war in Ukraine on Sunday, September 7:

The US' special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said Russia's drone and rocket attack on Ukraine, the largest of its kind since Moscow's large-scale invasion of its neighbor, indicates a lack of interest in diplomacy on Moscow's part.

""Russia appears to be escalating with the largest attack of the war hitting offices of the [Ukrainian] Cabinet in Kyiv,"" Kellogg posted on his X account, adding the attack ""was not a signal that Russia wants to diplomatically end the war.""

US President Donald Trump says he was  prepared to apply new sanctions on Russia, without giving any further details on whether the sanctions are going to include Moscow's trade partners.

Asked about whether he was intending on imposing more sanctions against Moscow, he replied: ""Yes, I am.""

This comes after Russia's largest-ever rocket and drone attack on Ukraine since its large-scale invasion of its neighbor in 2022.

The US is prepared to apply more pressure on Russia, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, while also callling for European allies to follow suit.

Bessent said US Vice President JD Vance had had a ""very productive call"" with European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen following Russia's large-scale rocket and drone attack on Ukraine.

""We are talking about what can the two — the EU and the US — do together,"" Bessent told US outlet NBC.

""And we are prepared to increase pressure on Russia, but we need our European partners to follow us.""

US President Donald Trump has voiced intent to sanction countries that buy Russia's oil in order to tackle one of Russia's main sources of income, with India being the only country to suffer from so-called secondary tariffs so far.

The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, condemned Russia's aerial bombardment of Ukraine and gave Ukraine her full backing.

""Once again, the Kremlin is mocking diplomacy, trampling international law and killing indiscriminately,"" von der Leyen posted on X.

""Europe stands, and will continue to stand, fully behind Ukraine. We are reinforcing Ukraine's armed forces, building lasting security guarantees, and tightening sanctions to increase pressure on Russia,"" the EU chief said, adding: ""The killing must end.""

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had spoken to French President Emmanuel Macron following Russia's aerial strikes on Ukraine.

""We coordinated our diplomatic efforts, next steps, and contacts with partners to ensure an appropriate response,"" Zelenskyy said in a post on the platform X.

""Together with France, we are preparing new measures to strengthen our defenses,"" Zelenskyy added.

In a separate post, Macron expressed his support for Ukraine, saying: ""Together with Ukraine and our partners, we stand for peace.""

""Russia, meanwhile, is locking itself ever deeper into the logic of war and terror,"" Macron said adding that everything would be done to ensure ""a just and lasting peace prevails."" 

Macron hosted ""coalition of the willing"" talks ahead of the weekend, after which 26 countries pledged to contribute towards Ukraine's post-war security.

The commander of Ukraine's drone forces reported a strike on the Druzhba oil pipeline in Russia's Bryansk region.

Robert Brovdi said on the Telegram messaging app, the strike had caused ""comprehensive fire damage.""

Brovdi's post was accompanied with infrared footage filmed at a distance, showing explosions and then billowing smoke.

There has been no immediate comment from Russian authorities and the veracity of the report cannot be independently verified.

Ukraine has in recent months targeted Russian energy infrastructure amid Russia's continued full-scale invasion.

Strikes on the oil pipeline — which delivers Russian oil to Hungary and Slovenia —— have caused disruptions in recent weeks.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that emergency services were still working in the areas hit by overnight Russian airstrikes.

Zelenskyy said that two deaths had been confirmed and that residential buildings had been destroyed in the capital.

Elsewhere, the president said that a person had been killed in Safonivka in the Sumy region, and another death was reported in Chernihiv.

""Such killings now, when real diplomacy could have already begun long ago, are a deliberate crime and a prolongation of the war,"" Zelenskyy said on social media platform X.

""It has been repeatedly said in Washington that sanctions will follow a refusal to talk,"" Zelenskyy added. 

Ukrainian officials said Russia carried out the largest drone strike overnight into Sunday since the full-scale invasion.

Russian forces fired 805 drones and decoys, as well as 13 missiles of various types during the attack, Ukrainian Air Force officials said.

At least two people died in Kyiv. Also in Kyiv, a government building that houses the offices of Ukraine's Cabinet ministers saw damage.

""For the first time, the government building was damaged by an enemy attack, including the roof and upper floors,"" Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said. ""We will restore the buildings, but lost lives cannot be returned,"" she added. 

Ahead of the weekend, France hosted ""coalition of the willing"" hybrid talks involving European, NATO and non-NATO allies — with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attending in person.

French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 countries pledged to contribute towards Ukraine's post-war security; however, Russia is in firm opposition to any foreign troop presence.

Germany pledged to contribute to security guarantees but stopped short of promising further military commitments.

US President Donald Trump was part of a joint call with European leaders on Thursday and called on Europe to stop buying Russian oil, saying that it was funding Moscow's war.

The European Commission has proposed legislation to phase out EU imports of Russian oil and gas entirely by 2028.

Trump also said he was planning on speaking to Putin again soon.

Officials in Ukraine said Russia's overnight bombardment was the largest since the war began.

Ukraine's air force said that 805 drones and 13 missiles were fired, but air defenses managed to shoot down 747 drones and 4 missiles.

The air force said that there had been nine confirmed missile hits and 56 drone strikes in locations across Ukraine.

The building that was damaged in Kyiv, is home to Ukraine's Cabinet and is where various ministers have their offices.

""For the first time, the government building was damaged by an enemy attack, including the roof and upper floors,"" said Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko.

""We will restore the buildings, but lost lives cannot be returned,"" Svyrydenko said.

The attacks come amid efforts to bring Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia's Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war.

Zelenskyy has said he is ready to meet Putin, who invited the Ukrainian leader to Moscow for talks. Zelenskyy rejected the invite and said Putin could come to Kyiv.

 

 

An administrative government building in the Pechersky district of Kyiv caught fire after Russia's air attacks on Kyiv this morning, said Timur Tkachenko, the head of the military administration of the Ukrainian capital.

Kyiv mayor Vitaliy Klitschko also reported the fire on Telegram, adding that firefighters were working on the scene.

Ukraine's overnight drones launched at Russia sparked a fire at the Iisky oil refinery in the southern city of Krasnodar, local Russian officials said on Sunday.

""One of the processing units caught fire. The blaze, covering several square meters, was quickly extinguished,"" the officials wrote on the Telegram messaging app. 

They reported no casualties and added that fire and resue teams were working on site.

A series of Russian strikes across Ukraine overnight left at least two people dead and several others injured, Ukrainian officials reported.

In Kyiv, falling debris from downed drones started fires on top of a 16-story residential building and two nine-story buildings, according to Mayor Vitali Klitschko.

Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv's city military administration, said that among the dead was a one-year-old child whose body was uncovered from the rubble by rescuers.

According to Reuters, witnesses heard a series of explosions shaking the Ukrainian capital city, which they believe were air defense units conducting operations.

Explosions were also reported in the cities of Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, and Kryvyi Rih.

Poland, which is Ukraine's neighbor to the west, scrambled its fighter jets during Russia's air raid to protect its own air space.

Russia currently occupies about 20% of Ukraine's territory. Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire and achieve lasting peace have stalled.

A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.



            The pendulum of power is swinging more and more frequently in the United States.
    


            In the 100 years between 1900 and 2000, control of the House, Senate or White House changed hands in Washington with relative infrequency and never in more than two elections in a row.
    


            In the 25 years since 2000, the party controlling the White House and/or at least one chamber of Congress changed in all but two US elections.
    


            It is an unprecedented period of political turnover in which voters have pulled the lever for some kind of change – either picking a president from a new party or flipping the majority in the House or Senate – nearly every time they're given the chance in recent years.
    


            At least one lever of power has flipped between Republicans and Democrats in Washington in each of the last six elections, the most consecutive power changes going back to before the Civil War.
    


            In five of the last seven presidential elections, voters opted for a president from the other party. In the same time period, voters elected a new Senate majority five times and picked a new House majority four times.
    


            The only elections this century in which the House, Senate and White House all remained under control of the same party were the only two successful presidential reelection campaigns, for George W. Bush in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2012. Those are also the only times the same party held on to the White House this century.
    


            Today's politicians have come to expect frequent shifts in power.
    


            The last four presidents have all assumed office with unified control of Washington and worked as quickly as possible to exploit it. Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Trump again in his second term all utilized reconciliation to get around the roadblock of the filibuster in the Senate and pass some sort of sweeping agenda item without help from the other party.
    


            For Obama, it was the Affordable Care Act. For Trump, it was tax cuts in his first term; in his second, it was a sweeping tax cut and agenda bill that pared back social safety net spending. For Biden, it was the Inflation Reduction Act, which had a lot more to do with clean energy and climate change than it did with reducing inflation.
    


            We'll see if Trump breaks this mold — something he is desperately trying to do by redrawing congressional maps in search of more Republican seats. But each of those other three administrations immediately lost the House.
    


            President George W. Bush defied political gravity and picked up House seats after his first two years in office, but that had a lot to do with his popularity after the 9/11 terror attacks.
    


            Bush lost the House four years later, after his reelection, when the public had turned on the wars.
    


            Bill Clinton lost the House in his first midterm, the 1994 Republican revolution. It was the first time Republicans had gained control of the House since the 1950s. They've lost and regained the House twice in the years since.
    


            Clinton picked up seats in the 1998 midterm, when the country turned against Republican efforts to impeach him.
    


            Sarah Binder, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said these elections change the balance of power, but a better way to view them is as “nationalized elections.”
    


            Voters are less frequently splitting their tickets between a senator or representative from one party and a president from the other as they tend more often to stick with one national party.
    


            “We've had nationalized elections, but we didn't have them back to back to back all the time,” Binder said.
    


            The closes corollary to today is probably the late 19th century, Binder said.
    


            “It was similarly a period of high partisanship and ideological disagreement,” she explained, but today there is the added element of much slimmer majorities — even in presidential elections. Trump, Bush and Clinton all won the White House without winning a majority of the popular vote in their first term.
    


            Not all power changes are equal, but they all affect how things work in the US government.
    


            If Democrats can wrest control of the House from Republicans next year – which is more likely than the chance they could flip the Senate – it will allow them to stand in the way of Trump's legislative agenda, investigate his administration and gain more power in spending debates.
    


            The general indicator for how a president's party will do in a midterm election is the president's own approval rating. Trump's, as it has been, is underwater.
    


            Only twice in the past 20 midterm elections going back to 1938 – for W. Bush in 2002 and Clinton in 1998 – has the president's party not lost seats in a midterm. In both cases, the president had approval ratings over 60%. Today, Trump's is under 50%.
    


            This year, Republicans are trying to change the map to draw more Republican seats. They've already changed the map in Texas to create five new seats to win, although it's a strategy that might not pay off if groups like Hispanic voters don't vote with the party in the same way they did in 2024.
    


            Republicans are also looking to redraw maps in Missouri and Ohio. Democrats are stymied by laws and state constitutional obstructions to such shenanigans in many states they control, but they are trying to find seats in California.
    


            Democrats of the 1970s and 1980s routinely had 80-plus-seat majorities. In the most recent elections, House majorities were determined by a handful of the 435 voting members.
    


            So while the power changes are happening more frequently, they're not accompanied by large swings in the size of majorities. Trump's Republicans lost 40 seats after the 2018 midterm and ceded control of the House. Biden's Democrats lost just 9 seats after the 2022 midterm, but they also ceded control of the House.
    


            The margins in the House are tight enough that in a close midterm, Republicans' redistricting efforts could pay off and allow them to maintain control of the House. But if there's a riptide against President Donald Trump and his policies, no amount of gerrymandering is likely to save Republicans' House majority.

• Sanctions on Russia: President Donald Trump signaled today that his administration is ready to move to the second phase of sanctions against Russia. This comes as the president has grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress toward peace in Ukraine.
    


            • US Open final: Trump arrived in New York for the US Open men's final match where he was booed by the crowd.
    


            • RFK Jr. defends leadership: Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  dismissed his intense grilling by senators on Thursday as “theater,” and said he did not think federal government health agencies have had any great successes.
    


            President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social today that he is issuing his “last warning” to Hamas to accept a hostage and ceasefire deal.
    


                    “Everyone wants the Hostages HOME. Everyone wants this War to end! The Israelis have accepted my Terms. It is time for Hamas to accept as well. I have warned Hamas about the consequences of not accepting. This is my last warning, there will not be another one,” the president wrote.
                





            Trump's comments on social media come just days after he told reporters that the White House is “in very deep negotiations with Hamas” to secure the release of the remaining Israeli hostages and warned of a “tough situation” ahead.
    


            “It's going to be nasty – that's my opinion, Israel's choice, but that's my opinion,” Trump said. “They gotta let them out.
    


            President Donald Trump arrived at Arthur Ashe Stadium and was booed by the crowd.
    


            The crowd is still sparse at this point, and there were definitely some cheers, but the overwhelming response to his fist pumps to the crowd were jeers.
    


            Trump stood outside of the suite that's hosting the US Open trophy and waved to the crowd that's here, pumping his first a few times before heading back into the suite.
    


            Enhanced security measures for the president's arrival have resulted in delays in fans entering the stadium and the match's start has been pushed back 30 minutes.

            Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier of Washington state said today that Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo is “flat wrong” after he defended his decision to remove vaccine mandates in the state.
    


            “I think he is flat wrong. Public schools should absolutely require children to be vaccinated,” said Schrier, a former physician, after Ladapo said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper that the issue is a matter of parental control over what happens to their children's bodies.
    


                    “Parents have always had a right to make their own decisions about whether to vaccinate their children or not,” Schrier told CNN.  “When that freedom to not vaccinate their own children and put them at risk comes up against another child's freedom to go to school knowing that they will not get measles or polio or whooping cough, then we have a real problem.”
                





            Florida announced last week that it will be the first state to move to end immunization requirements for everyone, including schoolchildren, that have been in place since the 1980s. The American Medical Association “strongly opposes” this change, a member of the association's board of trustees told CNN in a statement.
    


            Ladapo claimed his decision was “based on data and common sense,” yet in the interview with CNN,  said his state has not done any data analysis on the impact of ending vaccine mandate.
    


            The Trump administration launched a new federal immigration enforcement effort in Massachusetts focused on deporting criminals who entered the country illegally, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
    


                    “ICE launched ‘Patriot 2.0' to target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens living in the state of Massachusetts, following the success of Operation Patriot in May,” a DHS spokesperson told CNN today.
                





            The statement blamed Boston's Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu for so-called sanctuary city polices that it said “not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens,” vowing that DHS will arrest criminals released by local authorities.
    


            CNN has reached out to Wu's office for comment.
    


            “Under President Trump and (DHS Secretary Kristi) Noem, nowhere is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return,” the statement continued.
    


            The Justice Department sued Wu earlier this month over Boston's sanctuary policy, which limits cooperation with federal immigration efforts.
    


            “What we have seen from ICE and from the administration really isn't about public safety, it's about political theater. It's about a political power grab and an attempt to intimidate,” Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said today in an interview with MSNBC.
    


            CNN reported last month that Trump administration officials had discussed a major immigration enforcement operation in Boston in the coming weeks, according to two sources familiar with the talks.
    


            This comes as officials in Chicago are bracing for a federal immigration enforcement operation that sources had told CNN could start as soon as this weekend.

            President Donald Trump signaled on Sunday that his administration is ready to move to the second phase of sanctions against Russia.
    


            “Are you ready to move to the second phase of sanctions against Russia?” a reporter asked the president as he left the White House to head to the US Open in New York.
    


            “Yeah, I am,” the president responded.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday stressed the importance of ratcheting up pressure on Moscow and on “all countries who trade with Russia.”
    


            “The Russian economy is pressured and all the countries who trade with Russia are pressured, and we will continue with this,” Zelensky said, adding that “secondary sanctions and special trade tariffs” can help.
    


            CNN has previously reported that Trump was growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress on peace and was contemplating how involved he should be in brokering a meeting between Russian and Ukrainian leaders.
    


Russian attack: Meanwhile, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine said Sunday that Russia is “escalating” following its largest air attack of the war overnight.
    


                    “The danger in any war is escalation. Russia appears to be escalating with the largest attack of the war hitting offices of the UKR Cabinet in Kyiv,” Gen. Keith Kellogg posted on X. “History shows events can escalate out of control through actions as these. It is why President Trump is working to stop this war. The attack was not a signal that Russia wants to diplomatically end this war.”
                





            Russia launched its largest aerial assault of the Ukraine war overnight into Sunday, deploying more than 800 drones and striking a government building in Kyiv for the first time.
    


            An infant was among at least two people killed in drone strikes on several residential buildings in the capital, Kyiv's city office said.
    


            Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois said she hasn't seen any indication the Trump administration is preparing to imminently send National Guard troops into Chicago, as she accused President Donald Trump of “essentially declaring war on a major city in his own nation.”
    


            Duckworth, a Democrat, told CBS' “Face the Nation” she was at the Great Lakes naval base, the facility being used as a command center for immigration agents, on Saturday. She said personnel there told her they've only been asked to provide “office space for ICE” as Chicago braces for a federal immigration crackdown.
    


            “No barracks, no detention facilities, none of that is being requested or prepared to in order to support troops into Chicago,” Duckworth said today.
    


            She called Trump's social media post on Saturday saying Chicago will find out why “it's called the Department of WAR”  as “not normal.”
    


                    “I take what the president United States says very seriously, because that is the respect you have to give to the office,” Duckworth said. “And if that's what he's declaring, then let me make it clear, it would be an illegal order to declare war on a major city, any city within the United States, by the president of the United States.”
                





            Duckworth said she and her Democratic colleagues in Illinois, Sen. Dick Durbin and Rep. Brad Schneider, who represents part of the Chicago suburbs, asked the Department of Homeland Security for more information about what they were preparing, but did not hear back.
    


            She added that DHS denied the lawmakers a visit to the base at Great Lakes, and “gave their staff the day off on the day that we went to go look at the facilities and locked the doors and left the base.”
    


            The Trump administration is moving full steam ahead with its crime and immigration efforts, focusing their attention on Chicago.
    


If you're just joining, these are the latest headlines:



            Republican Sen. Roger Marshall, a doctor, defended Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after a tense hearing leading to criticism from other Republican senators who are also physicians.
    


                    “I respect what my colleagues are saying. But I think that you know this whole issue today, or in that meeting, was about vaccines,” said Marshall, who practiced for over 25 years. “In my humble opinion, not every person needs every vaccine.” 
                





            Marshall also sits on the Senate Finance Committee and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which oversee HHS and worked on Kennedy's confirmation.
    


            “President Trump chose Robert F Kennedy Jr., to be a disrupter to the CDC, and that's exactly what he's doing,” Marshall said on CBS' “Face the Nation.”
    


            Marshall, who is an OBGYN, also commented on an upcoming report from HHS linking people taking Tylenol during pregnancy to increased autism in children.
    


            Marshall said he recommends patients to not take anything during pregnancy because “we don't know what we don't know” and said he wants “gold standard studies to help us figure this out.” He, however, did add “as far as I know, Tylenol is OK in pregnancy.”
    


            “There is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues,” Dr. Christopher Zahn, chief of clinical practice for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement Friday.
    


            Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott told CNN's Manu Raju that the city doesn't need federal troops after former President Donald Trump threatened to send the National Guard. Scott and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore instead announced a surge of state law enforcement to fight crime.
    


            The World Health Organization made a public show of support for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention today, with its leader saying in posts across social media feeds that the American agency's work is “invaluable and must be protected.”
    


                    “When I was Ethiopia's Health Minister, I sent a team to Atlanta to learn from the US CDC, and a significant part of what the Ethiopian Public Health Agency does is based on these best practices,” wrote Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who serves as WHO's director-general. “The establishment of the Africa CDC, which I proposed at the African Union summit in Abuja in 2013 when I was Foreign Minister, was also inspired by the US CDC.”
                





            Florida's surgeon general said today his state has not done any data analysis on the impact of ending vaccine mandates and defended the state's decision to do so, saying,“it's really about ethics.”
    


                    “I mean, is it appropriate for a government or any other entity to dictate to you what you should put in your body? No, it's absolutely not appropriate,” Dr. Joseph Ladapo ​told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” “You have sovereignty over your body.”
                





            Last week, Florida announced that it will be the first state to seek to remove immunization requirements for everyone, including school children, which have been in place since the 1980s. The American Medical Association “strongly opposes” this change, a member of the Association's board of trustees told CNN in a statement.
    


            Florida, like all US states, grants exemptions from immunizations for medical and religious reasons. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around about 5% of kindergartners in the state were exempt from at least one vaccine last year — higher than the national average. The vast majority of these children were exempt for non-medical reasons.
    


            Pressed about whether the state had commissioned any medical research to back this move, the surgeon general responded, “The way you're portraying it is nonsense.”
    


                    “We don't need to do any projections,” said Ladapo — who last week likened vaccine mandates to slavery. “We handle outbreaks all the time, so there's nothing special that we would need to do.”
                





            Additionally, the surgeon general pointed to other countries without vaccine mandates, such as the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden, saying, “The sky isn't falling over there.”
    


            Meanwhile, the Treasury Department will issue rebates if the Supreme Court upholds a ruling that President Donald Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs were an overstep of power, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today.
    


                    “We would have to give a refund on about half of the tariffs, which would be terrible for the Treasury,” Bessent said during an appearance on NBC News' “Meet the Press.” He added that, “If the court says it, we'd have to do it.” But there are “numerous other avenues” that can be taken instead of rebates, Bessent said, without citing details.
                





A federal appeals court ruled on August 29 that Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs were among the imposed duties that breach the president's authority, saying that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the emergency tariffs Trump imposed earlier this year.
    


            The fresh slate of the Trump administration's so-called “reciprocal” tariffs, which went into effect in early August, will remain in place after the court delayed implementation of its order until October 14.
    


            The court ruling has put into question the Trump administration's ability to continue trade negotiations. The Trump administration appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, warning of a “poor nation” without tariffs.
    


            Bessent said he is “confident” the Trump administration will win at the Supreme Court.

            Tom Homan, White House border czar, defended President Donald Trump's “Chipocalypse Now” social media post from a day earlier, which said Chicago “will find out why it's called the Department of WAR.”
    


                    “I think his words are being taken out of context. I said we're going to war. We're going to war the criminal cartels. We're going to war with illegal aliens, public safety threats that rape children, that raped citizens, that committed armed robberies, that distribute narcotics that kill Americans,” Homan told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” today.
                





            Democratic officials in Chicago and Illinois condemned the post Saturday, with Gov. JB Pritzker calling it “not normal.” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and US Rep. Mike Quigley, who represents part of the city, described the post as an example of authoritarianism.
    


CNN previously reported the Trump administration's plans to conduct a major immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, and that officials there were bracing for it to begin as early as Friday.
    


            Pressed on whether the administration will send the National Guard in to Chicago this week, Homan told CNN that the option is “always on the table.”
    


            “We used them in Los Angeles, and we use them in Washington, DC. They're a force multiplier,” he said.
    


            Asked  how many National Guard troops would be in Chicago, Homan declined to respond, saying that it was “law enforcement sensitive information.”
    


            Asked whether there will be any action in Chicago this week, Homan responded “absolutely,” adding, “you can expect action in most sanctuary cities across the country.”
    


Hyundai immigration raid: He was also asked by CNN whether there will be more extensive immigration raids, like the one at a Hyundai manufacturing plant in Georgia that led to 475 arrests.
    


            “The short answer is, yes, we're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,” Homan said.
    


            Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr defended his leadership earlier in an interview on “Fox and Friends,” as we just reported.
    


            Jerome Adams, who served as US surgeon general during President Donald Trump's first administration, called for Kennedy to be fired as controversy continues to swirl over his handling of vaccine approvals.
    


            When asked by CNN's Victor Blackwell yesterday if Trump should remove Kennedy, Adams said, “I absolutely believe that he should for the sake of the nation and the sake of his legacy.”
    


            Adams' comments came after a contentious hearing on Capitol Hill last week, where Kennedy was grilled by both Democrats and Republicans about his views on vaccines and the recent exodus at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the resignation of its director, over tighter vaccine policies Kennedy was pushing.
    


            “I'm deeply concerned about the health and safety of our nation under RFK's current leadership,” Adams told Blackwell, later adding: “I absolutely believe he is uniquely damaging the credibility of federal agencies like the CDC, (National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration) and he's putting us at risk.”

CNN's Adam Cancryn contributed to this report.



            Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. decried his intense grilling by senators from both parties over major shakeups at the top health agencies as “theater” and defended his leadership.
    


                    “I've come to realize that those hearings are performative. They're theater. And, you know, they're not the kind of debate or open conversation that democracy would give us at its ideal,” he told “Fox and Friends” on Sunday.
                





            His interview on the conservative cable network show continued some of his first comments after a testy hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday. Democrats and Republicans on the panel pressed Kennedy on his vaccine skepticism and decision to fire the newly-installed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director.
    


            Kennedy accused senators on the panel that played a role in his confirmation of being beholden to pharmaceutical companies, without citing evidence, saying “they don't want to hear the answers to the questions that they ask me. They want to make a little speech and then shut me down.”
    


            Defending his ousting of Dr. Susan Monarez as director of the CDC, which led to the resignation of several other top health officials, Kennedy told Fox News “we need new blood, and we need new people who are committed to public health and integrity and gold standard science, and the Trump administration is going to make sure that happens.”
    


            Pressed on what he sees as the last great success of federal government health agencies, Kennedy answered: “I don't think there have been successes,” claiming that the infiltration of pharmaceutical companies have led to a “series of bad decisions.”
    


            After weeks of warnings, Chicago could be the next US city to see National Guard troops rolling through its streets.
    


            Local leaders were preparing ahead of this weekend – from the governor bracing for a court fight to parade planners postponing – even while it was not clear troops whether will show up.
    


            Officials in Illinois had heard the National Guard will be in place by Friday and ready to act Saturday – in step with an expected immigration enforcement swell – but no one from the Trump administration has told the state of its plans, Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker said Wednesday.
    


            Meanwhile, there are “no immediate plans” to send soldiers to Chicago, Vice President JD Vance told reporters Wednesday after President Donald Trump the prior day called it “the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far” following a violent Labor Day weekend and said the feds were “going in,” though without saying when.
    


            Read more here on how Chicago was preparing for this weekend.
    


            Just ahead of the weekend, President Donald Trump signed several executive orders in the Oval Office Friday and also took questions on a variety of topics from reporters.
    


            Let's take a look back at what was said:
    


CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo, Elise Hammond, Samantha Waldenberg, Kit Maher, Aditi Sangal, Jennifer Hansler, Alayna Treene, Donald Judd, Haley Britzky and David Goldman contributed reporting to this post.



            As we've reported, President Donald Trump is heading to the US Open men's final today after starting his day at the White House, an administration official has told CNN.
    


            According to the White House schedule, he'll get there at around 2 p.m. ET after leaving at 11.45 a.m. ET.



            As we report here, The last time Trump attended a US Open match, as a presidential candidate in 2015, the booing was so loud that multiple news outlets wrote stories about the critical crowd reaction
    


            He's then due to return back to the White House at 7 p.m. ET.
    


            President Donald Trump reposted a meme on social media Saturday saying in part that Chicago will find out why “it's called the Department of WAR.”
    


                    “‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning … Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR 🚁🚁🚁🚁,” the text of the post reads.
                





            It is accompanied by what appears to be an artificially generated image of the president and the Chicago skyline reading “Chipocalypse Now.”
    


            Trump signed an executive order Friday to rebrand the Pentagon as the “Department of War.”
    


            The president's post comes as he has ramped up his rhetoric against Democratic-led cities, with a direct target on Chicago.
    


            “Chicago is the worst and most dangerous city in the World, by far,” Trump said Tuesday morning on Truth Social. “(Illinois Gov. JB) Pritzker needs help badly, he just doesn't know it yet. I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC.”
    


            “We're going,” the president told a reporter hours later about sending in the National Guard. “I didn't say when. We're going in.”
    


            Pritzker responded on social media Saturday calling out the president's post as “not normal” and said that his state would not be “intimidated” by the president.
    


                    “The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city. This is not a joke. This is not normal,” Pritzker wrote on X. “Donald Trump isn't a strongman, he's a scared man. Illinois won't be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.”

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (AP) — Boko Haram militants killed dozens of people in a nighttime assault on a village in northeastern Nigeria that is home to residents who had recently returned from a camp for internally displaced persons, authorities said.

The attack on Darul Jamal in the Bama local government area took place late Friday and killed at least 60 people, a resident of the village, Mohammed Babagana, told The Associated Press.

Borno state Gov. Babagana Zulum, who visited the attacked community late Saturday evening, confirmed to reporters that over 60 died in the attack.

“We sympathize with the people and have pleaded with them not to abandon their homes as we have made arrangements to improve the security and provide food and other lifesaving items that they have lost,” Zulum said.

The chairman of Bama's local government, Modu Gujja, said over a dozen houses were burnt and more than 100 people were forced to flee.

Taiwo Adebayo, a researcher specializing in Boko Haram at the Institute for Security Studies, spoke to residents of Darual Jamal and said the killings on Friday night were carried out by a faction of Boko Haram known as Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad. 

Boko Haram, Nigeria's homegrown jihadis, took up arms in 2009 to fight Western education and impose their radical version of Islamic law. The conflict has spilled into Nigeria's northern neighbors, including Niger, and resulted in the death of around 35,000 civilians and the displacement of more than 2 million others, according to the United Nations.




Boko Haram split into two factions after the death of the group's longtime leader, Abubakar Shekau, in 2021.

One faction is backed by the Islamic State group and is known as the Islamic State West Africa Province, or ISWAP. It has become notorious for targeting military positions.

The other faction, Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, or JAS, has increasingly resorted to attacking civilians and perceived collaborators and thrives on robberies and abductions for ransom.

“When JAS attacks and kills a lot of people like they did last night in Bama, it's usually that they suspect the victims of spying for the rival ISWAP or the military,” Adebayo told the AP.

The Bama local government area was the target of several Boko Haram attacks a decade ago, forcing many residents to flee. Following military operations in the area in recent years, authorities had resettled displaced people in several communities, most recently the village of Darul Jamal in July.

Kaana Ali, a Darul Jamal resident, said he decided to leave the community for good after he confirmed the deaths of close family friends in the attack on Friday. “But the governor is still begging us to stay back as more protection would be provided to secure our community,” he said.

The two-part special, ‘The Amazon Review Killer,' is now streaming on Fox Nation.

One of California's most notorious killers is back in the spotlight as a new documentary revisits his crimes and uncovers even darker secrets.

Joseph Naso, the former photographer convicted in 2013 of killing four women, is now claiming he actually killed 26 women. The bombshell confession comes from a fellow death row inmate, William Noguera, who spent more than a decade building trust with Naso inside California's infamous San Quentin State Prison.

The chilling revelations are featured in a new Oxygen documentary, ""Death Row Confidential: Secrets of a Serial Killer,"" premiering Sept. 13.

""He's guilty of more than anyone knows,"" Noguera says during a preview of the new series. ""He told me everything, and I wrote all of it down.""

Naso's double life stunned the country. He was a father of two, Little League coach, and school photographer by day – and a sadistic killer by night. Investigators found photographs of what appeared to be dead women among his belongings, along with what investigators dubbed a ""hit list,"" containing ten cryptic descriptions of female victims.

Even after a jury handed down a death sentence, Naso continued to maintain his innocence in interviews, including an exclusive interview with KGO.

Noguera, who is also on death row for a 1983 murder, was assigned to assist elderly prisoners as part of a prison disability program, which is where he connected with Naso. Over 10 years, the two developed what was described by several media outlets as an ""unusual"" relationship. 

Noguera told the outlet that Naso eventually opened up, and offered the stunning admission.

""When I told him, 'Well, look, they got you because a list of 10,' he started laughing,"" Noguera recalled. ""He said, 'They got it all wrong. Yeah, I killed them women, yes. But those aren't my top – those aren't my list of 10. Those are my top 10."" 

Noguera disclosed even more disturbing details, noting that Naso's claims of killing 26 women may be supported by something reportedly found in the search of Naso's home. Noguera told the outlet, ""They found a coin collection with 26 gold heads. Those represent his trophies, they represent the 26 women that he murdered.""

Determined to document everything, Noguera compiled a 300-page dossier filled with cryptic clues, locations and partial confessions. He passed the files to retired FBI task force investigator Ken Mains, who took on the case pro bono.

While Naso never named his victims, his rambling stories hinted at forgotten crimes. In one ploy, Noguera convinced him to put a confession in writing, dangling the possibility of a prison transfer to get closer to his sons.

In his own words, Naso reportedly described luring a woman through a modeling ad, driving her home, killing her and dumping her body under the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge.

NEW ENGLAND SERIAL KILLER FEARS MERIT 'REVIEW AND INVESTIGATION' AFTER REMAINS FOUND ACROSS 3 STATES: EXPERT

Accused serial killer Joseph Naso, left, talks with his legal advisor Pedro Oliveros as the prosecution made their opening statement on Monday, June 17, 2013, in Marin Superior Court in San Rafael, California. 

The description matched the disappearance of Berkeley woman Lynn Ruth Connes in the 1970s, KGO noted. She had answered a modeling ad, and her bike was later found chained near the exact spot Naso described.

Working together, Detective Mains and Noguera linked Naso to several cold cases, including Connes'. Piece by piece, they are putting names to the women Naso once reduced to cryptic notes – and delivering long-awaited answers to grieving families.

""But now they know what really happened to her,"" Noguera said. ""And that has been my goal the whole time, is to give the victim's family just that closure, that finalization, that's the whole motivating factor behind all of this.""

Naso, who was dubbed the ""Alphabet Killer,"" gained his grim nickname after being found guilty in 2013 of murdering four women whose first and last names began with the same letter. The victims included Roxene Roggasch, 18, Carmen Colon, 22, Pamela Parsons, 38, and Tracy Tafoya, 31, with their deaths occurring between 1977 and 1994.

Authorities had previously investigated Naso in connection to the unsolved ""Alphabet Murders"" of three young girls in his hometown, Rochester, New York, in the 1970s. However, DNA evidence ruled him out as a suspect in those cases.

Investigators also uncovered a diary detailing more than 100 sexual assaults dating back to the 1950s, many involving underage girls. With the new claims emerging, law enforcement agencies across California and the FBI are now re-examining unsolved cases.

""Our two minds, cop and convict, working together. I know that I can solve unsolved murders. Let's get them,"" Mains said. 

As the documentary reveals, Naso's crimes may stretch further than anyone ever imagined — and his disturbing legacy continues to haunt both investigators and families seeking closure.

A knife-wielding man was shot dead during a police pursuit in New York City after entering a police precinct and slashing an officer in the face with a 14-inch blade, authorities said Sunday.

The attack unfolded just before 5:30 a.m. at the 73rd Precinct in Brooklyn's Brownsville neighborhood when a man entered the building through an employee entrance, NYPD Chief of Patrol Philip Rivera told reporters at a briefing.

When a female officer stopped the man and told him to go out and enter through the front door, the man pulled out ""a large butcher knife"" and slashed her in the face, Rivera said.

The female officer fought off the knife-wielding man, who then ran out through the back of the precinct. An officer used a taser as the man escaped, but the device was not effective in stopping him, Rivera said.

Several officers chased after the man, ordering him to drop the knife. The man did not comply with the officers' commands, Rivera said.

A short time later, the man lunged at an officer with the knife. Several officers then opened fire on the knife-wielding man, striking him numerous times. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

Rivera said the female officer was in ""good spirits"" at a hospital. (FOX 5 New York WNYW)

Officers recovered the 14-inch blade at the scene.

The officer who was slashed in the face was treated at a hospital, where she is recovering and in ""good spirits,"" Rivera said.

""This situation could have turned out very differently,"" he said. ""This is the risk that every NYPD officer faces every single day.""

Rivera said investigators had a tentative identification on the knife-wielding man, but could not immediately release it to the public.

President Donald Trump arrived at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York City for the U.S. Open men's singles final on Sunday between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.

Trump was greeted with cheers and applause from the fans at the stadium. He mouthed, ""Thank you.""

It's Trump's first visit to the Grand Slam tennis tournament since before he got into the White House. He was seen at the event in September 2015 – months after he announced his run for president the first time. And it's a pretty good time to be a fan of the sport.

Sinner and Alcaraz have cemented themselves as the two top stars in the post-Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal eras. Novak Djokovic has proved that he could still win Grand Slam titles as well but he hasn't won since the 2023 U.S. Open. He reached the semifinals in each Grand Slam tournament this season.

While U.S. Open broadcasters were reportedly ordered to avoid showing disruptions in the crowd over Trump's presence, Alcaraz welcomed the possibility of seeing Trump in the crowd.

""I don't want myself to be nervous because of it, but I think attending the tennis match, it's great for tennis to have the president at the final.""

When it comes to reports surrounding her romance with Liam Neeson, Pamela Anderson doesn't have time for PR stunts. 

During an appearance at the 51st Deauville American Film Festival in Deauville, France on Friday, Anderson — who gave an acceptance speech after receiving the festival's Deauville Talent Award — seemingly shut down rumors that she and her ""The Naked Gun"" co-star orchestrated their romantic chemistry to drive ticket sales. 

""I do not and will never feed into PR stunts,"" she said during her speech, per People. ""That would be a death sentence. I'm authentically driven. I'm superstitious when it comes to love. And I'm not comfortable sharing any shred of my romantic life.""

""I know I'll fall in love again and again on screen,"" she continued. ""That is my job. If we do it well, you will feel it, a kind of projection. It is the greatest compliment. So please think positive. And I appreciate your good wishes. There are no silly games being played. I'm sincere.""

""Do not mistake my kindness for weakness or my boldness for bitterness. I'm here on this journey, not for money or for fame, but to see what I'm made of in truth, hard work and to leave behind an honest legacy my family can be proud of,"" she concluded. 

The 58-year-old actress and the 72-year-old actor made headlines with their flirty exchanges and public displays of affection throughout ""The Naked Gun"" press tour, which kicked off in July.

Since then, reports have circulated that the pair's romantic connection was a calculated PR strategy to promote the film. 

In a report published by TMZ last month, sources alleged that Anderson and Neeson's PR teams, along with the movie's studio, Paramount Pictures, orchestrated the duo's alleged fake relationship while ""The Naked Gun"" was in production. TMZ reported that Anderson and Neeson had not seen each other from the time that filming wrapped in July 2024 until the press tour began.

In addition, the outlet reported that Anderson and Neeson never had a one-on-one date, and their dinners together were strictly business with personal assistants present. While speaking with People, a source slammed the allegation as ""ridiculous.""

However, an insider told People that the connection between Anderson and Neeson is ""genuine.""

""Everything between them has been genuine. Neither would ever take part in a publicity stunt. They have a great time. Neither of them needs the publicity,"" the insider said.

""Their relationship isn't just for show,"" another source told the outlet. ""They have a real connection. There's no incentive for either of them to stage something like this.""

Ohio GOP gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy ridicules Gov. Gavin Newsom's 'disaster' in California and outlines his vision for Ohio on 'Hannity.'

EXCLUSIVE – Republican Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is touting support from a growing list of prominent donors who once backed Democrat Tim Ryan, a development his campaign says underscores a major political shift in the Buckeye State.

According to Ramaswamy's team, nearly $220,000 of the contributions raised in his first months as a candidate came from individuals who previously gave to Ryan, the former congressman from Youngstown who is weighing a bid for governor. Ryan has not officially declared a gubernatorial bid and has said he will make a decision by the end of the year. 

Some of the best-known business leaders in Youngstown and Northeast Ohio, long part of Ryan's donor network, have now switched sides, Fox News Digital has learned. 

Ramaswamy's campaign highlights names including Caryn and Sam Covelli, a major business leader in Mahoning Valley who gave the Republican candidate $10,000 after donating more than $59,000 to Ryan over multiple cycles; and Bruce Zoldan, a Youngstown-area business leader who gave Ramaswamy $5,000 after contributing more than $53,000 to Ryan.

Another business leader, Adam Thomarios, gave $10,000 and is hosting an upcoming fundraiser after contributing nearly $17,000 to Ryan. Anthony Manna contributed $10,000 after donating nearly $25,000 to Ryan between 2005 and 2021, according to Ramaswamy's campaign. Regina Mitchell hosted a fundraiser and gave more than $13,600 to Ramaswamy after a prior $2,700 contribution to Ryan in 2017.

Jeff Edwards, the president and CEO of Edwards Companies and Installed Building Products in the Columbus area, and his wife,Lisa, gave roughly $33,000 to Ramaswamy this cycle after contributing $5,800 to Ryan in 2022.

Jai Chabria, Ramaswamy's chief strategist, told Fox News Digital that the donor movement is about more than campaign finance. He said Ohioans who once trusted traditional Democratic leadership are embracing Ramaswamy's message of economic growth and new ideas after decades of disappointment. In his view, voters are leaving behind ""a tired model"" that did not deliver and are backing someone who represents prosperity and reform. 

""It's a very interesting thing where people who have been – who have donated to Democrats, and especially someone like Tim Ryan, and they're flocking to Vivek,"" Chabria told Fox News Digital. ""There's actually a movement where people are actually moving over not just to Republicans, but to Vivek specifically because he's got such a message of growth, of economic growth."" 

He argued that the momentum is visible not only in financial reports but also in grassroots enthusiasm across the state.

""I think, like many people in Ohio who were promised one thing under these institutions, and by institutions I mean people that have been elected over and over and over again and didn't deliver for people, I think people are coming to see that someone else with fresh ideas is what they need to invest in rather than the tired old model that didn't deliver for the state,"" Chabria told Fox News Digital. 

Ohio Republican Party Chairman Alex Triantafilou echoed that point, calling the donor shifts ""impressive"" and a sign of Ramaswamy's strength as a candidate. He said former Ryan backers now see in Ramaswamy a leader committed to workers, reshoring manufacturing and strengthening Ohio's energy independence. 

Triantafilou also emphasized the GOP's early endorsement of Ramaswamy in May – more than a year before the primary – as unprecedented. He said it helped solidify a coalition that has powered Republican victories statewide.

Fox News Digital reached out to Ryan for comment.

After spotlighting the defections from Ryan's ranks, the Ramaswamy campaign is also underscoring its own financial milestones. Ramaswamy reported raising $9.7 million between February and June, which his team calls the largest sum ever collected by an Ohio gubernatorial candidate in the year before a general election. An allied super PAC has added $17 million more. 

RAMASWAMY PLEDGES 'RULE OF LAW' REVIVAL AFTER VIRAL CINCINNATI MOB ATTACK

Chabria described that first report as only the ""tip of the iceberg,"" predicting that the next filing will show an even bigger number.

Both strategists portrayed the fundraising and donor flips as part of a broader coalition that cuts across traditional political lines. Chabria said Ramaswamy's background in business appeals to donors because he understands their perspective, while his detailed policy agenda shows he is prepared to govern without a steep learning curve. He pointed to priorities such as energy independence, improving Ohio's schools and tackling crime in cities as issues resonating with small and large donors alike.

""The crime in our cities is – it's appalling. And it's something that Vivek wants to bring all leaders together to actually try to address because people need to be able to be safe in their own homes. And in too many places, they don't feel that way,"" Chabria told Fox News Digital. ""I mean, Democrats, Republicans, independents, they all need to feel safe in their homes, in their cities. So it's definitely not a partisan issue, but sometimes it becomes one. But Vivek, I think he's gonna try to rise above it and try to bring all people together and really listen to everybody and then try to offer real concrete solutions to this issue.""

Triantafilou stressed that Ramaswamy's agenda has broad working-class appeal, citing his proposals on manufacturing, education and eliminating the state income tax to make Ohio more competitive. He said those ideas speak directly to middle-class Ohioans, including union workers, postal employees and delivery drivers, who could benefit from lower taxes and better economic conditions.

Generational change is also part of the message. At 40, Ramaswamy represents ""a new era of leadership,"" Triantafilou said, contrasting him with Ryan, whom he described as emblematic of Democrats focused on cultural debates rather than the economic concerns of ordinary voters. He argued that Ryan, who lost a Senate race to then-first-time candidate JD Vance in 2022, is ""yesterday,"" while Ramaswamy represents ""tomorrow.""

Republicans are already previewing the contrast if Ryan enters the governor's race. Triantafilou criticized him as ""inauthentic,"" accusing him of posturing as a moderate in Ohio while voting with the left in Washington. He said Democrats are out of step with voters on issues ranging from crime to education, and predicted Ryan would be outspent, outworked and ultimately defeated if he jumped in.

""Tim Ryan represents kind of what's wrong with the Democratic Party,"" Triantafilou told Fox News Digital. ""Tim Ryan will put on a hunting jacket and be on TV, and then he goes to D.C. and votes with AOC and with the left of party.""

For now, the Ramaswamy campaign is focused on consolidating early momentum. Events are scheduled into the fall, including an October fundraiser hosted by Thomarios in Akron, as the campaign works to expand its base across Columbus, Cincinnati, Toledo and beyond. With record fundraising, defections from Ryan's donor network, and the Ohio GOP's early endorsement, Republicans say Ramaswamy has positioned himself as the frontrunner in 2026.

A former police officer in Florida was charged Thursday with traveling to meet an 11-year-old girl for sex, authorities said.

Gary Mygdal, 73, allegedly had sexually explicit conversations with someone he believed was a child and agreed to meet her at what he thought was her home, the Pinellas Park Police Department said.

Mygdal was arrested outside an apartment complex and confirmed to officers that he had traveled there ""for intimate sexual contact"" with the girl, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by the Tampa Bay Times.

Mygdal served as a Pinellas Park police officer for a decade, from 1974 to 1984, police said.

Vice President JD Vance dismissed the Democrats' potential presidential nominees for 2028 by saying they all try to “mimic” President Donald Trump, which he suggested is bound to fail.

Vance, widely seen as the Republican Party's top candidate for 2028 should he decide to run, laughed off the potential challengers in an appearance on Fox News's My View with Lara Trump Saturday night.

“I don't think much of the modern Democratic Party. Obviously, I'm biased,” Vance quipped, before adding, “I look at these guys, I think some of them are trying to actually mimic President Trump. You can't mimic his style. He just is who he is.”

While not mentioning specific Democratic lawmakers, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), who is viewed as the Democrats' best chance to retake the Oval Office in 2028, has regularly mocked Trump as the two have sparred throughout the year.

That has included Newsom ramping up his social media presence, frequently parodying Trump with the all-caps statements that the president uses, as well as launching a merchandise shop that features many of the slogans Trump has on his signature hats, only with Newsom's name swapped in.

Other prominent Democratic governors have tangled with Trump this year as well, in what has become a preview of the 2028 race. Those include Govs. Wes Moore (D-MD) and JB Pritzker (D-IL), who Trump has targeted over crime in their cities.

JERRY NADLER SAYS HE WILL NOT RUN FOR REELECTION

Both Moore and Pritzker have deflected on potential 2028 bids, with Pritzker recently urging his party to focus on the 2026 midterm elections.

Vance briefly touched on those midterm elections on Saturday, suggesting that “anger” from voters wins the off-year races. He contended that Trump supporters aren't “angry” and stressed the importance of getting out and voting in 2026 in order to ensure Republicans hold on to their small majority in the House of Representatives.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

When President Donald Trump sent the Washington, D.C., National Guard and other federal law enforcement to police the streets of the district this August, a New York Times reporter declared it “a nonexistent crime crisis.” Liberal journalists all rallied behind the idea that Washington was perfectly safe and clean.

Trump then declared that he had basically eliminated violent crime from the city, and his administration said they planned to deploy federal law enforcement to the streets of other Democrat-run cities. This spurred a new counterargument from Democrats: red states are actually more dangerous than blue states.

NEWSOM COMPARES CALIFORNIA'S HOMICIDE RATE TO RED STATES. DOES HE HAVE A POINT?

There's plenty to debate here, regarding federalism, D.C. home rule, political prudence, and law-enforcement tactics. But that debate is impossible while the politicians, the media, and the public all seem to be starting from different sets of facts.

So what's the truth about crime in the district and in other cities? How bad is it, how is it trending, and where is it worst?

“Bloodshed, bedlam and squalor,” Trump said in his oration on D.C. “Violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people.”

Is Trump's picture accurate? Or is Peter Baker correct that there is no crime problem in D.C.?

Well, it depends on your benchmark.

D.C. is much more violent and criminal than most of the country.

In D.C. last year there was 1 violent crime per every 100 people, or to use the measurement the FBI uses, about 1,000 violent crimes per 100,000 population. That rate puts D.C. in the top-ten most violent cities and is more than two-and-a-half the violent crime rate in the rest of the country (359 violent crimes per 100,000 people).

Likewise, D.C.'s property crime rate is more than double that in the rest of the country.

D.C.'s 2024 murder rate of 27.3 homicides per 100,000 population was six times that of New York City, and was the fourth highest among U.S. cities.

Carjackings are a very popular crime in the D.C. area, especially since the COVID lockdowns. Most carjackings in D.C. and the surrounding areas are by children and teenagers, many of whom simply go for joyrides and then crash the car. This is a clear fallout from the decision of local leaders to close the public schools for a year and ban organized recreational activity.

In 2023, D.C. saw nearly 950 carjackings, and in 2024 that number fell massively to 496 — only about 10 per week.

Some longtime D.C. residents don't think this is too bad, because things used to be a lot worse. From 1990 to 1993, back when Democrats were running as tough-on-crime, D.C. experienced almost 500 murders a year — more than 9 per week.

The murder rate steadily fell for about thirty years, and D.C. — slowly at first, and then rapidly in the late aughts and early 2010s — became a safer, cleaner, and more attractive place to live and hang out.

In 2012, only 88 people were murdered in D.C., representing a drop of more than 80%.

D.C.'s improvement reversed in 2014 — the year black teenager Michael Brown was killed after attacking a Ferguson police officer. Then, of course, the police killing George Floyd, the subsequent riots, the resulting police retreat, and the lockdowns and school closures.

D.C.'s Floyd/lockdown crime wave peaked around 2022 or 2023, depending on the measure, and the first half of 2025 showed a continued downward trend. Still, many crime figures are higher than they were before the pandemic, and just about everything is worse than it was before 2014.

As of Sept. 4, D.C. has had 104 murders in 2025, more than the total in 2012, and about equal to its annual total in the surrounding years.

D.C. had 1,742 violent crimes in the first 8 months of the year, which is much worse than in pre-COVID times. Back in 1997 was the last time, before the lockdowns, that there were so many violent crimes in D.C.

So is D.C. safer than it was the last few years? Yes. But it's much more dangerous than it was for most of the past three decades.

A final note on D.C. Part of what residents and workers in D.C. find so upsetting is the general disorder: bike theft, metro turnstile hopping, car break-ins, homeless encampments, and the ubiquitous smell of marijuana, to name a few.

These are the sort of things that liberal commentators say are no big deal, but that make life unpleasant, particularly for women, children, and parents.

In 2021, former NYPD officer Eric Adams won the Democratic primary for mayor, defeating multiple progressives who had advocated defunding the police. You could predict how well he would do in any given precinct based on the violent crime rate: The safest corners of Manhattan and Brooklyn supported the defund the police candidates — that is, they held luxury beliefs.

The most dangerous parts of the city voted for Adams. If you were exposed to crime, you wanted someone to come in and bust heads.

New York recovered pretty quickly from its Floyd/lockdown crime surge (even if the subways took a little longer to improve).

NYC murders in 2024 were down 20% from 2021 highs, but were still higher than any of the seven years before COVID. Likewise, all serious felonies are down from the 2022 highs, but still higher than any year between 2006 and 2020.

Other major cities generally show the same trends, down from recent peaks but still historically high.

Baltimore may be the exception. The city had a massive post-Ferguson spike in murders, exacerbated by their own version of Ferguson. (A black arrestee named Freddie Gray died in the back of a police van in 2015, and an ambitious Democratic prosecutor failed to convict the cops.)

But murders have fallen rapidly since 2022, and last month was the least deadly August in Baltimore in decades.

Trump administration officials have suggested that he will “liberate” Chicago. Trump likewise called Los Angeles “lawless.”

Again, there are debates over the legality and prudence of Trump sending federal law enforcement to police these cities, but underlying this debate is the question of whether they have a public safety crisis.

Chicago has plenty of crime and plenty of bad neighborhoods, but as a whole, it is not one of the more violent cities. It is not in the top 20 in murder rate, and its murder rate is half of Baltimore's.

Democratic politicians and the New York Times have responded to Trump's attacks on Chicago and LA by saying Republican-run states are more dangerous.

Birmingham, St. Louis, and Memphis are the three deadliest cities, measured by murders per capita. That these are all cities in red states is a source of smirking pleasure for the news media. (All three, though, have Democratic mayors.)

When Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R-AR) criticized the homeless problems and the immigration riots in Los Angeles, California Gov. Gavin Newsom — a Democrat who wants to run for president in 2028 — has fired back that both states have higher crime rates than his.

Louisiana, the home state of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), is also coming under scrutiny for its high crime.

These Democratic retorts are true.

Louisiana's murder rate is 7.9, Arkansas's is 7.2, and Oklahoma's sits at 6.2 — all higher than California's 4.2 or New York's 2.6.

Likewise, the largest cities in these states — New Orleans, Little Rock, and Oklahoma City — all have higher murder rates than LA or NYC, by a lot.

Why? It's hard to say, except that southern cities are much more segregated, creating more neighborhoods of concentrated poverty, fatherlessness, and general disorder. Also, Los Angeles and New York City have massive pockets of wealth — both extremely rich areas and upper-middle-class neighborhoods — that drive down the per-capita crime rates.

Different ways of measuring crime and safety turn up different results.

IN FOCUS: DO DEMOCRATS WANT THE GOP TO TAKE OVER THEIR CITIES?

For instance, one recent study found that the three most dangerous neighborhoods were all in LA, and No. 4 was in San Francisco.

So there are many ways to slice all the data on crime in U.S. cities. The fairest way to summarize it would be this: Crime in D.C., like crime in other major U.S. cities, has fallen dramatically in the last two years, but it still higher than it was 12 or 15 years ago — and this is true in both Republican and Democratic states.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

After a summer where Ethereum significantly outperformed Bitcoin, a shifting dynamic unfolded in early September, with institutional players pouring capital into Bitcoin ETFs while Ethereum ETFs were hit with outflows.

Does this indicate that Ether will start underperforming, or is this a volatile moment before another explosive ETH rally? Ethereum price predictions suggest that the latter may be true, with analysts anticipating big gains ahead in the remainder of 2025.

As such, traders are actively searching for the best altcoins to buy to capitalize on Ethereum's momentum. That's because ETH's growth typically indicates that investors are risk-on, which drives liquidity into smaller projects that can rally much faster.

So let's examine altcoins that could deliver the biggest returns. We'll consider Ethereum's current outlook and the potential impact on market dynamics, as well as altcoin use cases, investor sentiment, and tokenomics.

Ethereum may have experienced some selling this week with a 5.2% loss over the past seven days, but its fundamental outlook remains bullish. Analyst Ali Martinez notes that $2.10 billion worth of tokens have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges in the past week, reflecting a shift to long-term holdings. Meanwhile, the leading ETH treasury company BitMine continues to buy, with a $65 million purchase on Thursday.

Although ETFs may have experienced outflows in early September, treasury buys and exchange withdrawals are more reliable long-term indicators, suggesting that ETH's higher-time-frame outlook remains strong.

Technical analysts also remain bullish, with Kamran Ashgar predicting ETH could rally to $13,000 by the end of 2026, pointing to a “fair value gap” – a price imbalance caused by strong directional movement.

Meanwhile, the analyst Altcoin Gordon predicts that ETH could reach $15,000 in 2025, citing the asset's historical correlation with the M2 money supply as support for his thesis.

$ETH is $15,000 token trading at $4,400.

While these predictions are ambitious, Ethereum's whale interest and summer momentum – coupled with factors like rising on-chain activity – signal that the $13,000 to $15,000 range is certainly possible if bullish catalysts align.

If Ethereum rallies, it could also unlock a broader altcoin season, potentially allowing strong low-cap alternatives to rise faster and give far bigger gains. With that in mind, here are our top picks for the best altcoins to buy now.

Best Wallet Token is a utility token that powers the multichain crypto wallet Best Wallet. The project features a wide range of built-in tools, including a cross-chain DEX, a presale aggregator, a crypto debit card, a futures trading platform, and more. It also offers fiat on and off-ramping, allowing users to transfer money directly from their bank accounts to a crypto wallet without needing a centralized exchange.

The project supports Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, XRP, Cardano, and many other networks. This helps eliminate the cross-chain bridging issue, which has long hindered the on-chain user experience.



 

All this indicates that Best Wallet is on track to become a leading infrastructure tool in the DeFi space, potentially rivaling platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet.

BEST is currently in a presale, having raised over $15.5 million to date, indicating strong market interest. With ongoing presale momentum and a solid use case, Best Wallet Token could become one of the top altcoins to benefit from Ethereum's growth.

Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer 2 blockchain built on Bitcoin, aiming to expand what's possible with the world's largest cryptocurrency. Traditionally, Bitcoin's average network capacity of approximately seven transactions per second means it is mostly used for storing value rather than handling active payments.

What if Bitcoin could do more? Instead of merely serving as a hedge against inflation and a long-term investment, what if it could become a secure settlement layer for digital transactions worldwide? Bitcoin Hyper aims to turn this vision into a reality.



 

Its Layer 2 network uses ZK-rollups to bundle transactions and report back to Bitcoin's main layer, enabling blistering scalability while maintaining Bitcoin's security features. The project also leverages the Solana Virtual Machine for execution, unlocking smart contract capabilities and potential interoperability with Solana.

HYPER is also available for purchase in its ongoing presale, which has already raised over $14 million. The project averages around $200,000 in daily inflows – a clear sign of strong demand and potential price growth once it hits exchanges.

PEPENODE is a new Pepe-themed crypto on the Ethereum blockchain, touted as the world's first Mine-to-Earn meme coin. Bitcoin mining opened new possibilities for rewards through collective participation in securing the network – and PEPENODE brings mining rewards to the meme economy without requiring expensive hardware, high energy costs, or technical skills.

The project's team is creating a Web3 game where users can build their own virtual mining rigs and earn real meme coin rewards. They start with an empty server room and fill it with Miner Nodes, which can be upgraded to boost mining power, allowing them to earn more rewards.



 

70% of tokens spent on Miner Node upgrades will be burned, creating deflation that can help the PEPENODE price increase over time. This blend of deflationary tokenomics, gamification, engaging user experiences, and real crypto rewards could make PEPENODE one of the best altcoins to buy.

PEPENODE is currently available for purchase during its early presale stages, having raised over $600,000 so far. While this indicates community support, it also leaves plenty of room for growth.

Oops, something went wrong

Christian Catalini, co-creator of Facebook's Libra project, warned on Friday that Stripe's Tempo and Circle's Arc could succeed commercially but at the cost of crypto's decentralization ideal.

Launched in 2019, Libra was Meta's bold bid to create a global digital currency backed by a basket of stable assets. The project promised to make payments as seamless as messaging, but it triggered immediate backlash from regulators concerned about financial sovereignty, systemic risk, and user privacy. By 2022, Libra — renamed Diem in a bid to reset its image — was shuttered and its assets sold off.

Catalini, who served as Libra's chief economist, used his Sept. 5 thread on X to revisit the project's early compromises and explain why they matter now. He said the original open design, developed with Harvard economist Scott Kominers, was reduced to a short appendix after months of regulatory negotiations.

The first major retreat, he wrote, was abandoning non-custodial wallets. Regulators insisted on a “clear perimeter,” meaning a responsible intermediary they could contact — and penalize — if problems arose.

For supervisors used to intermediated finance, a world where users truly held their own money was unmanageable. “For them, killing self-custody wasn't a choice, it was an obvious necessity,” he recalled.

Catalini noted the irony: today, open networks are developing compliance tools native to blockchain that could have addressed these concerns more effectively than traditional frameworks. But back then, Libra was forced to strip away decentralization, a change he described as an early signal of where corporate-led projects were heading.

His broader lesson was stark: “As long as there is a single throat to choke — or a committee of them — you can't truly rewire the system. Worse, any network with an architect is living on borrowed time.”

Catalini placed Stripe's Tempo and Circle's Arc in that context. Both are new blockchains designed explicitly for payments, promoted as stablecoin-first infrastructure for enterprises and fintechs.

Circle launched Arc on Aug. 12, presenting it as a Layer-1 network purpose-built for stablecoin finance. Unlike public chains that rely on volatile gas tokens, Arc uses USDC for fees, offering predictable, dollar-denominated costs.

It integrates a built-in foreign exchange engine, promises sub-second finality, and includes opt-in privacy features. Circle said Arc will support cross-border payments, onchain credit systems, tokenized capital markets and programmable, automated payments.

Just weeks later, Stripe and Paradigm unveiled Tempo on Sept. 4, describing it as a payments-first blockchain capable of handling over 100,000 transactions per second.

The network is EVM-compatible, features a dedicated payments lane with support for memos and access lists, and allows users to pay both transactions and gas in any stablecoin. Stripe said early design partners include Visa, Deutsche Bank, Revolut, Nubank, Shopify, OpenAI, Anthropic and DoorDash.

Both projects were marketed as steps toward mainstreaming stablecoin payments. But for Catalini, they raised a deeper concern.

Catalini argued that corporate-led chains like Arc and Tempo risk simply rebuilding the old financial system with new players in charge. Instead of displacing card networks and banks, he warned, they could elevate fintech giants to the same position of dominance. “The throne will have new occupants, but it will be the same throne,” he wrote.

He also predicted such networks would fracture geopolitically, with Western and Eastern blocs unlikely to share a single corporate-led infrastructure. The result, he said, would be competing financial empires rather than the borderless system crypto's early advocates envisioned.

Ultimately, Catalini described Stripe's Tempo as a “referendum on the ghost of Libra.” If it thrives, he suggested, it may prove Libra failed because of timing, not design — and show that the dream of open, permissionless money has been overtaken by more pragmatic, centralized solutions.

The Rio PGJ is boasting that crypto tracking is a crucial tool that is changing crime and asset investigations across the country.

The Prosecutor-General of Justice (PGJ) of Rio de Janeiro, Antonio Jose Campos Moreira, proclaimed a significant breakthrough on the criminal scene by applying the technology of cryptocurrency tracking. 

He delivered the speech at the 6th regular session of the National Council of Prosecutors-General of Justice (CNPG), which was in Tiradentes, Minas Gerais.

This is a new tool, which can be used to trace virtual assets with high precision even on blockchains. 

The technology is essential in addressing the laundering of illegal finances by criminal groups. Moreira called it a game-changer in an investigation.


Moreira pointed out that the tool is not only useful when it comes to criminal investigations. It is also useful in bankruptcy and recovery in courts of law. 

This technology also helps in family wrangles, in which it is reported that cryptocurrencies are being hidden. 

Cases like these can give insights into an effort to hide assets, and this has been hard to uncover in the past. Moreira said this resource improves the level of our operations. It increases the effectiveness of research. 

The tool offers more insight than ever into digital financial flows that were formerly opaque and hard to read.


The Public Ministry of Rio signed a partnership contract with an American corporation. The acquisition provides 1 year of free access to one of the most popular cryptocurrency trackers, which is already used in the US and Europe. 

This collaboration makes Rio one of the pioneer states of Brazil that implements this high-tech resource.

The project is indicative of the desire of the Public Ministry to incorporate the latest intelligence gadgets in its operations.

 It preconditions a further refined tracing of assets and dissolution of transnational criminal networks based on cryptocurrencies.

Another significant emphasis that Moreira made was the need to reach out to other state Public Ministries in their efforts. 

It is a CNPG agreement that will facilitate common access to such tools throughout Brazil. This collaboration is meant to save money and also facilitate uniformity in investigations in the country.


PGJ is also a proponent of alternative dispute resolutions. He considers autocomposition to be an essential way of lessening court congestion. 

Moreira points out that a negotiated agreement between parties that fulfill their lowest interest is usually better than a protracted lawsuit that is not decided. In his view, one of the causes of these solutions is the Public Ministry.

Brazil recognizes cryptocurrencies as an economic instrument, not as currency. It is regulated, AML-compliant, and taxed. Such a legal framework favors the deployment of blockchain tracking technologies in law enforcement. Latest activities in Brazil have already demonstrated that blockchain tracing is effective. 

As an example, law enforcement agencies have recently broken the trail of large money laundering schemes and managed to freeze millions of crypto assets with the same technique

The implementation of this technology by Rio is a definite move to bring justice into a new age. The Public Ministry of the state is taking the leadership role in innovative ways of fighting crime. 

The crypto tracing plus collaborative institutional approach will yield greater effective outcomes against sophisticated financial offenses.","{'href': 'https://www.livebitcoinnews.com', 'title': 'Live Bitcoin News'}","cryptocurrency"

Stablecoin adoption among retail users has set new records this year, with transaction volumes through August already exceeding last year's total, a fresh report by CEX.io said.

Retail-sized transfers, counting transactions under $250, crossed $5.84 billion in August alone, the highest ever recorded, according to data by Visa and Allium cited in the report. With nearly four months left in the year, 2025 has already become the busiest period yet for stablecoin transfer volume at the consumer level.

The figures underscore stablecoins, a group of cryptos tied to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, becoming increasingly embedded into everyday financial activity, from cross-border remittances to microtransactions, the report pointed out.

Survey data from emerging markets, asking over 2,600 consumer in Nigeria, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Indonesia, reinforced this picture, CEX.io analysts. A majority of respondents said they turned to stablecoins to avoid high banking fees and slow transfers, the report said. Nearly 70% of them reported using stablecoins more frequently than last year, and more than three-quarters expect usage to keep rising, the report said.

The distribution of activity among blockchains have shifted, the report noted. The Tron TRX$0.3359 blockchain, traditionally popular for retail transfers due to its low fees and wide support for Tether's USDT (USDT), has given up market share. Monthly transaction counts fell by 1.3 million, or 6%, and its growth in volume lagged behind its closest competitors.

In its place, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) emerged as the top choice for retail users, capturing nearly 40% of retail stablecoin activity, the report said. The network's transaction count jumped 75% this year with transfer volume rising 67%. Much of the momentum came after Binance delisted USDT in March for European users and a resurgence of memecoin trading on PancakeSwap on BSC.

The Ethereum complex, with the base chain and layer-2 networks combined, made up over 20% of transfer volume and 31% of transaction counts, the report noted. While small transfers largely took place on L2s, the mainnet enjoyed a significant rise in the retail segment. Sub-$250 transfers on the mainnet rose 81% in volume and 184% in count.

Ethereum has been mostly used for large-value transactions due to its high fees, but transaction costs have dropped more than 70% over the past year, making mainnet transactions more competitive even in the sub-$250 range, the authors said.

 Ripple is done fighting the SEC, meaning it can focus on its original goal: challenging SWIFT, the world's money transfer system. 

Ripple has finally finished its legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission, bringing legal clarity to its underlying coin, XRP (XRP). Now observers are asking whether XRP can finally focus on providing a viable alternative to SWIFT.

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) has been the backbone of international money transfers since its founding in 1973. However, for several years, critics have said that the system is outdated.

Many in the blockchain industry, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, argue that blockchain technology provides higher throughput and better transparency, making it a superior alternative to SWIFT.

Now that Ripple's legal battles have calmed down, can it provide a reasonable alternative to SWIFT?

Over 50 years ago, SWIFT replaced Telex as the coding system underpinning worldwide financial transactions. The system does not send money itself but rather provides standardized codes and a secure messaging platform through which banks can coordinate money transfers.

A customer will make a money transfer request. Their bank will then send the request to the recipient bank, and that request may go through several other banks in the network. Actual settlement happens through established banking relationships and clearing systems.

SWIFT processes over 53 million messages daily across 40,000 payment routes, 220 countries and over 11,500 institutions.

But there are some major complaints with SWIFT. Transactions can take several days and are rife with fees. Furthermore, the complex network of bank partners means it is more difficult to ensure visibility.

There are also delays and failures. SWIFT said in January 2024 that one in 10 transactions fails, while one in 20 settles late. 

The network has undergone a number of upgrades since its inception, including ISO 20022, which aims to provide clearer payment data and more transparency by Nov. 25, 2025. Still, critics claim it is ultimately outdated “legacy” tech running on decades-old XML technology.

SWIFT may have the advantage of ubiquity and clear institutional adoption, but Ripple offers a clear advantage in technological terms, with faster transaction and settlement speeds, as well as lower costs.

In 2018, just a couple of years before Ripple's years-long legal battle with the SEC would begin, Garlinghouse told Bloomberg, “What we're doing and executing on a day-by-day basis is, in fact, taking over SWIFT” as banks and remittance companies signed on to use XRP Ledger.

So, with institutional partners signing on and the XRP price on a tear over the last year, what's stopping Ripple's ledger from challenging SWIFT?

Cassie Craddock, managing director for UK and Europe at Ripple, told Cointelegraph, “We don't see blockchain as an opportunity to replace legacy rails, rather a way of augmenting and modernizing the existing financial infrastructure, creating opportunities for greater efficiency and interoperability.”

Still, “scaling to the level of traditional providers requires tackling two key hurdles: usability and regulation.”

Regarding regulation, Ripple was, until recently, part of a particularly high-profile court case.

In December 2020, the SEC under Chairman Jay Clayton sued Ripple Labs for failing to register its XRP tokens as securities under US law. The commission alleged that the company and its executives raised capital through unregistered securities sales. What followed was an expensive, years-long court battle.

In 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that the programmatic sales of XRP did not require securities registration, but that its XPR sales to institutional investors did. The court didn't issue its final $125-million civil penalty to Ripple until August 2024.

By October, Ripple and the SEC had filed respective appeals, but following the election of US President Donald Trump and the realignment of the SEC's priorities for crypto, both parties finally agreed to drop their case in early August 2025.

The case may have hampered XRP adoption in the US, but during the case, it signed partnerships with institutions in numerous other jurisdictions around the globe. Furthermore, the case gives XRP specifically unique legal clarity — something few cryptocurrencies can boast.

However, legal clarity may not be enough for Ripple to overtake the world's largest payments network, as banks themselves must be convinced to change how they operate.

Pseudonymous software engineer and blockchain proponent Vincent Van Code said that platforms using SWIFT “process billions daily, but they are rigid, costly, and deeply siloed. A core replacement can take 5–7 years and hundreds of millions of dollars—an enormous operational risk.”

They said that banks don't change their systems because “every bank already ‘speaks SWIFT,' making it the safest, cheapest option. Even initiatives like SWIFT GPI are just patches on a nearly 50-year-old foundation.”

Van Code concluded that Ripple has to contend with fragile legacy cores and “uneven” global regulation and assuage risk-averse banks — all while countering perceptions about its underlying token's liquidity. 

“SWIFT's ubiquity is its moat, and breaking that network effect will take time.”

Craddock said that “institutions need tools that feel familiar,” and that new regulations, particularly the GENIUS Act, are a “step toward clear rules that give institutions confidence to adopt blockchain in a compliant way.”

“Stablecoins like Ripple USD are helping bridge this gap — they're simple to understand, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar and behave like cash in digital form. That familiarity is why we're seeing traditional financial players increasingly comfortable using crypto and blockchain tech today.”

It's unclear whether Ripple can take on SWIFT in the future, overcoming the entrenched business practices of the banking sector and less-than-enthusiastic regulators.

However, crypto is ascendant in the US, where lawmakers are making carveouts for digital assets to fulfill critical roles in the traditional finance system. Congress has clearly expressed its preference for the proliferation of private stablecoins over a digital dollar or central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Congress has not outright banned a CBDC, but it has created a law whereby only the legislature can create one, excluding the Federal Reserve or commercial entities. At the same time, it passed the GENIUS Act, which gives clear rules for stablecoin issuers.

In March, after the SEC dropped its investigation into Ripple, Garlinghouse told Fox News that “the market opportunity is massive” in the US and said that there's an opportunity to modernize the payment systems from SWIFT.

“The Trump effect is profound [...] you're gonna see that in the adoption of these [blockchain] technologies.”

In a tech landscape fixated on the question, “How much time can AI save you?” Fellou‘s founder and CEO Dominic Xie thinks that's exactly the wrong approach.

“That question is a trap,” he asserts in a recent interview. “Measuring AI by minutes saved just makes us run faster on the same treadmill. The real, transformative value of AI is its power to serve as a ‘cognitive lever'—a tool that expands how we think, create, and solve complex problems.”

This core philosophy drives Fellou. The Silicon Valley company is launching Fellou CE (Concept Edition), an AI browser built not just for viewing the web, but for executing complex web and desktop-based cross-app tasks on it.

While the first wave of AI gave us chatbots that could answer questions, Fellou is pioneering what it sees as the far larger opportunity: an Agentic AI browser that gets things done.

It's a bold move to redefine the browser from a passive window into an autonomous AI partner, aiming to end the era of digital drudgery and, as Xie puts it, “unleash the infinite individual.”

We are living in a paradox of productivity. Five centuries ago, Leonardo da Vinci could invent, paint, and conduct research with a single set of tools. Today, we've become a high-priced, carbon-based API between our own applications.

A single objective, like producing a competitive analysis report, splinters into a dozen tabs, logins, and a mind-numbing sequence of manual work. We are not knowledge workers; we are human middleware.

“The ‘Do It Yourself' method is fundamentally broken for the complexity of the digital world,” says Xie, a 2021 Forbes U30 Asia honoree who saw this inefficiency firsthand. “We are being held captive by the very tools meant to empower us. Our vision for this AI browser began with a simple idea: what if you had a partner that could understand your intent and act with you to make it a reality? That's the entire principle behind ‘Act With Fellou.'”

This vision is brought to life through concrete use cases that feel like a glimpse into the future of browsing.

Instead of spending a day hunting for opportunities, a user can simply tell Fellou, “Analyze my LinkedIn profile and find 10 suitable Head of Product roles in San Francisco, then apply with the tailored resume on my desktop.”

Fellou doesn't just return a list of links. AI agents autonomously navigates multiple sites, intelligently parses job requirements against the user's skills, accesses the local file, and executes the multi-step application process.

Critically, this isn't a black box. Fellou gives you ultimate, real-time control to intervene and approve each step of these agentic workflows. This simple but powerful shift elevates your role from “doing the work” to “directing the outcome.”

Fellou's innovation is not just integrating AI features; it's a deep exploration of the future paradigm of human-computer interaction. The company is building what it calls a “Seamless Continuum of Experience,” which it believes is its true technical moat and market potential. 

That continuum rests on three pillars:

This deep, philosophical approach to product design is what positions Fellou to lead the next wave of AI. The market is rapidly evolving from conversation to execution.

The first wave, dominated by LLMs like those from OpenAI and Anthropic, proved that AI could understand and generate human language. The next, and arguably much larger, market will be built on agents that can reliably perform tasks in the wild.

“Chat was the ‘hello, world' moment for mainstream AI,” Xie explains. “The agentic era is the ‘get to work' moment.”

As the world's first Agentic AI Browser, Fellou is built for this new era. It upgrades the browser into an autonomous partner that eliminates the tedious “grunt work,” freeing people to focus on what really matters: thinking, creating, and making smarter decisions.

This is where Fellou sees its massive potential. By embedding its powerful Eko 2.0 automation engine—the engine that powers the Seamless Continuum—Fellou bypasses the need for brittle, third-party integration tools.

This engine is not just theoretical; the company claims it achieves an 80% success rate on the complex Online-Mind2web benchmark, a figure that significantly outperforms competitors.

With over 1,000,000 users already using the platform, Fellou has found a powerful resonance in the market. This early traction suggests a deep hunger for tools that don't just add another layer of chat, but that actually removes layers of work.

Xie's long-term vision isn't just to build a better browser, but to foster an entire ecosystem for agentic AI. Central to this is Agent Studio, a marketplace where developers can build, share, and monetize specialized AI agents.

This strategy aims to create a virtuous cycle: developers contribute agents for specific verticals, while user engagement provides the feedback loop for continuous improvement.

“We're building a platform for distributed intelligence,” Xie states. “Our goal is to give every person the ability to operate and create across domains with a capability that was once reserved for rare geniuses. In the past, being a polymath was a privilege. Today, Fellou gives everyone that creative superpower.”

“Privacy is non-negotiable in that vision, which is why we champion a local-first, on-device execution model. Your most sensitive data never needs to leave your machine.”

As Fellou CE launches to the public today, it represents a significant step toward this future. The new version deepens the browser's ability to act as a true partner. For instance, the aforementioned Agentic Memory forms the backbone of the Memory Continuum.

To foster trust and user control, Transparent Sparks Usage gives a clear, upfront estimate of the credits needed for any complex action. And to truly offload recurring work, Scheduled Task Execution allows users to automate digital chores.

These are just a few of the enhancements in the new release, with many more capabilities waiting for users to discover as they explore Fellou CE.

“We believe the best form of human-computer symbiosis is a partnership where the AI helps us reclaim our focus and gives us the courage to pursue our biggest ideas,” Xie concludes.

It's an ambitious vision for the humble browser. But if Fellou is right, it could be the vessel for the next renaissance in human creativity.

Last week's disappointing jobs report showed U.S. job growth stalled significantly in August, with just 22,000 new jobs added, and an unemployment rate that has risen to 4.3%.

It was the worst August report since the pandemic and the market treated it accordingly, welcoming it for the potential rate cuts it may herald but wary of the slower growth it may portend.

“The labor market is showing signs of cracking,” Heather Long, Navy Federal Credit Union senior economist, wrote in a note to investors on Thursday. “It's not a red siren alarm yet, but the signs keep growing that businesses are starting to cut workers.”

Recent employment data confirms an increasingly uneven landscape within the technology sector, reflecting a shift away from the rapid job growth that characterized the early post-pandemic years.

According to a recent analysis by research think tank CompTIA, the sector has experienced a net decline of approximately 2,700 jobs over the past year, a 0.1% decrease.

This contrasts sharply with the period from late 2020 through 2022, when tech companies collectively added over 628,400 jobs across 29 months.

However, the last two years have seen almost 100,000 of those positions cut, indicating a recalibration amid the broader economic and geopolitical shifts.

“Unevenness in the data means acknowledging the employers and job seekers struggling with a multitude of challenges but also recognizing it is not all doom and gloom,” Tim Herbert, chief research officer, CompTIA, said. “Hiring intent data continues to show employers pursuing tech talent across a range of disciplines, from AI and data science to tech support and cloud engineering.”

The hottest spot for hiring was unsurprisingly in the AI skills job listings, which leapt 94% year-over-year according to CompTIA's AI Hiring Intent Index.

For job postings themselves, 16% were for workers with eight or more years of experience; 21% for workers in the zero to three year range; and almost a third were for workers with four to seven years of experience.

Who is hiring and where is also an interesting standout.

Large tech companies showed signs of large hiring sprees: Software publishers like Microsoft and Oracle have collectively added 16,100 jobs in the past year, signaling ongoing strength in areas linked to cloud computing and enterprise software.

But other marquee-name companies like computer-systems designers such as IBM and Booz Allen Hamilton have shed 28,800 roles, reflecting a tilt toward automation and project-specific staffing.

“Only three states, Maine, Delaware and Idaho, saw tech job postings increase in August. In each instance, the increase was less than 100 new postings,” the report found.

“The story was similar at the metro level, with just four markets recording growth. San Jose saw an increase of 127 job postings, from 5,808 in July to 5,935 in August. Little Rock had the biggest percentage increase (+ 10%) in job postings, from 987 in July to 1,090 in August.”

Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, attributes this trend to increased corporate investment in technology infrastructure and automation rather than direct employment.

“Companies are investing in technology instead of human capital,” she notes in the report.

While some segments remain resilient, the disparate nature of job growth is clear.

The CompTIA analysis underscores the broader narrative of an industry undergoing structural transformation, shifting gears from hiring sprees to strategic investments in technology.

As firms prioritize capital over traditional labor, questions about the future of tech employment and how the workforce can adapt to these changes remain central for policymakers and industry leaders alike. For more details, consult the full report at Morningstar here.

The divergence in employment trends within the tech sector highlights a fundamental shift in how companies are approaching growth.

The slower hiring rate and outright layoffs suggest that firms are reassessing their workforce strategies, likely driven by economic uncertainties, geopolitical tensions, and an intensifying focus on automation and AI.

This trend mirrors broader economic patterns, where companies seek to optimize efficiency and reduce reliance on human labor in areas where technology can provide cost-effective solutions.

Moreover, the sector's uneven employment landscape indicates that not all technology subsectors are impacted equally. Software publishing and cloud-based services, exemplified by Microsoft and Oracle, continue to grow, driven by demand for digital transformation and remote work solutions.

These companies are capitalizing on the necessity for scalable, cloud-based infrastructures, which require ongoing talent acquisition. Meanwhile, hardware-centric or systems integration firms are trimming headcount, perhaps due to supply chain disruptions, or as they shift toward more automated, project-based work models.

HARRISON, N.J. — The U.S. men's national team got shredded and beaten by South Korea in yet another sad friendly on Saturday at Sports Illustrated Stadium.

The USMNT lost to the Koreans, 2-0, in what was at times an even game. But in the 18th minute, Son Heung-min snuck behind USMNT debutant Tristan Blackmon and scored the evening's opening goal.

In the 43rd, with the U.S. midfield all out of whack, the Americans once again lost Son, who combined on the edge of the box with a teammate and teed up Lee Dong-gyeong for a second.

At the other end of the pitch, Christian Pulisic returned to the U.S. starting lineup. Playing on the right, with Tim Weah on the left, he was reasonably active, and combined a few times with another returnee, Sergiño Dest.

But overall, the USMNT was toothless and lifeless. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino's experiments — including Blackmon, a 29-year-old MLS journeyman, at center back; and Sebastian Berhalter in midfield — were exposed as moves that probably shouldn't be repeated.

All of this happened in front of a pro-Korea crowd, the latest in a long line of evidence that many attendees at USMNT matches are more enthusiastic about opponents than they are about this national team. Korean players received the louder reception when they appeared for pregame warmups. Korean flags big and small were draped over seats, waving in the air, and surrounding one lone U.S. supporters section. Korean chants were the soundtrack of the first half.

The second half brought more of the same. Korea returned to the field still on the front foot, with Son running in behind Blackmon and Tim Ream. The U.S. midfield — Berhalter, Tyler Adams and Diego Luna — often couldn't get close to the ball. Communication, or at least coordination of the press, seemed lacking.

In attack, Josh Sargent's nearly six-year goal drought for the national team continued. And to make matters worse, in the 61st minute, Weah went down with an apparent right leg injury. (After the match, Pochettino indicated Weah was cramping and not seriously hurt.) Alex Freeman replaced him, and Pochettino went to a three-center-back setup, with Freeman and Max Arfsten as wingbacks. But the rhythm and tilt of the game hardly changed. The USMNT's only clear-cut chances came in second-half stoppage time, when Korean goalkeeper Jo Hyeon-woo twice denied Folarin Balogun from close range.

The U.S. is now winless in its last five A-team games against non-CONCACAF opposition. It will travel to Columbus, Ohio, for a game against Japan on Tuesday.

Here's a deeper look at the latest USMNT setback:

It did not take long for Pochettino's continued tinkering with the U.S. roster nine months out from the World Cup to impact the game.

Pochettino summoned Blackmon, a Vancouver Whitecaps center back, into this camp for his first international cap. Pochettino said earlier this week that he and the staff wanted to see how he would, “deal being involved in the national team,” but it was a questionable decision considering the timing and Blackmon's age and level. Blackmon is a solid defender in MLS, but isn't a clear upgrade over players like Mark McKenzie and Walker Zimmerman, both of whom have far more experience on the international stage. At his more advanced age, he's also a different case from Noahkai Banks, the 18-year-old summoned by Pochettino who the Argentine said could grow into a top player this year with Augsburg in the German Bundesliga.

Pochettino threw Blackmon right into the mix, giving him the start over Chris Richards in the back line. It didn't take long for him to be exposed.

Less than 18 minutes into the game, Blackmon stepped forward toward the ball and lost track of Son, the Korean captain and Tottenham legend, over his left shoulder. Lee Jae-sung fed Son into the space behind him, and the LAFC star easily finished over Matt Freese's left shoulder to put the Koreans in front.

The goal will only add more concern and question marks around Pochettino's approach to the roster building as time ticks down toward the World Cup. The Argentine manager said September would be a last chance to see some new faces for the U.S. team, but the U.S. looked outmatched in quality against Korea. It will also only pile more pressure onto Pochettino to start crafting his team by working players like Weston McKennie, Malik Tillman and Antonee Robinson back into the starting group, while also bringing on and developing players like Johnny Cardoso, Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris and McKenzie to reinforce the depth.

Former U.S. men's national team captain Michael Bradley was honored before the game in his native New Jersey. Bradley, who retired in 2023, had 151 international caps, third-most in USMNT history behind Cobi Jones and Landon Donovan, and captained the U.S. 48 times.

Bradley, who now coaches New York Red Bulls II, spoke glowingly about his time with the U.S. and the thrill of playing in World Cups when “you genuinely feel like the world stops” and watches you. When asked about the pressure facing a U.S. team ahead of a World Cup, Bradley pointed to Landon Donovan's goal against Algeria and Tim Howard's record 15-save performance against Belgium as moments that got the entire country behind the team.

“Every person kind of internalizes the pressure in a different way, right? It's a World Cup, you play for the national team. There's always some level of pressure,” Bradley said. “But for a lot of guys, it's not pressure, it's excitement. It gives you energy. It's why you play. When you're six years old and playing in your backyard, you dream of playing in a World Cup. And so when you finally get that opportunity, sure, there's nerves, there's butterflies — you wouldn't be human if those things weren't there. But again, there's pride and there's excitement, and that gives you energy.

“And the part then of what it means to represent the national team, what it means to put on that jersey, and what hopefully these guys will be able to feel, is that the team, and the way that the team plays, has so much power. When the spotlight comes on brightest and the whistle blows next summer and those guys step on the field and pour their heart and soul into the game and play and compete and give everything they have for each other, and play football in a way that anybody in our country who's watching looks at them and says, ‘That's our team.' The power of that is amazing.”

On one hand, this was a friendly — a September friendly overshadowed by college football, played by an understrength USMNT, and likely forgotten by fans in a few months.

But on the other, it was the start of a World Cup year — a year already marked by apathy and widespread skepticism of Pochettino and his players. After Saturday, doubts will deepen. And pressure will intensify ahead of Tuesday's game against Japan.

It is, of course, another friendly. But Pochettino has lost significant leeway to tinker. He and the USMNT have lost the benefit of the doubt. In normal circumstances, they would not be expected to beat Japan — arguably the best team Pochettino's U.S. will have faced. Now, they almost have to get a result to avoid immense pressure coming out of the September window. If they don't, their struggles will start to approach a pre-World Cup crisis.

U.S. men's national team great Michael Bradley joked that he didn't need all the attention on him Saturday.

The team honored the American soccer great prior to kickoff of its friendly against South Korea at Sports Illustrated Stadium, a short drive away from Bradley's hometown of Princeton, N.J. 

Still, it was a special moment for Bradley to be able to share with his family.

“New Jersey has always been home. You know, football has taken me a lot of places throughout the world, but whenever people ask where's home, it's still, it's still New Jersey,” Bradley said Saturday. “It's special to be here in this stadium and to have the opportunity now to have a day like this. Honestly, it's even more so for my family, for the people that supported me along the way, for the people that I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them.

“Honestly, for any of you who know me, I'm excited, but I don't need [the celebration], but for the people who love me and for the people who have supported me every step of my career, then it's nice to share with them.”

Bradley retired from professional play in 2023 and quietly entered the coaching ranks, which eventually led to him being hired as the Red Bulls II coach earlier this year. His name remains one of the most prominent in USMNT history.

Bradley is the third most-capped player in the team's history with 151 appearances — including starting every match for the U.S. during the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. He ranks second all time for the national team in assists with 23.

He also served as captain in 48 of the 141 matches that he started with the USMNT, which rubbed off on a number of players still in the program. That list includes center back Tim Ream, who served as captain Saturday night against South Korea and previously played with Bradley on the national team.

“Just watching him, and knowing how professional he was, and the leadership that he showed from all the time that we were together, is something that I always left camp in awe of, really,” Ream said earlier this week. “I tried to use that when I would leave, and still trying to use those examples.”

Bradley had been around the national team a bit this week while they were training in New Jersey at the Red Bulls' facility and said that it was good to see so much soccer happening at the facility, with the two Red Bull squads and the USMNT training all in one place.

However, he didn't feel the need to impart any wisdom while crossing paths.

“Generally speaking, these guys don't need me telling them what to do,” Bradley said, before expressing confidence in the direction of the program.

“They're going in a good way,” he continued. “They'll continue to find the right ways to push themselves, push each other as they get closer to the World Cup. And for me, it's in little ways when I can help and support and engage them a little bit. Of course, I do.”

Jude Bellingham has received a major boost in his recovery from shoulder surgery, with Real Madrid insisting on a ‘zero risk' approach to his return.

Bellingham, 22, has been carrying a shoulder injury for over a year after suffering a dislocation against Rayo Vallecano in November 2023.

The England international decided to finally address the issue and go under the knife after Real Madrid's FIFA Club World Cup campaign.

Initial reports had suggested that he won't return to action until the end of October, but he is now looking likely to return sooner than initially expected.

According to Marca, Bellingham is preparing to return to training on Monday (September 8), a significant step towards pulling that famous white shirt on again.

The report adds that Real Madrid are maintaining a ‘zero risk' policy, however, and will not rush the central midfielder back.","{'href': 'https://www.tribalfootball.com', 'title': 'TribalFootball'}","soccer"

Thomas Tuchel reacts to England's 2-0 win over Andorra in their World Cup qualifier and reflects on the team's progress. (1:56)

The Football Association of Serbia has appealed to fans ""to send out an image to the world that will make us all proud"" in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against England.

The crunch Group K qualifier will be held in Belgrade at the Rajko Mitic Stadium, where the capacity will be reduced by 15 per cent -- approximately 8,100 seats -- due to fan behaviour against Andorra in June.

The Football Association of Serbia (FSS) was also fined 50,000 Swiss Francs ($62.600) by FIFA as punishment for: ""Discrimination and racist abuse; Order and security at matches; Use of gestures, words, objects or any other means to transmit a message that is not appropriate for a sports event.""

The governing body warned supporters after that punishment was meted out in July that ""any incidents could lead to new draconian FIFA sanctions"", including next month's game against Albania being played at an empty ground.

The FSS has sent another message ahead of England's arrival in Serbia.

""Our players will need strong support from the stands in that match, and the long queues from day one of ticket sales show that the Eagles will have their 12th player,"" it said in a statement.

""Due to all the stated, and above all because the Football Association of Serbia is under UEFA and FIFA scrutiny, as well as the history of various incidents that have made us subject to UEFA and FIFA disciplinary measures -- we appeal to supporters to send out an image to the world that will make us all proud.

""UEFA has long ago proclaimed a list of prohibited items (signs, symbols, flags, sounds, chants, political slogans...) that are subject to sanctions and strict penalties.""

The FSS highlighted that it has been fined €703,400 ($825,000) since 2021 by UEFA and FIFA due to various incidents.

""The national team is our pride, we have no other, and it certainly deserves the support fitting for these important matches,"" the statement continued.

""We would like to emphasise the importance and necessity of proper behaviour that contributes to creating a positive stadium atmosphere.

""Therefore, let us be united in our love for football, support our national team in the right way, and show respect for the opponent and the national anthem of their country.

""Let the match with England be a celebration of sport and respect among rivals and nations.""

The England senior men's team are travelling to Serbia for the first time since it became an independent nation in 2006.

In 2012, UEFA ordered Serbia Under-21s to play a match behind closed doors for ""the improper conduct of its supporters, specifically racist behaviour"" in a European Championship playoff against England in Krusevac.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Northern Ireland have lost their past nine meetings with Germany

Fifa World Cup qualifier: Germany v Northern Ireland

Venue: RheinEnergieStadion, Cologne Date: Sunday, 7 September Kick-off: 19:45 BST

Coverage: Watch live on BBC One NI, BBC Two, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app

Conor Bradley is looking forward to the challenge of facing his new Liverpool team-mate Florian Wirtz when Northern Ireland play Germany in World Cup qualifying on Sunday. 

Wirtz joined the Anfield club from Bayer Leverkusen in a £116m deal in June and has started three Premier League games for Arne Slot's side.

The 22-year-old has yet to share the field with Bradley, whose return from a hamstring injury last month came as a replacement for Wirtz against Newcastle United, but the pair are set to be in direct opposition down the flank at the RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne.

""Florian's a top player. There's a reason we bought him for the money we did,"" said Bradley, whose first Northern Ireland goal came against the Scotland side of Liverpool team-mate Andy Robertson in March 2024.

""He's obviously had a brilliant few years at Leverkusen and now he's come to us, and I think he started the season really well. He's really good with the ball, he's really creative and he's not scared to take a few risks with the ball as well.

""He's a top player and I know it's going to be a difficult night for me but hopefully I can make it a difficult night for him too.""

Having played just 10 minutes for Liverpool this season because of injury, Northern Ireland's win over Luxembourg on Thursday evening represented Bradley's first start of the 2025-26 campaign.

Coming at a time when he would have hoped to stake a claim for the Liverpool right-back berth following Trent Alexander-Arnold's move to Real Madrid, the 22-year-old acknowledged it had been frustrating to start the season on the sidelines. 

""It was really disappointing to pick up the injury when I did,"" he said. 

""Obviously it wasn't a big injury, it was only a few weeks, but it was really disappointing. I'm just happy to be back now.

""I have to show patience and I just have to pace myself through games to make sure I get through them and just look after myself.""

NI will not be 'starstruck' versus reeling Germany

Germany 'always' under pressure - O'Neill

Germany come into Sunday's game off the back of Thursday's surprise 2-0 loss to Slovakia to start their qualifying campaign with Bradley believing it is a result that leaves the race to make it to next year's World Cup from Pool A ""wide open"".

""Shocked, probably, to start with,"" he said of his reaction to hearing news of Slovakia's win after coming off the pitch in Luxembourg. 

""I think you can look at it both ways. I think it's good and bad. Obviously, that means the group's wide open now which is good for us [and] if we can get a positive result it's only good for us.""

Germany's latest loss means it is three defeats on the spin for Julian Nagelsmann's side, but Bradley is in no doubt about the enduring quality of the four-time World Cup winners.

""It's going to be a really difficult test. Germany are one of the top nations in the whole world,"" he added.

""They've got some top players, so it's always nice going up against top players and seeing where you're at compared to them.

""Obviously with the result the other night for them, they're going to be bang at it from the start so we've got to stick together and I think we're in with a good chance.""

7' — TOR! Germany take the lead in Cologne!

Kickoff! — We are off!

Lineups are out! Julian Nagelsmann pretty much sticks to his word based on the team news that came out after the Slovakia game:

Germany got bested by Slovakia in the former's World Cup Qualifying match. Die Mannschaft slumped to a 2-0 loss in Bratislava, which infuriated gaffer Julian Nagelsmann who wanted a better response from his men. He will get the chance to rectify things in their next group match, which will be against Northern Ireland in Cologne.

Germany must finish first to avoid the playoffs early next year; they've still got five matches left and a win against the Green and White Army will be a step in the right direction. Who do you think takes the three points today?

The US men's national team's increasingly uneasy journey to the 2026 FIFA World Cup hit another rut on Saturday, with a 2-0 friendly loss to South Korea that presents more troubling questions for Mauricio Pochettino & Co.

The Yanks have now lost five straight games, and by a combined 11-1 margin, against opponents in the top 25 of the FIFA World Rankings, and border rivals Mexico are the only such side they've defeated since the 2022 World Cup. The USMNT's 2025 record is now a bland 6W-6L-1D, and 9W-6L-1D under Pochettino.

Yet the Argentine head coach struck a defiantly optimistic tone postgame. He pointed to the effects of roster turnover that seem self-imposed, as he continues to evaluate talent with that massive tournament looming just months away, and posited that the program won't enter ‘must-win' territory until the World Cup itself.

“I think overall we were better than South Korea,” said ‘Poch' afterwards. “We create more chances, we have the feeling that we control the game … when you concede after 20 minutes, it was tough, it's difficult, and I think we need to be positive, because I think in the second half, the team played really well.

""We only conceded one shot on target and then the team showed character.

“If I put the result on the side, I am so pleased in the way that we are evolving from the Gold Cup; today with different players, different roster than the Gold Cup, but also the players start to understand what we expect from them. I think the attitude was great.”

The Yanks fell behind early thanks to some trademark excellence from Son Heung-Min, dug themselves a deeper hole just before halftime via Lee Dong-Gyeong's cheeky heel flick, and rarely looked like a threat to turn things around at Sports Illustrated Stadium, home of the New York Red Bulls.

Coach and players alike admitted they couldn't claim to be surprised by how it all unfolded.

“We were starting the game in a very good way, but I think we concede in a way that we should not concede,” Pochettino said postgame.

“We were very focused on working a little during this week, not to give the possibility to run a player like Son into space. And I think the defensive line in the moment that Lee [Jae-Sung, the provider on Son's opener] received the ball on the side, we were so passive, and provided the space to score.”

Pochettino knows the LAFC superstar about as well as any opposing manager possibly could, having worked with him at Tottenham Hotspur from 2015-19. Yet by the time the USMNT got into the locker room to make halftime adjustments, the damage was already done, their visitors methodically exploiting weak points along the Yanks' right flank.

“First half, it was a little bit too easy for them to play through us,” Charlotte FC center back Tim Ream told TNT's postgame show. “Second half, the adjustments that we talked about at halftime, coming out and making sure that we were playing in their half, making sure that we were more compact, not able to play through us as easily and making sure guys were in the right spots.

“So we can take that with us, but at the same time, you have to look at the goals that we conceded and the chances that maybe didn't quite develop for them in the first half, but the danger was there for us to see.”

The USMNT attack grew markedly livelier after the entry of substitutes like Folarin Balogun, Cristian Roldan, Alex Freeman and Alex Zendejas, which might earn them more extensive minutes vs. Japan in Columbus on Tuesday.

A positive result and more cohesive performance at Lower.com Field would do much to calm the nerves of an increasingly concerned USMNT fanbase, which surely hoped the Yanks would look as well-drilled as South Korea did on this occasion.

“You can tell they're a good team that's played a lot together,” said Vancouver Whitecaps FC midfielder Sebastian Berhalter. “They know each other really well and they have quality. If you make little mistakes, they're going to punish you.

“For us, it's about to keep going and to keep building that team chemistry.”","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Slow pit stop sees Norris lose P2 to Piastri

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Italian Grand Prix

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

Max Verstappen has a memorable pole position, but he had to do the fastest lap in 75 years of F1 history to take it. Behind him are the McLarens, and given their run of five straight victories, putting neither car on pole looks a little lacklustre – but the MCL39 thrives when it's presented with a sequence of medium-speed corners to attack, and Monza forgot to order any of those.

Behind the McLarens, Ferrari have looked spritely on home turf, and Charles Leclerc could very easily have been top of the pile, while Lewis Hamilton has some ground to make up after his Zandvoort penalty pushes him down to P10.

Post-session, Verstappen didn't sound hugely confident of maintaining his lead, given the race pace of his rivals in Friday's long runs – but he does have strategic cards to play, with a different tyre allocation to them – and everybody else on the grid – that could be crucial should chaos descend. All to play for then, at the Temple of Speed…

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Slow pit stop sees Norris lose P2 to Piastri

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Italian Grand Prix

McLaren asked Oscar Piastri to give second place back to Lando Norris after his team mate lost ground with a slow pit stop late in the Italian Grand Prix.

Lando Norris has made it clear that he and McLaren would have done “exactly the same thing” if the roles were reversed after team mate Oscar Piastri obeyed team orders in the final stages of the Italian Grand Prix.

In a race dominated by Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, who pitted earlier to swap his starting set of medium tyres for hards, McLaren left it until the closing laps to bring Norris and Piastri in and give them soft rubber.

However, following Piastri's smooth stop on Lap 45 of 53, a slower service for Norris next time around meant the Briton rejoined the track in third, giving the McLaren pit wall a headache to try and resolve.

McLaren quickly got on the radio and asked Piastri to give up the position, which the Australian ultimately did after a reminder of the situation at last year's Hungarian Grand Prix and being told that the pair could then race to the finish.

Norris had enough in hand over Piastri to maintain second to the chequered flag, reducing his team mate's championship advantage from 34 points to 31, but there were inevitably questions for all involved after the race.

“It's what we decided as a team beforehand,” Norris explained. “If it was the other way around, we would have done exactly the same thing.

“It's not how I want things to go… I don't make these things, I don't plan for these things, I don't want to win or be second or third or whatever like this, but it's the most fair thing, I think. If I was behind and Oscar had the same thing, I would have to give up my position.

“It's not my fault, it's not Oscar's fault, it was a team mistake, which happens every now and then, and that cost me. I know it doesn't look [like] the best thing. I don't want it, but it's the most fair at the end of the day for driver against driver.”

While he still missed out on victory to Verstappen, via a wheel-to-wheel exchange in the opening laps, Norris was pleased with his overall efforts at the Temple of Speed.

Reflecting on that early battle for the lead, Norris said: “I tried to keep it even on the braking into Turn 1, but I always know it's going to be a good fight with Max, and it was, so [it was] enjoyable.

“Just not the speed today, not the pace of Max and the Red Bull, so a tricky one. It's one of the first few weekends where we're just a bit slow, but it was still fun, still a good race, so I enjoyed it.”

He added: “I did everything I could today. I tried to fight against Max, but we had a good race, he came out on top and he deserved it. So, nothing more, second was our best result. I just need to keep doing what I'm doing.”

2025 Italian Grand Prix: Slow pit stop sees Norris lose P2 to Piastri

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Italian Grand Prix

P2 was within Oscar Piastri's grasp at the Italian Grand Prix before team orders resulted in his McLaren team mate Lando Norris reclaiming the position.

Oscar Piastri lost out on a chance to extend his championship lead at the Italian Grand Prix as he followed late team orders to allow Lando Norris to retain second place.

The Australian went into the weekend with a 34-point advantage over his papaya teammate, but immediately found himself on the back foot as he struggled to break into the top spot throughout practice.

Qualifying then saw him take third place behind Norris, which is where he remained for the majority of the Italian Grand Prix as he focused on managing his tyres around the high-speed circuit.

However, an agonisingly slow pitstop for the Briton handed Piastri an unexpected P2 on track after he had changed onto fresh tyres first – this didn't last for long as he was ordered to hand the position back, prompting him to remark: “Is a slow pitstop part of racing?”.

Asked after the race to reflect on the decision, he said: “There were clearly valid reasons for swapping back. Lando qualified ahead and was ahead for the whole race, so I get that. There's just some things we need to discuss.”

After enduring a long stint on medium tyres, the team asked Norris whether he would prefer to pit before or after his team mate. He agreed to go second as long as there was no threat of the Australian undercutting him, which is exactly what happened when an error led to a 5.9s stop when Norris swapped for soft tyres.

Piastri reflected on the strategy choice, concluding: “We went so long that the soft seemed like a good tyre to put on, and we were just staying out for Safety Cars if we got any, but eventually Max got back into our pit window so there wasn't any point staying out much longer. A little 'inchident' at the end!”

His lead has now been cut to 31 points over Norris with nine rounds of the season remaining, and the tough weekend in Monza has given him plenty of points to focus on in his ongoing mission to claim his first title.

“I think as a team we just didn't have amazing pace today,” he summarised. “I think the first part of the race, we were struggling with balance quite a bit and then towards the end of the mediums stint, things actually came good.

“I was happy and the pace was really strong, so yeah, some good things to learn there. Maybe not the best opening lap or two either, which didn't really help things, but nothing too much to complain about.”

Cristobal Tapia de Veer, who parted ways with the HBO drama and its creator earlier this year, won the award for best original main title theme music.


							By 

	Brande Victorian



The White Lotus composer Cristobal Tapia de Veer has won the award for best original main title theme music at the 2025 Creative Arts Emmy Awards following a public falling out with the show's creator Mike White. The win marks de Veer's third Emmy for the HBO drama, which he's scored since its premiere in 2021.


	In April, de Veer told The New York Times that he would not be returning for the series' fourth season, saying, “I announced to the [editorial] team a few months ago that I was not coming back, that I was leaving. … At some point, [White] heard about that.”

	According to de Veer, he and White butted heads over the show's opening theme song, specifically the “ooh-loo-loo-loos” that were a part of the season one track. In season three, the sound was removed from the series' opening credit music, but was still featured on the full version of the track, with de Veer admitting, “I just stuck to what I was doing. And when I was giving versions, it was still the same thing.”


	Days after de Veer's New York Times story ran, White responded to the article in an interview with Howard Stern, saying, “I honestly don't know what happened, except now I'm reading his interviews because he decides to do some PR campaign about him leaving the show. I don't think he respected me. He wants people to know that he's edgy and dark and I'm, I don't know, like I watch reality TV. We never really even fought. He says we feuded. I don't think I ever had a fight with him — except for maybe some emails. It was basically me giving him notes. I don't think he liked to go through the process of getting notes from me, or wanting revisions, because he didn't respect me. I knew he wasn't a team player and that he wanted to do it his way. I was thrown that he would go to The New York Times to shit on me and the show three days before the finale. It was kind of a bitch move.”

	











	For his part, de Veer noted his reluctance to take notes from White in the Times, saying, “Maybe I was being unprofessional, and, for sure, Mike feels that I was always unprofessional to him because I didn't give him what he wanted. But what I gave him did this, you know — [won] those Emmys, people going crazy [for the show],” he said. “That is the main thing that I'm most happy about — it was worth all the tension and almost forcing the music into the show, in a way, because I didn't have that many allies in there … This was a good struggle.”


	De Veer won Emmys for both best music composition and best original main title music in 2022 and best music composition in 2023 for The White Lotus, which received a total of 23 Emmy nominations overall this year. The 2025 award for best music composition went to Severance.


	The 2025 Creative Arts Emmy Awards are held on Saturday, Sept. 6 and Sunday, Sept. 7 at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. Check out the full list of winners here.

Oasis will be back at the Rose Bowl for night 2 tonight.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	Decades after Noel Gallagher famously said his band was “bigger” than The Beatles, Oasis had a Beatle in the building, filming them like a proud musical father at their first concert at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.


	Fans in the crowd on Saturday night (Sept. 6) spotted Paul McCartney in a suite with his phone camera in the air, capturing Gallagher singing Heathen Chemistry‘s “Little by Little,” a No. 2 hit on the U.K.'s Official Singles chart. Later in the night, when Liam Gallagher took lead vocals on the 1994 single “Whatever,” he added a few lines of The Beatles' Abbey Road track “Octopus's Garden” for an outro (as they've done live for awhile now), but Liam probably didn't expect to be performing live and in person for a Beatle.

	











	After the show, a paparazzo captured McCartney heading to his car and asked how the concert was. He made an OK gesture with his hand and simply responded, “Fabulous.” Watch the video here.


			Trending on Billboard		







	Fans on social media were eating up the moment of McCartney — the only one standing in his section — filming Noel onstage, with one writing alongside the video: “Sir Paul McCartney watching Oasis tonight in Los Angeles. The teacher watching the student. Night of legends.” Another wrote: “noel gallagher is gonna go home tonight to the news of paul mccartney recording him, do you understand how insane that is? i'm so happy for them.” Another added: “Paul McCartney watching Oasis tonight like an elder wizard watching over his students. Beautiful.”

	











	Another posted throwback photos of the Gallagher brothers wearing Beatles shirts with the caption: “i wonder if these guys know paul mccartney just recorded them on his phone while watching them sing the music he inspired them to make.”

	When Oasis came out of the gate in the '90s with the one-two punch of 1994's Definitely Maybe and 1995's What's the Story (Morning Glory)?, they were often compared to The Beatles because of the band's strong influence on the Gallaghers' musical style, but they got off to a rocky start because of Noel Gallagher's “bigger than The Beatles” comment. In a 2021 interview, Noel reflected on the time, saying, “When Oasis started, we were so big we were compared to [The Beatles] size-wise and musically, embarrassingly, compared to them as well.” When the interviewer asked why it was embarrassing, he said: “Because we weren't as good as them.”


Also in 2021, Noel Gallagher played a set at the 50th birthday of Paul's daughter Stella McCartney and even joined Sir Paul for The Beatles' “Birthday” and “I Saw Her Standing There.”


	Oasis will return to the Rose Bowl for night 2 on Sunday night (Sept. 7) — the final U.S. date of their Live '25 reunion tour. Next up: Two dates in Mexico City on Sept. 12-13.

Conjuring is a melodrama not a horror film. Terrible end.

I thought people weren't going to movies due to inflation and politics? Huh.

Wow… that's a huge opening for a horror movie with a 4 next to the title. Great job WB marketing.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


Cristobal Tapia de Veer did not attend Night 1 of the 2025 Creative Arts Emmy Awards where he was nominated in two categories for Season 3 of HBO's The White Lotus and won in one of them, Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music. 


	It was his fourth Emmy overall for The White Lotus; he won two for Season 1 (for Main Title Theme Music and Original Dramatic Score) and one for Season 2 (Original Dramatic Score). It will be his last as de Veer will not be returning for Season 4 of the hit anthology, blaming his exit on creative clashes with series creator, writer, director and executive producer Mike White.

	Just as he didn't mince words in his New York Times interview in April about his departure, de Veer was defiant in his reaction to the latest Emmy win, not mentioning White or HBO as his customary in acceptance speeches. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“I respect the Academy because those votes can't be bought. No smear campaign distracted them,” he wrote across his social media channels Sunday morning. “Thank you, this means a lot to me in more than one way 🙏 I'm happy you connected with this melody cause it was an amazing trip making it.”


	It is unclear what smear campaign de Veer is referring to. While HBO did not actively campaign for him this year the way it has for previous seasons, the network submitted him in both the Main Title Theme Music and Original Dramatic Score categories just like it had done in the past. Both submissions resulted in nominations. He also was offered a ticket to last night's Creative Arts Emmy ceremony and had been invited by HBO to the Season 3 premiere.


	It was de Veer who went public and aired his grievances in the NYT interview a couple of days before The White Lotus‘ Season 3 finale, something White called “a bitch move” when asked about it by Howard Stern several days later.


	White denied that the two feuded, saying “he's definitely making a big deal out of a creative difference.”


The White Lotus‘ Season 3 Main Title Theme music, which won the Emmy, is the show's first without the now famous “ooh-loo-loo-loo”s that made the previous two opening credits themes pop culture phenoms, with the Season 2 also becoming a global dance club hit.

	











	According to de Veer, the refusal of his request to include his extended version of the theme that included the popular motif later in the show was one of the main sources of contention during the making of Season 3.


	In his reaction to the Emmy win, the Chilean-Canadian composer shared his inspiration for the theme. 


	“It's about this firefly I met and filmed for an hour,” he said next to a video of the said firefly to his White Lotus music.

	Despite the United States Tennis Association's attempt to censor the U.S. Open audience's reaction to Donald Trump‘s presence at Sunday's Men's Final, the stands were filled with a passionate response.


	Trump was met with a mix of both boos and cheers as he stepped out from the Rolex Suite at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center to greet the crowd gathered to watch Jannik Sinner of Italy take on Spain's Carlos Alcaraz.


	According to a pool report, the stadium was around 10 percent full when Trump stepped out from his suite to wave, with no PA announcement preceding his appearance. Meanwhile, the match was delayed by around 30 minutes to accommodate long lines for the beefed-up security presence.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Following a USTA memo sent to ESPN, Sky Sports and more, ABC appeared to mute the audience reaction to Trump, instead playing music over his appearance. The memo asked “all broadcasters to refrain from showcasing any disruptions or reactions in response to the President's attendance in any capacity.”


	Shortly after, Trump was met with a similar reaction from a more filled-out crowd as he stepped out for Sgt. Maj. Carla Loy's performance of the national anthem. As his face was displayed on the jumbotron during the ‘Star Spangled Banner', boos broke out from the crowd before cheering again for Loy's rendition of the anthem.

	Shown on ABC, ESPN Unlimited and other platforms of the sports giant, the dramatic battle between Carlos Alcaraz (who won the U.S. Open title in 2022) and Jannik Sinner (who won Wimbledon two months ago) was set to start at 11 am PT/2 pm ET.


	Having won in 2024, Aryna Sabalenka remains the U.S. Open's women's champion. The Belarusian player defeated Amanda Anisimova in straight sets earlier today. Sabalenka was applauded and received a standing ovation for her hard fought second consecutive Ashe victory.

That's NY tennis – filled with rich who only care about Wall Street gains.

Who cheers for a fascist? Bizarre.

If he thought he was going to get cheers, he wouldn't have asked to be censured.  Are we in the US or North Korea??  I'm very confused…

It was Most likely the cheer track piped in over the PA speakers that his handlers keep pushing on arenas and stadiums when he shows up.
He's absolutely pathetic.

Anyone remember when being a “career politician” was considered a negative slur, well I'll give anything for one right now instead of this no experienced hack wannna be dictator.

I find it hard to believe they were openly cheering for this thing in NYC. They are typically ashamed to do so in polite society.

The cheers were not real.

Voter registration since the 2024 election overwhelmingly favors republicans, so you might want to rethink this “everyone is a fascist” bluesky tier conspiracy theory.

Maybe people who want to vote in the next primaries to make sure the Republicans choose a more moderate and sensible candidate next time.

Those who drank the kool aid.

If ABC muted a crowd with Biden just imagine what the reaction from FOX and the right would be.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	Don't dare call Maude Apatow a mere “nepo baby.” Her winning directorial debut proves she has the chops behind the camera as well as in front (Euphoria), Apatow name or no Apatow name. Poetic License, which had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in a prime Saturday night slot, is evidence of the emergence of a major triple threat talent (also a producer with Olivia Rosenbloom under their Jewelbox Pictures banner).


	That's the headline but it is not meant to take away from the achievements of Raffi Donatich, whose supremely intelligent and raucously amusing screenplay is her feature writing debut, or a cast that just kills it. In fact this is the kind of ensemble where you can imagine every one of them, ala American Graffiti, being remembered for their collective early work in this engaging sleeper of a comedy that quite frankly caught me by surprise with so many LOL moments, building to true unbridled hilarity by the time it ends. Poetic License could be the true discovery of this year's TIFF.

	Not least among its charms is yet another memorable performance from Apatow's mother, Leslie Mann who has proven time and time again she is one of the best out there, and here gets a dream role as Liz Cassidy, a wife and mother in a bit of a life crisis, about to be an empty nester with her daughter Dora (Nico Parker) wanting to move away and no longer looking for comfort from Mom. She also is stuggling to find some sort of footing in a new town where her husband James (Cliff ‘Method Man' Smith), a college professor has found a new job. Looking for her own worth, she joins a poetry class as an auditor where she first meets a couple of students, the dynamic self-possessed Ari (Cooper Hoffman) and his best friend, buttoned up Sam (Andrew Barth Feldman), who is facing the prospect of joining Morgan Stanley, the brokerage firm he keeps referring to as Tracy Morgan. Neither of them are certain of their lives, even though Sam also has a girlfriend, Grace (Maisy Stella) and looks to be on something of a firmer career track (he thinks). Encouraging Liz to be more active in the class than as just an auditor, the three eventually become fast friends, and Liz finds herself enveloped in their world, as both slowly develop feelings for this much older married woman. Looking for acceptance as she is, Liz misreads their intentions and this threesome get a little too close for comfort.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	That would be what develops into the main plot here, but for much of its early running time, this is a movie simply about people trying to grow up and find their place in the world, and that isn't limited to the young, but everyone including Liz. Donatich's whipsmart script is character-driven, witty and wise in giving each of them a distinct personality as their decisions start to careen out of control. It also makes sly comments on colleges themselves with one reference to the ‘Cryptocurrency Department'. “You know the kids are really excited about the new bitcoin class,” the college president tells a professor in one of the film's wry throwaway lines.


	Mann gets a role that starts as one thing, a woman realizing her life at the moment isn't adding up to what she hoped, and trying to move on (a dialogue-less scene where she is deciding which of Dora's old clothes to donate is priceless and poignant). Liz creeps on you, as she ironically becomes the center of the film's coming-of-age theme. The sly attraction that Sam and Ari begin to feel for her is not pronounced, it just is, coming to a head one night when they all get high, innocently enough, but with consequences.


	Hoffman, so great in Paul Thomas Anderson's Licorice Pizza, and just as fine here, creates a portrait of a self-confident, sharp-talking guy who thinks he has the answers, but doesn't. Feldman, who made a real impression with Jennifer Lawrence as a 19-year-old losing his virginity in No Hard Feelings and has just replaced Darren Criss in the Tony-winning Maybe Happy Ending, is the perfect combo of nervous energy and sheer confusion as Sam. And if they ever decide to do a remake of The Graduate (which let's hope they never do), he is your Benjamin.


	There are so many others with their moments, including My Old Ass breakout Maisy Stella as Sam's girlfriend, who becomes shocked when she realizes he may be fancying the mother of a classmate, and the certified scene stealer here, Martha Kelly (Euphoria), who delivers pitch perfect deadpan stream of consciousness as the professor offering TMI in the poetry class where some this movie's most amusing and even affecting scenes take place. The mark of a brilliant director might be counted on how many actors get their moments in smaller roles, and this film is full of them, notably Steve Coulter in for one memorable scene as a seatmate whose nose cold causes consternation for Liz at a dinner party.


	It would be nice if this deserving film gets a theatrical release, even if movies like this seem to head to streaming more often than not these days. Sitting in the Royal Alexandra Theatre last night, hearing all that convulsive laughter once again, made me think comedies are made to be experienced in a theater. Hopefully we can get back to that someday. In the meantime, Maude Apatow's impressive first film is a keeper, no matter where you find it.


	Producers are Judd Apatow, Josh Church, Benjamin Hung, Thalia Daniel, Will Greenfield, Olivia Rosenbloom and Maude Apatow.

Let's be honest: Life is a lot better for everyone after Maria — or simply “Ms.,” as Saoirse Ronan's character is known to the primary-age kids at the posh British school where she teaches — locks her most disruptive student in the basement of her house, chaining the boy to a wall with the help of a harness that she found on the internet by googling “how to live with an 800lb. gorilla.” 

Before you judge the premise of Jonatan Etzler's wickedly assured “Bad Apples,” a ripe and unpredictable satire about the prevailing evils of “the greater good,” please keep in mind that 10-year-old Danny (played by extraordinary newcomer Eddie Waller) is easily one of the most demonic movie kids this side of Damien, and was an obvious problem for the whole population of Ashton Brook before his sudden disappearance. Hair shaggy, uniform untucked, his face like an arrow pulled taut, Danny held back the whole class with his antics. He was constantly bullying the people around him, smashing things in the classroom, and usurping all of Maria's energy. The day before he disappeared, he even pushed the teacher's pet over the bannister at school. The bone of Pauline's arm was sticking right out of her skin.

And it's not like Maria wanted to kidnap the boy. She only went over to his house for a welfare check, but Danny was hurt in the scuffle that ensued, and when he woke up on the way to the hospital he threatened to tell everyone that Maria had attacked him. That was just too much. All of the parents already blamed the hard-working Maria for every problem in their children's lives (“You look like you don't care,” one of them murmurs off-camera, indifferent to the fact that Ashton Brook won't budget the money to get students like Danny the extra support they need), and there was just no way she was going to lose her job for the crime of trying to do it well. Besides, if one bad apple can spoil the whole barrel, then just imagine the good that Maria could do by removing it from the rest of the bunch. 

 










Based on “De Oönskade” by the Danish author Rasmus Lindgren, and deviously scripted for the screen by Jess O'Kane, “Bad Apples” might operate with all the symbol-driven subtlety of an HBO title sequence (Danny ruins a class field trip by throwing his shoe into a cider mill during the opening scene), but the movie compensates for the obviousness of its premise by savoring the rich moral discomfort of seeing it through. The Ashton Brook community is elated that Danny has disappeared. The boy's father, an exasperated man at the mercy of an Amazon-like delivery job that docks him for every second he so much as thinks about his son, is the only person who even wants to go through the effort of looking for him. The other kids have never been happier or more prepared for the standardized tests that will determine their futures, which means their parents are suddenly in love with Maria, and her overbearing principal is sorry for misjudging her. Even the ex who left her for another woman after they moved in together, and works as the head teacher at her school, is starting to look at Maria with new eyes. Everything is coming up roses. 

And you know what? Things aren't so bad for Danny, either. Sure, nobody wants to be trapped inside a windowless basement, but there are worse things than playing “FIFA” all day, and it isn't long before he starts to benefit from the one-on-one lessons that Maria provides him when she gets home from work (whether dyslexic or simply neglected, he needs the kind of attention that Ashton Brook never bothered to provide). The only problem — and this might be a sticking point for some people — is that he's a 10-year-old boy who's been abducted by his teacher, chained to a basement wall, and forced to shit in a bucket for weeks on end. 

 










That “Bad Apples” is so much fun to hem and haw about is a testament to Ronan's typically excellent performance, which showcases both her low-key comic charm and also her pronounced talent for ambivalence. So credible and sympathetic that you can't help but start to second-guess your own feelings of right and wrong, Ronan mines a wince-inducing vein of mordant humor from how clearly Maria cares about all of her students (in stark contrast to the parents, who each only care about one of them), and from how sincerely she keeps trying to make the best out of a deranged situation. There's a part of you that hopes — and even thinks — that she might just be able to break through to Danny and strike a bargain that protects them both at the end of this.

But that wouldn't make for much of a social commentary, and “Bad Apples” has too many diabolical tricks up its sleeve to settle for anything so predictable. In the interest of preserving the experience of watching them unfold for yourself, I'll just say that O'Kane's script lulls you into a schematic moment of I know where this is going, only to pull the rug out from the entire movie by revealing little Pauline (the gifted Nia Brown) as its secret weapon. 

“Bad Apples” may never be quite as sharp-tongued or audacious as its cast is clearly itching for it to be, but it's satisfying all the same to watch the film bend further towards satire as it goes along, and, crucially, to do so in a way that never loses sight of the fact that it's about a kidnapped child. Etzler guides the story around a series of very tight corners with a steady hand and a rich eye for detail (that Maria keeps her TV on the coffee table is such an efficient display of sadness), and the plot doesn't begin to strain the limits of believability until the situation has grown absurd enough to allow it. 

 










Even the film's relentless forward charge — its preference for strict point-making over a more learn at your own pace curriculum — helps to reaffirm its larger argument that schools have been conditioned to process children rather than enrich them. Obvious as that opening sequence at the cider mill might be, there's a lingering queasiness to its Wes Anderson-like top-down shots of apples being funnelled through a big machine that shuts down the second an irregular object is thrown into the mix. That momentum — and the unwavering drive to maintain it at all costs — persists through the very last shot of this story, and begins to exert a decisive force over the course of its events as Maria and the Ashton Brook parents finally confront the Danny situation for what it is. 

Whether it's a McIntosh rolling through a mill, or a student being pushed from one grade to another, the system exists to serve its masters with efficiency, and there are precious few rewards for anyone who slows it down in order to pay special attention to one of its products. It works by making collective interest and self-interest seem like one and the same, until even the people we trust with our children are convinced that removing a problem might be easier than solving it. They say it takes a village to raise a child. The shrewd, pointed, and comically unforgiving “Bad Apples” suggests that it also takes a village to leave one behind.

 










“Bad Apples” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

“Maddie's Secret” is probably not what you are expecting. Comedian John Early's directorial debut, ostensibly a pastiche of basic-cable TV movies, is not a parody, or a satire, or even a comedy. Instead, it turns out a devastatingly sincere high melodrama with a studied queer sensibility. 

Early plays the eponymous Maddie Ralph, a dishwasher at Gourmaybe, a food content production company. She's sweet, hard-working, and a brilliant chef in her own right. Everyone in the film sees it; Her lesbian best friend (played by Kate Berlant) and her boyfriend (Eric Rahill of the magnificent “Rap World”) can't help but dote on her, and who could blame them? One day, she finds herself the new face of Gourmaybe after one of her signature vegetarian recipes goes viral. But between the stress of her new job, a big opportunity to impress the executive producers of “The Boar” (not a typo) and the words of her mother banging around in her head, she regresses into bulimia. In attempting to hide her eating disorder, Maddie begins to unravel.

There is no world, really, in which “Maddie's Secret” would not have turned out very funny. If you were to make a list of the most exciting people in comedy from the past decade, everybody in the movie would be on it. The cast includes Kate Berlant, Vanessa Bayer, and Connor O'Malley. There is an all-time runner about Better Help, Maddie's house is littered with incredible sight gags, and every time Berlant did so much as move her jaw it sent the whole theater to an uproar. Even when it is not strictly funny, the dialogue is written and perfomed with the kind of hyper-expressive broadness that defines the after-school specials which inspired it. But what is most immediately striking about the film is its straight-forward sincerity. Early never makes fun of Maddie, never lets the audience snicker at the screen. There is a mean version of this project, the one I imagined walking in — a satire of wellness culture and feminine self-image that is brutal and shocking, with a higher joke density. But “Maddie's Secret” is a different and more tender thing.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The film has far more in common with “All That Heaven Allows” and “Showgirls” than it does with “They Came Together” or “The Naked Gun”; A shot of Maddie's mother reflected in a television screen directly references Sirk's classic. The film is gorgeous, with a color grade that reminded me of how Nicholas Ray movies looked on a CRT. It is camp in the true sense — the use of aesthetic hysteria and unreal dramaturgy in low-brow modes, all in the pursuit of greater honesty. 

Though it is about many things, this is a movie most of all about bulimia, an epidemic that kills so many young girls and traps even more in a lifelong pattern of suffering. It treats eating disorders as a serious and crushingly universal experience. If the psychoanalytic rationale presented by the film can feel occasionally trite, it is no less astute or caring. By the time the story moves into the halls of an inpatient facility, it is strange to notice that “Maddie's Secret” has, without any fundamental shift in tone, begun to feel ultra-real. Yes, it is funny to meet an adult woman at the hospital who decorates her room with posters of boys and talks too much. But it is also devastating, most of all because that is a real girl I have known. I can remember her name. Watching these women claw against institutional infantilization and a system of culturally instructed emotional regulation that is killing them broke my heart.

 










None of this would work without Early's profound love for women. He plays Maddie with the grace of a mid-century diva. He wears that blond wig like it's real hair, with untamed flyaways and a style that's fighting its natural part. There is a sense, when Maddie visits a radically inclusive dance studio (even though she is just, in her words, an ally), that Early is welcoming in the girls from his past, giving them a space within his art. It respects the capability of melodrama to capture the intense despair and beauty of the soul. It cares about young women with eating disorders enough to believe they are worthy of such a massive canvas. It does not fetishize or leer at them, nor does it make them martyrs. The film's climax, which finds Maddie confronting her mother about her childhood, is a genuine show-stopper, one that can only really work with the trust Early and co. have built up with the audience over the preceding hour and half. It is a film of real kindness.

It is rare, these days, to see something genuinely exciting on the indie scene. I am long desensitized to genre mashups and the unearned swagger of bad experimental cinematography. “Maddie's Secret” renewed my hope that this corner of the industry can go to new places, outside of what is edgy or trendy. It is an extremely accomplished debut and one of the boldest American movies I have seen in years.

 










“Maddie's Secret” premiered at the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

“John Wick” writer Derek Kolstad is as amazed as anyone that Bob Odenkirk, the 62-year-old comic star of “Mr. Show” and of acclaimed dramas “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul,” has become America's next big action star. Between two “Nobody” films and Odenkirk's latest film “Normal” premiering at midnight tonight at TIFF, you might think Odenkirk has sufficiently scratched that action movie itch of cosplaying as John Wick.

Not even close. In fact, he and Kolstad are just getting started. 

“I think some of the best dramatic actors came from comedy, so why not some of the best action guys coming from comedy as well,” Kolstad told IndieWire.

Odenkirk, Kolstad, and “Nobody” producer Marc Provissiero are teaming up and have decided there's more action movies they want to make together, more stories to tell, and a whole lot more bad guys to beat up. The trio haven't even formed an official production company — more of a “creative partnership” — where they've decided that, hey, making stylish action movies with some depth and some humor is pretty fun.

 










“We have so much fun together, and it's so rare for that to be the case. We want to do more together, and there seems to be an appetite for this slot in the business,” Provissiero told IndieWire.  

Specifically, they want films with serious, dramatic stakes, something that Provissiero said proved tricky when they were searching for writers for “Nobody” and kept getting pitched comedy writers. The goal is this: Make studio-grade action films on a responsible budget with practical effects, some humor, and, most importantly, stories and characters that go beyond the mold of something bad happens to a loved one and a badass wants revenge.

All that is true of “Normal,” Ben Wheatley's new film for which Odenkirk helped Kolstad hatch the story. The film follows Odenkirk as Ulysses, a cop taking a job as an “interim sheriff” in the small Minnesota town Normal. Turns out everything in the town is slightly off and not, well, normal, but Ulysses' vice is he's overlooking most everything because of past sins that have left him jaded, and that's just how the town and a sleazy mayor (Henry Winkler) like it. The film is cathartically, playfully violent and has some laughs, but it also is pitched with dramatic stakes that Odenkirk and company see as crucial to the brand of action movies they seek to make.  

 










“There's a cookie cutter action type story you can tell and it will satisfy an audience, I understand that. I grasp that there's an audience out there, and I don't want to name names, but I don't need to because you can conjure them up without effort,” Odenkirk said. “There is a kind of movie that if you make it and it looks reliably satisfying, it will get its audience. But I'm always trying to find something more, find something more to the form, smuggle in something more than just the accepted values of that genre.”

It's not as though the trio today has a slate of projects in development and others gearing up production, but the trio is constantly noodling with ideas. On one end, Odenkirk wants to make an action movie in the vein of “Police Story” and other early Jackie Chan classics, one with no bloodshed, no guns, and a PG-rating. Essentially something you can watch “with your 8-year-old.” And on the other end, because of “the turmoil and the darkness” inside of him, he wants to make a “fucking horrifically violent” thriller in the vein of “Oldboy” meets “Taxi Driver.” Even as we're speaking, the wheels seem to be turning in Odenkirk's head for another idea he's eager to flesh out.

Kolstad fortunately has already been thinking about the lot, and Odenkirk says the “John Wick” creator is sitting on a plethora of treatments they have not yet begun to mine. Odenkirk downplays his filmography and says that though he may also be a writer, his experience hardly lies in feature screenplay writing (he calls his dozen or so features he's written “rough shit”), and he's merely pushing Kolstad in interesting directions.

 










“The way Derek talks about and learned about movies is the way I did sketch comedy,” Odenkirk said. “The other day I mentioned this notion to him, and he just rattled off movies that fit that structure tonally, thematically, structurally, and I haven't seen any of them.” 

There's also a clear market for the type of film they want to make. With “Better Call Saul,” Odenkirk found that portraying Saul Goodman gave him a perception amongst audiences that he was a “striver who would never quit and someone who might do something dastardly but was always on the right side of things,” a dead ringer for an action hero. That perception was especially true internationally, where buyers appreciated the film's modest, sub-$20 million budget, allowing “Normal” to pre-sell distribution rights to independently fund production. “Normal” is a sales title on the TIFF market looking for a North American deal.

All Odenkirk had to learn was the fighting. And he found it wasn't Saul Goodman that gave him a leg up in the combat department but his sketch comedy writing with “Mr. Show,” “SNL,” for Conan, and beyond. 

“I really dug it. It's funny, it's fun, it's got some DNA in common with sketch comedy,” Odenkirk said. “A fight sequence is between 2-6 minutes long. Like a sketch, I think it should have a beginning, middle, and end, and I think it should have a character. Each fight should have some kind of character to it and a way you can describe it, whether it's the funniest fight in a movie or one that starts as one kind of fight and transforms into another. It should have its own little body to it and personality.”

 










Kolstad and Provissiero never envisioned this would be such a calling for Odenkirk, but they can tell why being an action star has grown on him. 

“There's a discipline in comedy, because comedy is skill, timing, and luck, and in action movies, a lot of it is timing. And he's got that,” Kolstad said.

	Jonathan Bernstein



	“The full E Street Band right here!” Bruce Springsteen announced to the lucky crowd packed into Monmouth University's Pollack Theatre Saturday afternoon. Springsteen had just performed “Thunder Road” with seven musicians, six of them representing a just-for-this-occasion combination of original and current E Street Band members—Steven Van Zandt, Garry Tallent, David Sancious and Roy Bittan on keys, Ernest Carter and Max Weinberg on dual drums— plus longtime saxophonist Ed Manion. It was the first time this precise combination of musicians had ever performed onstage together, a union of the pre-1975, jazz-leaning E Street Band featuring Carter and Sancious and the version of the band—with Bittan and Weinberg—that's existed ever since.


	Following “Thunder Road” was “Born to Run,” the second of an all-too-brief two-song set concluding the day-long symposium celebrating the 50th anniversary of Born to Run at Monmouth University, hosted by the Bruce Springsteen Archives & Center for American Music. During “Born to Run” (with Carter nailing the complex drum fill Weinberg has said he's always had trouble playing), Springsteen and the E Street Band transformed the 700-capacity college auditorium into a stadium, with fans crowding the aisles and shouting “tramps like us.” when prompted.

	











	It was a thrilling finale to a day of on-stage panels, interviews and roundtable discussions featuring Springsteen himself, alongside many of the musicians and behind-the-scenes figures who played a role in the creation of Born to Run. Speakers ranged from E Street Band members to the album's engineer Jimmy Iovine to Springsteen's former and current managers, Mike Appel and Jon Landau, to Eric Meola, who shot the album's iconic cover, to assorted Columbia Records employees involved in the promotion of the record. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Even if Springsteen himself, who spoke during three separate panels before performing, was the day's unannounced-but-widely expected main attraction, the symoposium was a tribute to the many musicians, collaborators and industry players who helped make Born to Run the album we know today.

	“These were the guys that were there when you need them,” Springsteen said about his bandmates, Appel, Landau and Iovine during a panel about the recording of the album, “when you have nothing, and were no one, these were the guys that gave [me] everything.”


	The Born to Run symposium comes during a heightened period of legacy-building for Springsteen in advance of next month's Bruce biopic, Deliver Me From Nowhere. And while that film (and the most recently announced box-set) focuses on Nebraska, it's been a backwards-looking year for Springsteen in more ways than one. Apart from this year's Tracks II box set, there's been plenty of commemorating the 50th anniversary of Springsteen's most iconic album: Many nuggets from the day's panels can also be found in Tonight in Jungleland, the recently published book on the making of the album by Peter Ames Carlin, who interviewed Springsteen and Landau on-stage earlier in the afternoon.


	But regardless of how many tidbits from throughout the day were first reported by Carlin, hearing those involved with the album discuss its backstory and mythology in-person made for an incredibly entertaining day for fans: There was former manager Mike Appel talking about hardballing both Time and Newsweek editors as he finagled for both covers with “no interview without the cover” policy (one he allegedly even extended to Playboy when they called asking for a Bruce interview). 


	There was Jimmy Iovine sharing what Springsteen told him after they listened to Born to Run in its entirety on a rainy drive through New Jersey just a few weeks ago: “You peaked!” There was photographer Eric Meola talking about how tired Clarence Clemons and Springsteen were during the Born to Run photoshoot (“They're yawning in half the shots, exhausted. Yet in the other half, they're exuberant.”) And there were stories from former Columbia employees Paul Rappaport, Michael Pillot and Peter Philbin about fighting the uphill battle of advocating for an artist they believed in when he wasn't gaining traction in his earliest years.

	Springsteen himself showed up early in the day, first spotted next to Jimmy Iovine in the wings towards the back of the auditorium, arms crossed, as he cracked up while watching a humorous panel about the 1975 Born to Run tour in which tour photographer Barbara Pyle told a story about documenting Springsteen smiling for the first time in a year: “This guy was a shut-in!” 

	











	Springsteen then appeared in three consecutive panels. He responded to being asked how “Born to Run” sounds to him 50 years later: “It sounds like I fucking sound!” He told stories about his mother forcing him, at age 13, to pretend he was 12 to avoid paying adult prices for admission to a movie theater. He reflected on having a Peter Pan poster hanging in his bedroom circa 1974, the one that inspired him naming the character in “Born to Run” “Wendy”: “Not sure what that [says about] my adult life; It actually explains quite a bit of it!” He admitted he stole the opening of “Born to Run” from “The Locomotion.” He reflected on his controlling tendencies in the studio during Born to Run and talked about how intimidated he was by seasoned session pros like the Brecker Brothers and David Sanborn: “I was young and insecure about anything and everything.” 


	And he made jokes at his own expense. At one point, during a discussion of “Backstreets,” (a song “about those summer nights when you're left on your own,” he called it) Springsteen asked for the song's lyrics to be pulled up on a teleprompter. When that didn't immediately happen, Carlin asked him which lyrics he needed. 


	“I want all of them,” Springsteen responded. “I'm 76; I don't know any of them!”


	(At his own solo show later that evening at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, Max Weinberg joked in-between songs about how earlier in the day various E Street Band members had compared and contrasted their respective hearing aids with one another backstage.)

	Towards the end of the full-band panel about the recording of the album, Van Zandt pulled out a guitar to demonstrate a story he's told many times before: How a conversation he had with Springsteen resulted in the last note of the “Born to Run” guitar riff being changed from a minor chord to a major chord. The crowd laughed as Van Zandt played the riff as it sounded before he pointed out to Bruce that it was a minor chord. 


	“For those of you who don't know music,” Springsteen said of the song's riff before Van Zandt sparked the change, “this would've changed history.”

House Speaker Confuses White House With Claim Trump Was an FBI Snitch","https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-epstein-fbi-snitch-house-speaker-confusion-1235422703/","Sun, 07 Sep 2025 15:38:05 GMT","


	Trump administration officials are perplexed, as many people are, by House Speaker Mike Johnson's claims that Donald Trump was an FBI informant in the case against Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges he sexually abused and trafficked scores of underage girls. The president and Epstein had a well-documented friendship.


	On Thursday, Johnson made the confusing remarks about the president when a reporter asked him about Trump repeatedly referring to the Epstein scandal as “the Democrat Epstein Hoax.”


	“What Trump is referring to is the hoax that the Democrats are using to try to attack him,” Johnson said, claiming the president's feelings on the topic had been “misrepresented.” “He is not saying what Epstein did is a hoax. It's a terrible, unspeakable evil, and he believes that himself. When he first heard the rumor, he kicked him out of Mar-a-Lago.”


	Johnson then added the head-scratching claim that Trump “was an FBI informant to try to take this stuff down.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The comment sent the internet ablaze, and could surely make good South Park fodder. 


	According to five Trump administration officials and others close to the president, Johnson's “informant” claim on Thursday sparked widespread confusion within the ranks of Trump's government, with several senior officials blindsided or just completely perplexed by what the Trump-aligned House speaker could have possibly meant.


	For some in the administration, the confusion spilled over into Saturday, with some officials still unsure about whether Johnson was citing some explosive, unheard-of insider information, or if he misspoke or was freelancing extemporaneously.

	











	“What the hell is he doing?” one senior Trump administration appointee told Rolling Stone, after being asked about the Johnson “informant” comment.


	Other Trump advisers say it's their understanding that Johnson was referencing past claims made in the media about Trump; however, these claims did not amount to the idea he was a federal “informant.”

	FBI officials, including deputy director Dan Bongino, did not reply to Rolling Stone's inquiries on Saturday about whether or not their boss Trump was a snitch for the feds. Trump has yet to comment on Johnson's claim.


	Johnson's remarks come as survivors of sex offender Epstein teamed with lawmakers to  pressure Trump's Justice Department to release more information. On Wednesday, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said, “Less than one percent of those files have been released.”

	Trump had promised to release the so-called Epstein files during his 2024 campaign, and his administration appeared ready to try to score points with the MAGA base on the topic. In July, though, the Justice Department backtracked, issuing a memo asserting that Epstein died by suicide and that his long-awaited “client list” doesn't exist. 


	Khanna along with 212 Democrats and four Republicans are pulling for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a discharge petition that calls on the DOJ to release all unclassified records related to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's accomplice who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sex trafficking. Meanwhile, Republicans are calling on their ranks to support the efforts of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The committee released 33,000 documents with no apparent revelations on Tuesday.Survivors are compiling a list of Epstein's associates based on their own stories while the Trump administration continues to assert that an Epstein client list does not exist.

This is it, folks. The US Open final is upon us, and it's a free live stream you won't want to miss as the game's two best players compete for the title and the world number 1 rank. We have everything you need to know about where to watch Alcaraz vs. Sinner for free from anywhere.

Jannik Sinner has been on top of the rankings for a ridiculous 65 weeks now, even if he had to retire with illness when these two last met in the Cincinnati Open final. The Italian has been putting on a clinic in New York and is a favorite to retain his title and add it to his Australian Open and Wimbledon titles in an impressive 2025.

Carlos Alcaraz, the current French Open champ, has been on his tail all season, and Cincinnati aside, these two usually put on one hell of a match and aren't afraid to go the distance. He made short work of Djokovic a few days ago, a player the Spaniard has struggled with in recent meetings. Excited? You should be.

Access streaming anywhere:

Australia:

US:

UK:

The start of the US Open final has been delayed by at least 30 minutes due to the additional security measures at the Arthur Ashe Stadium, with President Trump attending the match. As of 2:05 p.m., we can still see huge lines outside the stadium as crowds filter in through the extra security. We wouldn't be surprised to see the start further delayed at this point, so you still have plenty of time to get yourself connected with one of the viewing options in this guide.

In Australia, fans can live stream the Alcaraz vs. Sinner match for free via 9Now. Don't worry if you're not in Australia right now, as we can show you how to use a VPN in the next section of the article to get around geo-restrictions and watch for free as well.

In the US, ESPN viewing options are available in five-day free trials through live TV streaming services like DirecTV and Fubo.

If you're away from Australia right now, you can still tune into your free streaming option with the help of a VPN.

ESPN (via ESPN, ABC, and other related networks) is the broadcast home of the US Open in the United States. Matches will be available in full through the new ESPN streaming service. Plans range from $12 a month for ESPN Select to $30 a month for ESPN Unlimited. Annual versions are also available.

Both tiers have US Open coverage, but Unlimited unlocks lots of extra coverage and full live streams from flagship networks. You can learn more in our ESPN streaming service guide and check out a limited-time deal when you bundle ESPN Unlimited with Disney Plus and Hulu. However, if you're only interested in the US Open, then ESPN Select will do the trick.


                      ESPN Select, formerly ESPN Plus, offers select coverage from ESPN properties. While it doesn't have a direct live stream of ESPN networks, like the Unlimited plan, it still offers around 32,000 live sporting events each year.
                    

If you're looking for an even more comprehensive sports streaming option, a month-to-month live TV streaming service such as DirecTV or Fubo can help. DirecTV MySports, the service's new genre pack, includes 20+ popular sports channels traditionally found in cable packages and access to the ESPN streaming service app. Subscriptions cost $70 a month and come with a five-day free trial for new customers. Right now, users can also get $10 a month off their first two months of service.


                      DirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network. 
                    

Fubo is another solid sports-friendly live TV streaming service with access to ABC and all of the necessary ESPN networks, in addition to more than 200 other live channels. Subscribing to Fubo will also unlock access to the new ESPN Unlimited app. Fubo Pro subscriptions start at $85 a month (plus a little bit more with required regional sports fees), but new users can get $30 off their first month of service after a five-day free trial. There's also a brand-new Fubo Sports package, which costs $56 a month, although it's only available in select markets right now.


                      Fubo is the streaming service for sports fans. Its huge library of channels includes regional and international sports leagues, setting it apart from the competition. You can also tack on additional programming to your plan, but it'll cost you extra.
                    

The US Open is available through Sky Sports in the UK. Subscription prices vary depending on which bundle and long-term contract you sign up for, but the cheapest plans with Sky Sports start at £35 a month. You can learn more in our guide to the best Sky TV deals and plans. There's also an option to stream Sky Sports through Now, which offers some additional plan flexibility.

9Now will live stream the US Open final in full in Australia. This is a free streaming option; fans just need to create an account if they don't already have one. Stan Sport, a paid option, also has coverage.

	It all comes down to this.


	Carlos Alcaraz faces off against Jannik Sinner today for the 2025 U.S. Open Tennis Championships men's title. The top two seeds were widely predicted to end up in the finals, and for tennis fans (and no doubt, tournament organizers), today's match is a dream come true.


	The Alcaraz vs. Sinner men's final takes place today, Sunday, September 7 at 2 p.m. ET / 11 a.m. PT live from Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing, Queens. Want to watch Alcaraz vs. Sinner online? Here's what you need to know.




	If you want to watch the Sinner vs. Alcaraz match on TV, the U.S. Open men's final is airing live on ESPN. You can watch the tennis match with a basic cable package that includes the sports channel. 


	Don't have cable? There are also a few ways to livestream Sinner vs. Alcaraz online, including options to stream the tennis match online for free.













	DirecTV's streaming service is one of our favorite ways to watch live TV online, without needing to pay for cable. The streamer carries a live feed of ESPN across most of its plans, and with its current free trial offer, new users can watch the U.S. Open men's final on ESPN for free.

	While Sling doesn't offer a free trial, the streaming service has affordable, customizable packages that get subscribers access to ESPN and ESPN2 as part of its Orange plan. Our suggestion: grab a one-day streaming pass to Sling for just $4.99 and use it to watch Alcaraz vs. Sinner on ESPN without cable.

	Oddsmakers have Alcaraz and Sinner pretty evenly matched for today's men's final, though most give the edge to Sinner. The Italian has dropped just two sets in the tournament on his way to the final, and looks poised to repeat as U.S. Open champ to take home his fifth Grand Slam title.




	The No. 2-ranked Alcaraz already has five Grand Slam wins to his name, with the most recent being the 2025 French Open (he then lost to Sinner at Wimbledon). Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic in the U.S. semifinals to make it to today's championship match.
