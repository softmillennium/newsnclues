(Steve Helber) Virginia House of Delegates, Del.-elect, Nicole Cole, speaks with constituents Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025, in Fredericksburg, Va. (Steve Helber) FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) — Virginia Democrat Nicole Cole and her team spent much of their 2025 campaign for the state legislature standing in places like Weis Markets in Spotsylvania County, railing against prices that she said were too high: at least $3.79 for a dozen eggs, up to $7.99 for a pound of ground beef, $9.39 for coffee beans. Her effort paid off when she ousted a 36-year Republican from his state House seat. She was one of 13 Virginia Democrats to flip competitive House seats and contribute to big election wins in her state and New Jersey, the only ones with governor's races this year. “We would greet them at the point of purchase,” Cole said. The cost of living also may have led voters to signal that this is President Donald Trump's economy now. Some prices have stabilized or even declined, and costs tend to be higher in New Jersey than Virginia. Morris County is part of a traditionally Republican state legislative district where liberal Democrat Marisa Sweeney and one of two incumbent Republicans are so close in the vote count that The Associated Press considers the race, which will have two winners, too close to call. Over the past decade, places like Morris and Spotsylvania counties have become increasingly competitive — communities just beyond major metro areas where midterms are often won or lost. Each is about two-thirds white, slightly wealthier than the national average, and at or above it in the share of residents with bachelor's degrees. Heading into 2025, both looked like they would be close. Glenn Youngkin won it by more than 20 percentage points in between. Still, Cole remained persuaded that she could flip her district, which includes part of Spotsylvania and Caroline counties. “Early on in my campaign, when I brought in my staff, one of the main messages I talked to them about was that we need to stop saying this district is red, and that it leans red,” Cole said, adding: “We had to give some encouragement that this is possible to the people who aren't red.” Cole, who was elected to the Spotsylvania County School Board in 2021, developed a playbook focused on the cost of living and education. Two weeks before the Nov. 4 election, she spoke at a town hall in Fredericksburg about tackling high energy bills from electric utilities. The quality of food that you're able to buy for your kids is a sacrifice.” As she greeted voters in November after the election, most people were tired of talking politics. But one voter, Kaitlyn Sapp, seemed interested in learning what Democrats would do for her. But recently, I have been trying to learn more.” Cole smiled, not wasting a second before rattling off the issues her party aimed to tackle next year: health care costs, public education, utility bills and so on. Voters seemed to pay attention to how the president's policies were affecting them, said Sweeney, whose district includes part of the county. “I think the message was drowned out a little bit by Washington.” The county, which has heavily Latino areas, went for Trump in 2024, the first time it went for a Republican in decades. This year, it swung back to Democrats by double digits. John Currie, the longtime Democratic chairman in Passaic, chalked up the swing back to his party there to “hard work” by those running, along with a message about lowering costs. And by not talking about costs enough, Currie said Republicans paid the ultimate price.</p>

In this image provided by the U.S. Air Force, a Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II aircraft flies alongside a U.S. Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bomber in the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility, Oct. 15, 2025. Attorney General Pam Bondi listens as President Donald Trump speaks during a roundtable on criminal cartels in the State Dining Room of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025, in Washington. MIAMI (AP) — In justifying American military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs, President Donald Trump has asserted that the longtime U.S. strategy of interdicting such vessels at sea has been a major failure. That milestone, however, has not dissuaded the Republican president from upending decades of U.S. counternarcotics policy. Trump and other top officials have contended that such boats are being operated by narco-terrorists and cartel members with deadly drugs bound for America. The strikes have generated international pushback from foreign leaders, human rights groups, Democrats and some Republicans who have raised concerns that the United States is engaging in extrajudicial killings that undermine its stature in the world. The Coast Guard for decades has interdicted small vessels suspected of smuggling illicit narcotics. That campaign, by at least one measure, has never been more successful, despite constant complaints by the Coast Guard that it lacks funding to seize even more drugs. The interdictions have continued as part of what's known as Operation Pacific Viper even during the federal government shutdown, with several cutters reporting major seizures last month. In almost every case, drug smugglers have been brought to the U.S. for prosecution, and valuable information about ever-changing smuggling routes and production methods was collected — all without any loss of life and a far lower cost to American taxpayers. Experts said each missile strike is likely to cost far more than the payload of cocaine on every ship. “The Coast Guard has extraordinary powers and authorities to do effective drug interdiction without killing unidentified people on small boats,” said Douglas Farah, a national security expert on Latin America and president of IBI Consultants. “When resourced, they are far more effective, sustainable and likely legal than the current Pentagon-led operations.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio this week defended the shift in strategy, saying that “interdictions alone are not effective.” “Interdictions have limited to no deterrent effect,” he added. Part of the problem is that demand for cocaine is high, and supplies have never been so robust, according to authorities and experts. The Coast Guard also does not have enough vessels or crew to halt it all. Shipments heading to Europe are smuggled through the Caribbean, often hidden in container ships. In social media posts, Trump has claimed that his strikes have blown up boats carrying fentanyl and that each destroyed vessel has saved 25,000 American lives. According to experts and former U.S. counternarcotics officials, Trump's statements are either exaggerations or false. Fentanyl, on the other hand, is typically trafficked to the U.S. overland from Mexico, where it is produced with chemicals imported from China and India. Cocaine overdose deaths are less frequent than those from fentanyl. In dozens of interviews, residents of the region and relatives said t he dead men were mostly laborers or fisherman making $500 a trip. Law enforcement officials and experts echoed those findings, saying the smugglers captured by the Coast Guard are hired for little money to ferry drugs from point A to point B. “They are hardly kingpins,” said Kendra McSweeney, an Ohio State University geographer who has spent years researching U.S. drug policies. In April, months before Trump launched his military campaign, his attorney general, Pam Bondi, traveled to South Florida to welcome home the Coast Guard cutter James from its latest antinarcotics patrol. It had seized 20 tons of cocaine worth more than $500 million. Flanked by FBI Director Kash Patel, she praised a “prosecutor-led, intelligence driven approach to stopping these criminal enterprises in their tracks.” “This is not a drop in the bucket,” said Bondi, standing in front of the vessel loaded with colorful, plastic-wrapped bales of narcotics stacked several feet high. “Behind you is half a billion dollars of pure, uncut cocaine.” Associated Press writer Konstantin Toropin in Washington contributed to this report.

Margot Kaczorowski and Ellen Holmquist, former teammates of trans swimmer Lia Thomas, join 'Fox & Friends' with their attorney to react to the University of Pennsylvania's decision, saying 'we have a long way to go' in the fight for women's sports. President Donald Trump nominated attorney Justin Olson, of the firm Kroger Gardis & Regas, LLP, to sit on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. Olson is one of the attorneys helping to lead a lawsuit financed by the Independent Council on Women's Sports (ICONS) against the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, the Ivy League and NCAA for its handling of a situation involving transgender swimmer Lia Thomas. Olson is also listed as an attorney in ICONS's lawsuit against the Mountain West Conference and representatives of San Jose State University over their handling of a situation involving trans volleyball player Blaire Fleming. "It is my honor to nominate Justin Olson to serve as Judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana! Graduating magna cum laude from the Indiana University Maurer School of Law, Justin previously distinguished himself at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Indianapolis and, as a litigator, has been fighting tirelessly to keep men out of women's sports," Trump wrote. "Hoosiers can trust Justin to always uphold the Rule of Law, and strongly protect their Constitutional Rights. Former UPenn swimmers Grace Estabrook, Margot Kaczorowski and Ellen Holmquist filed a lawsuit on Feb. 5, alleging UPenn officials led them to feel their concerns over being teammates with Thomas were rooted in a "psychological problem," and that by allowing Thomas to compete, the institutions "injured them and violated federal law." Thomas, a biological male, previously competed for the UPenn men's swimming team from 2017-20 under the name Will Thomas. According to the lawsuit, Thomas was introduced by women's swimming head coach Mike Schnur to the women's swimmers during a team meeting in Fall 2019 as their incoming teammate. UPenn agreed with the Trump administration in June to strip the athlete's swimming records from the women's program archives, and adopt a policy to keep biological males out of women's sports. Meanwhile, in the SJSU case, former women's volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser filed that lawsuit in November 2024, alongside 10 other former and current Mountain West players. Slusser alleged the Mountain West and SJSU withheld knowledge of Fleming's biological sex from her and other players while having her share changing spaces and hotel rooms with Fleming. In addition to his work on those cases, Olson has also served as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Indiana, Civil Division, and served as the civil health care fraud coordinator and civil opioid coordinator.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? New data shows foreign PhD enrollment remains steady, but the risks to America's foreign talent pipeline are growing. On the eve of World War II, the great laboratories were in Europe, and American research — especially in physics — was widely seen as trailing them. A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world. Then came the “scientific exodus”: Foreign refugees from fascism — like Einstein, Fermi, Bethe, Szilard, von Neumann, and others — remade US science. One reason we won the war is because America collected foreign talent while its enemies expelled it. And Washington locked in that advantage postwar by building Vannevar Bush's vision of federally funded university science, which turned the country into a scientific superpower, leaving the rest of the world as one big talent pool. Eight decades later, the US has started turning off that spigot. In June, the Trump administration suspended or curtailed visas from 19 countries, explicitly hitting student and exchange categories. This spring, it even terminated thousands of student SEVIS records — the official Department of Homeland Security status files for international students — before reversing course under legal pressure. August arrival records showed a roughly 19 percent year-over-year drop in new international student entries. That represented the biggest non-pandemic decline on record, even as surveys showed top researchers planning to leave the US in droves. For an economy that runs on scientific innovation, this is a self-own of historic levels So, here's the (measured) good news: Despite what appears to be the Trump administration's best efforts, new federal data reported by Nature shows that international PhD numbers are essentially flat year over year. That's not a triumph, but it's not the crash many feared — not yet — and it buys time to mount the political resistance needed to keep America's foreign talent engine running. It's important to understand that, in the fields that power the technological frontier — computer science, engineering, math — international students are not a rounding error; they are the majority of new US PhDs. And contrary to arguments that the US is educating foreign students only to see them take their talents elsewhere, many of those researchers stick around. Roughly three-quarters of international science and engineering PhDs from the 2017–2019 cohorts were still in the US five years later. Close it, and we'll feel the loss in capacity, not just headcount. Perhaps you're thinking that, if the US restricts foreign students, more seats will go to American-born candidates. But we don't have enough of those candidates. While more US citizens and permanent residents have been pursuing and attaining science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees over the past decade, the growth in graduate degrees has been uneven, including a 3 percent year-over-year dip in 2022. Far too many American students aren't ready to take those places. Compare that to China, which is already minting nearly twice the number of STEM PhDs as the US and doing it almost entirely with domestic talent. To compete, America can't only rely on its own resources. You can see the downstream payoff of foreign scientific talent everywhere innovation is actually measured. Immigrants produce about 23 percent of US patents — far above their share of the population — and their patents are, on average, at least as influential when judged by citations and market value. In the startup economy, immigrants have founded 55 percent of US “unicorns” (billion-dollar startups), while a large majority of top private AI firms have at least one immigrant founder. A nontrivial share of those founders first came as international students. Since 2000, immigrants have won roughly 40 percent of the Nobel Prizes awarded to Americans in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine. This year, both Jordan-born Omar Mwannes Yaghi, who moved to the US at 9, and Netherlands-born Joel Mokyr, who came to America as a grad student, added to that list. These wins aren't a coincidence; it's what happens when a research system reliably attracts and retains the world's best. So, the fact that international student enrollment is holding steady for now is reassuring — but only if we take advantage of it. If we keep that promise — stable study-to-work pathways, predictable visa processing, no sudden rule changes — the evidence suggests those researchers will come, contribute disproportionately to scientific discoveries and new business ventures, and, in many cases, stay.

Gavin Newsom and how the legal system handles alleged ‘sanctuary cities' on ‘Hannity.' Federal agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection are expected to arrive in the Charlotte area within days, local officials confirmed this week amid growing friction between Washington's immigration enforcement priorities and Democratic-run cities. The Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday that it had been notified of the impending federal presence but emphasized that it has not been asked to assist or participate in any operations. A department spokesperson told Fox News Digital Friday that the sheriff's office had "zero involvement or participation in any CBP immigration enforcements or operations." The impending immigration enforcement in North Carolina comes as Sheriff Garry L. McFadden, a Democrat, has sought to maintain open communication with federal agencies while distancing his department from federal immigration enforcement. People detained earlier in the day are taken to a parking lot on the far north side of the city before being transferred to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on October 31, 2025, in Chicago, Illinois. Those operations have sparked protests from anti-immigration activists. In Portland, Oregon, protests have flared since June. Anti-ICE graffiti has been scrawled outside of detention centers, and demonstrations have become violent at times between protesters and federal agents. WATCH: Federal immigration agents dodge bullets, speeding cars in CA Federal officials have described the deployments as part of an expanded effort to disrupt smuggling networks and track illegal aliens. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said: "Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations." Homicides and aggravated assaults have risen sharply this year, prompting Republican lawmakers to urge Democratic Gov. For now, the governor has resisted that call from Republican lawmakers, and local officials have argued that public safety remains a local responsibility. "Recently, the city faced eight homicides in seven days. "According to the Fraternal Order of Police, aggravated assaults involving knives or guns have risen from 86 in 2024 to 111 in 2025, and personal strong-arm robberies have increased from 26 to 31 in the same period." A view of the memorial dedicated to slain 23-year-old Ukrainian Iryna Zarutska at the East/West Blvd light rail station in Charlotte on September 11, 2025. According to the Charlotte Police Department's quarterly statistics report, violent crimes, commercial burglaries and larcenies from automobiles have all gone up in Charlotte since last year. On Aug. 22, the stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska garnered attention after her killing was captured on surveillance video while she was commuting home from her pizzeria job. Police revealed that her accused killer was identified as Decarlos Brown Jr., a repeat offender with a lengthy rap sheet. In his earlier statement Wednesday, McFadden sought to reassure residents that his office "remains committed to transparency" and that any coordination with federal agencies will be limited to information-sharing, not enforcement. The Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office said the sheriff, Garry L. McFadden, was contacted by two unnamed federal officials this week who said U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel will be arriving in the Charlotte area either Saturday or early next week. "It allows us to stay informed and be proactive in keeping Mecklenburg County safe and to maintain the level of trust our community deserves," McFadden said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iceland's relatively mild climate is shaped by a crucial network of currents that winds its away around the Atlantic Ocean transporting heat northward — without it, the island would be much icier and stormier. As evidence mounts these currents could be on course for collapse, Iceland's government has made the unusual move of designating the risk a national security threat, prompting a a high-level response into how to prepare for this “existential threat.” “Our climate, economy and security are deeply tied to the stability of the ocean currents around us,” said Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson, Iceland's Minister for Environment, Energy and Climate. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation — known as the AMOC — is a looping system of currents that works like a giant conveyor belt, pulling warm water from the Southern Hemisphere and tropics to the Northern Hemisphere, where it cools, sinks and flows back south. A growing body of research points to the AMOC slowing down, as higher global temperatures disrupt the delicate balance of heat and salinity on which its strength relies. The science is still unsettled on the likelihood and timing of any collapse, but some studies have projected it could be on course to happen this century. A shutdown of the AMOC “cannot be considered a low likelihood risk anymore in view of the evolving science over the past years,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, a physical oceanographer and climatologist who has studied the AMOC at Potsdam University in Germany. Scientists mapped what happens if a crucial system of ocean currents collapses. The impacts would be catastrophic — ushering in huge global weather and climate shifts, including rising sea levels in parts of the US and Europe, disrupted monsoon systems affecting countries in Asia and Africa, and a winter deep freeze in Europe, with sea ice potentially creeping southward as far as the United Kingdom. Iceland “would be close to the center of a serious regional cooling,” meaning the country could be surrounded by sea ice, Rahmstorf told CNN. The AMOC regulates Iceland's weather, and its collapse could devastate infrastructure, transport and vital industries including fishing, he said. In September, Iceland's National Security Council designated the current's potential collapse as a national security risk, marking the first time a climate impact has received this designation in the country. Rahmstorf commended Iceland for its decision and said other countries should follow suit. Scientists are trying to understand the full range of potential impacts on societies and economies, but research has pointed to destroyed crops and catastrophic flooding. Iceland's decision marks a shift in how the country understands climate risks, Jóhannsson said. “What we do know is that the current climate might change so drastically that it could become impossible for us to adapt,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exit polls showed women voters strongly favored Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia, helping them defeat their Republican opponents. They could once again boost Democrats into power during the 2026 elections. But winning them over to the Republican side will take a mix of solutions, both political and cultural, that won't be easy to implement. “There's a number of things that the Republican Party can be doing right now. And one, it's acknowledging the diversity of the roles that women play in their households,” said Erin Maguire, a GOP consultant who has worked on presidential super PACs. Tiffany Justice, executive vice president of Heritage Action, claimed that appealing to women voters isn't “complicated” but takes a common-sense approach. “The issues women care about aren't complicated: safety, parental rights, education freedom, protecting our kids, and affordability,” Justice said. “When the GOP speaks directly to those concerns, consistently, boldly, and without apology, women will respond, because they're experiencing the consequences of Democratic policies every single day.” Gov.-elects Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Mikie Sherrill (D-VA), as well as New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani (D), all ran on a campaign message of affordability that appealed to voters who still feel economic uncertainty under the Trump administration. Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs have resulted in higher costs for consumers, and a record-breaking government shutdown will likely cost the nation hundreds of millions of dollars. Spanberger and Sherrill, both moderate Democrats, won the total women's vote, according to CNN's exit polls. “Republicans are connecting with women by focusing on the issues that matter most to their families — affordability, safety, and a secure border,” Kiersten Pels, RNC press secretary, said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “In addition, through the Women Increasing Numbers (WIN) initiative, the RNC is providing women with training, tools, and hands-on opportunities to lead on voter registration, poll watching, and get-out-the-vote efforts in their communities.” Trump won reelection largely by claiming he could fix the economy after four years under former President Joe Biden's leadership. Gas prices have fallen under Trump, but voter malaise over the economy has continued. Proposals such as a 50-year mortgage to ease housing costs have met swift blowback, while possible tariff exemptions for coffee and bananas are an implicit admission by the Trump administration that tariffs are hurting consumers. I think the Republican Party, and I've said this for you know, for years, does a really poor job talking to women in general about healthcare.” Although abortion was not the top issue for voters during this year's elections, women's healthcare still remains a key topic as they vote. Polls have also shown that cultural issues remain prominent among Gen Z women voters. But when these young voters were asked to rank their personal definition of success, a significant fissure erupted. Young women and men, 18-29, who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, ranked having a job or career you find fulfilling as their top choice. But young men who voted for Trump said having children was their top choice, and young women who voted for Trump said achieving financial independence was their top choice. I don't think so, and here's why,” said entrepreneur-turned-pastor Dale Partridge in a video posted on X. “Hey @GOP, I know you are a mess after Tuesday, so let me spell this out clearly,” Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, responded. Hey @GOP, I know you are a mess after Tuesday, so let me spell this out clearly. “These are not people that have ever been traditionally within the political kind of movement,” she said. The GOP having conversations about fixing healthcare and housing costs and helping families survive on one spouse's salary, Hawkins claimed, is necessary to appeal to women. Women are very practical voters, despite what these fringe a**holes like to say,” Hawkins said. The effort to repeal the 19th Amendment also comes amid virulent sexism from conservative influencer Nick Fuentes, who blamed women for low birth rates in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in late October. “The men are extremely conservative, increasingly,” Fuentes said on Carlson's show. “The women are extremely liberal.” Carlson himself claimed during that same interview: “I'm a little sexist.” “Fringe internet posters aren't the GOP, and women know it. She continued, “And let's be honest: if the Republican Party spent as much time getting out the vote as some people do trolling online, we wouldn't be in this position. Nor are op-eds asking if women — or “liberal feminism” — ruined the workplace. Katie Frost, a Georgia Republican strategist, also cautioned that extremist comments happen on both sides of the aisle. What I would just say is online discourse is not the real world, and a few crank tweets does not a policy make,” said Frost. Some of the content online is completely divorced from reality,” she added. “We have to message to women that the Republican Party is the party that cares about keeping you and your family and your community safe,” Frost said.</p>

Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports on politicians and partners of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy allegedly participating in an energy corruption scandal on ‘Special Report.' The Trump administration has so far remained silent on a widening corruption scandal inside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government and inner circle. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on a $100 million corruption probe announced this week that has already prompted the resignations of senior Ukrainian officials. Corruption has long been a friction point in U.S.–Ukraine relations. At the same time, Trump's associates sought information on then–Democratic rival Joe Biden, who served as vice president under Barack Obama. Meanwhile, Biden's son Hunter held a $50,000-per-month board seat at the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma. As vice president, Joe Biden had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine dismissed prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whom Western governments accused of failing to pursue corruption cases. President Donald Trump for months has been working to secure a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, which the U.S. has provided with around $175 billion in aid since the start of the war in 2022. Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies — the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAP) — said they spent 15 months on "Operation Midas," a probe that included roughly 1,000 hours of wiretaps. Investigators say the inquiry uncovered a kickback scheme in which contractors for the state-owned nuclear company Energoatom paid 10 to 15 percent bribes, totaling about $100 million, to keep government contracts. According to prosecutors, the alleged ringleader was Timur Mindich, a longtime associate of Zelenskyy and co-owner of his former production studio, as well as an advisor to Justice Minister German Galushchenko. Authorities say Galushchenko, who served as energy minister until July, helped facilitate the money laundering operation and acted under Mindich's influence. Mindich fled Ukraine early Monday, hours before investigators raided his home. Both Galushchenko and his successor, Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk, said they would resign at Zelenskyy's request. Five suspects have been arrested, and seven others placed under official suspicion, prosecutors said. In a statement, NABU alleged that the criminal network transferred funds to "an unnamed former deputy prime minister of Ukraine," identified internally by the codename Che Guevara. Investigators said about $1.2 million was traced to that individual. Zelenskyy has not been directly implicated, but the revelations cast a shadow over a president who built his career on promises to root out graft. He publicly backed the investigation, saying Monday night that "any effective action against corruption is very necessary" and that "the inevitability of punishment is necessary." Earlier this year, Zelenskyy faced backlash after proposing tighter presidential oversight of Ukraine's independent anti-corruption agencies — a plan he later withdrew. Before entering politics, the former comedian often joked about his country's entrenched corruption. "Is it possible to become president and not steal?" "It's a rhetorical question, as no one has tried so far." His 2019 election campaign centered on dismantling the oligarch-dominated political system and increasing transparency. Now, nearly seven years later — with no election planned amid wartime conditions — some Ukrainians view him as increasingly reliant on a small inner circle consolidating their own power and wielding it with limited checks. Investigators say some of the laundered money had been earmarked for equipment meant to protect energy facilities from Russian missile attacks. Last week, the European Commission praised Ukraine's "significant efforts" to combat corruption but warned that "limited progress" could jeopardize its bid to join the European Union. The commission also cautioned that reports of political pressure on anti-corruption groups "cast doubt on Ukraine's commitment" and urged Kyiv to "prevent any backsliding on its notable reform achievements."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has said he believes Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's days are numbered, and that land strikes inside Venezuela are possible. Experts say that the US doesn't currently have the military assets in place to launch a largescale operation to remove Maduro from power, though Trump has approved covert action within Venezuela, CNN has reported. But if Trump did order strikes inside Venezuela aimed at ousting Maduro, he could face serious challenges with fractured opposition elements and a military poised for insurgency, according to experts, as well as political backlash at home for a president who promised to avoid costly entanglements overseas. CNN reported that Trump received a briefing earlier this week to review updated options for military action inside Venezuela, a concept the White House has been weighing. The concentration of military assets and threats of further attacks beyond the ongoing drug boat campaign have served to increase pressure on Maduro, with administration officials saying he needs to leave office while arguing that he's closely tied to the Tren de Aragua gang and leading drug trafficking efforts. But if Maduro does flee Venezuela or is killed out in a targeted strike, experts worry about a military takeover of the country or the boosting of another dictator similar to Maduro. “If the military is still cohesive, and I don't think we see any evidence it is not, they will not collapse because there is a challenge to or an ouster of Maduro,” said John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser in his first term. “They will follow their discipline, assert military control, and suppress anyone who goes into the streets.” Maduro, whose inner circle is made up of both civilians and military officers who are often in competition with each other, is known to have tight control over his administration and has helped stabilize competing factions. External forces, like Colombian insurgent groups who regularly operate from Venezuela or criminal syndicates linked to cocaine, gold and mineral trafficking further complicate the picture. Were Maduro to disappear, these pulls could tear the nation apart – descending into a potential civil war, experts said. “Whether you like it or not, Maduro is the guarantor of the equilibrium,” said a Western diplomat who has spent years in Venezuela, asking to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss with the press. “Everyone knows he's been politically dead since last year's election, but if he leaves there's nobody who can maintain the status quo … so they all close ranks around him.” The Trump administration may hope that Venezuelan opposition figures would be able to step into a power vacuum created by the removal of Maduro, something that the first Trump administration considered as it propped up Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido after a 2018 election victory for Maduro that was decried internationally as rigged. That first Trump administration officially recognized Guaido as the legitimate leader of Venezuela in 2019, but a failed coup attempt that year meant he never managed to take power. One current Venezuelan opposition group led by Edmundo Gonzalez, who ran for president last year in an election that the US said Maduro lost, says it has a 100-hour plan to transition the power of Venezuela's government from Maduro to Gonzalez. US officials have also said that Edmuondo Gonzalez, who is currently residing in Spain, is the rightful leader of Venezuela, based on the results of last year's election. The assistance includes support, like gaining access to secure communication capabilities, former US officials said. The opposition's enemies inside Venezuela are not limited to Maduro himself, which is why such sustained outside support is seen as a necessity, experts said. It is unclear how much support Trump would be willing to give any opposition leader who seeks to take the presidency from Maduro. On that basis securing Trump's commitment to long-lasting support for the opposition is likely to be a challenge,” said a GOP congressional staffer. Still, if Trump backs away from a potential opportunity to oust Maduro now, some believe it could be viewed as a lost opportunity. If he backs down now and Maduro survives, there goes all the ‘new Monroe Doctrine' talk and the idea of being supreme in our own hemisphere.” said Elliott Abrams, a former senior State Department official in Trump's first term. Even while some say that displacing Maduro could be done without US troops on the ground for an extended period, they say that the US commitment following any kinetic strikes needs to be long-lasting or else the effort could easily fall apart. “If the force is decisive it can disband a full army. The Maduro regime is propped up in different ways by Russia, China and Cuba. Experts worry that if US strikes hit assets of those nations the conflict could quickly escalate. All three nations have invested in the Venezuelan regime and have instruments that they could bring to bear to prevent Maduro's ouster, experts said. This is something that has happened in the past. “In 2019, the opposition thought that the Cubans had uncovered what they were trying to do with their coup attempt and believe that they made moves to undermine their efforts,” Bolton said. “There is a chance that if Maduro thinks he is going down he might make a move to hit something the US cares about, such as oil platforms in the Caribbean Sea. It could be a gamble he may be willing to take that would harm US interests in the region,” said Henry Ziemer, a regional expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Publicly the Trump administration continues to point to its buildup of military assets in Latin America as supremely focused on counter-drug operations – not an ouster of Maduro. Experts have also previously told CNN that the assembled hardware and troops aren't enough for a full-scale invasion. Still, when asked earlier this month if the US might get into a war with Venezuela, Trump gave an ambiguous answer, saying: “I doubt it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's administration said on Friday it was formally withdrawing a plan by his predecessor to require airlines to pay passengers cash compensation when US flight disruptions are caused by carriers. In September, USDOT first disclosed it planned to withdraw the proposal. On Friday, USDOT said the rules would result in “unnecessary regulatory burdens” in explaining why it would not go forward. “This is a common-sense proposal: when an airline's mistake imposes unanticipated costs on families, the airline should try to remedy the situation by providing accommodations to consumers and helping cover their costs,” said the letter signed by Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal, Maria Cantwell, Ed Markey and others. The European Union, Canada, Brazil and Britain all have airline delay compensation rules. No large US airline currently guarantees cash compensation for significant flight disruption. Biden administration will propose rule requiring airlines to compensate passengers for canceled or delayed flights USDOT said Friday in abandoning the compensation plan that it would “allow airlines to compete on the services and compensation that they provide to passengers rather than imposing new minimum requirements for these services and compensation through regulation, which would impose significant costs on airlines.” USDOT also announced in September it was considering rescinding Biden regulations requiring airlines and ticket agents to disclose service fees alongside airfares. It also plans to reduce regulatory burdens on airlines and ticket agents by writing new rules detailing the definition of a flight cancellation that entitles consumers to ticket refunds, as well as revisiting rules on ticket pricing and advertising.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks to reporters on Air Force One on his way to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., Friday, Nov. 14, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced Friday that he was scrapping U.S. tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and a broad swath of other commodities — a dramatic move that comes amid mounting pressure on his administration to better combat high consumer prices. Trump has built his second term around imposing steep levies on goods imported into the U.S. in hopes of encouraging domestic production and lifting the U.S. economy. His abrupt retreat from his signature tariff policy on so many staples key to the American diet is significant, and it comes after voters in off-year elections this month cited economic concerns as their top issue, resulting in big wins for Democrats in Virginia, New Jersey and other key races around the country. “We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods like coffee,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he flew to Florida hours after the tariff announcement was made. Pressed on his tariffs helping to increase consumer prices, Trump acknowledged, “I say they may, in some cases” have that effect. “But to a large extent they've been borne by other countries,” the president added. Meanwhile, inflation — despite Trump's pronouncements that it has vanished since he took office in January — remains elevated, further increasing pressure on U.S. consumers. The Trump administration has insisted that its tariffs had helped fill government coffers and weren't a major factor in higher prices at grocery stores around the country. “President Trump is finally admitting what we always knew: his tariffs are raising prices for the American people,” Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer said in a statement. Trump slapped tariffs on most countries around the globe in April. He and his administration still say that tariffs don't increase consumer prices, despite economic evidence to the contrary. Record-high beef prices have been a particular concern, and Trump had said he intended to take action to try and lower them. Trump signed an executive order that also removes tariffs on tea, fruit juice, cocoa, spices, bananas, oranges, tomatoes and certain fertilizers. Some of the products covered aren't produced in the United States, meaning that tariffs meant to spur domestic production had little effect. But reducing the tariffs will still likely mean lower prices for U.S. consumers. The Food Industry Association, which represents retailers, producers and a variety of related industry firms and services, applauded Trump's move to provide “swift tariff relief,” noting that import U.S. taxes “are an important factor” in a “complex mix” of supply chain issues. Indeed, Friday's announcement follows the Trump administration having reached framework agreements with Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina meant to increase the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, while also potentially easing tariffs on agricultural products produced there. During an interview that aired earlier in the week with Laura Ingraham of Fox News Channel, Trump hinted that lower tariffs might be coming. “Coffee, we're going to lower some tariffs,” the president said then. Despite pulling back on so many tariffs, Trump used his comments aboard Air Force One on Friday night to repeat his past assertions that his administration would use revenue the federal government has collected from import levies to fund $2,000 checks for many Americans. The president suggested such checks could be issued in 2026, but was vague on timing, saying only, “Sometime during the year.” Trump, however, also said federal tariff revenue might be used to pay down national debt — raising questions about how much federal funding would be needed to do both. Trump rejected suggestions that attempting direct payments to Americans could exacerbate inflation concerns — even as he suggested that similar checks offered during the coronavirus pandemic, and by previous administrations to stimulate the economy, had that very effect.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump rescinded his support and endorsement of Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene (R-GA) after her public criticism of the GOP during the government shutdown. It seemed to all begin when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor, she was at 12%, and didn't have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement — which she wasn't about to get! “I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day,” he wrote. “I understand that wonderful, Conservative people are thinking about primarying Marjorie in her District of Georgia, that they too are fed up with her and her antics and, if the right person runs, they will have my Complete and Unyielding Support. She has gone Far Left, even doing The View, with their Low IQ Republican hating Anchors.” While Trump's post did not mention the files, a Georgia Republican alleged that the president was trying to “make an example” of her to scare other Republicans out of voting for the files' formal release next week. “It's astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,” she added, wishing he would “fight this hard” to help those affected by foreign wars and causes, those who can't afford to feed their families, and are “losing hope of ever achieving the American dream.” “I have supported President Trump with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him,” she said. “But I don't worship or serve Donald Trump.” In another text conversation with a “Natalie,” she defended her comments about the files. It is unclear to whom the second message was sent. Trump later added in comments to reporters on Air Force One that he “already” had people calling to primary Greene in her district. He also said that one of his chief complaints about the Georgia Republican was her criticism of foreign deals. “You think I want go and be on an airplane for 20 hours…and then get off and make a speech, and get people to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in our country? If you didn't go, you wouldn't be able to have that kind of result,” he told reporters. No one cares about the never-ending amount of foreign leaders coming to the White House every single week,” Greene told NBC News. And I completely agree with them,” she wrote. Greene has once solidified herself as the House's most ardent Trump supporter, but earlier this week, she waved off criticism from Trump that she had “lost her way.” Greene told reporters she “100% hasn't changed” and that she is “okay” with the president not liking her.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins, right, speaks during a farm tour in Lebanon, Ind., Thursday, Oct. 30, 2025. (AP) — New data the Agriculture Department released Friday created serious doubts about whether China will really buy millions of bushels of American soybeans like the Trump administration touted last month after a high-stakes meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. That's well short of the 12 million metric tons that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said China agreed to purchase by January and nowhere near the 25 million metric tons she said they would buy in each of the next three years. But CoBank's Tanner Ehmke, who is its lead economist for grains and oilseed, said there isn't much incentive for China to buy from America right now because they have plenty of soybeans on hand that they have bought from Brazil and other South American countries this year, and the remaining tariffs ensure that U.S. soybeans remain more expensive than Brazilian beans. “We are still not even close to what has been advertised from the U.S. in terms of what the agreement would have been,” Ehmke said. Beijing has yet to confirm any detailed soybean purchase agreement but only that the two sides have reached “consensus” on expanding trade in farm products. Ehmke said that even if China did promise to buy American soybeans it may have only agreed to buy them if the price was attractive. Trump said his team spoke with Chinese officials today and they assured the White House they would be purchasing more soybeans, but he didn't offer any details of how much. “They're in the process of doing not only a little bit but they'll be doing a lot of soybean purchases,” he told reporters. Soybean prices fell sharply by 23 cents to $11.24 per bushel Friday. Ehmke said “that's the market being shocked by the lack of Chinese demand that was confirmed in USDA data today.” Prices are still higher than they were before the agreement when they were selling for $10.60 per bushel, but the price may continue to drop unless there are significant new purchases. Before the trade agreement, Trump had promised farmers would receive an aid package to help them survive the trade war with China. That was put on hold during the shutdown, and now it's not clear whether the administration will offer farmers aid like Trump did in his first administration. American farmers have been through this before after Trump's first trade war with China. In 2022, U.S. farm exports to China hit a record, but then fell. Soybean prices are actually still a little higher than they were a year ago even without China's normal purchases of roughly one-quarter of the U.S. crop. That's because this year's soybean crop is a little smaller while domestic demand remained strong with the continued growth in biodiesel production. But farmers are dealing with the soaring cost of fertilizer, seed, equipment and labor this year, and that is hurting their profits. The Kentucky farmer who is president of the American Soybean Association, Caleb Ragland, has said he worries that thousands of farmers could go out of business this year without significant Chinese purchases or government aid. Ragland said he's still optimistic that China will follow through on the purchases, but it's hard to be confident in that right now with so few sales reported. China is the world's largest buyer of soybeans. But China quit buying American soybeans this year after Trump imposed his tariffs and continued to shift more of their purchases over to South America. Even before the trade war, Brazilian beans accounted for more than 70% of China's imports last year, while the U.S. share fell to 21%, World Bank data shows. Ragland said that every vender he talks to has told him they are increasing their prices for next year, which will continue to put pressure on farmers. “We're still looking at sharp losses and the red ink as we figure budgets for 26 is still very much in play,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Behn is facing Republican Matt Van Epps in the general election on Dec. 2, a date chosen by Gov. But a lot is riding on this election: if Republicans can hold on to the seat, it helps boost Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-LA) razor-thin margin. Van Epps sailed to victory largely thanks to an endorsement from Trump and his capitalization on his nine active duty tours. But the nonpartisan analyst noted that that may not be enough to rally support from the GOP's voting base, which is already lackluster to vote for ballots where Trump's name is not at the top. She ran an unapologetic populist and progressive platform, and her campaign pointed to early voting totals in her victory announcement that showed Republicans at 50.52% and Democrats at 49.28%, “underscoring the competitiveness of a race many assumed would be unwinnable for Democrats.” Although the Democratic Gov.-elects, Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, ran centrist campaigns focused on lowering costs and making their states more affordable, New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani also attracted thousands of voters thanks to his affordability platform. With Democrats dominating New Jersey, New York, and Virginia, the party further down south is hoping they can make a splash in an otherwise red stronghold by connecting on similar issues. To boost turnout, Behn has enlisted the help of prominent Democrats, including Martin and Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX). “And Aftyn is not only within striking distance, she's on the verge of making this happen with all your help,” Martin told the canvassers. The Cook Political Report said in its analysis that public polling still shows an edge for Van Epps, with an Oct. 16-19 survey finding the Republican leading Behn by single digits, 52% to 44%. “We saw what happened last week in America: All across the United States, Democratic energy is up. “Aftyn Behn gives us an opportunity to send a fresh face, a fresh voice, and a fighter to Congress, and that's what we're excited about and what we're looking forward to.” “If we are able to get close or flip it, I think it is a testament to how the Democratic playbook will be rewritten in the South, which is one of running on affordability issues and not responding to the cultural issues that the right is weaponizing,” Behn said. Republicans currently have a 2-1 record in House special elections this year, gaining two new GOP lawmakers in the House thanks to Reps. Jimmy Patronis (R-FL) and Randy Fine (R-FL) are holding on to red seats. Democrats won the Arizona special election, with Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ) finally being sworn in on Wednesday after a weekslong delay during the government shutdown. Democrats will fill the seat left vacant by the late Rep. Sylvester Turner in Texas, with two Democrats advancing to a runoff election that could take place as late as January 31, according to Houston Public Media. With a projected Republican win in Tennessee and a projected Democratic win in Texas, the House will return to its 220-215 numbers, meaning Johnson can afford to lose only two votes to still pass legislation along party lines. However, Nashville Democrats are energized after losing their congressional representation due to redistricting in 2022. The Washington Examiner reached out to Behn and Van Epps for comment.</p>
