                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Image courtesy of Dark Horse / Provided with permission. Dark Horse has a new four-part miniseries from writer Kyle Starks and artist Piotr Kowalski. This one is called Devil on My Shoulder and follows the story of Tee, a character who faces unimaginable horrors from a group of five men. She survives the ordeal and vows to seek revenge, but what's unexpected is that her journey soon proves supernatural and otherworldly. Issue #1 of Devil on My Shoulder is now available from Dark Horse, and recently Hollywood Soapbox exchanged emails with Starks to learn more about the character of Tee and what she encounters in this evil, evil world. On this project, he's also joined by colorist Brad Simpson and letterer Josh Reed. Questions and answers have been slightly edited for style. One of the things I love about horror as a genre is it's nearly unlimited list of sub-genres, and I often come up with these horror ideas watching some movie or reading some book and going, “Aw, man, I want to make one of those.” With Where Monsters Lie, it was a love letter to slashers. With Those Not Afraid, it was a love letter to serial killers and true crime, and with Devil on My Shoulder, I wanted to make a true bloody revenge like we haven't seen in awhile but to put a little Kyle Starks twist on it all. The inspiration for the story itself was inspired by the truly awful, true story of the torture and death of Junko Furuta, which is a truly horrific tale, and honestly, I wanted to make a world where someone who suffered like that got their revenge on the group of monsters that did it to them. So it was a combination of the two. Is the real world and what actually happens out there scarier than anything supernatural? But what happened to Junko Furuta is worse and more terrifying than any demon or monster or boogeyman, in my opinion. Well, I don't want to spoil anything, but absolutely. This terrible event and its subsequent revenge definitely take place in a world with supernatural elements. And if there's a world with exorcism, then there's a world of — you know, let's not say too much. How would you describe the character of Tee? Tee is your normal, average early 20s girl trying to figure out existing in the world when she's kidnapped, tortured for 40 days, left for dead and comes out the other side a murderous, single-minded, revenge-seeking killing machine. In a book full of nearly supernaturally bad and dangerous people, she's the most bad and dangerous. I think we work really well together — he seems to get my vision and is able to elevate the parts that need it without having to be given really any direction at all. We had a blast working on the Where Monsters Lie franchise together, and my biggest takeaway was that Piotr is capable of drawing some really messed up stuff. And so he was a perfect partner for Devil on My Shoulder because it's full of messed up stuff. And he really stepped up his storytelling here, in my opinion. If you enjoyed his work on Where Monsters Lie — or any of the other numerous works he's contributed to — you'll love this. I feel like his work is very cinematic for this series. Do you feel that the story has mileage to go beyond four issues? I think it creates a world that there's more to be explored for sure, but when I approach these stories with the new status quo of four-issue series, I want to tell the best story for that moment. Devil on My Shoulder, written by Kyle Starks, is now available from Dark Horse. His writing has appeared in The New York Times, Earth Island Journal, The Hollywood Reporter, New Jersey Monthly and at Time.com, among other publications.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mumbai— A resurfaced video of legendary filmmaker Satyajit Ray has renewed debate over long-standing allegations that his unmade screenplay The Alien was plagiarised and later emerged as the Hollywood blockbuster ‘E.T. “Long before E.T., my science fiction screenplay was germinated from that story,” Ray says in the video. “I wrote a science fiction story called The Alien, full screenplay, which was supposed to be financed by Columbia. That is why I spent five weeks in Hollywood… It's only that I had a person who was working as a middleman, who behaved peculiarly, and the idea had to be dropped.” Satyajit Ray, regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers in world cinema, left an indelible mark with works celebrated for their humanism, subtle emotional power, and visual precision. Born in Kolkata into a culturally prominent family, Ray's artistic formation was shaped by literature, music, and the teachings of Visva-Bharati University. His breakthrough film, ‘Pather Panchali', made with limited resources and non-professional actors, won international acclaim, including at Cannes. Ray's filmography eventually grew to more than 30 films, including Charulata, Mahanagar, Jalsaghar, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, and Shatranj ke Khilari. His lifetime achievements earned him numerous honors, including India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, and an Honorary Oscar in 1992.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Dyatlov Pass Mystery — A True Story That Still Haunts Europe And then there are those rare, chilling enigmas that come from real events—events so frightening, so inexplicable, so painfully documented that even the most rational mind is forced to pause. The Dyatlov Pass Incident is exactly that kind of mystery. This is a case where all evidence exists, all people involved were real, and every photograph, autopsy report, and weather log is still preserved. A group of nine university students, all trained hikers and physically fit, planned a challenging expedition as part of their certification. Their diary entries from the early days of the trip were cheerful—jokes about cold weather, photos of laughing faces, handwritten notes about warm food and tired feet. Nothing suggested the horror that awaited them. They set up their tent on the snowy slope. It was the last normal moment any of them ever experienced. It wasn't blown over or ripped by wildlife. It was still standing—but cut open from the inside, as if the hikers had slashed their way out in panic. Inside the tent lay their boots, jackets, gloves, and supplies. If trained hikers were fleeing into −30°C weather without essential gear, then whatever forced them out must have been far more terrifying than the freezing night. Searchers found barefoot footprints, along with prints of socks—and even one set that seemed to be a single bare heel dragging across the ice. Imagine the level of fear required for experienced hikers to run barefoot into a mountain blizzard. The tracks led downhill, toward a forest. And that's where the bodies began to appear. At the edge of the woods, beneath a towering cedar tree, two hikers were found beside a small fire. They were almost naked, their skin blue from cold, and their fingers blackened as though burned—like they had desperately tried to keep the flames alive until the last breath. The cedar tree above them told its own story: as if someone climbed in a frantic attempt to look back toward the campsite— It looked as though they simply collapsed on their way back. But the remaining four hikers told a story that defied all logic. Months later, as the snow melted, another group of searchers stumbled upon a ravine. There—buried under thirteen feet of snow—lay the last four hikers. Their injuries were unlike anything the investigators expected: • One had a crushed chest, with ribs broken inward. • A female hiker's tongue, eyes, and part of her lips were missing. Despite the internal injuries, there were no external wounds. A forensic doctor later compared their injuries to the impact of Some rescuers also claimed they witnessed the same lights while searching. Several garments had levels of radiation far above normal exposure. Yet no military base nearby reported any incident. After months of interviews, autopsies, weather analysis, and scene reconstruction, Soviet investigators wrote their final line: “The hikers died due to a compelling natural force.” • an avalanche (but the tent remained intact) • infra-sound panic (a theory even scientists debate) that they ran barefoot into a deadly blizzard— was powerful enough to break bones from the inside. Today, the Dyatlov Pass is a tourist attraction. But many who visit the site report something strange: that seems to echo from deep within the snow. What remains is a mystery that refuses to die— a puzzle of ice, fear, and silence that has haunted Europe for more than six decades. ✨ “I share mysteries 🔍, stories 📖, and the wonders of the modern world 🌍 — all in a way that keeps you hooked!” I always thought fear came from things we didn't understand. This year has been a great one for movies, and del Toro's Frankenstein continues that trend. When Lydia first built ECHO, she didn't intend to create life. The apartment was too quiet after Daniel died—her younger brother, the only person who truly understood her code and her silence. His absence was the first thing she noticed every morning, like a missing semicolon that broke the whole program of her life. By Vocal Curation Teamabout 24 hours ago in Resources</p>

Kim, 45, confirmed she had failed the bar last Friday after originally taking the painstaking exam in July, two months after graduating from a four year California Law Office Study Program (LOSP). The TV star, who also plays a divorce lawyer in new legal drama All's Fair, is keen to follow in her late father Robert Kardashian's footsteps by qualifying to practice law. Kim recently admitted she was furious with her psychics for giving her false hope by incorrectly determining she would pass. 'I'm just letting you guys know that all of the f****** psychics we have met with, and that we're obsessed with, are all f****** full of s***', Kim said. 'They all collectively, maybe four them, told me I was gonna pass the bar, so they're all full pathological liars. Despite Kim's foul-mouthed phone tirade, medium Sally Morgan, 74, remains hopeful Kim will pass the bar, specifically in March 2026, and also predicted what the mother-of-four failed on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thunderstorms this evening followed by occasional showers overnight. DuBOIS — A quick stop at Junk Dealer's Daughter, a quaint antique shop in downtown DuBois, turned into a literary milestone for author Sherry A. Burton, whose hit paranormal mystery series has now anchored one of its latest chapters right here in central Pennsylvania. Burton, the Michigan-based author of the Jerry McNeal series, never expected that a February getaway would inspire Book 16 of her growing franchise, or that she would write local shop owner Darius Clement into the story. I could see Jerry and his ghost dog solving a mystery right there.” Now, Clement and his downtown DuBois antique store are featured in “Hidden Treasures,” Book 16 in the Jerry McNeal paranormal mystery series, a collection beloved by readers for its bite-sized thrillers, ghostly twists, and quirky canine sidekick. But I started writing, and the voices just showed up. That first novel, “Tears of Betrayal,” was published in 2011 and remains a steady seller. “My editor at the time said, ‘You should go indie.' Today, Burton juggles multiple genres, including romance, psychological suspense, and historical fiction. The original Jerry McNeal book was only supposed to be a standalone. “It was meant to be about Jerry, a Pennsylvania state trooper and veteran with psychic abilities,” said Burton. The dog now appears on every book cover, drawing in readers of all ages. “People say they're ‘potato chip books,'” she laughed. Each book runs about 200 pages, making them quick, engaging reads that are appropriate for all ages. “I had a friend who said big books intimidate him. He saw one of mine and said, ‘I could read this.' It was Gunter's ghostly sniffing and Jerry's investigative intuition that led Burton to imagine a DuBois-based mystery after walking through Clement's antique shop. She had barely stepped into the store before asking the owner if she could write him into her next book. “I was flattered, and totally on board,” said Clement. The store's historic quirks, including a now-hidden staircase and rumors of underground tunnels, became core elements of “Hidden Treasures.” DuBois readers now stop in to visit the “real” setting of their favorite chapters. Clement even keeps a copy of the book handy for fans. “I call it a Jerry McNeal pilgrimage,” he joked. “People come in, buy antiques, and ask where the ghosts were hiding.” In the latest books, Jerry and Gunter travel from DuBois to nearby Punxsutawney and then on to a cruise ship in Book 18. The books tell me where they want to go.” She also recently met the voice behind her audiobook series, narrator Bethanne Reid, based in Doylestown. “Beth morphs into each character — Jerry, Bunny, everyone. You can get it on Audible or directly from my site.” The books are also available in eBook and Kindle Unlimited formats, and readers can use the Kindle app to access them on any device, including iPads. In addition to her paranormal success, Burton is known for her Orphan Train Saga, a heavily researched historical fiction series inspired by the real-life relocation of more than 250,000 children from New York to the American Midwest between 1854 and 1929. I had never heard of the Orphan Trains,” she said. Her saga is endorsed by the National Orphan Train Complex as historically accurate and includes in-depth research and lectures. “I'm now working on Book 8 of that series,” she said. “They're big books, with some over 100,000 words, and fully researched. One of the future orphans will definitely be placed in Pennsylvania.” Burton's mother, who passed away after battling breast cancer, was her biggest cheerleader, and perhaps her most insightful editor. “She'd hand out my business cards to nurses, tell people in waiting rooms, always promoting my work,” Burton remembered. “Now I like to say she's up there in heaven telling all the angels, ‘Have your people read my daughter's books. The Jerry McNeal books are available in print, eBook, and audiobook. Readers can find them on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Kindle Unlimited, and directly through SherryABurton.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex Ramage and Andrei Volk were merely testing the zoom on their phone camera by filming an aeroplane when they spotted something that left them gobsmacked. The footage, captured during their work break in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, US, on Tuesday 4 November, reveals a mysterious oval entity 'gliding' across the sky. Both Alex and Andrei, 38, adamantly deny doctoring the video and are at a loss to explain what the unidentified object could be. Alex, hailing from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, expressed: "We thought it was pretty wild and we were freaking out about it. "To me it looks like you can make out a dome shape in the middle of the disk, like a traditional UFO people imagine. "It looked way different than the movement of a plane. "We were in shock and awe because I've always believed in UFOs but to experience it for myself is amazing. "It was a speechless moment because we were just randomly filming something. The video, captured by factory workers at 12.13pm, left social media users scratching their heads, with some asserting it as proof of extraterrestrial life, while others remained sceptical. One user remarked: "Looks like it's rotating around. Have been for a very long time." However, one individual simply dismissed it, stating: "Not a UFO!" Scientists have been examining images taken before the beginning of the Space Age and have discovered mysterious flashes of light that appear in one image and then vanish in the next. Studies suggest that some of those blips may be sunlight bouncing off flat, reflective objects high above Earth, years before Russia launched the first satellite, Sputnik.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The horrific mystery of the “Armchair Killer” is among a number of Coventry cold cases that have been highlighted by a new crime map revealing 1,000 unsolved murders. This exclusive list was compiled from Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to every police force in the country, supported by research through a wide variety of local newspaper archives.

Penelope, aged 44, was found slumped in an armchair at her home. Despite an exhaustive murder hunt, the killer has never been identified. Other Coventry cases highlighted in the map include the mysterious disappearance of 18-year-old mum Nicola Payne, who vanished as she walked into fog on a wasteland known as Black Pad on the way to see her parents in 1991; and schoolboy Mark Billington, who was found dead in Meriden, two months after he vanished. It is thought he may have been a victim of child killer Brian Field, who died in prison last year, more than 20 years after he was jailed for the 1968 murder of 14-year-old Roy Tutill. It seeks to reexamine cold cases that have been held in the files of police forces nationwide, in some cases for decades. Each remains an enigma, with families still seeking justice and answers - and in many cases, the murderer may still walk the streets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rumors and stories of special appearances made by Jesus Christ in the town of Dozulé, France, have been declared not true. There is a similar and smaller cross on display in the town. “The Cross does not need 738 meters of steel or concrete to be recognized: It is raised every time a heart, moved by grace, opens itself to forgiveness.” The town had a population of 2,279 people in 2022, according to Ville-Data. Father Patrick Mary Briscoe, a Dominican friar based in Rome, Italy, told Fox News Digital the Dozulé messages inspired curiosity in some circles. Father Briscoe said Pope Leo's approval of this declaration shows how seriously the church takes discernment in spiritual matters — “not to suppress faith, but to purify it” — and to ensure that faith is not anchored by emotion or speculation, but truth. “His recent comments on compulsive gambling and internet addiction, for example, show that he's thinking about pressing issues.” Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.

He shared that doctrinal clarity helps protect Christian teaching from superstition and excess. “The Vatican's discernment here safeguards authentic devotion. This is about protecting believers from confusion,” said Briscoe. Instead, Pope Leo is keeping the focus where it belongs — on Christ.”</p>
