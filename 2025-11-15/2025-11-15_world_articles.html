                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He studied at Liberty, a Christian university founded by the conservative pastor and televangelist Jerry Falwell, and recalls wearing a T-shirt expressing opposition to Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. Two decades later, Justin Douglas is running for the US Congress – as a Democrat. He is among around 30 Christian white clergy – pastors, seminary students and other faith leaders – known to be potential Democratic candidates in next year's midterm elections, including a dozen who are already in the race. While stressing the separation of church and state, many say that on a personal level their faith is calling them into the political arena. Douglas, 41, based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, is among a new generation of the Christian left aiming to change that narrative by ensuring that the Democratic brand is not associated with only college-educated urbanites, but can also connect with white working class churchgoers. “We've seen Democrats time and time again sell out working class people and we've seen Democrats time and time again look like liberal elitists who are looking down on people who think going to church on Sunday is a core part of their life,” said Douglas, who has been in ministry for more than 20 years. “But I also think the stereotypes of Republicans being pro-faith are bullshit too. We're seeing a current administration bastardise faith almost every day. For decades, many white Christians were not partisan and often voted Democratic, especially in the south. Many white conservative Christians felt increasingly alienated from the party they had long inhabited. His followers then felt betrayed when Jimmy Carter, the first evangelical Christian to occupy the White House, failed to pursue their priorities. That has persisted over the past decade under Donald Trump, seen by critics as vulgar and unchristian but by supporters as a blunt instrument to defend a church under siege by a godless liberal culture. It was a troubling realignment that caught the eye of Doug Pagitt, a pastor and executive director of the progressive Christian group Vote Common Good. Republicans have oriented themselves primarily around religious voter identity and Democrats have set aside religious voter identity, including the fact that in 1992 Democrats removed from the voter access file the category of religious identity.” Trump's first election was the trigger for a new wave of white clergy to overcome fears of being seen as partisan and run for elected office. Pagitt added: “After 2016 and 2018, a whole lot of people started thinking: ‘Hey, maybe running for office is something we should actually do.' “Few people are surprised when Raphael Warnock says, ‘I'm a working pastor at Ebenezer Baptist church.' He comes from the Martin Luther King tradition, from that pulpit, and it made sense: people are like, ‘Yeah, of course a Black clergyman's going to run as a Democrat.' It's taken some of these people a little while to get comfortable with the fact that they are going to be partisan.” Vote Common Good was founded in response to a schism created by the election of Trump, which left many religious people feeling “politically homeless”. The group operates as a “dating service”, connecting these voters with Democrats and non-Maga Republicans. Douglas is a county commissioner looking to unseat Republican Scott Perry in Pennsylvania's 10th district. But he was previously the lead pastor of a growing church that allowed LGBTQ+ individuals to participate fully in its community; over the course of a year this developed into a huge bone of contention and in 2019 Douglas eventually lost his licence. He had to find a new house and go from one job to three jobs including driving an Uber and CrossFit coaching. He started a new church that is still operating today. It taught me that doing what's right is often costly but always necessary, and everyone deserves to be safe, respected and fully included. In a series of social media posts, he deploys scripture to champion the poor and vulnerable while castigating Republicans for what he casts as their drift towards Christian nationalism and corporate interests. In Iowa, state representative Sarah Trone Garriott, an Evangelical Lutheran pastor, is seeking her party's nod to challenge Republican incumbent Zach Nunn in what is already billed as one of the nation's marquee congressional races. In Arkansas, Robb Ryerse, a Christian pastor and former Republican, is mounting a challenge to congressman Steve Womack, adopting the slogan “Faith, Family & Freedom” – rhetoric more commonly found in Republican campaign literature. Ryerse, 50, from Springdale, Arkansas, said: “I joke sometimes that the two people who have changed my life more than any others are Jesus and Donald Trump, for very different reasons. He has used them to validate him to their followers and they have used him to further their agenda, which has been a Christian nationalist culture war on the United States, which I think is bad for both the church and for the country.” White clergy are deciding to run for office, Ryerse believes, in part as a response to the rise of Christian nationalism and the reality that, according to a Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) survey, Trump won 85% of the white evangelical vote in last year's presidential election. Ryerse said: “We realise hey, our churches and the people in our churches have been duped by this guy and so rather than hope someone else will clean up the problem, what we've seen is a lot of pastors respond with, you know what, I'm going to jump in and I'm going to be a part of the solution. “On a more positive note, there's also that notion we need to do something for the common good.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) drone strikes on Russian Novorossiysk's port and oil facilities on Nov. 14 destroyed four S-400 "Triumph" launchers and two radars, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent. Ukraine launched long-range drone strikes on Novorossiysk, targeting an oil depot, a container terminal, coastal infrastructure, and a ship, according to preliminary reports. Novorossiysk handles not only Russian oil but also shipments from Kazakhstan, moving over 2 million barrels per day, which accounts for roughly 5% of global maritime oil supplies. Oil prices jumped about 2% on the morning of Nov. 14 amid supply concerns after Ukrainian drones struck an oil storage facility at the Russian port. Novorossiysk, a key Black Sea export hub, also suspended oil shipments following the attack overnight on Nov. 14, according to Reuters. Kateryna Hodunova is a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a sports journalist in several Ukrainian outlets and was the deputy chief editor at Suspilne Sport. She holds a bachelor's degree in political journalism from Taras Shevchenko University and a master's degree in political science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. Ukraine launched long-range drone strikes on Novorossiysk, targeting an oil depot, a container terminal, coastal infrastructure, and a ship, according to preliminary reports. Polish President Karol Nawrocki announced that he would no longer sign the law providing aid to Ukrainians unless a "new solution" is found. Ryazan Governor Pavel Malkov confirmed the attack and said one enterprise, whose name he did not disclose, sustained damage. Serhii Vlasenko, 35, has served in Ukraine's Emergency Service for 15 years and was on duty as a shift supervisor when the attack occurred. Ukrainian forces withdrew from the village of Novovasylivske in Zaporizhzhia Oblast to "more favorable defensive positions," the Southern Defense Forces said on Nov. 15. North Korean artillery supplies enabled Russia to maintain its firing rate in 2024, but this year, that support has declined markedly. The U.S. Coast Guard detected and monitored a Russian intelligence-gathering ship operating near the Hawaiian Islands on Oct. 29, according to a press release published Nov. 13. Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration's clemency drive is coming under scrutiny after the justice department this week replaced pardons posted online that bore strikingly similar copies of Trump's signature with others that are distinctively variable. The corrections came after online commenters seized on the similarities in the president's signature granting “full and unconditional” pardons to seven men, including to former New York Mets player Darryl Strawberry, former Tennessee House speaker Glen Casada and former New York police sergeant Michael McMahon, on 7 November. “There is no story here other than the fact that President Trump signed seven pardons by hand and [the Department of Justice] posted those same seven pardons with seven unique signatures to our website,” Gilmartin said in a statement to the Associated Press, referring to the latest wave of clemency Trump has granted in recent weeks. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an email that Trump “signed each one of these pardons by hand as he does with all pardons”. “The media should spend their time investigating Joe Biden's countless autopenned pardons, not covering a non-story,” she wrote. The errors come after a sustained administration campaign to undermine the validity of pardons issued by Trump's predecessor Joe Biden that were in many cases signed by autopen. Trump has claimed that Biden was not aware of the signatures on orders and pardons bearing his name. Trump, who typically makes an elaborate show of signing executive orders with a Sharpie at afternoon press calls, has gone so far as to replace Biden's portrait in a new “Presidential Walk of Fame” he created along the West Wing colonnade with a picture of an autopen. Asked last week if he had considered replacing that image with a portrait, Trump responded: “No, I don't think so.” Questions about Trump's signature come amid a new flurry of clemency orders. Zhao, who is also known as “CZ”, pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering in 2023. “A basic axiom of handwriting identification science is that no two signatures are going to bear the exact same design features in every aspect,” Thomas Vastrick, a Florida-based handwriting expert and president of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners, told the AP. The pardons issued by Trump earlier this month include Casada, a disgraced former Republican speaker of the Tennessee house who was sentenced in September to three years in prison after being convicted of working with a former legislative aide to win taxpayer-funded mail business from state lawmakers who previously drove Casada from office amid a sexting scandal. Strawberry was convicted in the 1990s of tax evasion and drug charges. The Republicans said their findings cast doubt on all of Biden's actions in office and sent a letter to the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, urging a full investigation. “Senior White House officials did not know who operated the autopen and its use was not sufficiently controlled or documented to prevent abuse,” the House oversight committee found. On Friday, Republicans who control the committee released a statement that characterized Trump's potential use of an electronic signature as legitimate, which it distinguished from Biden's.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ICE wants to build a public-private surveillance loop that transforms everyday online activity into potential evidence. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. When most people think about immigration enforcement, they picture border crossings and airport checkpoints. But the new front line may be your social media feed. The request states that private contractors will be paid to comb through “Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Tumblr, Instagram, VK, Flickr, Myspace, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, Reddit, WhatsApp, YouTube, etc.,” turning public posts into enforcement leads that feed directly into ICE's databases. The request for information reads like something out of a cyber thriller: dozens of analysts working in shifts, strict deadlines measured in minutes, a tiered system of prioritizing high-risk individuals, and the latest software keeping constant watch. ICE already searches social media using a service called SocialNet that monitors most major online platforms. The agency has also contracted with Zignal Labs for its AI-powered social media monitoring system. What would change isn't only the scale of monitoring but its structure. Instead of government agents gathering evidence case by case, ICE is building a public-private surveillance loop that transforms everyday online activity into potential evidence. The contractors would be able to correlate those findings with data in commercial datasets from brokers such as LexisNexis Accurint and Thomson Reuters CLEAR along with government-owned databases. They feed directly into Palantir Technologies' Investigative Case Management system, the digital backbone of modern immigration enforcement. Officially, ICE says its data collection would focus on people who are already linked to ongoing cases or potential threats. The danger here is that when one person is flagged, their friends, relatives, fellow organizers or any of their acquaintances can also become subjects of scrutiny. Previous contracts for facial recognition tools and location tracking have shown how easily these systems expand beyond their original scope. What starts as enforcement can turn into surveillance of entire communities. ICE frames the project as modernization: a way to identify a target's location by identifying aliases and detecting patterns that traditional methods might miss. Planning documents say contractors cannot create fake profiles and must store all analysis on ICE servers. Investigations have revealed how informal data-sharing between local police and federal agents allowed ICE to access systems it wasn't authorized to use. The agency has repeatedly purchased massive datasets from brokers to sidestep warrant requirements. And despite a White House freeze on spyware procurement, ICE quietly revived a contract with Paragon's Graphite tool, software reportedly capable of infiltrating encrypted apps such as WhatsApp and Signal. Together, these platforms make continuous, automated monitoring not only possible but routine. The United States isn't alone in government monitoring of social media. In the United Kingdom, a new police unit tasked with scanning online discussions about immigration and civil unrest has drawn criticism for blurring the line between public safety and political policing. Across the globe, spyware scandals have shown how lawful access tools that were initially justified for counterterrorism were later used against journalists and activists. Around-the-clock surveillance doesn't just gather information — it also changes behavior. Research found that visits to Wikipedia articles on terrorism dropped sharply immediately after revelations about the National Security Agency's global surveillance in June 2013. In this environment, the digital self, an identity composed of biometric markers, algorithmic classifications, risk scores and digital traces, becomes a risk that follows you across platforms and databases. That decision-making happens rapidly and across large numbers of people, for the most part beyond public oversight. At the same time, the consolidation of data means social media content can now sit beside location and biometric information inside Palantir's hub. Enforcement increasingly happens through data correlations, raising questions about due process. Transparency starts with public disclosure of the algorithms and scoring systems ICE uses. Advocacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union argue that law enforcement agencies should meet the same warrant standards online that they do in physical spaces. The Brennan Center for Justice and the ACLU argue that there should be independent oversight of surveillance systems for accuracy and bias. And several U.S. senators have introduced legislation to limit bulk purchases from data brokers. Without checks like these, I believe that the boundary between border control and everyday life is likely to keep dissolving.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The recent US-China trade truce may hold, but Trump's constant policy swerves make industrial peace unlikely. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. Globally-mobile companies have deserted communities with unionized workforces, successive administrations raised up oligarchs by slashing taxes on the rich, a major epidemic put the country on edge, and landlords are using technology to collude on raising rents more rapidly. But all this conventional class war is now joined by a trade war — an international conflict over trade barriers like import taxes. Tariffs are a tax paid by importers bringing foreign commodities into the United States. They are definitely not, as the Dear Leader has claimed, a tax on foreign countries. Tariff taxes are paid by the importing company that usually produces and/or sells the commodity, like Apple when it brings Chinese-assembled iPhones into U.S. ports. These higher prices for imports don't attract consumers, who then buy domestic goods made in the home country, if they are available. This creates captive demand for domestic industry, which is then able to grow and gain the scale and skill needed to satisfy the domestic demand with less competition from foreign capital. Tariffs are a tax paid by importers bringing foreign commodities into the United States. They are definitely not a tax on foreign countries. Trump himself claims his tariffs are justified by our trade deficits with other nations, apparently viewing any such deficit as proof of these countries benefiting from U.S. offshoring, and has openly celebrated that foreign goods will cost more. Despite acknowledging this impact, Trump has strongly resisted the idea that the higher prices deliberately sought by tariffs will aggravate inflation, despite imports being 14 percent of GDP. But it should be understood that trade deficits for the U.S. are trade surpluses for countries like China and Japan, which often take the proceeds and invest large flows of capital back into the U.S. Trade partners invest their large net earnings in Treasury bonds, U.S. real estate, and other sectors. The scale of resulting inflation will depend on the breadth and depth of the tariffs; because Trump is a shallow thinker and impulsive decision-maker, it remains unclear where average tariffs will settle. China has mirrored the U.S. with similar tariffs through this period. The main U.S. allies are now subject to large trade taxes, with 15 percent for European exports and for most Japanese goods, with higher rates on materials and cars. At the same time, huge tariffs of 50 percent have been imposed on many goods from Brazil and India in retaliation for those countries' domestic political decisions, without any regard for economic policy. The cumulative potential for stubborn inflation is clearly real. Today's extensive border-crossing supply chains, built up over decades of globalization, will likely be at least somewhat snarled by whatever exact tariff regime is in place when the dust settles. Modern production systems often cross international borders as freely as borders between U.S. states, and having to apply tariff taxes to each step for all the parts of a complete product, along with the paperwork, will likely work an ugly effect. These will slow economic growth to the point of stagnation and possibly recession. A Pew survey found 52 percent of Americans thought the tariffs would have a bad effect on the U.S. economy, and trade association CEOs say the baffling swirl of contradictory tariff news is “undermining long-term investment and growth,” language usually reserved for policies that attempt to ameliorate inequality or fund public goods (what the right often maligns as “socialism”). Falling consumer and investor sentiment, if sustained, will themselves have recessionary effects. Further, the potential combination of recession, weak growth, and inflation means the Fed can't easily turn to its usual tool: interest rates. But with weak conditions and high prices, the bank is over a barrel, which, for all its many, many shortcomings, reduces an important institution's ability to help steer the ship away from disaster. The relative decline of U.S. dominance of global finance systems clears the way for the loose BRICS alliance of developing world countries to gradually build up their alternatives for development financing and payment clearance. But the Chinese countermeasures are most important, including an “unreliable entities” list of Western firms barred from doing business with domestic Chinese firms. Further retaliation has taken simpler forms, like China steering its great soybean orders to feed its millions of chicken and swine to Brazil, as it did in Trump's first term. More seriously, China has announced a new bureaucratic process for exports of extremely important raw materials and goods made from them. China produces and refines much of the world's rare earth metals, a small class of scarce chemical elements that are essential for a vast number of technological products, from car steering components to capacitors to lasers to computer chips. It produces 90 percent of the powerful magnets derived from these elements, some of which are used in EV motors and cruise missiles. Export licenses are now required to export these from China, and the system for these is in the early stages. The large U.S. industrial firms that need these materials may lay off workers once they exhaust their supplies. China agreed to a looser rare earth review process, restrictions on exports of chemicals used in manufacturing fentanyl, and larger purchases of U.S. soybeans, which have been languishing in grain silos following China's shift in sourcing to Brazil. China also has further economic weapons up its sleeve, but many of them are seen as too risky to the global trading system. These include heavily devaluing its own currency to take greater shares of world markets, or purposefully selling its mountain of U.S. Treasury bonds, which were bought with the years of large trade surpluses that vex the Trump administration. Important sectors like autos are just now feeling the pain of higher steel and aluminum costs, higher prices for parts, and White House threats against raising prices. As the Biden-era EV mandates end, car companies are beginning to retrench. These twisted developments have been accompanied by a dramatic decline of the dollar, which normally would strengthen when tariffs are hiked. Instead there's been steep off-loading of bonds and dollars in currency markets, although these have partially recovered as the tariffs move up and down. The Wall Street Journal quotes a fund manager stating “U.S. It is also jeopardizing the role of U.S. Treasury bond yields in guiding interest rates on trillions of dollars in loans worldwide, which means global investors may no longer buy up essentially any amount of U.S. bonds to finance our ever-widening budget deficits. Loss of this reserve status could one day sharply reduce capital flows into the the country and require far higher interest rates to compensate by making the U.S. a more attractive destination for globally-mobile capital. It's uncharted territory, but for many American voters, the U.S. dollar's world reserve status is like their gall bladders — something they only hear about when it goes wrong. Make no mistake, Trump's trade policy won't work. Trump caved relatively quickly on the global “reciprocal” tariffs, lasting less than a week into negative coverage before he was moved once again, as in his first term and like most presidential administrations, by the gyrations of the markets. In a further stunning act of contradictory foolishness, current sectoral tariffs cover not just the consumer goods that the administration wants made in the U.S., but also materials needed for capital goods, like steel and aluminum. These tariffs on physical capital mean that even for companies that had already wanted to obey Trump and invest domestically, the costs are now so daunting that even phone assembly (let alone making all the components) is “way down the road now,” as a sourcing researcher put it. But looking past these clownish blunderings, protectionism has a whole history as a legitimate and successful, if challenging to develop, policy tool. But we absolutely do not have to accept ugly hierarchical power-mongering to recognize that various forms of protectionist policies have played major roles in lifting up large populations from poverty, even though they are abhorrent to the average U.S. economist. Modern republics can use these tools to develop or further evolve their economies based on the expressed will of the public, and in settings that bring people to a greater level of internal equality as well. No amount of ham-fisted incompetent bungling from a hideous race-baiting billionaire can change that. It led a complex system of subsidies, research grants, technology access, and trade barriers to rebuild the country into a cutting-edge industrial colossus. When what became South Korea was recovering from its own annihilation in the Korean War, the U.S.-backed Park military dictatorship had a tight, state-led development regime, including trade barriers, investment in strategic sectors, and extensive restrictions on capital. Considering the major social movements needed for these core economic issues to be addressed, through wealth confiscation and nationalization of monopolies, mere tariffs are a smaller lift. Trump's clumsy planless blundering at trade barriers likely falls in this category.

When the Supreme Court overturned a temporary restraining order in September that kept U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials from questioning and detaining people based on their language, skin color, or occupation — effectively clearing the way for racial profiling — Guadalupe Cardona was not surprised. Cardona is a member of Unión del Barrio, a national organization that has led resistance efforts against ICE and police violence since its inception in 1981. Since the Trump administration took office — but especially in recent months — she has witnessed daily scenes of ICE snatching primarily Latino people off the streets and detaining them without identifying themselves or giving due process. When the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration's emergency request to expand ICE's use of racial profiling, Cardona knew it would empower ICE agents to ramp up their raids and kidnappings of community members even further. Among other measures, it deputized law enforcement to carry out immigration enforcement by determining the immigration status of anyone they deemed suspicious — even U.S. citizens. Montoya says the law also emboldened people who already had racist ideas. She recalled getting “dirty looks” while speaking Spanish at a supermarket with her mother. Cesar Escalante, a researcher at the University of Georgia, found that during the period SB 1070 was in place, youth in Arizona faced isolation, depression, anxiety, and eating disorders due to the stress of either being undocumented or being assumed to be undocumented. However, communities mobilized against the law, holding protests and boycotts across Arizona. Further provisions to the law were stripped in 2016 when Arizona's then attorney general banned law enforcement from prolonging a stop based on immigration status, although the rule about allowing law enforcement to inquire about immigration status still lingers. In response to an “emergency request” from the Trump administration, the Supreme Court issued a quick order that overturned the ban, allowing ICE agents to arrest anyone they might deem to be an immigrant based on their language or skin color, without identifying themselves. In legal circles, these are now dubbed “Kavanaugh stops” after the Supreme Court justice claimed that legal residents are only briefly stopped and not arrested, despite lawsuits proving otherwise. As the American Immigration Council noted at that time: “Crucially, this order is not a final ruling, but it strongly signals the Supreme Court will not uphold strict constitutional limits on the authority of immigration agents to stop and question people they suspect to be immigrants.” Although he anticipates more litigation on this issue, the court's decision could still take years to overturn — during which a lot of damage could be done, he said. Since Donald Trump began his second term in office, more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by ICE, reporting from ProPublica has found; the government does not track the number of citizens held by immigration agents, so the count could well exceed that number. Loweree is concerned that the ruling could worsen this threat. “If we live in an environment where ICE can target people based on the way that they look, including U.S. citizens, that's a situation where no one in this country is safe from this sort of action,” Loweree said. Loweree also noted that ICE is cutting corners during background checks of onboarding officers. “All of this is a recipe for disaster, for some very ugly, negative outcomes impacting many people across the country, and it's all something that was facilitated by the Supreme Court.” Mario Nodal, creator of Unidos Podemos, a bilingual Instagram page, has spent the last months documenting ICE kidnappings and raids across the country by sharing crowd-sourced videos. He said the ICE raids and Supreme Court ruling are very concerning. While Unidos Podemos originally started as a page to uplift Mexican American culture, it quickly turned into a platform to raise awareness about ICE activity after the Trump administration took office. Nodal said it is important to document the raids and their intensity. “In this moment, there is a beautiful hope that exists in this solidarity and that people are standing up for what is right. Nodal shares fundraiser campaigns of people who are impacted by ICE raids. He also said it is important to continue celebrating Latino culture and honoring the sacrifices that have been made to make a life in the U.S. “In the midst of all of this, we're still trying to push that culture, like Día de los Muertos, still trying to push it in front of people that don't like us, people that hate us, like ‘We don't care, you're gonna see our culture, you're gonna see who we are,'” Nodal said. This is who we are, you're not just gonna get rid of us.” Cardona said her organization has also been proactive in fighting back against ICE activity. She said Unión del Barrio has been doing “know your rights” workshops and training people on how to spot ICE and report to the community when they do see them. Like Nodal, Cardona also said it is important to document ICE raids and kidnappings to help people understand what they have been seeing and the way ICE goes about these operations. Advocates have also been organizing patrols and responding to reported ICE activity. Cardona said there have been many instances where community members in Los Angeles have been able to chase ICE agents away and prevent people from being detained. “We know that less happens to people when there's large numbers of community members, when the agents are outnumbered in large quantities,” Cardona said. “In this moment, there is a beautiful hope that exists in this solidarity and that people are standing up for what is right,” Cardona said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts say New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's selection of Lina Khan, the former Federal Trade Commission chair, for his transition team acts as a warning to private equity firms in the state that have raised rents and monopolized local healthcare industries. Throughout the US, private equity has increasingly monopolized industries through the practice of “roll ups,” acquiring many small local firms and rolling them into one larger firm, giving them power to simultaneously raise prices and lower quality. This practice is especially problematic in healthcare industries, where private equity involvement has been linked to worse health outcomes, including death. “Kamala Harris should have campaigned on some sort of populism,” Kenney said, noting Harris's message should have been: “We're going to break up the monopolies, you know, we're going to go after Wall Street. A more populist campaign would have highlighted Khan's mission to scrutinize private equity “roll ups” as well as big tech acquisitions, including Meta's acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram. During her time at FTC, Khan brought multiple suits against private equity and big tech monopolies. She didn't win all of them, but still had impact. So for private equity, that meant that they couldn't just waltz in and buy up all of these various [medical] practices,” he said. “Mobile home parks, which used to be run by a lot of independent owners, private equity would come into a region and buy up all the mobile home parks, then raise all the rents.” Just knowing they might be scrutinized made firms more cautious. The real estate private equity firm Sugar Hill Capital Partners has been accused of allowing its buildings to become unlivable – through problems like rat infestations – so that tenants in rent controlled units will leave and they can raise rents. Notably, Mamdani's campaign centered around making rent more affordable; Kenney thinks that Khan's appointment is most directed at private equity landlords. When it comes to private equity owned health companies, Loren Adler, associate director and fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center on Health Policy said “there was a lot of focus on trying to shine sunlight on private equity firms buying up a bunch of small practices and combining them into a larger entity”. For example, Khan filed a complaint against US Anesthesia Partners and its private equity owners for attempting to monopolize Texas's anesthesia industry (though she ultimately lost). However, there are a few ways Mamdani could make things difficult for private equity-backed health companies in New York. One reason that private equity is able to get away with monopolizing health industries is they usually are not required to disclose acquisitions below a certain threshold, so ownership of a clinic can change without consumers ever knowing. This was something that Khan worked to change under Biden. So there's some power to compel that sort of disclosure,” Adler explained. Mamdani could also create more competition for private equity firms by strengthening New York City's already strong public hospital system, and resisting contracting with private equity firms for things like ambulance services and medical devices. “New York also already has one of the most robust public hospital systems.</p>

BUDAPEST, November 15. /TASS/. The Hungarian government will block any decisions by the European Union aimed at escalating the armed conflict in Ukraine and involving European countries in it, Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said.

"If Brussels pushes us towards the war, we will exercise our right of veto against its decisions, even if we have to act alone against all the other 26 [EU countries]," the Hungarian top diplomat said at an anti-war rally in Gyor in the country's northwest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine is being rocked by the biggest corruption scandal of President Volodymyr Zelensky's term. In the halls of power in Kyiv, the mood is one of dread and uncertainty about what to expect next. "What I would recommend the president to do right now is to take serious action and get rid of lots of people in his entourage," they added. The scandal centres on an investigation by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), which alleges that Timur Mindich, a close ally of Zelensky, led a group getting kickbacks from energy construction and procurement, including building defenses for Ukraine's energy infrastructure, and laundering the proceeds. Several other figures in the Zelensky government are implicated, and two ministers — Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk — have already resigned as a result. Across the country, people already face chronic power outages, and Russia's ever-escalating attacks on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure threaten not only the supply of electricity but also gas, heating, and even water. It's no surprise then that the revelation that while soldiers and civilians suffer the hardships of war, the news that some of those in power have been enriching themselves has caused mass outrage. "This is the mentality that comes from the USSR, that those people who are in power always want to benefit from their position and always try to steal something." "It hurts to believe that at the same time, the president's friends are paying for their whores, expensive cars, and spending hundreds of millions of our money on new villas." Similar sentiments can be found everywhere on the streets of Kyiv. I think this is the mentality that comes from the USSR, that those people who are in power always want to benefit from their position and always try to steal something," she added. Others are directing their ire at Zelensky himself, who, despite not being named in the investigation so far, is unlikely to survive unscathed given his closeness to those involved. But despite the gravity of the crisis engulfing Ukraine's leadership, there is a glimmer of optimism that such an investigation shows the country's democratic, investigative, and legal processes are alive and healthy. "I sincerely hope that the next step will show that institutions are working in our state, and the proof of this is that every corrupt scoundrel will be punished by the law, rather than by angry and armed people." The very fact that an Anti-Corruption Bureau investigation exists at all is largely down to mass public protests over the summer in reaction to the president signing a bill that would have effectively destroyed two of Ukraine's key anti-corruption bodies, including NABU. "If people had not taken to the streets then, this criminal case would have simply been closed," 24-year-old veteran Liubomyr Dmytryshyn told the Kyiv Independent. "We are going through a painful process of understanding the value of our own state, from personal survival to the realization that the source of power in it is people protesting with cardboard signs," Architect, a 32-year-old drone operator in Ukraine's Armed Forces, told the Kyiv Independent. "I sincerely hope that the next step will show that institutions are working in our state, and the proof of this is that every corrupt scoundrel will be punished by the law, rather than by angry and armed people." "Cancer should be detected, and preferably at an early stage. In light of recent news, I am warmed by the example of people who just did their jobs honestly," she said, adding: "So like a lot of people I'm not going to give up." But regardless of whether Ukraine's wheels of justice function as they should, many are concerned that the reputational damage from the scandal could affect international support. He does, however, have concerns about the response from Western politicians. The Kyiv Independent asked military volunteer Maria Berlinska if she was concerned about the scandal affecting Western support for Ukraine. "My comment is very simple: Europe should still support Ukraine, because otherwise they will be next, and they will be fucked," she said. Independent journalism is never easy, and it's even harder in wartime. Yet we can do it without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise — because of our community.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Doaa Musallem's high school grades were so good that she got a congratulatory call from the Palestinian Minister of Education. Like some 56,000 other students from Gaza's class of 2025, the last two years of her education have been nearly completely disrupted by Israel's war in Gaza, which has killed almost 19,000 school age children, made orphans out of thousands of others, and all but decimated the enclave's formal education system. Doaa's father Bassam Musallam was critically wounded by shrapnel in November 2023, when an Israeli strike hit a neighboring house and killed his friend in central Gaza, the family told CNN. Musallam was evacuated to Egypt for medical treatment in April 2024 and has been there since, missing many milestones in his daughter's life, including her exam results, which have gone viral. “You are a hero,” Palestinian Minister of Education Amjad Barham told Doaa over the phone as he called to congratulate her on graduating high school and earning the highest grade of any student in Gaza, at 99.7%. Doaa's joyful scene was emulated throughout Gaza Thursday, in bright moments that have been rare over the past two years. As the education ministry announced the grades for tens of thousands of high school students like Doaa, there was a buzz in the air as Palestinians set off fireworks and embraced in song and dance. Mahmoud Elyan, a recent graduate who was displaced from the southern city of Rafah to central Gaza, stood at a crowded dessert shop in his hometown with a grin on his face. “I am happy beyond words,” he told Palestinian state TV. “I am here to buy desserts and hand them out to people because it's been a long time that people haven't seen desserts after two years of war and displacement.” For others, graduation day is a reminder of that suffering. Student Doha Nazmi Abu Dalal, who had been displaced in Deir el Balah, central Gaza, achieved a near perfect GPA. Abu Dalal, along with 17 members of her family, was killed in an Israeli strike on October 29, weeks after the ceasefire was implemented, according to hospital authorities. Israel has repeatedly said Hamas uses schools and universities as part of its infrastructure to store weapons or as command centers. It has not addressed the scholasticide accusation directly. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) previously told CNN it seeks to minimize civilian harm while Hamas “cynically exploits civilian infrastructure for terror purposes.” In addition, some 792 educational staff have been killed and 3,251 injured. Like his classmates, Al-Hassan had to navigate the challenges of online education amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. “We had a hard time with internet connection, the lack of electricity and water as well as displacement and most importantly food,” Al-Hassan told WAFA, the Palestinian state news agency, at a shelter for the displaced in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza on Thursday, where he and his friends had gathered to celebrate his graduation. She said she suffered minor injuries from an Israeli strike that happened during her first private math lesson – at a sporting club – after the war had started. Gaza's 56,000 new graduates are ready for college, according to the education ministry. But there are hardly any campuses to attend. Educational supplies, like stationery, backpacks, and other resources, have been  “impossible” to bring into the enclave, despite the implementation of the October 10 ceasefire, because they are not deemed as “lifesaving humanitarian aid,” UNICEF said. Nearly 92% of all education facilities will require either full reconstruction or major rehabilitation to become functional again, according to a recent  UNICEF statement. “Despite the pain and ache in Gaza, we want to be happy and get over our wounds,” Dima's father said. Gazan music teacher uses drone sound to teach kids Meanwhile, others are calling for mechanisms to help pursue college scholarships and study abroad, rather than going back online to study. “This is not life, they (Israel) destroyed our schools and universities,” recent graduate Mohamed Bilal Abu Faraj told Palestinian state media on Thursday after handing out desserts at a shelter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump had won a retraction and an apology just a day earlier from the BBC for the way it had edited his January 6 speech. But as he glowered over me on Friday night at the back of Air Force One, it was clear he wasn't ready to celebrate just yet. “We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn and $5bn, probably some time next week.” Mr Trump was close enough to touch. Next to him stood Karoline Leavitt, his press secretary. It was her interview with me a week before, when she called the corporation a “leftist propaganda machine”, that had given fresh legs to The Telegraph investigation. Until recently, he was one of the most powerful figures in the White House, but he is now due to take up a posting as ambassador to India. He must have known what was about to come. Oh, what a job you did,” he said. Like most reporters, I have been on the receiving end of his glares. He once stormed out of a press conference because of a question I asked about Covid and, during his trip to Scotland this year, I ended up as “this guy”, dismissed as a wise-cracking troublemaker. I was on the receiving end of a beam, the sort of all-embracing glow the president deploys to woo Middle Eastern princes bearing big money deals or glamorous talk show hosts with soft ball questions. It was one of those moments that his close staff talk about. How did you catch the BBC like that? Trump tells me he will sue the BBC for between $1 billion and $5 billion, probably "sometimes next week. It must have been a blessed relief to rail against “fake news”. He was flying home on Air Force One to Mar-a-Lago for a weekend of golf chased by headlines about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, following the latest email dump, and what he knew about the late paedophile's activities. A moment earlier, he had berated the reporter sitting next to me, calling her “piggy” after she pushed hard on the latest Epstein releases. He was in the press cabin for 26 minutes for his “gaggle” – what the White House press corps calls a quick question and answer session. But in that time, his mood ran from fury to elation and back again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president vows to follow through on legal threat against ‘stupid' and ‘corrupt' corporation after Telegraph investigation Donald Trump has confirmed he will sue the BBC for up to $5bn (£3.8bn) after its Panorama programme doctored one of his speeches. Speaking to The Telegraph onboard Air Force One, Mr Trump said he would formally seek damages against the BBC as early as next week for between “$1bn and $5bn”. The corporation on Thursday apologised to the US president after he threatened to sue it for $1bn in damages if it did not say sorry for the edit, but rejected his claim of defamation. But speaking onboard Air Force One on Friday night, Mr Trump said he still intended to pursue legal action against the corporation and could seek up to $5bn in damages. “We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn and $5bn probably some time next week,” he told The Telegraph, en route to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Praising The Telegraph's reporting as a “great service… exposing fake news”, he said the broadcaster had acted “worse than what CBS did with Kamala”. The president was referring to a broadcast of CBS's 60 Minutes last year, shortly before the election, when an interview with his political opponent Kamala Harris was edited to make her answer sound more coherent. Mr Trump declared that CBS, the sister channel of the BBC, had attempted “election interference” and sued it for $10bn. He settled the case earlier this year for $16m. In a separate interview on GB News on Friday night, Mr Trump claimed he had an “obligation” to take on the BBC, which he labelled “corrupt” and “beyond fake”. I'd like to find out why they did it.” But when you say it's unintentional, I guess if it's unintentional, you don't apologise,” he said. “But they took my words, you know, and I made a beautiful statement, and they made it into a not beautiful statement.” Mr Trump had said in his speech: “We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” Roughly an hour later, he said: “And we fight. In Panorama's version, he said: “We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. On Thursday, The Telegraph revealed that BBC Newsnight had also doctored footage of the speech in 2022, making it appear that Mr Trump was encouraging his supporters to riot. Mr Trump suggested the BBC could have also misrepresented comments by Nigel Farage, the Reform leader and a political ally. “One of the things that we'll find out during this litigation… is how many other times have they done it to your Prime Minister, have they done it to Nigel, have they done it to the people that are in your country,” he said. A senior White House official suggested on Monday that there could be further ramifications for the BBC, apart from the legal threat. Mr Trump also hit out at Sadiq Khan, the London mayor and a longtime political enemy, for letting crime spiral out of control in the capital. “My mother loved London… That was a different London than you have today,” he told GB News, claiming people are “being stabbed in the ass, or worse”. London has “no-go” areas where sharia law is in effect and police “don't even want to go anywhere near”, he claimed without evidence, adding that Mr Khan was a “nasty person”. 'If you put him there, I wouldn't even know who he was. The president also alleged that migrants from “some of the worst places on earth” were coming to Britain and “destroying your country”. “You have this huge asset sitting there, and you're destroying your country with windmills all over the place,” he said.</p>
