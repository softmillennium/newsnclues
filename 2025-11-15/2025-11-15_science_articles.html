                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It probably required technological seafaring advancements beyond what was considered likely during the Paleolithic era. But those experts may have a surprising new answer thanks to research that shows the ancient people of the Philippines and ISEA may have mastered seafaring well before anyone else. The pivotal archaeological evidence comes in the form of stone tools excavated at sites in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste, showing strong evidence that as far back as 40,000 years ago, there was a technological sophistication from these ancient seafarers that rivals much later civilizations. Proving seafaring history represents a tricky endeavor, since organic wood and fiber that would have likely been used in constructing Paleolithic seacraft rarely survive in the archaeological record. These stone tools offer a new way in. The most recent discovery, according to the study, shows traces of plant processing that features the “extraction of fibers necessary for making ropes, nets, and bindings essential for boatbuilding and open-sea fishing.” Add in the discovery of fishing hooks, gorges, net weights, and the remains of deep-ocean fish such as tuna and sharks, and these archeological sites are a rich exploration of what is obviously a robust seafaring culture. That same rope technology was then adapted for the actual fishing. Rather, they posit that the movement came from highly skilled navigators equipped with the knowledge and technology to travel to remote locations over deep waters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quark-gluon plasma, a bizarre state of matter that mimics the early cosmos, is the hottest thing ever made on Earth The collision took place at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) run by Brookhaven National Labratory in Brookhaven, NY. This inferno re-creates conditions from the dawn of time, when the universe was too hot and dense to form regular atoms—or even their ingredients such as protons and neutrons. “These are the building blocks of the particles that make up the visible world, and we're trying to figure out how they work,” says physicist Zhangbu Xu of Brookhaven National Laboratory and Kent State University. The experiment took place at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), within the STAR (Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC) detector. There, gold nuclei racing along a 2.4-mile loop reach mind-boggling speeds before they bang together and disintegrate into quark-gluon plasma. Each primordial cloud lasts for only a split second, churning out many particles as it cools, including photons (particles of light) that decay into pairs of electrons and their antimatter counterparts, positrons.

This revealed that temperature to be an astonishing 3.3 trillion degrees Celsius (5.94 trillion degrees Fahrenheit)—roughly 220,000 times hotter than the core of the sun. The scientists reported their results in Nature Communications. Determining this temperature will help physicists figure out when and how the fiery primeval universe transitioned from quark -gluon plasma to the building blocks of atoms. These two states are different phases of matter, akin to the more familiar solid, liquid and gas phases of everyday life. “We want to map out what you could call the most fundamental ‘phase diagram' that we know of,” says Frank Geurts of Rice University, a spokesperson for STAR. The RHIC accelerator and its STAR experiment are in the final stages of their last run, after starting up 25 years ago. Even after STAR closes, however, scientists will analyze its last batch of data over the next few years to further hone their measure of this original cosmic fire.
