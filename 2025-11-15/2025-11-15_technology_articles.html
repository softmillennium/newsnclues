                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[Editor's Note: Agents of Transformation is an independent GeekWire series and 2026 event, underwritten by Accenture, exploring the people, companies, and ideas behind the rise of AI agents.] For serial entrepreneur David Shim, it's two things the early internet never had at scale: real business models and customers willing to pay. Today, he said, companies and consumers are paying real money and finding actual value in AI tools that are scaling to tens of millions in revenue within months. Shim pointed to the speculative “edges” of the industry, where some companies are securing massive valuations despite having no product and no revenue — a phenomenon he described as “100% bubbly.” He also cited AMD's deal with OpenAI — in which the chipmaker offered stock incentives tied to a large chip purchase — as another example of froth at the margins. But even that, in his view, is more of an outlier than a systemic warning sign. He now leads Read AI, which has raised more than $80 million and landed major enterprise customers for its cross-platform AI meeting assistant and productivity tools. He made the comments during a wide-ranging interview with GeekWire co-founder John Cook. They spoke about AI, productivity, and the future of work at a recent dinner event hosted in partnership with Accenture, in conjunction with GeekWire's new “Agents of Transformation” editorial series. Human psychology is shaping AI deployment: Internally, ReadAI is testing an AI assistant named “Ada” that schedules meetings by learning users' communication patterns and priorities. It works so quickly, he said, that Read AI is building delays into its responses, after finding that quick replies “freak people out,” making them think their messages didn't get a careful read. Global adoption is happening without traditional localization: Read AI captured 1% of Colombia's population without local staff or employees, demonstrating AI's ability to scale internationally in ways previous technologies couldn't. He believes one key is connecting AI across entire teams, to answer questions by pulling information from a colleague's work, including meetings you didn't attend and files you've never seen. “Digital Twins” are the next, controversial frontier: Shim predicts a future in which a departed employee can be “resurrected” from their work data, allowing companies to query that person's institutional knowledge. The idea sounds controversial and “a little bit scary,” he said, but it could be invaluable for answering questions that only the former employee would have known.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The AppleTV series Pluribus stars Rhea Seahorn as Carol Sturka, a romantasy writer who doesn't care for her genre. As the show opens, she's released a new book, Bloodsong of Wycaro, and now you can read a little slice of it. A bit of it, anyway,” writes Carol in the letter for Bloodsong, which now has a free 11-page excerpt you can read on Apple Books. You may recall in the Pluribus pilot that Carol hinted as much to a fan. As for the full Bloodsong book, Lucasia is tasked with saving her crew after they've been afflicted with a curse that's left them bedridden. With few able-bodied workers left, they brave a nasty storm to reach the isle and find Madam Asclepius, a banished healer who may be able to help. This whole thing may remind some folks of what Apple did for Severance, whose self-help book The You You Are from Ricken Hale got a downloadable version back in January. New episodes of Pluribus premiere Fridays on Apple TV. Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who. Apple TV's sci-fi hit explores a world where (nearly) everyone shares the same brain. Plus, 'Creep' director Patrick Brice talks about his hopes for a new sequel. Apple TV's excellent new series 'Pluribus' explores a seemingly harmonious, deeply harrowing take on the classic trope. Karolina Wydra talks about her character in Apple TV's new sci-fi standout: the elegant, infuriatingly accommodating Zosia. Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Bob Odenkirk, and others appear in a new promo for the Apple TV+ sci-fi show.</p>

The U.S. Department of Justice just announced that it has convicted five individuals, including four U.S. citizens and one Ukrainian national, for facilitating the illegal employment of North Korean IT workers at American companies. According to its press release, these people used their own identity or provided false or stolen identities to North Korean workers seeking employment with U.S.-based firms. “These actions demonstrate the Department's comprehensive approach to disrupting North Korean efforts to finance their weapons program on the back of Americans,” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg said in a statement. “The Department will use every available tool to protect our nation from this regime's depredations.” But because Pyongyang faces heavy sanctions from various nations, including the U.S., its workers need false identities to gain employment, especially in the U.S. Despite many seeing the DPRK as a state where most citizens lack access to the latest technology, it actually has an elite group of hackers. “FBI investigations continue to expose the North Korean government's relentless campaign to evade U.S. sanctions and generate millions of dollars to fund its authoritarian regime and weapons programs,” FBI Counterintelligence Division Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky said. We ask all our private sector partners to improve their security process for vetting remote workers and to remain vigilant regarding this emerging threat.” Both companies and workers have benefited from remote work. While institutions rely on cursory document checks and monitoring the IP addresses of their laptops to determine their actual location, these can easily be circumvented by facilitators who are paid for their services. One of the convicted felons even forfeited $1.4 million as part of their plea deal, which shows how lucrative this illegal activity can be.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>My parents always used to say, “You get what you pay for,” and at the ripe old age of 33, I've often found that to be true. If you buy a knockoff, that's usually what you're going to get: an imitation of something that's cheaper, but probably not quite as good as the real deal. Sometimes, if Soundpeats' new Clip1 wireless earbuds are any indication, what you actually get (for a lot less money) is your favorite new pair of open-style wireless earbuds for the price. The Clip1 are a great-sounding pair of open-style wireless earbuds with an enticing price. I've used a few pairs of open wireless earbuds in my day, and there was always one pair that stood as my favorite: Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds. I personally love Bose's clip-on design, which is comfortable and (at least in my opinion) looks pretty good—more like a piece of jewelry than a pair of wireless earbuds. Also, Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds shouldn't work, but they do. Despite that strange, very indirect method of delivering audio, they sound great. Coming up on nearly two years since their release date, the Ultra Open Earbuds are still $300. Unlike Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, Soundpeats' Clip1 start at less than half the price. Immediately upon sliding the Clip1 onto my ears and loading up Spotify, I noticed that Soundpeats paid special attention to fidelity. I started off with some jazz, Wes Montgomery's “While We're Young,” and noticed ample low end and very little distortion even with the volume turned up past 75% on my phone. Guitar tones sounded natural and nuanced, like I was in the room. I listened to some rock songs with a lot more going on instrument-wise and in the production department, and the Clip1 crushed it. In “Castleman” by Floatie, I was able to hear all of the guitar tracks clearly and separately, with very little distortion. I listened to Todd Terje's “Delorean Dynamite,” and the driving arpeggiated synths sounded perfectly gritty, with shakers and other reverberated percussion came across as atmospheric but well-accounted for. These are some of the best-sounding open wireless earbuds I've used to date, and I've used quite a few now from Sony, Nothing, and Bose. On top of sounding great, I also find them to be equally as listenable in louder volume scenarios as Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, if not a little more so. Because of the design of open wireless earbuds, no pair will ever be ideal in high-volume situations where you'd want a more traditional pair of wireless earbuds with tips and active noise cancelation (ANC). There's a middle ground to be struck where you can still hear your audio well while also being able to hear your surroundings, though. In my humble opinion, Soundpeats strikes that balance well. On the crucial subway test, I was able to hear my post-work Buffalo Bills sports talk podcast while still keeping one foot in the environmental sound. That's more than I could say for other entrants in the open-ear audio game, which have a bad habit of being drowned out in loud environments. Outside of being able to hear your surroundings more, another reason why people buy open-style wireless earbuds is that they're just a lot more comfortable than using something that gets put inside your ear, even if it's only a little bit. While both the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds and Soundpeats' Clip1 have a similar design (a clip that you wrap around your ear), there are subtle differences between the two you should know. As I mentioned, Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds have a plastic knob that goes inside your ear, while the speaker, a round little drum, actually gets tucked behind your ear. The indirect approach to delivering audio somehow produces solid, well-balanced sound. The Clip1, like Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds are great to wear over long periods and feel sturdy and comfortable while wrapped around my ears. The Clip1 might even have a slight edge over Bose, since Soundpeats manages to get the weight of each of its earbuds down to 5g as opposed to Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, which weigh 6.3g per earbud. Like Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, the Clip1 also allows for a good amount of ambient noise bleed, which, in this case, is exactly what's supposed to happen. f you're in need of hands-free controls, the Clip1 also have touch inputs which allow you to double and triple-tap the piece that rests behind your ear on either earbuds to play and pause, and skip tracks respectively. It's a little awkward at first, tapping behind your ear like that, but once you get the hang of it, they work just fine. As long as we're talking about design, it's worth mentioning one area that I actually don't think the Clip1 takes the crown over Bose in, and that's looks. The Clip1 is a little bit lower profile compared to the Ultra Open Earbuds, which is nice, but I actually appreciate the almost cyberpunk look, even if they're more noticeable when they're clipped onto your ears. That's a minor gripe, all things considered, and even more forgivable when you keep in mind that the Clip1 is $70 compared to Bose's current $300 price tag on the Ultra Open Earbuds. Open wireless earbuds may not have the benefit of canceling noise like other wireless earbuds, but that lack of ANC is actually a blessing in some ways, mostly when it comes to battery life. According to Soundpeats, the Clip1 should get 8 hours on a single charge when being played at 60% volume. That battery life tracks in my testing; after more than two hours of listening, I was at about 80%, though I wasn't listening to audio the entire time (I took some short breaks intermittently). I wouldn't call 8 hours impressive by wireless earbuds standards, but it does notably beat the Bose Ultra Open, which get about 7.5 hours on a single charge. For context, some wireless earbuds that I've tested this year, like the Technics EAH-AZ100, get 10 hours on a single charge with ANC activated. Again, though, those wireless earbuds are also $300 compared to the Clip1's $70 price tag, so maybe that comparison is a little unfair. For me, I have no major complaints in the battery life department when it comes to the Clip1; I think they'll last long enough to satisfy most people. As for features, there are quite a few things to take advantage of in the Soundpeats app, including the ability to toggle on Dolby audio for “movie mode” and “music mode,” which are meant to provide “immersive 3D sound.” I tested both, and while I could do without movie mode (sorry, I know it's supposed to give in-movie audio a sense of space, but I think it just makes everything sound worse), music mode actually sounds pretty good. I don't need music mode toggled on to enjoy how the Clip1 sound, but I do think using it provides a heightened sense of space and atmosphere in most songs. There are also additional EQ options in the Soundpeats app, including preset EQ for genres like rock and electronic, and even one for enhancing treble, and also a granular 10-band EQ if you're that kind of person. There is an option to custom-tune the EQ with a hearing test so that the wireless earbuds conform to your specific hearing, but when I tried to take the test, I noticed that lots of the tones being played for me were hard to hear. As an added bonus, the SoundPeats app also has free, playable white noise for when you just want to zone out (think rain sounds and airplane noises) as well as something called “EQ space” where people can share their custom EQs for things that they like to listen to. Let's be honest, most people are never going to take advantage of that sort of thing, but having the option is always nice. As I mentioned previously, there are a lot of open-style wireless earbuds on the market nowadays, so making a decision can be tough. Most people, when it comes to open audio, just want something that sounds good, is audible in a range of settings, and is comfortable and practical in terms of battery life and features. For the Clip1, all of those boxes are checked, and while the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds still have the edge in terms of design, that only matters if you really care about that sort of thing. For most, the $70 price tag and great fit and sound should be enough to give Soundpeats a shot at being their go-to open-ear wireless buds. JVC Kenwood's Wood Master wireless earbuds are looking like stiff competition. House of Marley's new headphones might smoke the competition.</p>

I noted a few gamma issues during calibration but aside from that, the LG Ultra Gear 45GX950A is a superb OLED gaming monitor for flying and racing simulation. With its extreme curve, you'll be completely drawn into the gaming environment. Bright, sharp and colorful image with high pixel density Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Gaming can be a pleasure on many kinds of computer monitors, but when you have one perfectly suited to what you're playing, the experience jumps to another level. The feeling of immersion is especially important in racing or flying simulations. Simulators are dominated by the best gaming monitors with ultra-wide and mega-wide screens in either 21:9 or 32:9 aspect ratios. LG's Ultra Gear 45GX950A is ideally suited for driving and flying sims. It delivers a high pixel density of 125ppi with a 5120x2160 (5K2K) array on an OLED panel with an 800R curve. It also sports a 165 Hz refresh rate with a dual-mode switch to 330 Hz at 2560x1080, plus Adaptive-Sync, DisplayHDR 400, and wide-gamut color. You could expand your view with multiple screens, but then there are those annoying dividing lines that you can't unsee. A 32:9 screen brings the width, but current 49-inch models aren't very tall. They impart a view that's like looking out of a racing helmet, which is fine for driving but not so much for flying. That means a circle of them would only be 1.6 meters across. It's so tight that you can hear your voice bounce off the sides of the screen — it's a unique experience. That equates to 125 pixels per inch, denser than a 27-inch QHD monitor but not quite as dense as a 32-inch Ultra HD screen. It's more total pixels — over 11 million — so fast frame rates will require a stout video card. It doesn't have a Quantum Dot layer, but the color gamut covers almost 98% of DCI-P3, so the vivid saturation is there. You also get high brightness with 1,300 claimed nits in HDR mode for a 1.5% window. I measured 673 nits from a 25% window so that tracks. There are two levels of variable brightness as well, so SDR peaks can top 450 nits. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. It's easily accessed with a switch in the OSD. The 45GX950A is certified G-Sync Compatible and for FreeSync Premium Pro as well. There's plenty of bandwidth available through the DisplayPort 2.1 input, and you get two HDMI 2.1 ports, along with a USB-C port that supports DisplayPort and delivers 90 watts of power. Two USB downstream ports handle peripherals, and you get a nice pair of internal speakers. For that sum, you're getting something relatively unique that brings a new level of immersion and realism to your favorite flying and driving simulators. The 45GX950A arrives in a huge box with plenty of crumbly foam inside. It's needed to support that extremely curved panel, and my sample showed up unscathed. Cables include DisplayPort, HDMI, and USB-C. You also get an enormous external power brick that thankfully has a cord long enough that you can put it on the floor. An 800R curve is tighter than anything you've seen before, unless you read my review of the AOC AG456UCZD, which is the same size but has lower resolution. When you sit two or three feet from the screen's center, the sides aren't that far from your ears. The stand has a relatively small footprint thanks to its heavy cast metal base. The height adjustment is firm, nicely dampened, and wobble-free. The back is perfectly smooth and features a ring of LEDs controllable from the OSD and an LG logo. Underneath the center is a single joystick that controls all monitor functions. A snap-on cover helps to hide the cabling. It's game-focused with a slick look that includes color and fade effects, with important info always displayed at the top. There are 13 in total, including sRGB, HDR emulation, and two calibration memories that work with LG's Calibration Studio app. Personalized Picture is another memory that connects with the LG Switch app. You can also change the aspect to 16:9 or 21:9/39” to accommodate games that distort the image at full-screen settings. The switch was seamless every time; I didn't need to set it up in the Nvidia Control Panel beforehand. LG and I recommend that you make the switch before starting up a game. Additional gaming aids include aiming points and a frame rate counter. In the Picture Adjust menu, you'll find the Peak Brightness setting, which is LG's term for variable brightness. It has two levels, both of which render the image without clipping. This menu also has four gamma presets and five color temps. You also get hue and saturation sliders for all six colors. Sound comes from two internal speakers that play with 10 watts of power. This requires compatible headphones with a four-pole connector, but once plugged in, the surround-sound experience is incredible. If you typically play with headphones, I recommend going for DTS Headphone:X models. The 45GX950A supports PIP and PBP, so you can view two video signals at once. The side-by-side view is especially useful if you have a PC and console hooked up. In the General menu are OLED care options that include pixel orbiting, a screen saver and image cleaning, which runs automatically at regular intervals. The 45GX950A can be enjoyed without calibration in its default Gamer 1 mode. When I tweaked the RGB sliders, I was able to improve grayscale tracking slightly, but gamma was negatively affected. They are valid when Peak Brightness is turned off. If you use the high or low setting, you might need to lower them a tad to compensate. You can also adjust brightness, and the Peak Brightness setting is available too, which is a nice touch. Most monitors have no brightness options in HDR mode. I had to readjust my perceptions when playing familiar maps in Doom Eternal and Call of Duty WWII. I had no trouble with lag or hesitation of any kind. 165 Hz means there's a tiny bit of motion blur, but it never distracted during gameplay. I played for a bit at 330 Hz and found it was smoother, but the loss of resolution was significant. While I gained clarity by removing all traces of blur, it was lost in the lowered pixel density. I noted that it was no problem to maintain 165 fps using a GeForce RTX 4090. This same setup typically runs around 220 fps with the best 4K gaming monitors. The 45GX950A is a bit brighter than other ultra-wide OLED monitors I've reviewed. That made up for its lack of Quantum Dot color. It also had a textural quality that made me want to reach out and touch objects on the screen. For daily use, the extreme curve took some getting used to. There is some image distortion from the extreme curve, but it should be easy for users to adjust. It's important to keep the screen vertical so your eyepoint is equal to all parts of the screen. The 45GX950A's stand is high enough for this purpose. My physical interactions with the 45GX950A were all positive. Takeaway: Despite its extreme shape and size, the 45GX950A is a superb gaming monitor in all respects. It might be a little too in-your-face for shooters, but I can't imagine a better screen for racing or flying sims. The dual refresh feature isn't terribly useful because it lowers pixel density too much. But it was more than smooth and responsive enough at 165 Hz to be addictive. It takes gaming to a new level of immersion and realism. Christian Eberle is a Contributing Editor for Tom's Hardware US. He's a veteran reviewer of A/V equipment, specializing in monitors.

Broken PCIe fingers are becoming a frustrating trend among Nvidia's latest flagship graphics cards based on its RTX 5090 Founders Edition design. Computer technician NorthridgeFix on YouTube published a video detailing the story of one of his customers who suffered such bad luck on not just any high-end RTX Blackwell GPU, but Nvidia's crazy-expensive $10,000 RTX Pro 6000 workstation graphics card. If only that were actually feasible — NorthridgeFix revealed that Nvidia astonishingly does not provide any replacement parts for its OEM graphics cards, despite them boasting a design that allows easy repairability of the PCIe connector alone. We covered this story and how the user got a free RTX 5090 Founders Edition replacement from Nvidia. Apparently, Nvidia watched NorthridgeFix's rant on YouTube about the lack of replacement parts for their GPUs, and that was enough to get Nvidia to replace the broken card for free, even though it was technically the customer's fault for breaking it with a waterblock in the first place. Nvidia's latest flagship Founders Edition graphics card design has the unique trait of having modularity in its design, something that is very uncommon in the graphics card world. The RTX 5090 Founders Edition and RTX Pro 6000 graphics cards are made up of three primary PCBs, including a PCB that houses all of the important bits like the GPU core, VRAM, and power delivery system, and a secondary PCB that is only responsible for providing PCIe connectivity to the graphics card. This design, by nature, makes them uniquely well designed for repairability, at least in theory. Both require specialized tools and a qualified technician to do the job. With Nvidia's latest Blackwell OEM graphics cards, their design should allow you to simply swap out the PCIe connector component with a replacement part as if you were replacing DRAM on a motherboard. However, as this unfortunate user found out, Nvidia doesn't dish out the parts, rendering the modular and repairable design somewhat obsolete. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Maybe one day Nvidia will provide replacement PCBs for its flagship graphics cards, but for now, if you own one of these cards, NorthridgeFix warns users that these graphics cards are not easily repairable. If the card breaks, there's a good chance you'll have to beg Nvidia customer support for an entirely new GPU replacement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Aedes aegypti is a species of mosquito that people like Tim Moore, district manager of a mosquito control district on the Western Slope of Colorado, really don't want to see. “Boy, they are locked into humans,” Moore said. This mosquito species is native to tropical and subtropical climates, but as climate change pushes up temperatures and warps precipitation patterns, the Aedes aegypti—which can spread Zika, dengue, chikungunya and other potentially deadly viruses—is on the move. It's popping up all over the Mountain West, where conditions have historically been far too harsh for it to survive. Now, an old residential neighborhood in Grand Junction, Colorado, has emerged as one of the latest frontiers for this troublesome mosquito. “I concluded it was a one-off, and we don't have to worry too much about this,” Moore said. But then, a few years later, it happened again. “Coincidence is not a word you use much in science,” said Hannah Livesay, biologist at the Grand River Mosquito Control District, which is based in Grand Junction. Scientific literature and mosquito researchers told them the effort was bound to be pointless. Mosquitoes are often called the most dangerous species on the planet for their ability to spread life-threatening diseases to humans. However, as climate change allows the Aedes aegypti to move northward, survive at higher elevations and stay active for longer into the fall, dengue virus is fast emerging as one of the most dangerous of the world's diseases transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks, researchers say. Between 2000 and 2024, dengue cases reported to the World Health Organization increased more than twentyfold, as climate change, urbanization and global travel and trade pushed the mosquito vector for the disease into new areas. Climate change has also lengthened the season during which the insect can breed and thrive in areas where it's endemic. About half the world's population is now at risk of dengue, according to the WHO, and between 100 and 400 million infections occur each year. In Colorado, state medical entomologist Chris Roundy said that while the mosquito is in Grand Junction, the state's public health officials are not too worried about disease spread—yet. “The presence of those mosquitoes does not mean that dengue is going to be there,” Roundy said. Still, he said, “we are keeping a very close eye on [the mosquitoes] to see if they expand their area in Grand Junction, or if we start seeing them in other counties.” On a warm and sunny October morning in Grand Junction, David Garrett, team lead for the Grand River Mosquito Control District's Aedes aegypti program, parked his white truck on what the team calls their “epicenter street” in the old residential neighborhood of Orchard Mesa, where the Aedes aegypti found a foothold in Colorado. Across the rest of Colorado, mosquito control operations aimed at preventing the spread of West Nile virus are winding down. Unlike the mosquitoes that are native to the Western Slope, which breed in standing water like ditches and ponds, the Aedes aegypti mosquito prefers to breed in containers like potted plant saucers, watering cans, and decorative yard fixtures. The traps for them look like unassuming black plastic buckets with an oddly shaped funnel attached to their tops. But before doing that, he paused to peel one of the sticky papers apart and counted four invasive mosquitoes stuck to it. Their jet black bodies with reflective white markings are easy to differentiate from the dusty brown of the native desert mosquitoes. The mosquitoes don't lay all their eggs in one basket. “So, it's really difficult to track them down.” “Tires are one of the most common places you find them,” she said. The species' preference for backyards and gardens makes it incredibly difficult to control, Livesay said. The district had to get permission from dozens of homeowners in the Orchard Mesa area to set up and maintain traps on private property, and only a handful of homeowners have allowed them to spray insecticides in their yards. On the day the team checked its traps, several residents said that they weren't aware that an invasive mosquito was present in their neighborhood. Given how costly it is to control them, further expansion of their range on the Western Slope is Moore's biggest concern. He doesn't want it to gain any more ground. “If we can't get rid of them, or at least confine them,” Moore says, “that's a huge game changer for us.” While it's virtually impossible to know how the mosquitoes got into Colorado, experts said, the pathway could've been as benign as a Grand Junction resident bringing home a potted plant from out of state. Robert Hancock, a mosquito researcher and biology professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver, said that, since the mosquito follows humans and is easily transported by the containers it breeds in, he's not surprised when it pops up in Colorado and other high and cold locations. What does surprise him is when the mosquito can survive winters in those areas. “That's the scary part, because it made it to the next summer in Grand Junction,” Hancock said, speaking in his Denver lab while feeding his own colony of Aedes aegypti, reared for research. (He allows the mosquitoes, which are completely free of disease, to feed on his own arm.) As the climate warms, Hancock said, “Aedes aegypti is performing at an extraordinarily high level.” More than half of pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change, a 2022 article in the journal Nature Climate Change found. Livesay, the biologist, suspects the newcomer mosquitoes are wiggling their way into basements and greenhouses to weather the Colorado winter, which doesn't have as many freezing nights as it used to. Grand Junction had only 17 days of below-freezing temperatures in 2024, the fewest on record, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Typically, the area gets more than two months' worth of freezing weather. Winters there have, on average, warmed 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1970. “We need a cold winter for the mosquitoes to not make it through,” Livesay said. “Things are hovering just above freezing, and they're able to last.” Big Story: How Gen Z toppled Nepal's leader and chose a new one on Discord Mark Zuckerberg's neighbors revolt against his illegal school Event: Join some of the most influential voices in tech and beyond WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The result is, unsurprisingly, a pile of world record benchmark scores. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. An incredibly ambitious hardware modder with a penchant for both sublime and ridiculous GPU tinkering has boosted an RTX 5050 to nearly 3.5GHz with a camping freezer. This test was performed as part of what Trashbench calls "the dumbest competition on YouTube" in a video about his battle against fellow overclocking YouTuber Clock Bench to see who can push the GeForce RTX 5050 harder. Determined to win, Trashbench shunt-modded his Gigabyte RTX 5050 card to unlock the card's power limits and crank it as hard as possible. The GPU reported a power draw of just 78W, but of course, due to the shunt mod, that value is completely inaccurate. To be frank, 23% doesn't sound like all that much to this greybeard's ears, but the days of 100% overclocks are sadly long gone; most modern GPUs struggle to achieve 10% even with a shunt mod. I've always said that Australians and Texans are kindred spirits. These qualities manifest in many ways, but one of the most visible is our willingness to rig up just about anything to make a point, like ol' mate Trashbench, who was also the bloke responsible for the world-record Intel Arc B580 overclock about two weeks ago. That card wasn't modified beyond replacing the cooling, though. Buc-ee's trucker hats off to Trashbench for his achievement; it's readily recognizable redneck ingenuity from the other side of the planet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A lot of apps are adding artificial intelligence to their products in the most in-your-face manner possible. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta are all adding colorful buttons and pop-ups to their user interface, and barraging their customers with marketing emails, all of which are loudly begging users to try out the new AI features. The Seattle-based company makes OmniFocus, a powerful task management application long loved by reviewers and enthusiasts for its extreme flexibility. If you can imagine a way you'd like to manage your tasks, OmniFocus is flexible enough to enable it without ever feeling overly cluttered. AI is instead added as a potential tool for anyone who wants to build automations, or anyone who installs one of the automations built by someone else. These operating systems all support one of the least-discussed new features in macOS 26—third-party applications can now utilize Foundation, the large language model that powers Apple Intelligence. To use these new features you'll also need an up-to-date version of OmniFocus, which is currently the only Omni application that supports AI. One, called Help Me Plan, can break any task in your inbox into subtasks. I tried this out on a task titled “Write about OmniFocus Automation features” and several subtasks were quickly added below, from research to drafting to finalizing. Now, these steps aren't exactly how I'd proceed in writing an article, but the idea is more to get yourself started when you feel stuck. My favorite automation, Clipboard Events, turns whatever's on your clipboard into a task, or multiple tasks, complete with an accurate description and due dates. It's a great way to turn an overwhelming block of text into a concise reminder of what you need to do next. There's extensive documentation, including a video, explaining how the automation features can connect to Apple's new Intelligence APIs, as well as how Omni's new APIs connect to it. And you can read the source code for every automation before installing it—they're generally not very long. “This is ignition, not even liftoff,” said Naomi Pearce, who does public relations for Omni. I've written before about how I don't think chatbots are the future of how we'll use AI, pointing to the indie app Substage as an example of how machine intelligence features might be used instead. That application lives under the Finder and lets you manipulate files by typing plain text commands. Once a plug-in is set up, you can use it with just a click, without having to think much about the technology. I hope all AI becomes similarly invisible in time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Valve made a big return to PC hardware this week. The Steam Machine is a revival of Valve's original Steam Machine, a failed attempt to bring PC gaming to the living room almost exactly 10 years ago. Valve claims the new Steam Machine is six times more powerful than the Steam Deck, and it's kind of like a compact PC. We don't have exact measurements yet, but some early hands-on impressions have called it similar in size to the Nintendo GameCube. The Steam Machine uses a custom Zen 4 CPU from AMD, and will reportedly be sold in several memory and storage configurations, which are user-upgradable. Valve calls the Steam Frame a “streaming-first” VR headset, meant to be connected to a PC for lag-free, wireless gaming. The Steam Frame can also be used as a stand-alone headset, running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, meaning you'd be playing x86 games on ARM in SteamOS. It's a tricky endeavor, but based on the success of the Steam Deck in juggling the emulation layers required, I trust Valve to do it in a way Microsoft has always struggled with. Here's more you may have missed this week: There's a lot more to learn about these devices, and none of the new hardware has a firm release date or price yet, as is customary with Valve. All we know is that these devices will begin shipping in early 2026. You've probably already seen or heard about the iPhone Pocket. Inspired by a “piece of cloth,” it's a tiny shoulder bag designed to carry around your iPhone, and it stems from a collaboration between Apple and Japanese design brand Issey Miyake. The two companies have enjoyed a long history—Steve Jobs famously wore Issey Miyake's black turtlenecks on stage during every major launch event. The cloth is a singular 3D-knitted construction made in Japan and will be able to fit any iPhone model. This isn't the first time Apple has suggested you put one of its products in a piece of cloth. Both are available in a range of colors, but since this is a special-edition release, you're only able to purchase them at select Apple Store locations and Apple.com in France, China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, the UK, and the US. That's the idea behind Apple's new Digital ID, a new way to add information from your US passport into Apple Wallet. You'll be able to present this form of identification even if you don't have a Real ID-compliant driver's license or state ID. (You can already add your driver's license to Apple Wallet, but this is only available in select states.) It's important to remember, though, that Apple's Digital ID does not replace a passport, which is still required for international travel. Samsung has announced a new line of “portable” monitors that are meant to travel with you around your house or office. Rather than have separate large screens in each room, the idea behind these Movingstyle monitors is to have a screen on the go—similar to LG's StanbyMe range. It's not hard to imagine scenarios where this could be convenient. Maybe you're following a recipe in the kitchen or want to finish a show you're watching on your television in the bedroom. While the 32-inch version lacks those features, it can still be swiveled, tilted, and even rotated into portrait mode. Outside of the three hours you get on the 27-inch model, you'll still need it to be plugged into power. For that, the monitors come with a 13-foot power cable. Both models come with the normal assortment of Samsung smart monitor features, but the 27-inch model is clearly the higher end, sporting not only extra portability features but also a faster, 120-Hz refresh rate. I'm interested to see how the 27-inch model in particular could fit into my day-to-day life. The new version offers lidar obstacle detection, better-quality video, and longer battery life. As it stands, if there is no federal security audit of DJI by December 23, 2025, most of the company's products will likely disappear from shelves. Insta360 has released a slew of new add-ons for its Ace Pro 2 action camera. A complete bundle of all lenses, the camera, handgrip mount, and two batteries is available for $740. The new accessories can also be purchased individually. Controlling the camera still requires using the touchscreen, but at least you can hold it and press a shutter button just like a traditional point-and-shoot. The Flash Print Bundle, as this is called, goes for $580 (includes camera, grip, and printer). Alas, there is still no 10-bit color or Log video support. Just over 100 days until Audi makes its F1 debut, the car company has taken the covers off its racing design. For three years now, Audi has been developing its power unit for Formula 1 in Neuburg an der Donau (the only operational location of an F1 team in Germany.) The hybrid setup is a turbocharged V6, an energy recovery system, energy storage, and a combined electric motor and generator, as well as an electronic control unit—a computer "brain" of the car, controlling the engine, hybrid systems, gearbox, and other components. However, despite the new tech and a new car, Audi's CEO, Gernot Döllner, seems well aware it will likely take years for the brand to be competitive for the world championship. “We are not entering Formula 1 just to be there," says Döllner. At the same time, we know that you don't become a top team in Formula 1 overnight. By 2030, we want to fight for the World Championship title.” —Jeremy White Big Story: How Gen Z toppled Nepal's leader and chose a new one on Discord Mark Zuckerberg's neighbors revolt against his illegal school Event: Join some of the most influential voices in tech and beyond WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're looking for holiday party ideas that will actually make hosting and enjoying your next holiday party easier, this is the guide for you. Here's everything I've tried to automate so far with great success, and everything I'll be trying at my next parties. A friend once told me something I've never forgotten: “You seem like a crafty person, but you actually aren't crafty at all.” She's right. My best handiwork is my smart lock installations and digital craftsmanship, like fun holiday cards I can design on tools like Canva. That digital design skill can come to life with the help of a vinyl cutter like Cricut. I had a vision to turn a happy birthday banner into a “Soup-giving” banner for my soup-themed Friendsgiving day, and I was able to easily pull up the Cricut app, choose a font that spoke to my party vibe, and instantly print it out and stick it onto the backs of the banner for a whole new look. WIRED reviewer Kat Merck has and loves the less expensive Cricut Joy Xtra ($149), with which she can create stickers and iron-on decals from designs she uploads. The vinyl can go on all kinds of things, from posters to cups, letting you get as specific with your decor as you want without any heavy lifting. I have a preschooler who gets sand, leaves, and shredded cheese everywhere he goes, so there's always a lot of cleaning to be done before my home feels habitable. (Or livable without wearing the thickest house slippers I can find.) I'm currently testing the Narwal Flow Robot Vacuum and Mop ($1,500) for our guide to the Best Robot Vacuums, but any robot vacuum and mop we recommend can help with this task. Just turn it on and let it work; I let the Narwal vacuum and mop while I installed a light strip around my kitchen island and printed out letter decoration with my Cricut. I especially like the vac-mop combos since my home is almost entirely hard flooring—nothing feels as good as my floors after a good vacuuming sesh followed by a mop job. It does take the main floor of my house the better part of two hours to get fully vacuumed and mopped, so make sure to do this well ahead of party time. But I can confirm the Narwal was able to make the crazy amount of crumbs and dried-up Play-Doh disappear from my floors; just make sure to move things like chairs or toddler towers out of the way of particularly messy spots that you want to make sure the vacuum can deep clean without any furniture legs blocking the way. The Narwal didn't get stuck on any furniture I left out, though, which was nice to see. If you're looking for something more affordable and don't mind missing out on a mop, a great affordable robot vacuum is the G10+ robot vacuum. The solution is layered lighting, bringing lighting options at various eye levels that aren't insanely bright but instead distribute light nicely throughout the room. The best way to do that is with a combination of smart lights and light strips, as you'll see in the TikTok above. These are such a great way to perfect your lighting since you can choose the right shade of white, or choose colorful holiday scenes or just colors you like. I really like GE Cync's lights, especially since both the light strips ($36 for 16 inches) and light bulbs ($35 for two) can sync to music using a built-in microphone. Cync's indoor light strip and kitchen cabinet lights ($52 for three), which I installed in my kitchen, introduce a beautiful, layered lighting look. My personal go-to for a cozy feel is the Candle Light Show you'll find in Cync's presets. My biggest struggle when I'm hosting is answering the door. It's not easy to check if the door's locked when your anxious little mind starts wondering at 10 pm whether you left it unlocked, and it's not any easier when you're trying to entertain guests on the second floor while still letting people in on the bottom floor. It was honestly such a relief not to have to jump the gate and run down the stairs every time someone arrived. I still had the Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch on my door for the party, but all of our smart lock picks let you add codes and even create temporary ones that will automatically expire after the party, so you don't have to worry about someone trying to waltz back into your home later. You can also use video doorbells to help you answer your door, or at least be alerted when someone's arrived. I have a Ring doorbell that will make my Echo devices alert me when the doorbell is rung, which can be a nice solution if you don't want people to let themselves in, but want to be able to see who's at the door without leaving the kitchen. You can also set up your smart speaker to unlock your door with a voice command, though you'll have to access the settings to specifically allow that—for security reasons, it doesn't work by default. For my latest parties, I brought the HP Sprocket Photo Booth Machine ($600), and it was a hit. It's a 21-inch-tall, portable photo booth that both automatically prints 3 x 4-inch pictures and lets you download digital versions via a QR code. I love that you can create events on the device and set up customized filters—mine had the word “Soupsgiving” on the bottom, though it was in an incredibly small font compared to the regular filter designs—and you can also add settings like how many prints of one picture guests can print. We left the default setting of two on for the soup-themed Friendsgiving, but I think I'll bump it up to at least three for future gatherings. Make sure to stock up on HP's Zink paper packs ($40 for 50) for the photo booth to print with, especially if it's a big gathering. It will need both Wi-Fi access and a power outlet. Feeding a crowd that includes some serious allergies and dietary restrictions doesn't make it any easier. In the spirit of automating everything I could, I turned to ChatGPT to come up with my appetizer for a group that featured two vegetarians and someone whose allergies include avocado, beans, shellfish, and eggs. (Getting those two sets of friends their protein needs at the same time has a singular overlap in the Venn diagram of what they can all eat: tofu.) ChatGPT did a good job brainstorming some possible options, and when I asked for a holiday angle, it came up with new options that were nice and seasonal. I was able to have this digital conversation and get the recipes all on ChatGPT's free tier, but you can hit the paywall when you ask too many questions or ask things that need more research from the artificial intelligence. Fellow WIRED reviewer Matthew Korfhage is currently testing two different robots that will cook your dishes for you, but in the meantime, the closest I've found is the 10-in-1 Ninja Foodi PossibleCooker Pro ($119). It was really helpful to use in an already busy kitchen, and I imagine it would be indispensable for big, Thanksgiving-style dinners where the stove and oven are monopolized. While I still had to do the cooking, I was able to hang out in my own little spot and let the PossibleCooker help me. It has a timer in the front to help remind me how long I've been cooking on a setting, though I do wish there were a medium setting (your choices are low and high for the cooktop settings). There are a lot of food scraps when you're cooking for events like Thanksgiving and holiday dinner parties. I really loved grabbing the canister from the FoodCycler and bringing it next to where we were cooking soups so everyone could throw their food scraps in as we went. into a sort of nutrient-rich meal that can be mixed in with potting soil or sprinkled on your lawn. I have the new FoodCycler Eco 5, and WIRED reviewer Kat Merck recommends the FoodCycler Eco 3 as one of her favorite home food recyclers. I'll be testing some of the fun holiday cocktails too. Moen Align Smart Faucet ($554): If you're tired of water splashing everywhere behind your sink, or wish it were easier to automate turning on your kitchen faucet or to measure the perfect amount of water for a recipe, Moen's touchless smart faucet with voice control is the answer. It even connects to smart assistants like Alexa. Pura 4 Smart Home Fragrance Diffuser ($50): I was hoping to try our favorite nebulizer from our guide to the Best Scent Diffusers for my soup-themed soiree, but my husband's Hungarian goulash filled our whole home with its scent a full hour before the party even started. WIRED reviewer Kat Merck has multiple Puras and says they're a great solution for areas with stale air, like my entry stairwell with no windows (but a lot of shoes).

That all-time low pricing turns a business-class laptop with professional specifications into something actually accessible for everyday users. The Intel Core i7-150U processor has 10 cores, 12 threads and a turbo speed of up to 5.4GHz, thus providing computing horsepower that handles demanding workflows with ease. In this processor architecture, workload splits between performance and efficiency cores enable the system to power through heavy applications, such as video editing or data analysis, while continuing to deliver responsive performance for background tasks. It features 32GB of DDR5-5200MHz RAM, and offers ample headroom for memory-intensive professional applications. This is ample to run several large files with a photo editing application like Adobe Photoshop, video editing timelines featuring dozens of clips, and development environments running multiple containers.DDR5 technology provides faster data transfer rates than the older DDR4 RAM which in turn translates to quicker application launches and snappier multitasking if users rapidly switch between memory-intensive programs. The consequence of such a stark difference in speed is that Windows will start up in seconds instead of minutes, files will copy rapidly, and applications launch almost instantaneously. The 16-inch FHD+ touchscreen comes with a resolution of 1920×1200, 300 nits brightness, and IPS technology for wide viewing angles. Meanwhile, the 16:10 aspect ratio is a little taller than standard 16:9 screens, providing extra vertical space handy when working with documents, spreadsheets, or web pages that show more content without the need to scroll. Wi-Fi 6E extends into the 6GHz band, offering less congestion in wireless connections with an environment full of competing networks. For $999, it's a laptop with specifications that easily command $2,000 or more in today's market.</p>

Digital hoarding becomes inevitable when you're storing years of family photos, 4K video projects, game libraries or comprehensive backup archives. That represents an all-time low for this drive and works out to approximately one cent per gigabyte of storage. The 22TB equates to roughly 5,500 hours of HD video, 440,000 photos at 5MB each or your entire Steam library a few times over, with room to spare. This amount of storage means no more constant juggling over what to keep and what to delete; you can have complete and uncompromised archives. Photographers working with RAW files store whole shoots over several years while video editors can hold project files and source footage on hand without getting mired in slow cloud retrieval or having to hot-swap several smaller drives. A 100GB folder would transfer in roughly 10 to 15 minutes at these speeds, which remains practical for most backup and archival workflows. Mac users can use it right away for standard file storage but if you want to use it with Time Machine for automated Mac backups, you'll need to reformat it to a Mac-compatible file system which only takes a few minutes through Disk Utility. Seagate includes Rescue Data Recovery Services with this drive, which provides a safety net in case the drive fails and you need professional data recovery. This service alone normally costs hundreds of dollars separately, and having it included adds more value beyond just hardware. The peace of mind factor does count when you store irreplaceable family memories or critical work files on this drive, knowing that even in worst-case scenarios you have options to recover them. That works out to roughly a cent per gigabyte, which undercuts both cloud storage and smaller capacity drives handily in terms of cost per gigabyte. A plan for 2TB of cloud storage often runs $10 to $20 per month so you'd pay $120 to $240 per year for a fraction of this drive's capacity. The math gets even more favorable over three, four, or five years of use.</p>
