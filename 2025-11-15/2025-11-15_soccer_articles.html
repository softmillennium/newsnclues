                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former coach of Malmo FF and the Danish national team, the 72-year old Norwegian Age Hareide, is seriously ill according to the Norwegian media vg.no. Hareide is currently in Milan, where Norway are due to face Italy in a decisive World Cup qualifier tomorrow. He was supposed to be present as an expert for the television station NRK in connection with the match, but he is not well enough. Norwegian international team coach Stale Solbakken has just sent a touching greeting to Hareide at a Norwegian press conference in Italy. "I send my regards to Åge Hareide, who is fighting a battle. He is one of the greatest players. Victories in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. And he knows what it's all about", said Solbakken at the press conference. Hareide was capped 50 times playing for Norway. Last year, he stepped down as coach of the Icelandic national team.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The USMNT faces Paraguay in an international friendly that arrives at a pivotal moment, yet the team enters this camp without its most influential attacker, sparking questions that stretch far beyond simple squad rotation. The manager, Mauricio Pochettino, must lead a squad stripped of several first-team pillars, but none leaves a shadow as long as the Milan winger. The opening lines of every American squad discussion include him—this time, only to point out the void he leaves behind. The USMNT arrives with momentum: two October friendlies, a draw against Ecuador and a win over Australia, stretched their unbeaten run to three. The tactical switch to a 3-4-3 suits Pochettino's personnel, and players such as Folarin Balogun, Gio Reyna and Tanner Tessmann now step into expanded roles. All of these roles initially revolve around Pulisic, whose gravity and cutting influence shape the system's identity. His absence isn't the only concern. The U.S. also lack Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Malik Tillman, Chris Richards and Antonee Robinson. He had returned to action for Milan on November 7 in a 2-2 draw against Parma, proving that his condition wasn't catastrophic. Which raised a sharper question: if he was fit enough for club soccer, why not for the national team? Christian Pulisic at center of drama: USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino fires back at Milan after star's injury storm with six-word swipe As per MilanNews.it, the club reached an agreement with the U.S. Soccer Federation to keep Pulisic in Italy during the break, allowing him to fully recover rather than risk reinjury on transatlantic travel. “Speaking with the people at Milan, but also when I was leaving the national team, we had good conversations,” Pulisic explained in a recent interview for Paramount+. “I haven't come back and played yet. Ex-USMNT star Stuart Holden thinks so, as he doesn't hold back against popular stigma “So I don't think it's right for me to fly over there and try to get my first games back with the national team. When I just want to make sure I have the time now to fully care for myself and make sure that my hamstring is doing well and allow other guys to take the place. So I think it's just the best decision for everyone right now,” he added. World Soccer Talk, like Futbol Sites, is a company owned by Better Collective.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Follow all the action across another day of UEFA World Cup qualifying! One change each as we get underway for the second stanza. Spain are at their dominant best this evening against Georgia, with La Roja now all but assured passage to next summer's World Cup barring a heroic comeback by Jvarosnebi. Goals from Oyarzabal (11' Pen), Zubimendi (22'), and Ferran (35') separate the two sides at Boris Paitchadze National Stadium. A top-class kick save from Mamardashvili denies Oyarzabal his first-half brace and Spain an even more commanding 4-0 lead. It's surely done and dusted in Tbilisi, as Ferran Torres makes it 3-0 in the 35th minute. It's been a whirlwind run of outings for Spain by Oyarzabal, who has unquestionably become a vital cog in the La Roja wheel. Arsenal's Martin Zubimendi makes it 2-0 with a delicate chip from inside the box! Spain have been at their best once again, matching the form that has seen them run riot during World Cup qualifying. Georgia will have to dig deep if they have any chance to claw their way back into this before the half-time interval. Álex Baena smashes a long-range effort off Giorgi Mamardashvili's post! It's 1-0 to Spain as Mikel Oyarzabal slots home from 12 yards out to put the European giants that much closer to officially qualifying for the 2026 World Cup! Benoît Bastien is now taking another look at the screen...and yes, penalty for Spain! It's now under review by VAR for a potential penalty... For you Georgian fans out there, here is the Jvarosnebi XI fielded by Willy Sagnol It could be a historic night for Luis de la Fuente's side, with Spain on the cusp of making it 30 unbeaten in competitive fixtures. Though they'll be without Lamine Yamal, La Roja no doubt remain confident on the back of having yet to surrender a goal across their qualifying campaign. Spain are a win or a draw away from officially booking passage to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with kickoff in Tbilisi less than an hour away. Here is the XI La Roja will field this evening against Georgia...</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A road win over Georgia on Saturday could seal Spain's spot at the 2026 World Cup. European champion Spain travels to Georgia on Saturday with lofty ambitions as it looks to continue a perfect run through World Cup qualifying and guarantee its place at the 2026 World Cup. La Roja sit three points clear at the top of Group E and are certain to finish first if they manage to beat Georgia while Turkey drops points at home to Bulgaria. That being said, a first-place finish is all but guaranteed either way as long as Spain beats Georgia, with Turkey facing an almighty deficit in goal difference ahead of its trip to Seville in the final qualifying match. Spain has dominated its rivalry with Georgia in recent years and won each of its six encounters the the Crusaders over the past four-and-a-half years. Georgia's sole win in this fixture was a friendly victory back in June 2016, but the odds of that result being repeated in Tbilisi this weekend appear incredibly slim. Georgia has won just once in four qualifiers thus far and needs three points to keep alive any chance of stealing second place, though even that would be ruled out should Turkey beat Bulgaria as expected.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The game was ended as a contest in the space of four minutes, when Bunny Shaw slid in for her side's second before Lauren Hemp capped her return from injury with a powerful strike on the stroke of half-time after Rebecca Knaak had initially opened the scoring. Still United pushed forward but City were far more ruthless, doubling their lead in the 43rd minute when Kerstin Casparij's cross was met by a sliding Shaw to slot home. Hemp capped off a brilliant first half, both for herself and her team, with a thunderous third. Knaak might've been sent off in the second half for what probably should've been a second yellow but, that aside, the second half passed by with little incident as City extended their lead at the WSL summit to four points, with second-placed Chelsea in action against Liverpool on Sunday. GOAL rates Manchester City's players from the Etihad Stadium. Commanded her box well from set pieces but had little to do otherwise. Her inviting cross set up Shaw for the second. Bombed up and down the right flank throughout. Put her head on the line to clear a late goalmouth scramble. Took the opener brilliantly, powering her header back across goal giving a scrambling Middleton-Patel no chance. Lucky to avoid a second yellow when her lunging tackle on Malard went unpunished with the referee playing advantage. A touch indecisive on the ball at times. Her failure to deal with a long ball could have set up a United goal, or got Knaak sent off. Denied an early goal when her effort was cleared off the line. Screened her back four with minimal fuss. Linked up well with Hemp and showed flashes of her brilliance on the ball. Dropped into a holding midfield role in the final 15 minutes and looked just as comfortable. So strong in possession, her low centre of gravity making it impossible for United's defenders to win the ball. Provided attacking impetus down the left and on set-pieces. A constant aerial threat and a willing runner in behind and her decision to nod back into the box set-up Knaak's opener. Took a bang to the head that ended her afternoon. Came on in the 74th minute, winning a corner almost instantly with her direct dribbling. Little time, or need, to affect proceedings. Clearly saw no need to make any major changes. He will be thrilled with his side's tenacity in keeping a clean sheet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GK Who Tried to Pay £50 Fine in Pennies Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman will be a free agent this offseason. Trinity Rodman's representation is in negotiation with the National Women's Soccer League over her future in the league, as interest from teams abroad continues. The 23-year-old will be a free agent this offseason. Rodman's agent has spoken directly to commissioner Jessica Berman about deals to keep her stateside; however, one of the key points of contention is the player's salary. Rodman's team has had talks with at least three teams in the English Women's Super League, according to sources familiar with the discussions. While the minimum player salary for this season is $48,500 and will rise to $82,500 by 2030, there is no maximum salary for an individual player. Still, the Spirit currently has 27 players' salaries to cover (with three players on loan), whereas teams in Europe do not have to abide by such caps. After her breakout rookie season in 2021, Rodman signed a three-year contract extension with an option for a fourth year, which was exercised this year. Rodman told ESPN's Futbol W at the start of the season that she has “always thought about playing overseas at some point” in her career. The Spirit's owner, Michele Kang, owns multiple teams across the U.S. and Europe, including OL Lyoness and London City Lionesses and considers herself a “globalist” when it comes to player movement, but has made it clear that keeping Rodman has been a top priority. “We're going to do everything in our power to hopefully keep her here,” Kang told reporters in March. Multiple U.S. players have made the move to Europe this season, including defender Naomi Girma and former Angel City forward Alyssa Thompson, both of whom went to Chelsea. In March, Kang ruled out a loan for Rodman to one of the other teams in her multi-club investment company, Kynisca Sports International, but said that players should experience different types of soccer throughout their career. “The European players should actually go at some point to experience the American football or different football. She was named rookie of the year in 2021, recording seven goals and seven assists, including one to Kelley O'Hara against the Chicago Stars to secure the team's first NWSL Championship title. Before her time in NWSL, Rodman was a standout for the U.S. youth national team, scoring nine goals in the team's successful 2020 Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship. She has been equally as impactful for the senior national team. Rodman has 11 goals and nine assists in 47 games with the U.S. women's national team. Rodman has spent much of this season dealing with injuries, first with a persistent back problem that limited her to 15 appearances and nine starts through 26 regular-season games. She was on the bench for Washington's penalty kick shootout win over Racing Louisville in the NWSL quarterfinals last week, but never changed out of her warm-ups, instead helping guide players from the sideline. She has been impactful for the NWSL as a whole in terms of marketing, too, and was recently the only U.S. player featured in an Adidas campaign for the 2026 men's World Cup. Rodman participated in full training on Friday ahead of today's semifinal match at Audi Field between the Spirit and the Portland Thorns.</p>

It is almost never too early to frame things around the quadrennial tournament for a number of obvious reasons, chief among them the indisputable fact that most players work day in and day out with the World Cup in mind. Four years is a lot of time to accomplish those goals but often it can feel like no time at all, depending on how you look at it. "It always feels close," U.S. men's national team defender Tim Ream said on Friday. There is, though, something undeniable about the looming deadline of their opening game at next summer's tournament, now just under seven months away. Call it What You Want: A weekly podcast where Jimmy Conrad, Charlie Davies and Tony Meola cover all things USMNT and the state of the beautiful game in the United States. Catch the show YouTube live every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. Saturday's friendly against Paraguay is the fourth-to-last before head coach Mauricio Pochettino names his World Cup roster, intending to have his group together as soon as they commence their pre-tournament training camp in late May. There is a sense of finality this month, though -- this will be the last time the USMNT convene before March, something Pochettino has emphasized since naming his roster last week. He is intent on getting as many looks at his vast player pool, having called in 71 players in his year-plus in the job, half of his 24 player roster for November's games made up of players who did not take part in October's camp. "It's to give a big boost and motivation and it's a big opportunity in November because the squad is the squad that we selected," Pochettino said about the fresh faces, including forward Ricardo Pepi, who returns to the group after an injury-plagued year. "It's great to [see him] after one year because last game from him in the national team was in November in St. Louis [a 4-2 win over Jamaica] and today, if we [did] not give him the chance today to come, we need to wait four months more, I think March, to see [him] again." The turnover from October's friendlies, a 1-1 draw with Ecuador and a 2-1 win over Australia, is the direct result of several key players being unavailable – midfielder Tyler Adams picked up an injury over the weekend, for example, while Christian Pulisic is only in the early stages of his recovery from a hamstring injury. Cohesion may be an issue as a result on Saturday against Paraguay, though the head coach has chosen a glass half full approach as he continues to embrace a spirit of experimentation. "I think it's a good test for us even if for us, it's maybe the first time that we play with this starting 11," he said. Even if we don't know too much, I think we did everything to try to create the chemistry in between the players, even if they didn't play too much together." "Intesnity" and "aggressiveness" are words that frequently come up when describing Pochettino's ethos, a wide-ranging fundamental that carries tangible and intangible demands for players. "I think there's definitely a style [of play] andI think it comes down to the work ethic," midfielder Diego Luna said. "I think that's the biggest thing for us because the talent is there with whoever we bring in and whatever players we have. Some of Pochettino's tactical preferences are finally clear to see, too, particularly in a recent switch to a back three. The formation is quickly becoming a constant but the head coach has always insisted this look is one of several the team could break out and as Ream described it, a back three can mean a variety of different things. "It's not a full on, stick with it three at the back but it's important for all the guys to get the reps to understand that sometimes we start with a four, build with a three [or] start with a three and build with a three, sometimes we play five and build with a three," Ream said. "It'll be important for all the guys that are here who haven't gotten as many reps to watch the film, make sure we're really focused in the meetings because that's where a lot of the work can really be done and a lot of the understanding can happen and then translate that and then take it out onto the field so we've worked a bit on that, a good bit on that in the last couple of training sessions and I think everybody has a pretty good understanding of it." Guys are desperate to be a part of the group and be a part of the team and be part of a World Cup on home soil." "There's not that many trainings we get to have, not that many times you get to connect with guys leading into games," Luna said. "It's challenging, but at the same time, it's super cool," Luna said about the comings and goings from camp to camp. "You got a bunch of guys coming in that are representing the badge and I think to get their opportunity and stuff shows that we have a bunch of talented players and keeps the competitive nature at the top." Pochettino has used club form as the foundation for his roster decisions, which almost automatically ruled Reyna out of the running since last winter. Since moving from Borussia Dortmund to Borussia Monchengladbach, though, Reyna is slowly building some match fitness -- but it is not the only noticeable change to the player's situation. "He's not really let the challenges overseas seep into camp, which is great to see," Ream said. "I've had a few conversations with him, nothing crazy, but he's speaking up a lot more in the trainings in terms of, 'I'm seeing this, what are you seeing?' He's really getting involved in the understanding of the movements and what we're kind of doing in the buildup and in the defensive shape so I feel like he's more in tune and more focused on the field than I've seen in the past, which is a great thing and I think weather it was injury or other things that were going on, I think his focus is so much greater now and that's a good thing. You kind of lose focus a little bit as trainings go on. Like I said, his focus seems so much more intense and greater this time around after missing out for so many camps." Reyna is also joined in camp by midfielder Sebasitan Berhalter, the son of ex-USMNT head coach Gregg, the pair on opposite sides of a family feud that included their parents. Reyna's parents, former national team players Claudio and Danielle, had complained to U.S. Soccer about his playing time and Danielle eventually shared a decades-old domestic violence incident involving Gregg and his now-wife Rosalind, which led U.S. Soccer to launch an investigation that eventually cleared Gregg of wrongdoing. "I heard something but for me, it's not important," Pochettino said. It was not top of mind for anyone else in camp, either. "I completely forgot about it until the third or fourth day and I was like, 'oh wait a minute,'" Ream said. "But no, it's not really been discussed amongst the team. Like I said, everybody's trying to make this team. It's good to see that their focus is here and now and hopefully both of those guys can impress over the next couple of months."

CHESTER, Pa. — The best version of this U.S. men's national team, the version that crushes any reasonable expectation at next summer's World Cup and propels soccer into a new stratosphere in the United States, almost certainly has Gio Reyna on it. 

Reyna, who started for Borussia Dortmund at age 17. Reyna, who was going to be bigger and better than Christian Pulisic. Reyna, who turned 23 on Thursday and still has so much more to give and so much time to reach his untapped potential.

Reyna, who until this week had gone seven months without a national team call-up and for whom the fallout from the 2022 World Cup still hangs over everything. 

In Qatar, Reyna reportedly was almost sent home and had to apologize to his teammates for a lack of effort in training and did not start any of Team USA's four games. </p>

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Before their weekend game, the Eagles met up with four players from a team that plays a different type of football.

Saquon Barkley, Cooper DeJean, A.J. Brown, and Jalen Hurts welcomed members of the U.S. Men's National Soccer Team to the NovaCare Complex following Thursday's practice.

The U.S. plays Paraguay at Subaru Park in Chester Saturday evening in a friendly match-up, as preparations continue for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Some of the Eagles, including wide receiver Britain Covey, showed off some of their impressive soccer skills to the surprise of their teammates and the U.S. men's team.</p>
