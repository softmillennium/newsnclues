When Arnold Schwarzenegger played game show contestant Ben Richards in the 1987 version of Stephen King's dystopian novel “The Running Man,” his adventures took place in a relatively confined subterranean world. When “Baby Driver” and “Last Night in Soho” director Edgar Wright took on the challenge of reimagining King's novel for 2025, he decided to go back to the more ambitious scale of the original story — even though it meant taking on the biggest production of his career. It's hide and seek on a national, even global scale — there's nothing in the rules to say you couldn't get out of the country. The Arnold Schwarzenegger version kept it all contained.” With that in mind, Wright pitched his “Running Man,” in which Glen Powell plays the game show contestant running for his life, less as a remake than a new adaptation of the novel. “Having now done the shoot and been totally exhausted by it, I understand it was a practical decision rather than an artistic one.” “The Running Man,” which encompassed 165 different locations and sets across England, Scotland, and Bulgaria, may have exhausted Wright, but for the audience it's more energizing than tiring thanks to the movie's high style and carefully calibrated pacing. It's essentially a non-stop chase in the tradition of Sam Peckinpah's “The Getaway” (adapted by screenwriter Walter Hill from the Jim Thompson novel), and it not only shares that film's elegant sense of structure and visual dynamism but its approach to the hero. “ Usually when I make a movie, we watch a good luck film before we start production,” Wright said. “The week before we started shooting, we got together and watched ‘The Getaway,' because Glen had actually never seen it. [Steve] McQueen had immense power and charisma, not saying very much at all, and you could point to a lot of his performances, but that's a really great one in terms of how to hold the screen.” “We talked about two performances a lot,” Wright said. The other influence was Bruce Willis' performance as John McClane in “Die Hard.” “In the first one at least, even though he's a cop, the exciting thing is that for large portions of the film, he's out of his depth, and you think there's no way that he can take on all of these guys and win. What we talked about [in ‘The Running Man'] was the idea that Ben Richards is on his heels the entire time, and there's something really fun and hopefully exciting about the fact that he's just trying to tough his way through it.” What really made him nervous wasn't making the movie — it was getting script approval from the book's author, one of Wright's childhood heroes. “[Stephen King]  is a producer on the film and had script approval and some cast approval as well,” Wright said. “I had been in contact with him on and off for years, and he'd always been really kind, but when I was working on [the script for ‘The Running Man'], I didn't talk to him about it until we were very close to it happening, because I didn't want to be the boy who cried wolf. Once Wright was pretty sure the movie was on its way to a green light, he sent King the script he co-wrote with Michael Bacall and waited for the author's response. “Stephen King is probably the most famous English teacher in the world, and it was literally having to hand in your homework to Stephen King and over a very long weekend. I was like, ‘Please, just read the whole thing! Luckily, King liked the script, but after some early conversations about casting, he stayed away until the movie was finished. “He said this thing that really stuck with me, and it's what I hope the audience will take away from it as well,” Wright said. And I was thinking, ah, you can't say it better than that. I couldn't ask for anything more, really.” To hear the entire conversation with Edgar Wright about and make sure you don't miss a single episode of Filmmaker Toolkit, subscribe to the podcast on Apple, Spotify, or your favorite podcast platform.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” star Jen Affleck is standing by her husband Zac Affleck after their relationship was subject to scrutiny during her run on “Dancing With The Stars.” Jen was eliminated from the competition during the October 28 episode following her Halloween-themed contemporary routine to Taylor Swift's “Look What You Made Me Do.” Someone on TikTok reenacted Zac's reaction to Jen and partner Jan Ravnik's elimination, utilizing a popular trend on the app where a person pretends to look sad before smiling for a split second at the camera before looking sad again. “Youre honestly disgusting,” Zac wrote in the comments, “Grow up.” News that she did with her “Mormon Wives” castmate Jessi Ngatikaura, Jen expressed her frustration with all the speculation. Jen noted how her and Zac were both still learning to deal with all the attention. “We're working on just tuning out the noise of the world—I think it still is hard for him.” She added, “It's hard to have to constantly open your phone and see negative comments and it's hard not to take that in,” she explained. “I feel like we've grown so much,” she reasoned. This isn't the first time that Jen has stood firmly by her marriage to Zac. “He's the one who checks that l've actually eaten breakfast, who reminds me to sleep and makes sure I get real rest. What you don't see are all the quiet ways he keeps us going-cooking, cleaning, kid duty, and those late-night shifts with Penny. This journey truly wouldn't be possible without him, and for that, I am forever grateful.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hot on the heels of Contenders Film: London, Deadline is back home in Los Angeles where it all began — the birthplace of our Contenders and the original beloved city of Hollywood moviemaking. While she will be beaming in virtually to our stage to chat with Eleanor the Great screenwriter and executive producer Tory Kamen, the 95-year-old Squibb has a pretty decent excuse for not being here in person: she's busy preparing to tread the boards every night on Broadway right now. DaCosta will be joined by star Tessa Thompson and production designer Cara Brower. In another period story, we're going back to WWII with Nuremberg — writer-director James Vanderbilt's close-up on a psychiatrist, played by Rami Malek, assigned to watch over the Nazis approaching the Nuremberg trials. Vanderbilt and Malek will be with us to talk about the film, which also stars Russell Crowe in the role of Hermann Göring. Going further back still, we're in 1930s Mississippi for some vampire magic with Sinners, starring Michael B. Jordan, not once, but twice. Writer-director-producer Ryan Coogler will be on stage to discuss. We return to the '90s with Christy, a true-life story of a champion boxer fighting her way to freedom from an oppressive marriage. Sydney Sweeney will be here to talk about taking on this very punchy role as an actor and producer, alongside producer Kerry Kohansky-Roberts. All the way from South Korea, we have the satirical black comedy No Other Choice from filmmaker Park Chan-wook, who'll have his lead actor Lee Byung-hun with him on our stage to talk about this film that takes unemployment issues to a whole new level. And from Norway, we'll have the team behind Sentimental Value, led by filmmaker Joachim Trier, with his The Worst Person in the World collaborator Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsgård, Elle Fanning and newcomer Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas joining him fo a discussion. The makers of Homebound, the Oscar submission for India, will take to our stage too, with director Neeraj Ghaywan and actors Ishan Khatter and Vishal Jethwa. We'll also have some stunning animation on board, with Japanese fantasy feature Dragon Heart: Adventures Beyond this World, from director Isamu Imkake. You'll also want to strap in for the ride with F1, the film that puts us in the hot seat with both Brad Pitt and Damson Idris as they race their way to Formula 1 stardom. Director-producer Joseph Kosinski will be at Contenders with supervising sound editor Al Nelson, to talk about capturing the roar of the racetrack, among other things. We'll have the team from Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere, including writer-director-producer Scott Cooper, and Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater will be here with their Blue Moon, Linklater's film about songwriter Lorenz Hart. Last but definitely not least, we've giving a shout-out to those brave, unsung heroes of the screen: stuntpeople. They will have their own panel, along with those other all-too-hidden gems: casting directors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As BravoCon draws fans, cast members, and network executives into a weekend of panels and breaking news, Andy Cohen's filmed at-home visit with “Real Housewives of Potomac” star Karen Huger is emerging as one of the convention's biggest talking points. Bravo screened the trailer for attendees on Friday, revealing Cohen's unannounced arrival at Huger's Potomac home shortly after her release from a six-month stay in a Maryland detention center. The outlet reported that she was released in September and immediately reunited with her family while Bravo cameras captured the moment. The midseason trailer shows Cohen greeting Huger inside her home and telling her, “You are a free woman,” People reported. Huger responds by saying she is ready to speak openly about addiction, accountability, and the events leading up to her sentencing. The footage teases a raw conversation that positions Huger's personal challenges as a centerpiece of the remaining season. Cohen's willingness to meet Huger in her home, rather than on a reunion set, marks a tonal shift in how the franchise addresses real-life crises. The visit also reframes Cohen's role. Instead of moderating disputes from the reunion couch, he engages Huger in a one-on-one conversation about recovery and consequences. As BravoCon continues, fans are speculating about Huger's long-term future on the series. Bravo has not confirmed whether she will hold a full-time position next season, but the network's decision to center her storyline in the trailer suggests she remains an important part of the franchise. Producers appear to be leaning into an arc that blends vulnerability, rehabilitation, and the high-stakes interpersonal drama that defines the Housewives universe.

Quentin Tarantino once defined the “hangout” film as “movies that you hangout with the characters so much that they actually become your friends,” and he declared his friend Richard Linklater its master. While a guest on this week's episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, we asked Linklater what he thought of the subgenre Tarantino had tagged his films with. “Maybe he got that from me,” chuckled Linklater. That is the tone, I want the viewer to feel like they're transported to a place and that they are participating in some way, and that there is a relation with the character.” Linklater, like many cinephiles, has long held a reverence for the French New Wave — that time when cinema felt young, new, and full of possibilities. And the idea of transporting back to what it felt like to be in that moment was something he found appealing. But to accomplish that, he had to throw his reverence for that moment in history, and the great filmmakers in it, out the window. According to Linklater, that's where most period films fail. “I've always just rolled my eyes at most ‘important' historical films,” said Linklater. I just keep coming back to the word self-important. The greatest moments in history were preceded by someone just having a sandwich.” You can't even make your way through his writing for ‘Cahiers du Cinéma. Linklater believes films about historical figures can suffer from their star power. He acknowledges and rattles off the great performances given by A-list stars in biopics but admits that for him, there's always something distracting about the layering of icon on icon. “I always remember the feeling I got watching ‘Gandhi' 42 years ago now, and if you didn't know London theater, you didn't really know who Ben Kingsley was. I was a kid in Texas and I knew a lot about Gandhi at that time, and watching it just going, ‘Oh, that's Gandhi,' because I didn't know who the actor was,'” said Linklater. “ I heard Dustin Hoffman wanted to play Gandhi. And he probably would've been pretty good,  but I was transported.” It was that feeling the director wanted for “Nouvelle Vague.” Linklater was very conscious of the cinephile audience who would be drawn to his film — people like himself who think of Godard, Jean-Paul Belmondo (Aubry Dullin), François Truffaut (Adrien Rouyard), and Claude Chabrol (Antoine Besson) as these iconic figures in cinema — which is why he believes his ensemble of fresh-faced French actors was the most important ingredient. The much more important part is their personalities and who they are,” said Linklater. “Aubry, who plays Belmondo, he had this light, airy [quality], quick smile, happy — he struck me as Belmondo, like, ‘I don't care much. Linklater auditioned Belmondo's real-life grandson, who he said is a good actor and would have been fine, but Dullin embodied the spirit and just “felt right.” Linklater said it often came down to what the actors felt like in the room during auditions, and he could really tell he had caught lightning in a bottle when he got them in the room together. “I remember sitting down with the actors who would play Godard, Truffaut, and Suzanne Schiffman (Jodie Ruth-Forest). And they're like, ‘Oh my God, I see what you're talking about.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Born in Portland, Oregon, and relocating to northern California after high school, Snider rambled his way to Texas in the 1980s, where he met and was mentored by the songwriter Jerry Jeff Walker. His 2004 album East Nashville Skyline is considered essential to the alt-country catalog. I had a predisposition for it,” Snider told Rolling Stone in 2023. Along with Walker, Snider befriended and learned from songwriting greats like Billy Joe Shaver, John Prine, Jimmy Buffett, Guy Clark, and Kris Kristofferson. “Nobody's ever deserved there to be a heaven more than John Prine,” Snider told Rolling Stone in 2020 following the singer-songwriter's death. “And if there's not a heaven, they oughta get one together pretty quick, because John's coming.”The loss of each of those guiding lights for Snider (Walker died six months after Prine) shook the musician — “I sing about dead friends more than girls these days,” he said in the press materials for what would be his last album, 2025's High, Lonesome and Then Some. But they also left him as the flag-bearer for a certain type of songwriting, one informed by lived experiences, both good and bad, and plainspoken, honest lyricism. “One thing I learned from John Prine is if you're not embarrassing yourself, then I don't know,” Snider told Rolling Stone in 2014. And if she wrote a book, I bet you it would just be full of her not ever making mistakes.” Snider reveled in life's mistakes — whether he learned from them or not wasn't the point. “You're gonna mix my emotions and you're gonna tangle my net/You're gonna make me do somethin'/that I'm afraid I won't regret,” he sang in the bold-faced cheating song “Trouble,” off his 1994 debut, Songs for the Daily Planet. The fan favorite “Alright Guy,” off that same LP, found him admitting flaws like smoking too much weed and having a propensity for getting arrested. In his 2014 memoir, I Never Met a Story I Didn't Like, Snider openly shared many of his missteps with the world, proving himself just as fearless an author as he was a songwriter. While artists from Gary Allan and Mark Chesnutt to Loretta Lynn and Tom Jones all recorded his songs, and he released Songs for the Daily Planet (with Buffett's help) on the major label MCA, Snider never abandoned his DIY roots. He put out a strings of albums for Prine's indie label, Oh Boy Records, beginning with 2000's Happy to Be Here and culminating with the 2004 masterpiece East Nashville Skyline. The latter contained one of Snider's signatures, “Play a Train Song,” which Robert Earl Keen recorded in 2011. Todd Snider Health Situation 'Complicated' After Late Walking Pneumonia Diagnosis Champs Leader, ‘Tequila' Hit Maker Dave Burgess Dead at 90 Sally Kirkland, Best Actress Oscar Nominee for ‘Anna,' Dead at 84 In 2008, Snider founded his own label, Aimless Records, and issued the EP Peace Queer, a collection of politically biting songs. In 2012, he paid tribute to Walker with an album of his songs, and then unflinchingly probed life in a haves-and-have-nots America with Agnostic Hymns and Stoner Fables, released that same year. Snider toured relentlessly, both solo and as part of his side project Hard Working Americans with Widespread Panic's Dave Schools and the late guitarist Neal Casal. On the road, he entertained crowds with his dry wit and wealth of stories. Various battles with drug addiction and stints in rehab pockmarked his career. Still, Snider soldiered on with music, playing livestreamed shows during the pandemic from his studio-slash-clubhouse, the Purple Building, in East Nashville, and releasing latter-day albums like 2021's First Agnostic Church of Hope and Wonder and 2023's Crank It, We're Doomed. In the fall of 2025, he released High, Lonesome and Then Some, an album of loping blues-like numbers with titles like  “Unforgivable (Worst Story Ever Told).” “I at least want to do it one more time,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kiss paid tribute to Ace Frehley before the band's first show since the death of their former guitarist in October. “Obviously, before we get going — and we're going to have an awesome time — we just wanted to take a moment to think about about somebody who was at the foundation of this band. “We certainly had differences, but that's what family is about. Why don't we take a moment, little quiet, and think about him looking down on us – from [the planet] Jendell, probably – and let's have a moment for Ace.” Frehley died Oct. 16 at the age of 74 from injuries he sustained in a fall. No one can touch Ace's legacy.” Simmons said in a statement at the time. Sadder still, Ace didn't live long enough to be honored at the Kennedy Ctr Honors event in Dec.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britney Spears' song “Slumber Party” appeared to become her reality Friday night, as she was seen cozying up in bed with Kim and Khloé Kardashian, 41, in two selfies posted to Instagram. The “Toxic” singer, who was joined by her longtime manager, Cade Hudson, appeared to be visiting the SKIMS founder's Hidden Hills home. “Calabasas nights,” Kim, 45, wrote atop the first image in her Instagram Stories. Khloé, on the other hand, opted for a pair of Christmas-themed pajamas and wore her tresses down in loose waves. As for Spears, she wore a yellow-and-white ensemble. While the hangout may be unexpected, Kim and Spears have known each other for quite some time. “It can really break even the strongest person. No one deserves to be treated with such cruelty or judgment for entertainment.” It was also previously reported that Kim wanted to help Spears break free from her 13-year conservatorship. “She reached out to Britney as soon as she read her [court] statement,” an insider told Closer magazine back in 2021.

A judge ultimately terminated the guardianship in November 2021. Kim and Spears, who are both friends with Paris Hilton, reportedly met in the early 2000s. The duo were last photographed together at a 2012 Grammy Awards party.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vicki Gunvalson is officially returning to The Real Housewives of Orange County as a full-time housewife. It was during the taping of The Bravos amid BravoCon in Las Vegas that Andy Cohen presented Gunvalson with her orange. ”Vicki, would you join us as a housewife for Season 20?” Cohen asked Gunvalson on stage. Deadline understands that no deal has been finalized yet but the offer is now on the table to start negotiations. It was RHOC that started the franchise, which gave way to The Real Housewives franchise, expanding to other cities, including New York City, Atlanta, Potomac, Beverly Hills, Dubai, Miami, Salt Lake City, and more. However, the honor of holding an orange again as a full-time housewife to celebrate 20 years of the franchise proved that Gunvalson remains an icon. RHOC premiered on Bravo in 2006, and Gunvalson quickly became a fan-favorite for her outrageous personality and her ability to “Whoop it up” at Andale's in Puerto Vallarta, or any of the cast's trips. RELATED: Jeff Lewis Set For Bravo Return With ‘Still Flipping Out' Series Gunvalson's return comes as she and fellow RHOC co-star Tamra Judge appear to have reconciled following a feud that played out in the media and on social media. Judge had been estranged from Gunvalson and Shannon Beador, and Season 20 of the series will surely chronicle how the “Tres Amigas” will hash out their differences and get the trip back together. RELATED: BravoCon 2025 Cast Photos: All The Stars Confirmed For Fan Event The RHOC cast from Season 19 includes Tamra Judge, Shannon Beador, Heather Dubrow, Gina Kirschenheiter, Emily Simpson, Jennifer Pedranti, and Katie Ginella.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several venues reported packed rooms, lines down the street, and tabs running dry within hours. Amyl and The Sniffers turned a last-minute cancellation into an unforgettable night for Melbourne's live-music community on Friday, after their free all-ages show at Federation Square was shut down minutes before they were due to take the stage. The Aussie rockers, who had been set for a triumphant hometown performance, redirected their entire AU$5,000 performance fee to seven local venues — a gesture that quickly grew into a AU$35,000 bar tab shared across some of the city's most beloved rooms. Megan Moroney Scores Third Country Airplay Top 10 With '6 Months Later' Monica Calls Chris Brown 'The Greatest Entertainer' Alive: 'I Don't Give a Damn Whose Song It Is, He Makes It Better' According to ABC Australia, the gig was halted after multiple breaches of the security barrier raised concerns about crowd safety. “Have a drink on us,” Taylor said in the video posted to social media over the weekend, which has since clocked more than 1 million views. Several venues reported packed rooms, lines down the street, and tabs running dry within hours. It also collected major honors at the 2025 AIR Awards, including Independent Album of the Year and Best Independent Punk Album or EP. The band is up for multiple ARIA Awards this year — including Album of the Year and Best Group — marking a new peak in their national profile. They also joined AC/DC for a run of Australian stadium dates in November, cementing a milestone for a band that cut its teeth in the same small rooms they helped support on Friday night. Friday's bar-tab blowout underscored the deep roots Amyl and The Sniffers maintain in Melbourne's grassroots scene, even as their profile accelerates worldwide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actor and podcaster Dasha Nekrasova—best known, in many circles, for her supporting turn on HBO's Succession, as crisis PR operative/Cousin Greg love interest Comfrey—has reportedly been fired by her representation at Gersh. Nekrasova has long blended her espoused political views—which have reportedly swung along the outer edges of a number of different portions of the spectrum over the last several years—with her more mainstream work, having gained early attention for touting pro-Bernie Sanders comments on Alex Jones' InfoWars. She started her own podcast, co-hosted by Anna Khachiyan, in 2018, occasionally raising eyebrows with the show's “dirtbag left”-adjacent political stances and statements, but never in a way that seemed to directly impact her more mainstream career. That appears to have changed with the interview with Fuentes, though, who's considered the leader of the far-right “groypers,” a loose-knit organization that describes itself as “Christian nationalist” and “America First,” and which tends to get described by everybody else as racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, and plenty more besides. The conversation between Fuentes, Nekrasova, and Khachiyan, which was originally broadcast in late October, but has circulated more widely in recent weeks, doesn't do much to disabuse listeners of those sentiments, either, including conversations that seem to reinforce negative stereotypes about immigrants and ethnic groups, with a special amount of focus put on Jewish people. In any case, it pretty clearly crossed a line for Gersh, which cut ties with Nekrasova earlier on Friday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been a banner week for delusion on the internet—never not a growth market, as it happens—and specifically in the world of AI grifters. It also helps that it's the kind of thing that would feel heavy-handed popping up in a story about humanity letting AI excesses run amuck, to the extent that we literally have a Black Mirror episode about how this kind of thing is a terrible idea. Who else would you trust to sell you a shallow, repetitive facsimile of the most important missing people in your life, but the fourth-billed lead on Austin & Ally, right?) On the other hand, we really don't know what to do with the following paragraph, from a recent Today article about an application called “Text With Jesus.” We're just going to reprint it in its entirety because, well, fuck: In other words, users can text questions to Jesus and get a response.

(Among other things, the app's already produced the television spectacle of Today co-host Carson Daly trying, in real time, to process a day-time TV version of his actual feelings about a virtual Christ.) Personally, our big worry is just how much money that there probably, depressingly, is in giving people instant access to even auto-complete garbage answers to life's most fundamental questions. (A very quick perusal of various app stores shows that Text With Jesus, which supposedly has 150,000 users, is not alone in this fAIth-based space; we were especially drawn to the Catholicism-minded One Day Confession App, which promises, with a straight face, an “AI-driven confession experience.”) Jesus Christ, The Carpenter's Son is bland Biblical horror By Jacob Oller November 11, 2025 | 5:00pm JEZEBELTeen Girl Was Allegedly Homeless When Matt Gaetz Paid $400 to Have Sex With Her PASTE10 Years Ago, Justin Bieber Confronted a Strange New Era On Purpose ENDLESS MODEThe Disney Destiny Is a Cruise Ship with Character (and Characters)</p>

The streaming service has access to more than 95 other live channels — including BET, CNN, Food Network and more — starting at $64.99 per month for the first three months of service ($82.99 monthly) and comes with Hulu's entire streaming library, as well as Disney+ and ESPN Unlimited. Hulu is currently offering a three-day free trial to try before you commit. Sling might be a good fit to watch the UCLA-Ohio State on NBC — and the live TV streaming service is on sale for half off your first month of service. The streaming plan comes with other news, entertainment and sports channels, such as Fox, Discovery Channel, FS1, MSNBC, NFL Network, SYFY, National Geographic and others. Please note: Pricing and channel availability varies from location-to-location. You can watch by tuning in through your cable TV provider, on NBCSports.com or the NBC Sports mobile app with your cable TV account login — including streaming and traditional services such as DirecTV, Fubo, Hulu + Live TV, Sling, Verizon, Xfinity and others. Tickets are available for the UCLA-Ohio State game at StubHub, Ticket Liquidator, Ticketmaster and GameTime — prices depend on seat location. One of the best deals on last-minute tickets right now is at TicketNetwork, which offers The Hollywood Reporter readers $150 off orders of $500 with promo code THR150 or $300 off orders that are $1,000 and up with code THR300.
