                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Climate change is already driving a global health emergency, with over 540 000 people dying from extreme heat each year and 1 in 12 hospitals worldwide at risk of climate-related shutdowns, warns a new special report, released today jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Government of Brazil (COP30 Presidency) and the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The COP30 Special report on health and climate change: delivering the Belém Health Action Plan, notes that rising temperatures and collapsing health systems are claiming more lives, and calls for immediate and coordinated action to protect health in a rapidly warming world. With global temperatures now exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the world is already experiencing mounting health impacts. Without rapid decarbonization, the number of health facilities at risk could double by mid-century, which stresses the critical importance of implementing adaptation measures to safeguard health infrastructure. The health sector itself contributes around 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and needs rapid transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient systems. The report identifies persistent gaps that require urgent attention. "The evidence is clear: protecting health systems is one of the smartest investments any country can make," said Professor Nick Watts, Chair of the Expert Advisory Group and Director, NUS Centre for Sustainable Medicine. "Allocating just 7% of adaptation finance to health would safeguard billions of people and keep essential services operating during climate shocks – when our patients most need them." There is progress being made; between 2015 and 2023, the number of countries with national Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems (MHEWS) doubled to 101, now covering about two-thirds of the global population. Cost-effective, high-impact, and no-regret interventions exist for each component of the Belém Health Action Plan. But adaptation strategies could ultimately fail unless they address the root causes of health inequity – both within health systems and across society. The Government of Brazil also released a companion report, Social participation, climate and health: a special report to support implementation of the Belém Health Action Plan, which focuses on social participation, governance, and community engagement as a critical dimension of the Belém Health Action Plan. The report highlights that climate change poses profound risks to human health, particularly for vulnerable and historically marginalized populations, and that effective adaptation requires the active involvement of communities in designing, implementing, and monitoring health policies. The report provides clear data and evidence that climate change is already directly affecting health systems around the world," says Dr Alexandre Padilha, Minister of Health, Brazil. "Recent tragedies show that now is the time to implement policies and actions that address the impacts of climate change on health. The Belém Health Action Plan and this report offer countries the tools they need to turn scientific evidence into concrete action." The Plan also outlines three lines of action for climate-resilient health systems: Drawing on more than 70 case studies from around the world, the report identifies practical interventions already delivering results – from early warning systems and green hospital design to climate-informed health planning and sustainable financing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The World Health Organization (WHO) is marking its first official observance of World Prematurity Day with the launch of a new global clinical practice guide for Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) – a simple, proven and life-saving intervention that significantly improves survival for preterm and low birth-weight babies. Among other positive impacts, it is associated with a more than 30% reduction in newborn deaths, a close to 70% reduction in hypothermia and a 15% reduction in severe infections – as well as improved weight gain and better longer-term health and cognitive development. It should now be universal clinical practice for all small and preterm babies, ensuring they have the best chance to survive and thrive." Dr. Jeremy Farrar, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Care Geared at health workers, facility managers as well as caregivers, the new WHO guide offers detailed, step-by-step, adaptable guidance for initiating, maintaining, and monitoring KMC. It states that all preterm or low birth weight newborns should receive KMC starting immediately after birth - unless they are unable to breathe on their own or their blood pressure and circulation drops to dangerously low levels, requiring urgent treatment. While mothers should typically be the primary providers, fathers and other family members can also give KMC if the mother is unable – as well as providing critical emotional and practical support. KMC can be practiced at all levels of health facilities – from the labour room or the operating theatre to postnatal wards and special or intensive newborn care units – and can be continued at home. It also outlines how health facilities create enabling environments for KMC through supportive policies and training staff. Family-friendly approaches are crucial for successful implementation, the guide notes – including ensuring mothers can always be together in the same room as their babies. On this World Prematurity Day, with the theme 'A strong start for a hopeful future', WHO is calling on governments, health systems and partners to prioritize quality care for preterm and low birth weight babies. This means ensuring dedicated wards or facilities with specially trained neonatal staff providing round-the-clock care for small and sick newborns, as well as universal access to essential equipment and medicines like antibiotics. This increases risks from infections, hypothermia, heart problems, respiratory distress, and other life-threatening complications. "It's time to ensure every baby gets the attention they need, by investing in special care for small or sick babies, alongside quality maternity services that can prevent many occurrences of preterm birth."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At NYU Langone Health, midwives are fully integrated into obstetric care, giving patients the benefits of personalized guidance in an environment equipped for urgent, advanced treatment. That approach shaped the experience of Juliette Sardou, who planned to deliver her first child at home until a scan during a third trimester prenatal appointment revealed that her baby had an irregular heartbeat. She was referred to NYU Langone for further testing, where an evaluation by Colin K. Phoon, MD, a pediatric cardiologist in the Pediatric Congenital Heart Center at Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at NYU Langone, revealed a twisted (tortuous) ductus arteriosus - a heart condition that would require ongoing monitoring. The ductus arteriosus is a vessel that helps circulate blood before birth. To help ensure the safety of both Sardou and her baby, Dr. Phoon advised against having the birth at home, but he wanted to make the transition to hospital-based care more comfortable for Sardou and her partner. We knew Juliette had a strong vision for her birth experience, so our goal was to support that as much as possible while also providing the specialized monitoring her baby needed. This is a great example of how we coordinate with multiple specialties to balance patient safety with an experience that feels personal and supportive." At 37 weeks, Sardou developed high blood pressure and was admitted to the hospital for delivery. "I felt like every single midwife really had my back," Sardou said. "They handled any stressful moment with a lot of ease. "I feel so grateful for the midwives," Sardou said. "They made an overwhelming situation manageable, supportive, and joyful." At NYU Langone, certified midwives are integrated members of the labor and delivery team, offering patients personalized care during pregnancy, birth, and beyond. Midwives also attend births at NYU Langone Hospital - Brooklyn. "We take time to understand each person's values and preferences to create birth plans that prioritize mobility, comfort, and minimal intervention when medically appropriate." The midwifery team works closely with obstetrician-gynecologists and maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists, allowing patients to go through labor as naturally as possible while having access to additional medical support if complications arise. The collaborative approach also means that some high-risk patients can still have midwifery-attended care. "Patient safety is always our top priority," said Justin Brandt, MD, director of the maternal-fetal medicine division. "Because we work hand in hand with our midwifery colleagues from the start, we can anticipate needs, respond quickly when circumstances change, and make decisions together with the patient. When Alison Ferrell became pregnant with her first child, she was relatively new to New York City and didn't yet have an established obstetric provider. She initially sought care at another practice, but each visit left her feeling rushed and unheard. The experience changed when she transferred her care to NYU Langone's midwifery team. From her first appointment, Ferrell noticed a different approach. When answers to her questions weren't immediately available, she received follow-up phone calls. I felt like somebody that was being cared for in a very personalized way." During labor, unexpected challenges developed, including an infection that required antibiotics. Under Montesinos's care, and with partnership from the generalist obstetrics team, each step was explained clearly, with safety prioritized alongside her goal for mobility and minimal intervention. Ferrell delivered a baby girl, Sydney, and both went home in good health. Recognizing that postpartum recovery can be overwhelming, Montesinos followed up with a call just to check in.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Q: How would you summarize your study for a lay audience?Millions of people worldwide continue to experience lingering symptoms after COVID-19, a condition known as long COVID. These symptoms can affect people of all ages and often include neurological issues such as "brain fog," which makes thinking and memory difficult. Because these problems can significantly disrupt daily life, researchers are working to find effective treatments. Our clinical trial tested whether raising levels of NAD⁺ - a molecule that helps cells produce energy -through nicotinamide riboside (NR), a form of vitamin B3, could improve health outcomes. Participants took NR supplements for up to 20 weeks, and we tracked changes over time. Previous research suggests COVID-19 may interfere with NAD⁺-related biological processes, possibly contributing to neurological symptoms.In our study, we wanted to know if boosting NAD⁺ through NR supplementation could improve cognitive function and ease common long COVID symptoms. Q: What methods or approach did you use? We ran a 24-week clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital between August 2021 and September 2023. We enrolled 58 people with long COVID and randomly split them into two groups: The others left the study for reasons such as getting COVID again, moving, changing medications or experiencing possible side effects. Other symptoms like fatigue, sleep and mood also didn't show big differences between groups. However, in exploratory post hoc analyses with a slightly larger sample size of everyone who took NR for at least 10 weeks, we observed improvements in self-reported fatigue, sleep, and depressive symptoms after 10 weeks of NR supplementation compared to baseline. Some also performed better on a task of executive functioning, a set of mental skills that help us, for example, plan, organize, and switch between tasks. This suggests that some people may benefit from the use of NR, even if the overall results didn't show clear differences between groups. Long COVID affects an estimated 400 million people worldwide, yet its causes remain unclear. In this study, high-dose NR safely boosted NAD⁺ levels. While results were mixed, findings suggest that boosting NAD⁺ may play a role in easing symptoms like fatigue and poor sleep for some people. This points to a promising direction for future treatments.The most common side effects were mild, such as easy bruising or rash. None were serious, and only a few participants discontinued due to side effects Are people with lower baseline NAD⁺ levels or higher inflammation more likely to improve? Because long COVID often involves inflammation, an important question is whether boosting NAD⁺ can help reduce it. We also plan to analyze physical activity data collected during the trial, as well as examine whether other supplements taken by participants influenced NR's effects. Wu, C. Y., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For many Americans, health care debt is to blame. More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have health care debt. In response, more than a dozen states have instituted laws to keep these unpaid bills off consumer credit reports. The Trump administration has been chipping away at these protections. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, headed by President Donald Trump's budget director, issued new guidance that challenges state laws, saying only the federal government can decide what can go in a credit report. Consumer advocates say that move could undercut state-level protections and worsen the financial strain on Americans burdened by medical bills. KFF Health News senior correspondent Noam N. Levey appeared on WAMU's “Health Hub” on Nov. 12 to explain why state laws like these could be especially important in the wake of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, set to kick millions off Medicaid, and the potential lapsing of enhanced tax credits for people buying health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.
