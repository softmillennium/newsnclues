                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Singapore is positioning itself as a global leader in tokenized finance, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announcing ambitious plans to trial tokenized government bills and introduce regulatory frameworks for stablecoins. This move comes as the city-state seeks to build a scalable and secure ecosystem for digital assets, blending traditional finance with blockchain technology. Speaking at a financial conference on November 13, 2025, MAS Managing Director Chia Der Jiun highlighted the progress and challenges in tokenization. According to a report by Reuters, Chia noted that ‘tokenization has lifted off the ground. The trials for tokenized MAS Bills are set to begin next year, settled using a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC). This initiative builds on Singapore's ongoing experiments with digital assets, aiming to enhance efficiency in financial markets. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies, have grown in popularity but face scrutiny over stability and misuse. MAS plans to introduce laws that will provide clarity and oversight, ensuring these digital assets can serve as reliable mediums of exchange without undermining financial stability. Tokenization involves representing real-world assets like bonds or bills on a blockchain, enabling faster settlements and reduced costs. The tokenized bills trial will test issuance and settlement processes, potentially revolutionizing how governments manage short-term debt instruments. Singapore has been at the forefront of fintech innovation, with projects like Project Orchid exploring CBDC use cases. The upcoming trials follow successful pilots with major banks, including a 2025 collaboration involving DBS Bank, as mentioned in recent updates from TradingView News. According to Cryptopolitan, the framework will impose requirements such as holding reserves in low-risk, highly liquid assets, echoing earlier MAS guidelines from 2023. This aims to prevent collapses like those seen in other markets, ensuring stablecoins maintain their peg and user trust. Users have highlighted Singapore's proactive stance, with one post noting the country's framework as a bridge between fiat and digital ecosystems, crediting sources like Ripple and Circle for input on regulations. However, these social media discussions underscore the need for caution, as they often mix optimism with unverified claims. For instance, the European Union's MiCA regulations have influenced stablecoin rules worldwide. In Singapore, the focus is on enabling stablecoins for cross-border payments while mitigating risks like money laundering. Chia Der Jiun remarked that the laws will foster a ‘credible digital medium of exchange,' as reported by BusinessWorld Online. The tokenized bills initiative could set a benchmark for other central banks. A The Block report notes that this moves beyond experimentation, integrating tokenization into core financial operations. Tokenized assets could attract more institutional investors, with firms like BlackRock already exploring similar technologies. In Singapore, this aligns with the nation's vision of becoming a digital asset hub, supported by licenses granted to companies like Ripple in 2024, as per X posts referencing government-backed media. Cybersecurity risks in tokenized systems are a concern, with MAS emphasizing secure protocols. Moreover, ensuring equitable access to these innovations is crucial, as smaller players might struggle with adoption costs. Singapore's economy, heavily reliant on finance and trade, stands to benefit. The city-state processes trillions in transactions annually, and tokenization could streamline operations. According to Bitcoin Ethereum News, the 2026 pilot expands on 2025 trials, potentially including cross-border elements with partners in Asia and Europe. By developing independent standards, MAS avoids over-reliance on any single system. Chia highlighted in his address that tokenization must achieve ‘escape velocity' through widespread use, not just pilots. Neighbors like India, with its own crypto frameworks as discussed in X posts about the COINS Act 2025, may observe Singapore's model. On X, discussions amplify the buzz, with users praising Singapore's clarity compared to U.S. uncertainties. Posts reference the Stablecoin Act 2025 in other contexts, drawing parallels to Singapore's framework.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum forms a textbook double top while 2.5M ETH bought near $3,150 and a $1.4B Aave whale defend key support. Now Ethereum sits between a textbook double top and one of its heaviest on-chain support zones. Ethereum shows a clear double-top formation on the daily chart, with two failed attempts near the same resistance zone. As the pattern completes, ETH has already pulled back toward the $3,100 zone, where traders watch for confirmation of further downside. A double top often signals a shift in trend when price breaks below the midpoint support, and Ethereum is now testing that zone. The formation also comes at a moment of broader market uncertainty, adding weight to its implications. If ETH fails to stabilize above current levels, the pattern suggests increased risk of continued selling pressure. At the same time, new on-chain metrics highlight a strong support zone forming near $3,150. Glassnode's cost-basis heatmap shows more than 2.5 million ETH acquired in this band, marking it as one of the cycle's densest accumulation clusters. The data reflects where a large share of holders entered the market, offering a clear gauge of sentiment as Ethereum pulls back from its recent highs. In addition, a major whale continues to build an aggressive leveraged long position on Aave. Arkham reported that the address now holds $1.42 billion in ETH, backed by roughly $467 million in borrowed stablecoins. These combined flows strengthen the argument that Ethereum has a defined base at current levels. Heavy accumulation near $3,150, visible on the heatmap, aligns with the whale's repeated purchases and signals concentrated demand. As ETH trades inside this cluster, analysts watch whether the support holds and whether leveraged positioning stabilizes after weeks of rapid additions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has descended further into a bear market. The digital token's price has seen a 22% drop from its peak in early October. Three primary factors have contributed to this sell-off. First, Bitcoin has been impacted by a wider sell-off in risk assets, especially tech stocks, as investors express concerns over high valuations. On Thursday, outflows from spot bitcoin ETFs reached $866.7 million, the highest since early August, according to CoinGlass data. Second, over the past month, Bitcoin's liquidity has dwindled, leading to heightened price volatility. The market depth of Bitcoin, a metric that gauges price resistance to volatility from large trades, fell from roughly $766 million in early October to $535.2 million this week, as stated by crypto analytics firm Kaiko.

However, Michael Saylor, Strategy's founder, refuted these rumors, asserting that the company was actually purchasing more Bitcoin. Despite Saylor's assurances, the market continues to be wary, as Strategy's net asset value premium dipped below 1x this week, suggesting that its premium over the value of its Bitcoin holdings has been temporarily wiped out. The fear of high valuations, coupled with decreased liquidity and market rumors, has led to an increased sell-off.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Friday then brought a modest rally for tech stocks, one that bitcoin didn't come close to matching. What's happening, according to a report this week from Wintermute's Jasper De Maere, is not a loss of correlation with the Nasdaq 100, which remains high at about 0.8. "This isn't a breakdown of correlation, but a reflection of asymmetry, the uneven way BTC responds to risk," said De Maere. When they sell off, BTC tends to move more sharply in the same direction." It will be no shock to anyone paying attention that skew has been solidly negative for some time. Attempting to put a number on it, Da Maere charted the percentage of days on a 365-day rolling basis in which BTC has seen positive performance skew versus the Nasdaq. Da Maere suggests a loss of mindshare for bitcoin as both institutional and retail speculative appetites have been quite satisfied in stocks. There are also liquidity issues as ETF inflows have slowed, stablecoin issuance has plateaued and market depth across exchanges still remains below early 2024 levels. "The current BTC/Nasdaq performance skew suggests that BTC investors are somewhat exhausted and have been for a while."

The SGD Testnet is a shared ledger infrastructure that allows banks and other financial institutions to settle tokenised assets in central bank money. Singapore is among a number of financial centres testing such designs as central banks consider how distributed ledger technology could be applied in funding markets and cross-border transactions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home - Crypto Presales - Monero (XMR) ICO Miss Still Hurts but LivLive ($LIVE) 200% Bonus Turns It Into the Next 100x Crypto to Buy How many people scroll past crypto charts, ignore early stages, and then act shocked when a tiny project becomes the talk of November 2025? So many missed their ticket to life changing gains because they waited for “proof” instead of opportunity. This time, LivLive ($LIVE) sits in that exact spotlight and carries the next 100x crypto to buy energy. LivLive ($LIVE) enters the scene with a strong presale start that signals real traction long before launch. Meanwhile, Monero (XMR) and the broader market keep showing how fast trend shifts hit when no one expects them. Both have strong news phases, but today's focus is on how LivLive ($LIVE) positions itself as the next 100x crypto to buy with real utility and a growing community. Many early crypto users doubted Monero (XMR) from the first day. It multiplied thousands of times, proving that hesitation can be the most expensive decision in a bull cycle. Those who dismissed it still talk about the lost chance. LivLive ($LIVE) positions itself as a lifestyle upgrade where daily actions convert into measurable value. It aims to reshape how people move, shop, attend events, and interact with cities through a reward system powered by blockchain and augmented reality. LivLive ($LIVE) builds a digital layer over the physical world so every action carries purpose, value, and progress that goes far beyond simple gameplay. Below is a structured breakdown of how LivLive ($LIVE) transforms real world activity into a long term ecosystem with benefits that early buyers care about. Each point highlights how the functions help people gain value and why the early crowd is already forming around it. • Daily actions turn into token rewards, XP, and collectable assets • AR missions prove physical presence so rewards stay fair • Wearables verify movement and unlock higher earning levels • Local businesses plug in to offer real perks like event tickets or merchandise • Leaderboards add motivation for competitive participants • Referral model gives both sides instant benefits LivLive ($LIVE) has also gained strong engagement from people who want an app that rewards activity instead of draining time. This concept gains traction fast in markets that seek utility beyond speculation. The presale performance shows why early buyers are calling it a breakout contender. More than 2.1M USD has been raised with 250 holders so far. This climb reflects rising interest in AR ecosystems and RWA backed reward layers. LivLive offers a reward burst that supercharges any entry size. People who act early get bonus allocations while others end up scrolling through chats where early buyers brag about scoring bigger positions. LivLive shakes the space with a heavy bonus system that multiplies entries instantly. It is a resource pack for early presale strength and it explains why so many are rushing before the next price jump. Missing these multipliers means paying full price later while others enjoy higher stacks from the same spend. LivLive brings real world rewards, AR missions, and strong presale traction into one ecosystem that stands out in November Q4 2025. The flash bonuses, referral rewards, and presale momentum position it as a strong candidate for the next 100x crypto to buy.

OKX Review 2025: Pros, Cons, Fees and Key Features Explained Gate.io Review 2025: Is it Safe and Legit for Crypto Trading? Coinbase Referral Code 2025: Steps to Earn $200 in BTC Welcome Bonus The crypto market is entering one of its most unpredictable phases in months. Ethereum is flashing sharp swings, SUI is clinging to a critical support line, and traders are scrambling to understand which project might lead the next breakout wave. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) enters this backdrop with a completely different approach. Instead of leaning on price charts or social buzz, it introduces income-generating hardware built to deliver measurable returns. In a market full of speculation, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) puts real work and real output at the center of the conversation. Zero Knowledge Proof introduces a model built on verifiable computational work rather than waiting for hype cycles. The project has already produced more than $17 million worth of hardware, all scheduled to ship five days after the presale launches. Its $249 Proof Pods arrive fully prepared to validate AI tasks and generate privacy proofs. These Pods appeal to people hunting for a leading bullish crypto with predictable income that does not require price speculation. All earnings are visible on-chain and tied directly to the daily Initial Coin Auction, which distributes 200 million Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) coins every twenty-four hours. This structure keeps all rewards aligned with real network demand. The Ethereum price recently plunged to around $3,098 before staging a notable rebound. Across a three-day period, major holders purchased more than 394,600 ETH, valued at over $1.37 billion. This buying spree reflects confidence well beyond the short-term turbulence visible on price charts. The “Fusaka” upgrade and more than $12 billion in real-world assets already deployed on Ethereum continue to build long-term excitement. Traders watching the Ethereum price today see a blend of high volatility and major future catalysts, a combination that keeps Ethereum firmly positioned among popular bullish crypto candidates. SUI is navigating a tense technical setup around the $2.00 support zone. A failure to hold the $2.00 support could send SUI toward $1.85, reflecting increased selling pressure. A rebound would require clearing $2.16 and $2.37, both of which represent key resistance levels for short-term recovery. Analysts point toward earlier models suggesting a path to $9.00 if SUI breaks above $3.60. Real-world adoption contributes to this potential, including Crypto.com's new institutional custody offering launched on November 11. This mix of volatility, technical pressure, and institutional interest keeps SUI firmly in the conversation for traders pursuing the next big bullish crypto. The market's current landscape shows three completely different forms of speculation unfolding at once. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) introduces hardware-based income tied to measurable computational output. These separate storylines reflect a broader transformation, where traders and long-term participants each chase different catalysts. For those searching for the next leading bullish crypto, the comparison highlights a diverse field of opportunities, each shaped by a different form of momentum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In crypto, “biggest” and “largest” are words thrown around daily. As its whitelist opens now, investors aren't buying into an idea; they're securing early access to a network being built from the ground up for real-world use. For those looking for substance over hype, ZKP might just be the top altcoin to buy now, not because it shouts the loudest, but because it's building where others only promise.. Every cycle, crypto investors see flashy websites, vague roadmaps, and empty promises. It meets every benchmark of a credible, mature blockchain project: Where most presales ask investors to fund development, ZKP flipped the model,  building first, selling later. This reversal of the norm is what gives it weight in a market flooded with vaporware. The $100 million ZKP spent pre-launch wasn't theoretical spending; it produced verifiable results across three key fronts: Every system that typically takes months post-launch to deploy is already built and entering its final readiness phase before the first public auction. This combination allows ZKP to process private computations faster than most existing networks, merging blockchain's transparency with AI's computational power,  a breakthrough that places it among the top altcoins to buy now for long-term value. Each 24-hour cycle releases 200 million ZKP tokens, distributed proportionally to contributions. Everyone, from retail participants to institutional investors, competes on equal footing. This model eliminates manipulation and ensures transparency that traditional presales simply can't match. Participants can use ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, and over 20 other payment methods to join a global access framework built for inclusion, not exclusivity. Each Pod will perform real computations, verify tasks, and generate zero-knowledge proofs. The network uses these devices to power privacy-preserving AI and decentralized compute operations worldwide. Participants can upgrade their Pods up to Level 300 via software boosts, scaling daily earning capacity with network demand. This synergy between token utility and compute performance makes ZKP's model economically circular,  where growth reinforces value. In blockchain, capital deployment before revenue signals commitment and confidence. It ensures reliability, compliance readiness, and resilience from day one. It's infrastructure-grade crypto, a foundation-level opportunity similar in scale to Ethereum's early architecture, but with the benefit of hindsight and proven tech. This is why institutional analysts are labeling it one of the top altcoins to buy now,  not as hype, but as an asset built for measurable adoption. In ZKP's case, it means scale, structure, and substance. With $100 million already deployed, $17 million in hardware ready to ship, and a fully built four-layer blockchain, this is infrastructure that exists,  not promises waiting for funding. The next era of blockchain begins with proof, not promises. Michelle is an editor at CoinCentral & Blockonomi, covering the latest trends in crypto, blockchain, and digital finance.

It is known for its creator tools, accessible gameplay and its vision of a connected world that links players, builders and communities. The platform has developed a strong global audience thanks to its user generated content model and plans to introduce deeper onchain features supported by HYBUX. HYTOPIA is introducing a new web3 interface that will allow players to stake HYBUX as well as multiple HYTOPIA NFT collections. Staking pools will distribute large allocations from the initial token supply. The final vesting schedule for these rewards has not yet been confirmed. Staking NFTs will allow holders to earn a share of these large pools, which positions them at the center of HYTOPIA's long term economic design. A dedicated node pool interface is also being introduced with an initial allocation of 500 million HYBUX. The marketplace is expected to launch in December and will allow creators to sell items and experiences for real currency. Fifteen percent of every primary sale and five percent of every secondary sale will flow directly into the NFT reward pool. This design allows long term collectors and creators to benefit from future marketplace activity. Beginning in January 2026, HYBUX will transition into an inflationary model. Staked tokens will earn an estimated annual yield of two point five percent in the first year. Stakers who pair HYBUX with HYTOPIA NFTs will be eligible for boosted yields that can reach up to ten percent. The combination of token staking, NFT staking, and marketplace rewards creates a multi layered reward structure that supports both players and creators. With these systems in place, HYTOPIA is entering a new era of onchain activity, economic depth and community involvement. We do not share any kind of investment advice.

This enables direct peer-to-peer transfers in central bank money, reducing costs by up to 50 per cent and eliminating reconciliation delays that typically take days in legacy systems like SWIFT. The bank has also noted in a recent policy paper that widespread accessibility is expected to expand financial services for unbanked or underbanked individuals—a critical factor for many remittance users who lack traditional bank accounts. Exchange houses have long played a central role in the remittance ecosystem, and the system is expected to evolve into a hybrid, wallet-based access model, which is often easier for individuals without conventional banking relationships. By lowering barriers and expanding access, the Digital Dirham is likely to promote financial inclusion and ensure more equitable distribution of the benefits of digitalisation. A notable design feature is that non-residents will also have access, which is essential for enabling cross-border transfers by people who do not permanently reside in the UAE. For the Digital Dirham to become a primary remittance channel, it must overcome familiar pain points in traditional remittance systems, such as high costs and slow settlement. Many observers expect it to simplify cross-border payments by reducing fees and enabling instant settlement in central bank money. Instant settlement and broad accessibility are central goals of the CBDC. As early as July 2023, the two countries signed MoUs to enable trade settlement in their national currencies and to link their payment and messaging systems. It called for proof-of-concept work on a bilateral CBDC bridge with India.

Bitcoin profits are declining while altcoin profits stabilize during a deep capitulation phase, creating an unusual divergence between the two market segments, according to Glassnode.

The current market environment reflects continued pressure across crypto assets, with both Bitcoin and altcoins showing signs of capitulation rather than growth. However, the stabilization in altcoin profits contrasts with Bitcoin's ongoing decline.

Social media discussions highlight that most altcoins are underperforming, with only a small portion generating profits for investors. This underperformance has contributed to the stagnation in altcoin profits relative to Bitcoin's recent trajectory.

The divergence marks a shift from typical market patterns where Bitcoin and altcoins often move in similar directions during major market phases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Born out of the desire for financial freedom and decentralization, cryptocurrency went from being a mysterious and obscure concept in the deep web to a powerful force that influenced global politics, even reaching the highest echelons of government—The White House. The story of cryptocurrency begins in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, a time of economic collapse, widespread disillusionment with central banking systems, and a desire for alternative solutions. At the heart of Nakamoto's vision was the idea that money could exist outside of government control, free from the inflationary pressures of fiat currencies, and completely anonymous. This idea struck a chord with many, particularly libertarians, technologists, and those frustrated by the corruption and inefficiencies of traditional financial systems. However, the true impact of this idea would not be fully realized for many years. The most infamous of these was Silk Road, a black market for illicit goods, where Bitcoin became the preferred payment method. In this realm, Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature made it ideal for untraceable transactions. But as time went on, cryptocurrency began to attract attention from outside these dark corners of the internet. Bitcoin's value started to rise, and its potential as a legitimate alternative currency was recognized by a growing number of investors, entrepreneurs, and developers. However, despite its growing popularity, cryptocurrencies remained highly controversial. Many viewed them with suspicion, associating them with criminal activities in the deep web and dark web. Ethereum expanded the possibilities of blockchain technology, moving beyond simple transactions to more complex applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (dApps). As the technology evolved, major financial institutions, tech giants, and even governments started to take notice. Cryptocurrency and the White House: A New Era of Digital Diplomacy While cryptocurrency began as a financial tool for individuals and businesses on the margins, its growing influence soon captured the attention of powerful political institutions. In 2021, the cryptocurrency landscape had evolved to the point where it could no longer be ignored by major governments. Countries like El Salvador had embraced Bitcoin as legal tender, and China had launched its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies gained in legitimacy, the White House took an interest in how these digital currencies could impact the global economy, financial systems, and the future of U.S. monetary policy. The rise of decentralized finance, the integration of blockchain technology into traditional sectors like banking, and the growing influence of cryptocurrency on global trade and investment meant that cryptocurrency was no longer just a fringe movement—it was becoming a central issue in global finance and governance. In 2021, the White House began hosting roundtable discussions and meetings on cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and the regulatory challenges posed by decentralized finance. Biden's administration invited a wide range of experts to participate, including cryptocurrency developers, bankers, financial regulators, and even representatives from the crypto industry itself. No longer was cryptocurrency viewed solely as a tool of criminals or anarchists. The U.S. Treasury Department began to explore ways in which cryptocurrencies could be taxed and monitored to prevent illegal activities, while the Federal Reserve began to evaluate the possibility of creating a digital dollar, which would operate alongside cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency's Impact on Global Governance: A New Form of Diplomacy As the U.S. government began to seriously engage with cryptocurrency, it also recognized that this new financial system could be used as a tool for global diplomacy. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology offered a way for nations to transact across borders without relying on traditional financial institutions. This could potentially reduce the influence of global powers like the IMF or World Bank, creating a more decentralized financial system. In some countries, blockchain technology was being explored as a way to secure elections and track the flow of foreign aid. The potential for cryptocurrencies to be used for money laundering, fraud, or tax evasion was a major concern, and policymakers were determined to create frameworks that would address these risks while still allowing for innovation. Today, cryptocurrency is no longer confined to the dark web or seen as a tool for criminal activity. In the wake of the 2020-2021 crypto boom, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others have gained legitimacy and have been adopted by major institutions, including governments, tech companies, and investment firms. The White House, too, has embraced this new reality. Cryptocurrency is now discussed not only in terms of financial policy but also in relation to national security, international diplomacy, and economic sovereignty. It has moved from a tool of anonymity and rebellion to a catalyst for political and financial change, impacting everything from global governance to the policies of the White House. As cryptocurrency continues to evolve, its story will undoubtedly shape the future of money and governance in ways that we can only begin to imagine. However, as we turn our gaze towards the present and future, it becomes essential to explore in greater depth how history's lessons can be applied to the complexities of the modern world. By Zain Ul Abedin Khanabout 7 hours ago in History When it comes to packaging, printing, or even custom gift wrapping, the GSM (Grams per Square Meter) of paper or card stock plays a crucial role in determining quality, strength, and appearance. Many people get confused when choosing between 200 GSM and 300 GSM, especially for items like boxes, cards, or bottles. In this guide, we'll break down the differences, help you understand which is better for your purpose, and explain how GSM affects overall presentation and durability. It was safe, predictable, and endlessly walked upon — the kind of path where even the stones seemed to recognize you. In many western countries the promotion of cultural acceptance has become intertwined with the strong encouragement of groups and communities to maintain and cultivate their differences. Terminology such as the “Cultural Mosaic” in Canada, celebrates this mentality.</p>

LivLive ($LIVE) is catching attention because its first presale numbers already look strong. At the same time, Cardano (ADA) and other major coins keep shaping the overall market tone through their price movements and news updates. The mix of old giants and new fire shows how the market keeps opening new chances for people who want something fresh. That is why the best crypto to buy now appears again during strong shifts. Cardano (ADA) had one of the most doubted early runs in crypto history. Its ICO price sat near fractions of a dollar, and many said it would never rise. Then it climbed thousands of percent and created life changing returns for early buyers. ADA crushed all early doubts and proved how wrong crowds can be when they ignore new tech. But crypto keeps giving new entries to those who missed old ones. Every cycle brings coins that start tiny and then rewrite their whole story. It is a real world operating system that turns everyday actions into rewards. Walking, checking in, reviewing places, attending events, or visiting shops all create XP and $LIVE tokens. It upgrades real life into a reward system where daily steps start to matter. These numbers matter because the rising price steps reward early movers with bigger positions. Growth in raised capital signals strong belief from the community. More holders in the first stages show real demand before listings even start. • Global AR Game LayerTurns real cities into a reward map where movement and check ins earn $LIVE. • Pokémon GO Style MissionsReal world quests that unlock tokens, XP, and nonstop activity. • 2.5M Dollar Treasure VaultToken packs open vault chambers, including the 1M ICON reward. • AI Personalized MissionsAdaptive quests that change based on behavior to boost long term engagement. It is the classic story where early movers walk away smiling while latecomers talk about missed chances. Those who delay usually end up paying the full rate while early adopters enjoy bigger stacks.

The latest 13F filing shows Harvard increased its stake from 1.9 million shares reported in June, while simultaneously growing its gold ETF holdings by 99% to 661,391 shares worth $235 million. Harvard's substantial Bitcoin allocation stands in contrast to earlier predictions from its own economics faculty. Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, stated in 2018 that Bitcoin would more likely trade at $100 than $100,000 within a decade. “I think bitcoin will be worth a tiny fraction of what it is now if we're headed out 10 years from now,” Rogoff told CNBC, adding that removing money laundering and tax evasion would leave Bitcoin with “very small” transaction uses. Balchunas referenced Rogoff's earlier skepticism, noting it “must feel so great” for Bitcoin advocates to see Harvard's institutional validation. However, Bitwise analyst Ryan Rasmussen predicts that this allocation will grow to 1% and eventually 5% as peer institutions follow suit. Harvard joins a widening cohort of institutional investors increasing cryptocurrency exposure through regulated investment vehicles. Meanwhile, Emory University disclosed a $15 million stake in the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust in 2024, becoming one of the first major US endowments to reveal crypto ETF exposure. Beyond traditional universities, the University of Austin launched a dedicated $5 million Bitcoin fund within its $200 million endowment in February, becoming the first US university endowment to establish a Bitcoin-focused investment. At that time, Pantera Capital reported an eight-fold increase in endowment and foundation clients since 2018, while Yale University invested in crypto venture funds during Bitcoin's earlier price levels. Brian Neale of the University of Nebraska Foundation told the Financial Times he does not consider cryptocurrency an “institutionally investable” asset class due to limited adoption among traditional allocators.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Barcelona announced on Friday a new sponsorship agreement with blockchain company ZKP, or Zero Knowledge Proof. Most of Barcelona's sponsors are global brands with significant history and a track record of putting up big numbers. However ZKP was only formed in 2022, and only became a public company in 2025, as per their own website. They will launch their blockchain on the 27th of November in less than two weeks, and have just two official partners; Barcelona and NRL-side The Dolphins. Interestingly, ‘Zero Knowledge Proof' is a theory based on convincing people of a statement based on other information than conveying that the statement is true. More surprising still, is that ZKP have chosen to platform a tweet from Andrew Tate, which is their pinned tweet on their profile. They say that Tate's view on AI and blockchain is ‘the future'. Tate is currently awaiting trial in Romania for charges of human trafficking, child trafficking, rape and sex with a minor. In the United Kingdom, he also has 21 charges against him for rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking. Given Barcelona is a club that publicly epouses the values of equality and feminism, it is surprising that they would be in league with a company that supports a figure such as Tate, given his criminal and abhorrent media history, arguing for the subjugation of women.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have come a long way since 2018. Yet six years later, the fundraising model that defined crypto's wildest boom is quietly resurfacing. New launches like Yield Basis and Monad are pulling investors back in, hinting at a revival few saw coming.

Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit When blockchains were still a novel concept and the crypto community was in its infancy, there were relatively few projects seeking to raise money. However, once the new technology garnered more mainstream attention, blockchain development began to snowball, as did the fundraising activity required to sustain it. At a time when few institutions were interested in crypto, most of the funding came from retail investors. In turn, this prompted regulatory scrutiny and the ensuing crackdown suppressed what little ICO momentum remained. From 2018 onward, new crypto projects increasingly turned to venture capital funding in place of public sales. Rather than selling coins to retail investors, platforms like Solana (SOL) favored private deals with a select group of institutions. In 2019, Binance Launchpool reimagined the way issuers connect with retail investors. Following Binance, OKX, Bybit, and KuCoin sought to emulate the centralized launchpad model. But faced with regulatory uncertainty, U.S. exchanges initially chose not to get involved. Developed by Curve founder Michael Egorov, Yield Basis borrows key elements from the decentralized stablecoin exchange to generate a yield of WBTC and ETH deposits. In an interview with CCN, Egorov explained how Curve's algorithmic foundation inspired the new platform. Starting with this idea, Egorov set about building a new platform, “and on the way, I improved a little bit on Curve tokenomics, and arrived at what Yield Basis is currently,” he recalled. However, starting on Nov. 17, Coinbase plans to host a new token sale each month, with a focus on strictly vetted projects and regulatory compliance. retail traders can now widely participate in public token sales for the first time since 2018.” For its ICO debut, the American exchange selected Monad—a high-performance Layer 1 (L1) blockchain promising parallel execution and EVM compatibility. With its mainnet launch scheduled for Nov. 24, Monad is among a new generation of blockchains reinvigorating L1 development. The other major L1 ICO of 2025 is  Nexchain, whcih has almost concluded a $50 million sale that started in March.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Bitcoin's price plunges below $97,000, the crypto market is in flux, offering both challenges and opportunities. How do altcoins and stablecoins provide stability for DAOs amidst this chaos? The selloff is raising eyebrows, particularly among institutional investors and traders, with technical indicators suggesting a bearish outlook. This situation has many in the market on edge, wondering what comes next. Stablecoins like USDC and Tether (USDT) are pegged to reserve assets, usually the US Dollar. This structure aims to eradicate the volatility that typically plagues Bitcoin's price, allowing DAOs to make transactions, manage treasuries, and execute smart contracts without worrying about wild price swings. This is invaluable for DAOs that prioritize decentralization and want to avoid reliance on traditional banking systems. Altcoins like Ethereum come with the added benefit of programmable smart contracts. Unlike Bitcoin's limited scripting capability, Ethereum and its counterparts provide the rich functionality that DAOs require to navigate through this volatile environment effectively. The recent price movements carry significant regulatory implications, particularly for European SMEs. The decline has prompted businesses to prefer regulated crypto banking solutions over direct Bitcoin investments. This is a strategic pivot, as companies seek more stable financial frameworks in an evolving regulatory landscape. Even though initial regulatory scrutiny slows down adoption, unified regulations can create a safer space that fosters innovation. European SMEs are now grappling with fragmented regulations, and the lack of clear guidelines complicates compliance efforts. The regulatory framework is changing, potentially easing compliance burdens for SMEs. The repeal of outdated accounting standards has eliminated barriers for regulated custodians, allowing them to develop digital asset custody solutions at scale. Stablecoin legislation could also streamline regulations, making it easier for companies to navigate compliance. Fintech startups in Asia have a unique opportunity to enhance their crypto payroll solutions amidst this volatility. This way, they maintain value stability while still utilizing blockchain efficiency. Platforms like Stellar allow for automated payroll disbursements, offering low fees and compliance-ready infrastructure. The ongoing volatility in Asia creates opportunities for trading and liquidity. Investors are enhancing risk controls by increasing due diligence, employing AI-driven market monitoring tools, and using derivatives such as put options to hedge against risks. Instead of focusing solely on Bitcoin, investors are diversifying their portfolios. All of these developments could build institutional confidence, even in a bearish market. In a world where Bitcoin's price is anything but stable, the role of altcoins and stablecoins seems more vital than ever. For DAOs and businesses alike, these alternatives provide a path through the storm. Innovative strategies are essential for surviving and thriving in today's volatile market. It's an arduous journey, but one that can lead to long-term success in the crypto space. OneSafe brings together your crypto and banking needs in one simple, powerful platform. Stablecoins are revolutionizing crypto payroll by providing stability and efficiency, addressing volatility challenges for decentralized organizations. BullZilla presale opens new avenues for crypto investment with innovative strategies, promising high ROI, and a vibrant community.</p>

To own Franklin Resources, an investor must believe in the company's ability to adapt to fee pressure and capture growth from global and digital innovation, particularly as it invests in blockchain-enabled solutions. The recent Benji-Canton blockchain move showcases technology leadership, but on its own, is unlikely to materially offset persistent industry-wide fee compression in the short term, which remains the biggest near-term risk. Among Franklin's recent developments, the new low-fee pricing on its Core Equity Funds in Canada stands out for its immediate relevance, as it responds directly to competitive pressures and addresses a key catalyst, broadening investor access to modern portfolio building blocks as the firm navigates pricing headwinds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto-market roller coaster is showing no signs of slowing down. With Bitcoin under severe pressure and altcoins flashing mixed signals, the Solana SOLUSDT price enters the weekend at a critical inflection point. The token's resilience has surprised many traders, but its latest tightening structure suggests a decisive move may be approaching. While some analysts expect a rebound toward $170, others warn that the current range may be masking deeper weakness. Will Solana defend its key support and stage a late-week recovery, or is the market preparing for another downward swing? Solana SOLUSDT is trading near $141.50, maintaining its footing above the crucial $130–$135 support band that has shaped market structure for several weeks. Earlier dips toward $136 were quickly absorbed, demonstrating that buyers are active at lower levels even as broader sentiment remains shaky. Resistance continues to build near $155–$160, where momentum stalls repeatedly. With price increasingly compressing between these two zones, the next breakout or breakdown is likely to dictate SOL's trend direction in the coming sessions. Solana has slipped to the lower boundary of its multi-month ascending channel, a zone that has acted as a strong accumulation region since early 2023. The weekly candle shows SOL tapping this trendline near $140–$145, signalling that buyers are once again attempting to defend the broader uptrend. The narrowing space between channel support and cloud resistance signals an approaching trend resolution—and whichever side breaks first is likely to define Solana's direction into early December. The weekend will likely bring heightened volatility, especially if Bitcoin continues to struggle near its lower range. For Solana, the immediate focus lies on two critical questions: But if support gives way, traders should brace for deeper retracements before any meaningful recovery attempt. As per our Solana price prediction 2030, with a potential surge, the price of SOL could reach a maximum of $1,351. Solana stock, with its strengths in fundamentals, still holds significant prominence. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.
