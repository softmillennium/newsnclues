                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 30-year-old Briton announced his retirement in August after a series of physical issues that included one surgery a year in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Although his retirement decision is just three months old, Edmund already feels happy to focus on his experiences as an elite performer on the world stage. “You definitely look back with more positivity [with time],” he told ATPTour.com in Turin, where he and seven other recently retired ATP Tour stars were honoured in a special ceremony on Friday night at the Nitto ATP Finals. “For me, when I was ending [my career], it was a bit of a negative because something is coming to an end that you are so passionate about and so invested in. But you can look back and enjoy those things.” You May Also Like: Schwartzman, Edmund, Ramos-Vinolas among retired players honoured at Nitto ATP Finals Edmund turned pro in 2012, the year that Andy Murray ended Great Britain's 76-year wait for a men's singles major champion at the US Open. Renowned for his huge forehand, which combined raw power with vicious whipped topspin, Edmund went on to win two ATP 250 titles — in Antwerp in 2018 and New York in 2020 — while his standout moment at the majors came at the 2018 Australian Open. “In terms of achievements, definitely Davis Cup,” said Edmund, when asked what he considers to be his career highlights. “Also my first Tour title, at the end I was very emotional, because that was a goal I had, to win a Tour event. Those are the ones that stick out for me. “Then there are little ones like playing at Wimbledon as a British kid, playing for my country, and obviously the Olympics as well. So it's been nice to reflect in that way.” Edmund in action against Gael Monfils en route to the 2018 Antwerp title. “There was no specific thing, but definitely various things that just sort of added up,” explained Edmund, when asked about the main reason for retiring when he did. That's what I felt I was doing a lot with my injury and obviously physically there is a toll on your body with all the surgeries. I was coming back in terms of I'd been playing for a period of time, but every now and again I would get something else that came up that would just stop me for two or three months.” Edmund celebrates after defeating Grigor Dimitrov in the 2018 Australian Open quarter-finals. Deciding to retire is a difficult moment in any athlete's career, no matter their achievements or status, but Edmund is ready to use his experiences on the tennis circuit to inform the chapter of his life. “You do realise and learn that it is a privilege to be a professional athlete at the highest level, when you don't have it,” said Edmund, who has enjoyed some time off and is now considering his next moves, with a preference to stay working in sport. You've got to earn your way there, but when you are on the Tour playing these types of events, it is very rewarding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defending champion Jannik Sinner powered to the Nitto ATP Finals championship match for the third consecutive year on Saturday, when he dispatched Alex de Minaur 7-5, 6-2 to maintain his perfect record against the Australian. Sinner did not drop a set or his serve throughout the round-robin stage and once again dominated in front of his vocal home support in Turin. “First of all, I am very happy,” Sinner said. I felt like he was serving great, very precise. In the second set, I broke very early and then my level rose. "I tried to be a bit more aggressive and it worked well but it was a tough match. But making the final for three consecutive years means a lot to me. It is a great atmosphere for me to play tennis and a great place for me to close this beautiful season. Sinner has won his past 30 indoor matches, with his last defeat coming against Novak Djokovic in the championship match in northern Italy two years ago. He has since captured indoor titles in Rotterdam, Turin, Vienna and Paris, while he helped guide Italy to Davis Cup glory on two occasions. The second seed will aim to add to his growing trophy cabinet when he meets Carlos Alcaraz or Felix Auger-Aliassime in the title match on Sunday. Inside a packed Inalpi Arena, De Minaur briefly silenced the 13,000-strong home crowd when he surged to 0/40 in Sinner's opening service game. But when he failed to convert, the Italian steadied and never looked back. De Minaur dug deep, covering every inch of the court and fending off seven break points to keep pace. But at 5-5, Sinner finally pierced his opponent's defence, ripping a backhand winner down the line to break. The Italian, who won 59 cent of points on De Minaur's second serve in the set, closed out on serve to lead. The Italian, who struck 32 winners and made 75 per cent of his first serves in the match, timed the ball cleanly and was locked in a comfortable rhythm to triumph after one hour and 52 minutes. For De Minaur, the defeat bookends an otherwise standout year. De Minaur's lone title of 2025 came at the ATP 500 event in Washington. Sinner joins Djokovic in 2018 as the only men to reach the championship match at the Nitto ATP Finals without dropping serve since ATP Tour began recording serve statistics in 1991. The Italian has held all 40 of his service games this week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One year on from suffering a semi-final exit on debut at the prestigious season finale, Heliovaara and Patten this time marched to a 6-4, 6-3 last-four victory against Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori. The Finnish-British duo produced a stunning all-around display to overwhelm their Italian opponents and nullify the partisan atmosphere inside Inalpi Arena. Finals bound 🕺🕺Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten power into the championship match in Turin, defeating Bolelli/Vavassori 6-4 6-3!#NittoATPFinals pic.twitter.com/PcIQxxiNTk “I think we really enjoyed being out on court. He and Heliovaara will on Sunday take on an all-British duo in the championship match: Top seeds and Year-End ATP Doubles No. Patten, who started the week in Turin by getting engaged to his partner Ellie Stone, served a double fault at 3-2, 40/30 to gift Bolelli and Vavassori a chance to break at Deuce deciding point, but he followed that with a nerveless lefty serve out wide to clinch the game. You May Also Like: Patten gets engaged in Turin! 'I was much more nervous about getting engaged than my first match' That proved to be the final moment of peril for Heliovaara and Patten on serve, and the pair soon closed out for a 76-minute victory in which they finished the match having won 87 per cent (20/23) of points behind first serves, according to Infosys ATP Stats. They now hold a 3-1 Lexus ATP Head2Head series lead over Bolelli and Vavassori, having also prevailed in the two teams' Australian Open semi-final clash earlier this year. There's no secret really,” said Patten, when asked about he and Heliovaara's returning performance. The 36-year-old Heliovaara and 29-year-old Patten will on Sunday play for their eighth tour-level title as a team, and their second indoor title of the year after they lifted the Rolex Paris Masters title earlier this month.
