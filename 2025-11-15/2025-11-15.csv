            Iran confirmed on Saturday that its Revolutionary Guards had seized a tanker in Gulf waters carrying a cargo of petrochemicals bound for Singapore over alleged violations, Iranian state media reported.
    


            A US official and maritime security sources had said on Friday that Iranian forces intercepted the oil products tanker and diverted it into Iranian territorial waters. It was the first report of Tehran seizing a tanker since Israeli-US strikes on Iran in June.
    


            Iranian state-run television read a statement from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) stating that “the tanker was in violation for carrying unauthorized cargo.” It did not provide further details of the alleged violations.
    


            The Marshall Islands-flagged tanker, the Talara, had been sailing off the United Arab Emirates' coast, maritime sources said, and was carrying a cargo of high-sulfur gasoil through the Indian Ocean en route to Singapore from Sharjah in the UAE.
    


            The vessel's manager Columbia Shipmanagement said it lost contact with the Talara Friday morning around 20 nautical miles off the coast of Khor Fakkan, UAE. It added that it was working closely with relevant parties, including maritime security agencies and the vessel's owner, to restore contact.
    


            The ship is owned by Cyprus-based Pasha Finance.
    


            In a statement, the US military said it was aware of the incident and was actively monitoring the situation.
    


            Iran's IRGC has periodically seized commercial vessels in Gulf waters in recent years, often citing maritime violations such as alleged smuggling, technical infractions or legal disputes.
    


            However, the US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the incident was surprising since Iran had not carried out any such operations in recent months.
    


            Iran has curbed its military activities in the region since the 12-day Israeli bombing campaign in June, which was joined by the United States. Its last reported seizure of a vessel was in April 2024.

            Doaa Musallem's high school grades were so good that she got a congratulatory call from the Palestinian Minister of Education.
    


            But for the 18-year-old, the celebration was bittersweet.
    


            Like some 56,000 other students from Gaza's class of 2025, the last two years of her education have been nearly completely disrupted by Israel's war in Gaza, which has killed almost 19,000 school age children, made orphans out of thousands of others, and all but decimated the enclave's formal education system.
    


            “Our happiness is incomplete because our supporter and the pillar of the house is not here,” she told CNN, speaking of her father, who was absent from the celebrations.
    


            Doaa's father Bassam Musallam was critically wounded by shrapnel in November 2023, when an Israeli strike hit a neighboring house and killed his friend in central Gaza, the family told CNN.
    


            Musallam was evacuated to Egypt for medical treatment in April 2024 and has been there since, missing many milestones in his daughter's life, including her exam results, which have gone viral.
    


            When she sent her father a photo of the celebrations, standing proudly next to her brother in her graduation gown and cap in front of a bright yellow balloon sign that read: “Congratulations,” she felt like the entire enclave was celebrating with her.
    


            “You are a hero,” Palestinian Minister of Education Amjad Barham told Doaa over the phone as he called to congratulate her on graduating high school and earning the highest grade of any student in Gaza, at 99.7%.
    


            Doaa's joyful scene was emulated throughout Gaza Thursday, in bright moments that have been rare over the past two years. As the education ministry announced the grades for tens of thousands of high school students like Doaa, there was a buzz in the air as Palestinians set off fireworks and embraced in song and dance.
    


            Mahmoud Elyan, a recent graduate who was displaced from the southern city of Rafah to central Gaza, stood at a crowded dessert shop in his hometown with a grin on his face.
    


            “I am happy beyond words,” he told Palestinian state TV. “I am here to buy desserts and hand them out to people because it's been a long time that people haven't seen desserts after two years of war and displacement.”
    


            For others, graduation day is a reminder of that suffering.
    


            Student Doha Nazmi Abu Dalal, who had been displaced in Deir el Balah, central Gaza, achieved a near perfect GPA. But she was killed less than a month before she could see how her hard work had paid off. Abu Dalal, along with 17 members of her family, was killed in an Israeli strike on October 29, weeks after the ceasefire was implemented, according to hospital authorities.
    


            Israel's bombardment of Gaza since October 7, 2023, has decimated the education system in Gaza, leaving it on the brink of collapse, according to UNICEF, and prompting accusations from UN experts of a scholasticide, or the systematic destruction of a country's education.
    


            Israel has repeatedly said Hamas uses schools and universities as part of its infrastructure to store weapons or as command centers. It has not addressed the scholasticide accusation directly.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) previously told CNN it seeks to minimize civilian harm while Hamas “cynically exploits civilian infrastructure for terror purposes.”
    


            Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed over 97% of schools in Gaza, according to UNICEF, leaving hundreds of thousands of children with limited access to in-person learning.
    


            At least 18,591 school age students have been killed and 27,216 injured over the course of the war, according to the Palestinian education ministry figures. In addition, some 792 educational staff have been killed and 3,251 injured.
    


            Al-Hassan Ali Radwan is one of the Palestinian students who experienced the loss of one of his loved ones when his cousin and study buddy was killed during the war. Like his classmates, Al-Hassan had to navigate the challenges of online education amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.
    


            “We had a hard time with internet connection, the lack of electricity and water as well as displacement and most importantly food,” Al-Hassan told WAFA, the Palestinian state news agency, at a shelter for the displaced in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza on Thursday, where he and his friends had gathered to celebrate his graduation.
    


            In central Gaza, another graduate, Dima, who only gave her first name to state media, was celebrating with her family after overcoming trauma attached to her studies.
    


            She said she suffered minor injuries from an Israeli strike that happened during her first private math lesson – at a sporting club – after the war had started.
    


            “I stopped studying for some time because I was scared,” she said. “But I eventually had to keep going because we only get to be highschoolers once in a lifetime.”
    


            Gaza's 56,000 new graduates are ready for college, according to the education ministry. But there are hardly any campuses to attend.
    


            Israeli attacks have completely destroyed 63 university buildings over the past two years, according to the ministry.
    


            And resources are scarce.  Educational supplies, like stationery, backpacks, and other resources, have been  “impossible” to bring into the enclave, despite the implementation of the October 10 ceasefire, because they are not deemed as “lifesaving humanitarian aid,” UNICEF said.
    


            Still, some students and parents are riding the high of Thursday's graduations, and are hopeful that Gaza's schools and universities will soon be rebuilt.
    


            Nearly 92% of all education facilities will require either full reconstruction or major rehabilitation to become functional again, according to a recent  UNICEF statement.
    


            “Despite the pain and ache in Gaza, we want to be happy and get over our wounds,” Dima's father said. “Students need to be back in classrooms as soon as possible.”

            Meanwhile, others are calling for mechanisms to help pursue college scholarships and study abroad, rather than going back online to study.
    


            “This is not life, they (Israel) destroyed our schools and universities,” recent graduate Mohamed Bilal Abu Faraj told Palestinian state media on Thursday after handing out desserts at a shelter.
    


            “Open up the border,” he added, nodding to the continued siege on Gaza.
    


            For Doaa, her father's injury has fueled her interest in pursuing a higher education in nursing.
    


            She too, hopes to continue her education abroad, where she yearns to reunite with her father once again.

NEW YORK, November 15. /TASS/. The United States successfully tested a B61-12 tactical thermonuclear bomb without a warhead in August, according to a statement from the US Department of Energy's Sandia National Laboratories.

The tests were conducted at a test site in Nevada from August 19 to 21, the statement said. During the tests, American fifth-generation F-35 fighter jets delivered and dropped the weapons with inert warheads. The tests were conducted in coordination with the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).

Seemingly identical signatures appeared on clemency orders, which White House blamed on technical error

The Trump administration's clemency drive is coming under scrutiny after the justice department this week replaced pardons posted online that bore strikingly similar copies of Trump's signature with others that are distinctively variable.

The corrections came after online commenters seized on the similarities in the president's signature granting “full and unconditional” pardons to seven men, including to former New York Mets player Darryl Strawberry, former Tennessee House speaker Glen Casada and former New York police sergeant Michael McMahon, on 7 November.

Administration officials have blamed “technical” errors and staffing issues for the apparent oversight and insisted to the Associated Press that Trump had originally signed all the pardons himself.

Chad Gilmartin, a justice department spokesperson, said the “website was updated after a technical error where one of the signatures President Trump personally signed was mistakenly uploaded multiple times due to staffing issues caused by the Democrat shutdown”.

“There is no story here other than the fact that President Trump signed seven pardons by hand and [the Department of Justice] posted those same seven pardons with seven unique signatures to our website,” Gilmartin said in a statement to the Associated Press, referring to the latest wave of clemency Trump has granted in recent weeks.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an email that Trump “signed each one of these pardons by hand as he does with all pardons”.

“The media should spend their time investigating Joe Biden's countless autopenned pardons, not covering a non-story,” she wrote.

The errors come after a sustained administration campaign to undermine the validity of pardons issued by Trump's predecessor Joe Biden that were in many cases signed by autopen. Trump has claimed that Biden was not aware of the signatures on orders and pardons bearing his name.

Trump, who typically makes an elaborate show of signing executive orders with a Sharpie at afternoon press calls, has gone so far as to replace Biden's portrait in a new “Presidential Walk of Fame” he created along the West Wing colonnade with a picture of an autopen.

Asked last week if he had considered replacing that image with a portrait, Trump responded: “No, I don't think so.”

Questions about Trump's signature come amid a new flurry of clemency orders. Last month, Trump issued a pardon to Changpeng Zhao, later telling CBS News that he had “no idea who he is” but had been told that crypto-currency businessman was a victim of a “witch-hunt” by the Biden administration.

Zhao, who is also known as “CZ”, pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering in 2023. He served four months in prison and agreed to step down as the chief executive of Binance, the crypto exchange he co-founded.

“A basic axiom of handwriting identification science is that no two signatures are going to bear the exact same design features in every aspect,” Thomas Vastrick, a Florida-based handwriting expert and president of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners, told the AP.

“It's very straightforward,” Vastrick added.

Legal experts say the use of an autopen has no bearing on the validity of the pardons.

“The key to pardon validity is whether the president intended to grant the pardon,” said Frank Bowman, a legal historian and professor emeritus at the University of Missouri School of Law who is writing a book on pardons. “Any re-signing is an obvious, and rather silly, effort to avoid comparison to Biden.”

The pardons issued by Trump earlier this month include Casada, a disgraced former Republican speaker of the Tennessee house who was sentenced in September to three years in prison after being convicted of working with a former legislative aide to win taxpayer-funded mail business from state lawmakers who previously drove Casada from office amid a sexting scandal.

Strawberry was convicted in the 1990s of tax evasion and drug charges. McMahon was sentenced to 18 months in prison earlier this year for his role in what a federal judge called “a campaign of transnational repression”.

The justice department's replacement of Trump's signature on the pardon documents is unlikely to stall Republican's autopen trolling of Biden.

Last month, Republicans in Congress released a sharp critique of Biden's alleged “diminished faculties” and mental state during his term that ranked the Democrat's use of the autopen among “the greatest scandals in US history”.

The Republicans said their findings cast doubt on all of Biden's actions in office and sent a letter to the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, urging a full investigation.

“Senior White House officials did not know who operated the autopen and its use was not sufficiently controlled or documented to prevent abuse,” the House oversight committee found. “The committee deems void all executive actions signed by the autopen without proper, corresponding, contemporaneous, written approval traceable to the president's own consent.”

On Friday, Republicans who control the committee released a statement that characterized Trump's potential use of an electronic signature as legitimate, which it distinguished from Biden's.

Dave Min, a California Democrat on the House oversight committee, seized on the apparent similarities in the initial version of the pardons and called for an investigation of the matter, deploying the Republican arguments against Biden in a statement to AP that “we need to better understand who is actually in charge of the White House, because Trump seems to be slipping”.

Ex-FTC chair was among first to go after practice of folding local firms into larger ones leading to higher prices

Experts say New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's selection of Lina Khan, the former Federal Trade Commission chair, for his transition team acts as a warning to private equity firms in the state that have raised rents and monopolized local healthcare industries.

Throughout the US, private equity has increasingly monopolized industries through the practice of “roll ups,” acquiring many small local firms and rolling them into one larger firm, giving them power to simultaneously raise prices and lower quality.

This practice is especially problematic in healthcare industries, where private equity involvement has been linked to worse health outcomes, including death.

Serving as FTC chair under Biden, Khan was among the first to aggressively go after this practice on the national level, said Martin Kenney, distinguished professor at the department of human ecology at the University of California, Davis and author of  Private Equity and the Demise of the Local.

While Khan might have comparatively less power on a transition team for a city government, where she will provide advice on how to run a municipal cabinet, Kenney said her appointment is “a signal”– of warning to New York private equity firms and, more positively, that younger Democrats like Mamdani are taking a new approach.

“Kamala Harris should have campaigned on some sort of populism,” Kenney said, noting Harris's message should have been: “We're going to break up the monopolies, you know, we're going to go after Wall Street. There's a lot of Americans out there who hate Wall Street, you know.”

Now, Khan will be in Wall Street's backyard.

A more populist campaign would have highlighted Khan's mission to scrutinize private equity “roll ups” as well as big tech acquisitions, including Meta's acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram. During her time at FTC, Khan brought multiple suits against private equity and big tech monopolies. She didn't win all of them, but still had impact.

“She started to do those investigations at the FTC of these kinds of roll ups. So for private equity, that meant that they couldn't just waltz in and buy up all of these various [medical] practices,” he said.

Her work affected real estate too. “Mobile home parks, which used to be run by a lot of independent owners, private equity would come into a region and buy up all the mobile home parks, then raise all the rents.” Just knowing they might be scrutinized made firms more cautious. “Once you get the FTC investigating, you become more careful,” Kenney said.

In New York City, private equity firms have been known to use aggressive tactics to get residents of rent controlled buildings to leave so they can raise rents.

“They made it a hellhole for the tenants. They played all sorts of shitty little tricks on them, and they eventually moved,” Kenney said.

The real estate private equity firm Sugar Hill Capital Partners has been accused of allowing its buildings to become unlivable – through problems like rat infestations – so that tenants in rent controlled units will leave and they can raise rents. Notably, Mamdani's campaign centered around making rent more affordable; Kenney thinks that Khan's appointment is most directed at private equity landlords.

When it comes to private equity owned health companies, Loren Adler, associate director and fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center on Health Policy said “there was a lot of focus on trying to shine sunlight on private equity firms buying up a bunch of small practices and combining them into a larger entity”.

For example, Khan filed a complaint against US Anesthesia Partners and its private equity owners for attempting to monopolize Texas's anesthesia industry (though she ultimately lost).

Adler agrees with Kenney that Khan's appointment is largely symbolic, given that “municipal power is only so strong”. However, there are a few ways Mamdani could make things difficult for private equity-backed health companies in New York.

While the mayor might not have power to stop acquisitions, “it's pretty easy to force transparency at the municipal level”.

One reason that private equity is able to get away with monopolizing health industries is they usually are not required to disclose acquisitions below a certain threshold, so ownership of a clinic can change without consumers ever knowing. This was something that Khan worked to change under Biden.

“There's a lot of facility approvals, land use permits and things like that that happen at the municipal level. So there's some power to compel that sort of disclosure,” Adler explained.

Mamdani could also create more competition for private equity firms by strengthening New York City's already strong public hospital system, and resisting contracting with private equity firms for things like ambulance services and medical devices.

“New York also already has one of the most robust public hospital systems. There's already a good jumping off point,” Adler said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Scramble to find replacement for George Tidmarsh shines light on dysfunction at US regulatory agency 

After the dramatic ousting of the top drug regulator at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) two weeks ago, officials have scrambled to find a replacement in a process that has revealed the agency's internal cracks and tensions.

It's troubling news for a regulatory agency that has previously enjoyed a reputation for stability and consistency.

On Tuesday, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the top spot at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) would be filled by a surprising candidate.

Richard Pazdur is a respected oncology expert and longtime FDA employee – that's not the surprising part. But he reportedly turned down the position when he was approached last week, according to Pink Sheet. That's when top leaders began searching for other candidates.

“It boggles the mind,” said Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a former associate commissioner at the FDA. “Reversals upon reversals.”

The news comes after several upheavals at the FDA.

George Tidmarsh, who was only appointed as CDER director in late July, resigned in early November following accusations of retaliation against a former pharmaceutical business partner and reports of strife within the agency. Tidmarsh was accused, in an explosive lawsuit, of using his position to harm his former business partner.

In the days before his ouster, Tidmarsh had opposed a new form of rapid approval, he told Stat News. The new program, called “Commissioner's National Priority Voucher”, promised the rapid reviews of drugs – but Tidmarsh said he questioned the legality of the plan.

Tidmarsh also reportedly sparred with Vinay Prasad, simultaneously the agency's chief medical and scientific officer and the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), after Prasad repeatedly bypassed Tidmarsh to ask CDER employees to do work for him.

The HHS did not respond to the Guardian's questions about power struggles between Tidmarsh and Prasad, but the agency did confirm that Tidmarsh was no longer employed there.

“Secretary Kennedy expects the highest ethical standards from all individuals serving under his leadership and remains committed to full transparency,” said Emily Hilliard, press secretary.

Prasad himself was subject to reversals. He was forced to resign in July, but he returned unexpectedly less than a week later. FDA chief Marty Makary reportedly worked to bring him back.

“Prasad has obviously been very aggressive, and he's not been softened by the experience of getting fired – if anything he seems to feel that he has the wind at his back because he was restored,” Lurie said. “But none of it speaks well to the kind of relations between the center directors that are necessary to make the place work.”

The degree of discord among top FDA officials is “very unusual”, Lurie said.

Before the job was filled by Pazdur, one CDER employee told the Guardian that “I would never take it” because the position would be a “career killer” in the turnover and tumult at the agency.

“Plus, I'd have Vinay Prasad bitching at me or about me non-stop,” said the employee, who asked for anonymity to protect their job.

After Tidmarsh's departure, several longtime employees said they were not interested in the position, and Sara Brenner, principal deputy commissioner at the FDA, sent an email on Friday to some CDER employees asking whether any of them wanted to apply.

“The whole process of appointments at FDA in the current administration has been an enormous departure from accepted practices,” Lurie said. “The degree of upheaval at the agency is really difficult to overestimate and leaves people in the agency disconcerted.”

Opening up the position to large numbers of employees “reeks of desperation” and gives the impression that FDA leaders struggled to fill the job, he said. But Pazdur has “the right qualifications”, and choosing an FDA insider might shore up confidence and morale, Lurie added.

“There's a sense among people who have worked at the agency for a while that they're under siege by people who have come from the outside with only limited understanding of the way that FDA works and that they would be better served with somebody who actually understands the institution,” he said.

Lurie notes that the pharmaceutical industry values stability at the FDA more than anything. There is a core belief in the industry – and among the public – that FDA review is valuable in order to maintain trust and safety. “Predictability from day to day is really what they want, and otherwise, everything is in upheaval,” Lurie said.

The FDA has developed careful and relatively uncontroversial processes over the decades for evaluating drugs, biologics and medical devices.

“But now, everything is up for grabs,” Lurie said. “Suddenly, we have people who can get their drug reviewed in a one-day meeting.”

In addition to disrupting its regulatory work, the chaos at the FDA may also undermine the credibility of its experts in general, particularly as top officials within the administration continue to attack scientific expertise, Lurie said.

“If the assault on government continues at the pace that it has,” he said, the idea that the government is not to be trusted “could actually become true”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Former president Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) yesterday called for Taiwanese to put aside partisan differences, and unite and work together to build a better Taiwan. 

Tsai made the comment on her Facebook page after returning from a week-long trip to Germany, where she attended the Berlin Freedom Conference, an event commemorating the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and promoting freedom and democracy worldwide. 

Tsai thanked Taiwan's frontline diplomats, members of the media, and others for helping raise Taiwan's visibility on the global stage and strengthening its ties with Europe.

“Taiwan, like other democracies around the world, is facing unprecedented challenges,” she said, adding that only by staying united can Taiwan safeguard its democratic development and economic prosperity. 

Tsai said she would always be there for Taiwan if needed, and urged everyone to come together, and work toward its betterment and contribute to the world. 

In a statement issued on Friday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that during her trip to Germany, Tsai also attended a screening of Zero Day Attack (零日攻擊) during the Berlin conference's Berlin Freedom Week. 

Zero Day Attack is a Taiwanese speculative television series released this year and set against the fictional scenario of a Chinese People's Liberation Army invasion of Taiwan. 

Tsai also met with representatives from several local think tanks and visited the Berlin office of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, the ministry said in the statement. 

She held in-depth discussions with the team behind the Germany-funded “Taiwan as a Pioneer” research project, aimed at promoting structural strengthening and networking of Taiwan research in Sinology, it added.

Ukraine is being rocked by the biggest corruption scandal of President Volodymyr Zelensky's term.

In the halls of power in Kyiv, the mood is one of dread and uncertainty about what to expect next.

""It's a huge blow, but the worst part of it is that I'm not sure that we are at the end of it, it might still be unfolding,"" a pro-government Ukrainian lawmaker speaking on condition of anonymity told the Kyiv Independent.

""What I would recommend the president to do right now is to take serious action and get rid of lots of people in his entourage,"" they added.

The scandal centres on an investigation by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), which alleges that Timur Mindich, a close ally of Zelensky, led a group getting kickbacks from energy construction and procurement, including building defenses for Ukraine's energy infrastructure, and laundering the proceeds.

Several other figures in the Zelensky government are implicated, and two ministers — Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk — have already resigned as a result.

The timing could not be worse for Ukraine as it heads into what will likely be the most difficult winter since the launch of Russia's full-scale invasion.

Across the country, people already face chronic power outages, and Russia's ever-escalating attacks on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure threaten not only the supply of electricity but also gas, heating, and even water.

On the front lines, Russia's now years-long grinding advances in Donetsk Oblast are threatening to consume the fortress city of Pokrovsk in the coming weeks.

It's no surprise then that the revelation that while soldiers and civilians suffer the hardships of war, the news that some of those in power have been enriching themselves has caused mass outrage.


""This is the mentality that comes from the USSR, that those people who are in power always want to benefit from their position and always try to steal something.""
    

""This war will take away most of the active, honest, and decent people — of which most of us are,"" military volunteer Mariia Berlinska wrote in an eviscerating op-ed for Ukrainska Pravda.

""It hurts to believe that at the same time, the president's friends are paying for their whores, expensive cars, and spending hundreds of millions of our money on new villas.""

Similar sentiments can be found everywhere on the streets of Kyiv.

""While Ukrainians sit without electricity for 16 hours a day, they launder money,"" Kyiv student Elizaveta Demidova told the Kyiv Independent.

""It's not acceptable at all. I think this is the mentality that comes from the USSR, that those people who are in power always want to benefit from their position and always try to steal something,"" she added.

Others are directing their ire at Zelensky himself, who, despite not being named in the investigation so far, is unlikely to survive unscathed given his closeness to those involved.

""Our president knew everything about all of this,"" a Kyiv tour guide, Yevhen Makovsky, emotionally told the Kyiv Independent.

But despite the gravity of the crisis engulfing Ukraine's leadership, there is a glimmer of optimism that such an investigation shows the country's democratic, investigative, and legal processes are alive and healthy.


""I sincerely hope that the next step will show that institutions are working in our state, and the proof of this is that every corrupt scoundrel will be punished by the law, rather than by angry and armed people.""
    

The very fact that an Anti-Corruption Bureau investigation exists at all is largely down to mass public protests over the summer in reaction to the president signing a bill that would have effectively destroyed two of Ukraine's key anti-corruption bodies, including NABU.

""If people had not taken to the streets then, this criminal case would have simply been closed,"" 24-year-old veteran Liubomyr Dmytryshyn told the Kyiv Independent.

In this case, the government backed down and reinstated both bodies, but Ukraine's youthful 33-year history is littered with examples of the bloody price its people have had to pay for democracy, most notably the 2014 EuroMaidan Revolution, and the ongoing fight against Russia.

""We are going through a painful process of understanding the value of our own state, from personal survival to the realization that the source of power in it is people protesting with cardboard signs,"" Architect, a 32-year-old drone operator in Ukraine's Armed Forces, told the Kyiv Independent.

""I sincerely hope that the next step will show that institutions are working in our state, and the proof of this is that every corrupt scoundrel will be punished by the law, rather than by angry and armed people.""

This sentiment was echoed by Oleksandra Matviichuk, a human rights lawyer and a Nobel Prize laureate, who, in a Facebook post, compared corruption to cancer.

""Cancer should be detected, and preferably at an early stage. It can and should be fought with. In light of recent news, I am warmed by the example of people who just did their jobs honestly,"" she said, adding: ""So like a lot of people I'm not going to give up.""

Denys Kovalenko, a judge who lives in Kyiv, told the Kyiv Independent that although the news ""made me mad,"" people shouldn't lose focus and be distracted from the fight against Russia.

""We have to discuss how to help the army, how to raise funds, and where to direct them. And corruption should be dealt with by the bodies that deal with it,"" he said.

But regardless of whether Ukraine's wheels of justice function as they should, many are concerned that the reputational damage from the scandal could affect international support.

Taras Chmut, the head of the Come Back Alive charity foundation, believes it won't affect the support from individuals in foreign countries, as they understand that ""they are donating to the soldiers, not to the state.""

He does, however, have concerns about the response from Western politicians.

""The issue of corruption in Ukraine always arises at international meetings,"" he told the Kyiv Independent.

""(A negative reaction on the political level) would be worse, because the trust of the state drops from the view of our partners — this is bad.""

The Kyiv Independent asked military volunteer Maria Berlinska if she was concerned about the scandal affecting Western support for Ukraine.

""My comment is very simple: Europe should still support Ukraine, because otherwise they will be next, and they will be fucked,"" she said.

Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) drone strikes on Russian Novorossiysk's port and oil facilities on Nov. 14 destroyed four S-400 ""Triumph"" launchers and two radars, a source in the agency told the Kyiv Independent.

Ukraine launched long-range drone strikes on Novorossiysk, targeting an oil depot, a container terminal, coastal infrastructure, and a ship, according to preliminary reports.

Satellite images obtained by the Kyiv Independent show that four destroyed launchers of the S-400 Triumph anti-aircraft missile system, which were positioned at the Kuban Red Banner Regiment military base.

The attack also resulted in the destruction of two Russian radars: the 96N6, also known as ""Cheese Board,"" an early-warning radar, and the 92N6, ""Grave Stone,"" a target designation radar.

The base reportedly housed around 12 S-400 launchers, and the source indicated that several additional launchers may have been damaged in the strike.

The operation was carried out by the SBU with support from Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR), the Special Defense Forces, and the State Border Service.

Ukraine has routinely targeted oil facilities in Russia and in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories in an effort to disrupt Moscow's military logistics and supply lines.

Novorossiysk handles not only Russian oil but also shipments from Kazakhstan, moving over 2 million barrels per day, which accounts for roughly 5% of global maritime oil supplies.

Oil prices jumped about 2% on the morning of Nov. 14 amid supply concerns after Ukrainian drones struck an oil storage facility at the Russian port.

Novorossiysk, a key Black Sea export hub, also suspended oil shipments following the attack overnight on Nov. 14, according to Reuters.

Ukraine launched long-range drone strikes on Novorossiysk, targeting an oil depot, a container terminal, coastal infrastructure, and a ship, according to preliminary reports.

Polish President Karol Nawrocki announced that he would no longer sign the law providing aid to Ukrainians unless a ""new solution"" is found.

Ryazan Governor Pavel Malkov confirmed the attack and said one enterprise, whose name he did not disclose, sustained damage.



Interest in Lukoil's overseas holdings has increased in recent days, Bloomberg reported on Nov. 14.

Serhii Vlasenko, 35, has served in Ukraine's Emergency Service for 15 years and was on duty as a shift supervisor when the attack occurred.

Ukrainian forces withdrew from the village of Novovasylivske in Zaporizhzhia Oblast to ""more favorable defensive positions,"" the Southern Defense Forces said on Nov. 15.

North Korean artillery supplies enabled Russia to maintain its firing rate in 2024, but this year, that support has declined markedly.



The Nov. 11 attack triggered explosions and a large fire at the facility, and the plant may remain offline until the end of the month, the sources said.

Russian forces launched three Kinzhal ballistic missiles, as well as 135 drones against Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine's Air Force. 

The number includes 1,000 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

The two leaders will discuss bilateral cooperation in the ""energy, economic, and defense fields,"" as well as progress in preparing security guarantees for Ukraine under the ""Coalition of the Willing"" framework.

The U.S. Coast Guard detected and monitored a Russian intelligence-gathering ship operating near the Hawaiian Islands on Oct. 29, according to a press release published Nov. 13.

Ukrainian drones struck the Russian port city of Novorossiysk on Nov. 14, damaging an oil terminal and sparking a large fire, multiple Russian Telegram channels reported.

Bavarian Premier Markus Söder has proposed building small nuclear ""mini reactors."" Meanwhile, a World War II bomb has been successfully defused in Nuremberg. DW has the latest.

More than two years after Germany shut down its last three nuclear power stations, Bavarian state Premier Markus Söder is calling for the construction of small reactors.

Söder argues in an interview that these ""mini reactors"" would require less state funding than previous plants.

Meanwhile, bomb disposal experts have defused a bomb left over from World War II.

More than 20,000 people were required to leave their homes to allow the weapon to be safely disarmed.

And one of the country's most important railway stations, that in Cologne, is out of action for 10 days amid construction work.

Read on here for a rundown of the top stories from and about Germany on Saturday, November 15, 2025.

Saxony's state premier, Michael Kretschmer of the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), has spoken in favor of returning to energy supplies from Russia. 

""We must also consider the sanctions against Russia from our own economic perspective,"" he told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group on Saturday.

""Our interest must be to resume energy supplies from Russia after a ceasefire. Economic relations also increase our security,"" added Kretschmer, who has expressed this position in the past.

Germany stopped receiving pipeline gas from Russia in late August 2022 following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Since then, the EU has imposed a series of unprecedented sanctions against Moscow. 

In mid-October, EU countries agreed to phase out all remaining natural gas imports from Russia by the end of 2027.

In response to the question about renewed gas deliveries, Kretschmer said that ""Russia must be a trading partner again in the long term — without us becoming dependent on it again.""

Before the war in Ukraine, Germany imported more than half of the natural gas it used from Russia. While some politicians, particularly on the right, have called for a return to Russian energy imports, others say Germany should not let itself become dependent on a single energy producer. 

The premier of the southern German state of Bavaria is urging a major shift in the country's energy policy — including the construction of new nuclear power plants.

""It's not about building large reactors like in the past. I'm talking about smaller, smart reactors, such as those already in use in Canada,"" Markus Söder told the Sunday edition of the Welt newspaper.

In recent years, he has repeatedly criticized Germany's decision to phase out nuclear power. The country's last three nuclear power plants were shut down in April 2023.

Söder, the leader of Bavaria's conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) party, the sister party of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), argued that these ""mini reactors"" would require less state funding than previous plants.

However, according to the Canadian government, such reactors do not yet exist in Canada. Only preparatory work has begun in the Ontario region, with the first reactor expected by around 2030.



Sauerkraut, made of fermented white cabbage, has long been a frequent element of traditional German cuisine.

In centuries past, it has also provided a valuable source of vitamin C for sailors of all nationalities to prevent scurvy, as it can be stored for long periods.

The British navigator James Cook was particularly noted for having introduced it on board his ships, though he and his officers had first to give a good example by having it served in their mess, as the sailors initially refused to eat it.

Media reports say two tourists have fallen ill with symptoms of poisoning in Istanbul, shortly after a German mother and her two children died, apparently from eating tainted food.

According to the DHA news agency, the two stayed in the same hotel in Istanbul's Fatih district as the German family.

The two people, who have been hospitalized, come from Italy and Morocco, according to the daily Cumhuriyet.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said once more that his party will not cooperate with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

Speaking to his conservative bloc's youth movement in the southwestern town of Rust, Merz said this was not because the two parties were separated by any ""firewall,"" but because his Christian Democrats (CDU) were ""worlds apart"" from the populists.

""We have nothing in common with them,"" he said, saying he would not jeopardize the legacy of the CDU and the names he associated with it, such as the former chancellors Helmut Kohl and Konrad Adenauer.

Merz, whose coalition government has implemented an increasingly hard-line migration policy, was at pains to stress that Germany should nevertheless remain open to regular immigrants, say that while irregular migration must be combated, those who want to come to work in Germany would continue to be welcomed in the future.
 

Altogether 63% of Poles want to see Germany pay more reparations for losses and damage caused by the Nazi occupation of their country during World War Two from 1939 to 1945, according to a study by the state-run polling insitute CBOS.

That is an increase of five percentage points over results from the same survey two years ago.

However, there are extreme differences depending on the political orientation of the respondents.

Altogether 85% of people opposed to the center-left government of Donald Tusk are in favor of asking for more reparations, while only 31% of Tusk supporters are of the same view.

Religiosity seems also to play a role, with Poles who attend church at least once a month more likely to want German reparations than those who are less observant or nonreligious.

The question of war reparations has long strained relations between the two neighbors.

The German government rejects making more payments, with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier saying as late as September that the issue was legally settled from Germany's point of view.

Tusk himself is cautious on the issue, believing along with his government that Warsaw would not be able to push through such a demand in any international court owing to the long period of time — more than eight decades — that has elapsed since the conflict ended.

However, the new conservative president of Poland, Karol Nawrocki, has been vocal in his call for what he says is a debt of €1.3 billion (€1.5 billion) owed to his country by Germany, a sum established by a Polish parliamentary commission in a 2022 report.

A German woman and her two children who are suspected to have died from food poisoning while on holiday in Turkey are to be buried there on Saturday.

The father of the two children, who were aged 6 and 3, is still being treated in an intensive care unit in Istanbul.

Investigators are still working to determine the cause of the deaths, with the main focus being on the food from street vendors they bought and ate before they died.

The family is said to have eaten stuffed mussels from a street vendor and then soup and kokorec — a dish made from lamb or goat intestines wrapped around seasoned offal — at another shop.

They also bought Turkish delight and water, with the Anadolu news ageny saying they also ate chicken.

Four suspects have been arrested, with state broadcaster TRT saying they are sellers of such dishes. Anadolu said all the suspects have previous convictions for other offenses.

The police force of Germany's lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has warned lawmakers after USB sticks were sent to them by post this week by an unknown source.

Several parliamentary parties have confirmed receiving the devices in packages with English-language cover letters.

The police warned against connecting the sticks to any computer.

Social Democrat politician Marja-Liisa Völlers described the sending of the USB sticks as concerning and said an investigation was underway. 

Cologne main train station, one of Germany's busiest and most importance rail hubs, has been closed to long distance (ICE/IC/EC) and regional (RB/RE) trains from Friday for construction work that will last until the morning of Monday, November 24.

Until then, the station will only be served by the local underground (U-Bahn), suburban commuter trains (S-Bahn) and one regional connection, the RB25.

However, the originally planned construction work on a new signal box won't actually take place in this period after rail operator Deutsche Bahn (DB) identified a string of last-minute software errors which will have to be fixed first.

Instead, the installation of the new signal box has been postponed until the new year, necessitating a second, shorter closure of the station ""after carnival"" in February.

""What we can already promise passengers is that the second closure will be shorter,"" said Matthias Gramer, regional head of the DB's infrastructure subsidiary InfraGo, insisting that no one could have foreseen the software error.

""It's like something out of a madhouse; there's nothing else you can say. It's a mystery to me how something like this could happen,"" criticized Oliver Krischer (Green Party), the regional transport minister for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), on local public broadcaster WDR.

""We've been planning this for a long time and then I'm told two days before: April fool! The software doesn't work. You can't make it up,"" he added.

For travelers whose journeys pass through Cologne, long-distance and regional trains will run to and from Deutz (Köln Messe/Deutz) on the other side of the River Rhine, with others calling at suburban stops Cologne-Ehrenfeld or Cologne South (Köln-Süd).

Key regional lines such as the RE1 (Aachen-Hamm) and RE5 (Koblenz-Wesel) will circumvent not only Cologne but also Leverkusen and Düsseldorf-Benrath.

A Catholic church in the southwestern German town of Rottweil has been temporarily rendered unusable by an unbearable odor believed to emanate either from a dead marten or from carrion carried by one of the weasel-like mammals into a heating duct of the building.

Services will be held in the parish hall rather than the Church of the Resurrection until the problem is remedied, said Jürgen Rieger, the church's minister.

He said the stench of rotting flesh had begun eight days ago and grown ever more intensive since then.

A pest controller called in to eliminate the problem has so far failed, despite several attempts.

Rottweil is located 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of the city of Stuttgart.
 

A World War II bomb found in the southern German city of Nuremberg has been successfully defused in an around hourlong operation by three bomb disposal experts, the city announced early on Saturday. 

Up to 21,000 residents were required to leave their homes ahead of the defusal, with all roads within a radius of 800 meters (875 yards) of the bomb closed to traffic.

The city said the evacuation operation was the largest even conducted by Nuremberg in such a case.

The bomb, which weighed around 450 kilograms (992 pounds), was discovered during construction work  in the city's Grossreuth district. 

Hundreds of emergency personnel were deployed in the area on Friday evening to monitor security, including 500 firefighters, 250 rescue service volunteers, 60 civil protection organization (THW) personnel and more than 100 police. 

Allied forces carried out a number of bombing raids on Nuremberg, which was an important economic and infrastructural center, from 1940 to 1945.

The biggest of them came on January 2, 1945, when 521 RAF bombers dropped 6,000 high-explosive bombs and a million incendiary devices, killing more than 1,800 people and almost completely destroying the old part of the city.

Nuremberg was also known for its rallies from 1923 to 1938, which the Nazi party used to propagate its ideology.

Former German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the current environment minister, Carsten Schneider, are expected to take part in the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil over the weekend. 

Baerbock, a Green politician who is now president of the UN General Assembly, plans to take part in several discussions and events at the conference in the city of Belem in the Amazon region.

As foreign minister, she was previously in charge of negotiations for Germany at climate conferences, a role that will now be assumed by Schneider. 

Ahead of her expected visit, Baerbock told the DPA news agency that the climate crisis was ""the greatest threat of our time,"" even eclipsing the many wars and conflicts currently besetting the world.

""Some 3.6 billion people — almost half the world's population — are already severely threatened by the consequences of climate change: droughts, floods, extreme heat and growing food insecurity,"" she said.

Baerbock said this added to ""the vicious cycle of hunger, poverty, displacement, instability and conflict.""  

She stressed the vital importance of international cooperation in view of the fact that ""CO2 doesn't stop at borders."" 

Schneider, for his part, plans to meet with members of the Quilombola community, which lives in the rainforest, as well as visiting a nature reserve.

A blast has torn through a police station in India-administered Kashmir, sparking a fire. It comes amid heightened tensions in India after a deadly car explosion in New Delhi this week.

At least nine people were killed and 32 injured when a pile of confiscated explosives detonated inside a police station in Srinagar in India-administered Kashmir, police said on Saturday.

The blast happened in the Nowgam area of Srinagar, the region's main city, late Friday, while officials were examining explosives.

Jammu and Kashmir police chief Nalin Prabhat ruled out any foul play, saying it was an ""accidental explosion.""

""Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary,"" he told a news conference.

According to Prabhat, the dead included policemen, government officials and forensic staff. 

""The building of the police station has been severely damaged and the adjacent buildings have been affected,"" said Prabhat.

The Nowgam police station was engulfed in fire as a result of the explosion and several vehicles nearby were damaged.

A police source told Reuters that authorities are working on identifying the bodies, as some have been completely burnt.

""The intensity of the blast was such that some body parts were recovered from nearby houses, around 100-200 metres away from the police station,"" the source said.

Several small explosions followed the initial blast, which briefly delayed rescue and firefighting efforts.

The police station blast in Kashmir comes amid heightened tensions in India.

On Monday, a car exploded in the capital, New Delhi, killing at least eight people in what the Indian government has called a terror attack.

Indian security agencies detained several suspects in Kashmir as part of their investigations into the car explosion.

Turkish authorities have detained four suspects after a German mother and her two children died from suspected food poisoning while on holiday in Istanbul. Investigators say the family had eaten street food.

Turkish prosecutors arrested four people on suspicion of negligent homicide after a German woman and her two children died in Istanbul, Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said Friday.

Authorities have closed one of the food outlets in Istanbul's Besiktas district and taken samples from multiple locations where the family is believed to have eaten.

The family — a couple and their children aged six and three — had traveled to the city on Sunday and reportedly ate at several street vendors in the Ortakoy quarter, a busy tourist area on the Bosporus waterside.

Shortly afterward, all four fell ill with symptoms of food poisoning.

They were taken to a hospital on Wednesday but later discharged. The children died shortly after being readmitted, followed by their mother. The father remains in intensive care, according to Turkish media.

Justice Minister Tunc said on X that tests were being conducted to confirm whether the consumed food directly caused the deaths. 

""Samples have been taken from the places where the family is known to have eaten and four people.. have been taken into custody,"" the minister wrote. 

According to media reports, the family is thought to have eaten mussels with rice, sweets, and kokoretsi — a grilled dish made from lamb intestines — as well as stuffed potatoes.

The family, reportedly of Turkish descent and living in Germany, had been visiting Istanbul for vacation. Germany's Foreign Office confirmed they were German citizens and said it was in contact with local authorities.

The tragedy has sparked national concern in Turkey over street food safety, which is popular among residents and tourists alike, particularly in the Bosporus neighborhoods.

Donald Trump has confirmed he will sue the BBC for up to $5bn (£3.8bn) after its Panorama programme doctored one of his speeches.

Speaking to The Telegraph onboard Air Force One, Mr Trump said he would formally seek damages against the BBC as early as next week for between “$1bn and $5bn”.

“I think I have to,” he said.

The US president added that Sir Keir Starmer was “very embarrassed” by the scandal, and that he would speak to the Prime Minister over the weekend.

The Telegraph revealed earlier this month that the BBC had doctored a speech delivered by Mr Trump to make it seem that he had encouraged the storming of the Capitol on January 6 2021.

The corporation on Thursday apologised to the US president after he threatened to sue it for $1bn in damages if it did not say sorry for the edit, but rejected his claim of defamation.

But speaking onboard Air Force One on Friday night, Mr Trump said he still intended to pursue legal action against the corporation and could seek up to $5bn in damages.

“We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn and $5bn probably some time next week,” he told The Telegraph, en route to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

“I think I have to do it. They've even admitted that they cheated… They changed the words coming out of my mouth.”

“The people of the UK are very angry about what happened as you can imagine because it shows the BBC is fake news,” Mr Trump continued, saying Sir Keir was “very embarrassed” by the scandal.

Praising The Telegraph's reporting as a “great service… exposing fake news”, he said the broadcaster had acted “worse than what CBS did with Kamala”.

The president was referring to a broadcast of CBS's 60 Minutes last year, shortly before the election, when an interview with his political opponent Kamala Harris was edited to make her answer sound more coherent.

Mr Trump declared that CBS, the sister channel of the BBC, had attempted “election interference” and sued it for $10bn. He settled the case earlier this year for $16m.

In a separate interview on GB News on Friday night, Mr Trump claimed he had an “obligation” to take on the BBC, which he labelled “corrupt” and “beyond fake”.

“This was so egregious,” he said. “If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people. I think you probably have an obligation. I'd like to find out why they did it.”

The president hit out at the BBC's “stupid” claim that it had “unintentionally” misled viewers about the content of his speech on Jan 6.

“They wrote me a nice letter saying [they] apologise. But when you say it's unintentional, I guess if it's unintentional, you don't apologise,” he said.

“But they took my words, you know, and I made a beautiful statement, and they made it into a not beautiful statement.”

The BBC has been thrown into turmoil by The Telegraph's revelation that it had spliced together two statements made by the president almost an hour apart to make it seem as if he was inciting rioting at the Capitol.

Tim Davie, the BBC's director-general, and Deborah Turness, the head of BBC News, resigned on Sunday evening amid a backlash in what was seen as the corporation's worst crisis since the Jimmy Savile scandal more than a decade ago.

Mr Trump had said in his speech: “We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”

Roughly an hour later, he said: “And we fight. We fight like hell.”

In Panorama's version, he said: “We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”

The BBC agreed not to show the edition of Panorama again.

On Thursday, The Telegraph revealed that BBC Newsnight had also doctored footage of the speech in 2022, making it appear that Mr Trump was encouraging his supporters to riot.

Mr Trump suggested the BBC could have also misrepresented comments by Nigel Farage, the Reform leader and a political ally.

“One of the things that we'll find out during this litigation… is how many other times have they done it to your Prime Minister, have they done it to Nigel, have they done it to the people that are in your country,” he said.

A senior White House official suggested on Monday that there could be further ramifications for the BBC, apart from the legal threat.

“The White House may consider restricting the BBC's access to open press events due to their admission of falsely doctoring President Trump's words,” the official told The Telegraph.

That development would ban the BBC from covering briefings by Mr Trump's press secretary, meetings with world leaders, and major announcements made on the grounds of the White House.

Mr Trump also hit out at Sadiq Khan, the London mayor and a longtime political enemy, for letting crime spiral out of control in the capital.

“My mother loved London… That was a different London than you have today,” he told GB News, claiming people are “being stabbed in the ass, or worse”.

London has “no-go” areas where sharia law is in effect and police “don't even want to go anywhere near”, he claimed without evidence, adding that Mr Khan was a “nasty person”.

The president also alleged that migrants from “some of the worst places on earth” were coming to Britain and “destroying your country”.

“I've told some of the leaders of Europe, you've got to stop. Your immigration is going to destroy you if you get people from the wrong places,” he said.

Mr Trump criticised the Government for blocking drilling in the North Sea, which he labelled “one of the greatest energy fields in the world” with “some of the best oil”.

“You have this huge asset sitting there, and you're destroying your country with windmills all over the place,” he said.

The Pentagon has been turned “upside down” under an increasingly paranoid Pete Hegseth, defence sources have said.

Insiders described the secretary of defence's tenure as chaotic, amateurish and dysfunctional, warning that Congress and some in the White House are now losing trust.

Some claim the 45-year-old has grown steadily more suspicious throughout his 11-month tenure, putting his faith in a shrinking circle of aides.

As Pentagon chief, Mr Hegseth oversees every branch of the US military, and has a critical role in operations ranging from strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities to building up US forces near Venezuela.

But critics have claimed the former Fox News host has increasingly retreated into his comfort zone.

Instead of grappling with the biggest issues facing the US and the world, they say, he spends his time on photoshoots of his workouts, rooting out “wokeness” in the military, and lecturing “fat generals” about weight loss.

He has also frozen out key institutions and defence officials traditionally involved in the running of the nation's forces.

Media outlets, including conservative ones, have also been shut out. Congressional Republicans and Democrats are furious about being left in the dark. And even channels of communication with the White House have grown silent.

Supporters of Mr Hegseth say he is conducting a radical overhaul necessary to project “peace through strength” across the world, a key plank of Donald Trump's foreign policy.

But Mr Hegseth, known even by his critics to be fiercely loyal to Mr Trump, has repeatedly blindsided and contradicted the US president. At times, the commander in chief has had to personally rein in his newly-named “secretary of war”.

Mr Hegseth is increasingly distrustful of all but his inner circle, consisting of his wife, his personal lawyer, and one of his few aides left in the department following a flurry of sackings.

The defence secretary is thought by his superiors to have placed his fate in the hands of advisers in whom the White House has little confidence and is rapidly losing patience.

John Ullyot, a former deputy assistant to Mr Trump who worked for Mr Hegseth as chief Pentagon spokesman from January to April, supported the secretary during his rocky confirmation as the best candidate to shake up the department.

He doesn't think that any more.

“Hegseth is a good TV host, but sadly his tenure as secretary has been preachy, amateurish, and dysfunctional,” he told The Telegraph. “It's been one distraction after another, and president Trump deserves better.”

In March, Elon Musk, the government's efficiency tsar at the time, was invited to the Pentagon for a briefing on the US military's plans for a potential war with China, prompting concern from those who feared the Tesla billionaire was susceptible to pressure from Beijing.

Mr Trump personally stepped in to stop the meeting from going ahead. “What the f--- is Elon doing there? Make sure he doesn't go,” he instructed aides, according to Axios.

Mr Hegseth eventually pushed back on the bad press, claiming it was an “informal” meeting to discuss “innovation”.

Then in July, the president halted Mr Hegseth's order blocking vital military aid from being sent to Ukraine, a decision which the defence secretary had reportedly taken without informing the White House. The Pentagon insisted the pause had been coordinated with the government.

The same month, he was apparently overruled by officials close to Mr Trump after ordering Pentagon staff to submit to lie detector tests in an attempt to root out leakers.

Lat week, senators pointed out multiple contradictions between the White House and Pentagon positions, including the decision last month to withdraw US troops who had been stationed in Romania.

“We're constantly joking that we're in the upside down,” said a source who works under Mr Hegseth. “This is not a good way to run a government.”

Critics say this is a consequence of Mr Hegseth's own failings: a “Johnny One Note” with vague ideas about “lethality” and “warfighters”, who lacks the gravitas to run a department or the seriousness to learn how.

“For him, the Pentagon is like a shiny new Ferrari,” a former senior defence official said. “The reason why he got that problem with Musk was that he wanted to let Musk sit in the driver's seat and rev the thing and see how cool this was.”

Added to that is Mr Hegseth's growing paranoia since “Signalgate”, the scandal that almost ended his career when he inadvertently leaked US military plans to the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic.

While the defence secretary is not thought to have been the person responsible for mistakenly adding the journalist to the Signal chat, he shared sensitive information, including strategy and advance notice of bombings, that critics said was classified.

“I would have bet my life on the fact that he would have been gone after Signalgate,” said a Pentagon official. “You just don't release secrets like that on a commercial channel.”

Colin Carroll, a former adviser to Mr Hegseth, told the Megyn Kelly Show in April that the secretary quickly became “consumed” with paranoia and was spending half his day on leak investigations.

Nobody, including personal friends of Mr Hegseth, was safe in the atmosphere of mutual suspicion that gripped the department and in a short time would lead to purges of top aides accused of leaking.

Mr Carroll was one of those sacked by Mr Hegseth in April. So were Darin Selnick and Dan Caldwell, two long-term advisers to the secretary, who were summarily marched out of the Pentagon.

The trio would later issue a joint statement hitting out at “unnamed Pentagon officials” who had “slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door”.

The finger of blame has since been pointed at Tim Parlatore, the secretary's private lawyer who followed him into the Pentagon, as part of a “power play” to cement his own position.

Mr Parlatore said suggestions he had orchestrated the sacking of aides were “debunked lies”.

He criticised The Telegraph's reporting, which he said had been directly contradicted by the US president's public statements.

At the same time, Ricky Buria, now seen as the de facto chief of staff, unsuccessfully attempted to oust Matt McNitt, the White House liaison, according to the Washington Post.

Both men appear to have the confidence of Mr Hegseth, no mean feat in the current climate. But coordination across the government has been hamstrung by their strained relationship with the White House.

Mr Parlatore left Mr Trump's criminal defence team in 2023 amid infighting in his inner circle and was reportedly called “unstable” by the president. Mr Buria, who has donated to the Democrats, is distrusted by Trumpworld and been blocked from the permanent chief of staff job.

One individual familiar with the situation suggested the White House was “reaching the end of the rope” with the pair.

“Not only are they inexperienced in what they're doing, they have bad relationships across the administration,” they said.

Mr Hegseth was just hours into his first day as US defence secretary when he started pulling up the drawbridge at the Pentagon.

On a Monday in late January, sitting with his team in his new office, Mr Hegseth and his wife pushed to ban Courtney Kube, NBC's veteran national security reporter, from the Pentagon.

They refused to be put off when his attempt to force out Ms Kube from the Pentagon was dashed by legal advice, according to a former senior Pentagon official.

A new, legally-watertight plan came to fruition in February. The Pentagon might not be able to target NBC, but it could rotate the media seats hitherto reserved for the broadcaster and other unfavourable publications like The New York Times.

In their place came conservative outlets, including the New York Post, Breitbart and One America News Network, alongside HuffPost.

HuffPost leans to the Left and was apparently chosen as cover for the claim that the move was to “broaden access”. But in reality, the source said, it was meant to clamp down on NBC.

None of that would stop Ms Kube from becoming a thorn in Mr Hegseth's side over the months that followed, however.

In March, she reported on the White House directing the Pentagon to draw up plans to “reclaim” the Panama Canal, which is said to have inflamed the defence secretary's sense of paranoia about leaks.

Then, after “Signalgate” broke, she reported that Mr Hegseth had sent information about military strikes on Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to a group that included his wife, even though it is unclear whether she has security clearance.

Jennifer Hegseth, already agitated by the steady stream of stories about her husband during his turbulent confirmation, is named by sources as one of the driving forces behind the Pentagon's attempts to clamp down on the media.

She had been a producer at Fox News, and seems to have been determined to stage-manage her husband as he left television and entered the world of government.

Normally, the defence secretary's office is decorated with images of the armed forces. An insider said Lloyd Austin, Mr Hegseth's predecessor, had “every single service represented”.

But since then the walls of the room have been covered in large prints, each at least 2ft wide, of Mrs Hegseth standing alongside her husband during his swearing-in.

Dozens of news outlets surrendered their Pentagon media passes in October when they refused to agree to Mr Hegseth's demands that they would not publish material without authorisation by officials.

Many conservative outlets could not stomach the imposition, including Newsmax, The Washington Times and even Mr Hegseth's former employer, Fox News.

When the Epoch Times agreed to the rules, its national security reporter Andrew Thornebrooke resigned, arguing it would “abdicate our responsibility as journalists in favour of merely repeating state narratives”.

Adam Smith, the top-ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives' armed services committee, labelled the development a “totalitarian step”.

“Hegseth doesn't think that the American people and the media have the right to know what he's doing or why… It is unbelievable,” he told The Telegraph.

The Pentagon has since formed a new press corps, and counts among its members the Right-wing activist Laura Loomer, and LindellTV, a news network formed by pillow tycoon Mike Lindell.

Mr Hegseth, who seems almost uniquely distrustful of the press, has also retreated from the media spotlight despite being seen as one of the administration's most able communicators.

A former defence official said the secretary generally “performed very well in front of the camera” but would get visibly “rattled” by tough questions.

Other senior government figures are fixtures on the Sunday political shows, like JD Vance, the vice-president, and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, who appear happy to head into the trenches with interviewers.

Mr Trump routinely takes dozens of questions from reporters, including those he labels “fake news”, and this month was interviewed on 60 Minutes. It was only last year he sued broadcaster CBS for a 60 Minutes interview with his political opponent, Kamala Harris, which he claimed was “political interference”.

Mr Hegseth, despite reports that he had a makeup studio installed next to the Pentagon briefing room, has not followed his boss's lead and remains noticeably absent from television screens.

Senior congressional figures who are meant to scrutinise the Pentagon say they know so little about its day-to-day operations that they want to haul Mr and Mrs Hegseth in for questioning.

The defence secretary is stamping his authority on the military with actions that range from transformative, like sacking or sidelining dozens of members of the top brass, to the inane, like gathering hundreds of high-ranking officers to declare an end to fat generals.

Yet politicians told The Telegraph there is so little trust between Mr Hegseth's Pentagon and Congress that they are the “last to know” what's going on.

Suhas Subramanyam, the top Democrat on the House's military and foreign affairs oversight subcommittee, said he wanted Mrs Hegseth to “come before us and testify” to clarify “what her clearance is and what her exact involvement is”.

Adam Smith said relations between Congress and the Pentagon were at their lowest ebb in his 28 years on the House Armed Services committee.

“It's not an argument about how accountable they should be, or when they should talk to us, or whether or not they need to be transparent on this, that or the other thing,” he said.

“Their position is, f--- you.”

Republicans made the most of an opportunity to vent their frustrations this month at what should have been a routine Senate confirmation hearing for an official called Austin Dahmer.

Tom Cotton, a Republican hawk, claimed there was a “pigpen-like mess” at the department, while Republican Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan complained about the silence from the policy office.

“Man, I can't even get a response,” he said. “And we're on your team.”

Mr Dahmer, who blamed “fake news” and “inaccurate reporting” for the controversies, claimed the Pentagon had provided three briefings to the Senate Armed Services committee on the recent withdrawal of troops from Romania.

That was news to Roger Wicker, the committee's chairman, who said they had not received even one.

A Pentagon insider told The Telegraph that the “atmosphere of suspicion” had filtered down from the top of the department and upended any coherent decision-making process.

“Some of the decisions that have come down that don't make any sense. We'll be working on something… and then we get pulled to work on some weird exercise,” the source said, adding that morale had plummeted among officials.

“They can do all the lie detector tests they want, but in the end, the truth will come out,” said Mr Subramanyam, who has spoken to whistleblowers at the department.

“They're so ashamed about what leaks from the Pentagon… they should just be more transparent in the first place.”

A spokesman for the Pentagon said: “All of the fake rumours and false forecasting in your article is plain wrong, given by anonymous sources or those who have an agenda against Secretary Hegseth and President Trump.”

Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesman said: “Secretary of war Pete Hegseth has been one of the most effective leaders this Pentagon has seen in decades, and of course that makes his haters in Washington lose their minds.

“Under his leadership, the DOW (department of war) is a well-oiled machine, united under President Trump's America First vision.”

Mr Hegseth is not the first Pentagon chief who has tried to prevent leaks, and he will be far from the first who has failed to do so.

Like many of his predecessors, the defence secretary has found that while armies will follow orders, government departments with millions of employees will not.

Decisions made in the Pentagon are life and death, and critics are concerned the department is under the control of an individual who seems more concerned with waging internal battles than the real wars taking place around the world.

The Pentagon has always resembled a fortress. But now, with a defence secretary who believes he's under siege, it's being treated like one too.

Donald Trump had won a retraction and an apology just a day earlier from the BBC for the way it had edited his January 6 speech.

But as he glowered over me on Friday night at the back of Air Force One, it was clear he wasn't ready to celebrate just yet.

“We'll sue them,” he told me. “We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn and $5bn, probably some time next week.”

I was sitting in the front row of the press cabin. Mr Trump was close enough to touch.

Next to him stood Karoline Leavitt, his press secretary. It was her interview with me a week before, when she called the corporation a “leftist propaganda machine”, that had given fresh legs to The Telegraph investigation.

It ultimately triggered the resignation of Tim Davie as the corporation's director-general when he must have realised he was at the heart of an international incident.

Behind her was Sergio Gor. Until recently, he was one of the most powerful figures in the White House, but he is now due to take up a posting as ambassador to India.

He winked at me as the president arrived in the press cabin. He must have known what was about to come.

“Mr President,” I began… “My newspaper, The Telegraph, has led the way in exposing…”

He cut me off. “Are you The Telegraph? Oh, what a job you did,” he said. “What a job you did.”

Like most reporters, I have been on the receiving end of his glares.

He once stormed out of a press conference because of a question I asked about Covid and, during his trip to Scotland this year, I ended up as “this guy”, dismissed as a wise-cracking troublemaker.

This was a new experience. I was on the receiving end of a beam, the sort of all-embracing glow the president deploys to woo Middle Eastern princes bearing big money deals or glamorous talk show hosts with soft ball questions.

It was one of those moments that his close staff talk about. He wasn't exactly cooing, but it was the next best thing.

“Are you proud of yourselves? How did you catch the BBC like that? Honestly, congratulations,” he continued.

It must have been a blessed relief to rail against “fake news”.

He was flying home on Air Force One to Mar-a-Lago for a weekend of golf chased by headlines about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, following the latest email dump, and what he knew about the late paedophile's activities.

A moment earlier, he had berated the reporter sitting next to me, calling her “piggy” after she pushed hard on the latest Epstein releases.

But he was in the mood to praise The Telegraph.

It was only when he moved on to his plans to take the BBC to court that his face darkened again.

“I mean they even admitted that they cheated,” he said in disbelief.

He was in the press cabin for 26 minutes for his “gaggle” – what the White House press corps calls a quick question and answer session. But in that time, his mood ran from fury to elation and back again.

The recent US-China trade truce may hold, but Trump's constant policy swerves make industrial peace unlikely.

U.S. workers as a whole have endured a lot of losses in the class war. Globally-mobile companies have deserted communities with unionized workforces, successive administrations raised up oligarchs by slashing taxes on the rich, a major epidemic put the country on edge, and landlords are using technology to collude on raising rents more rapidly.

But all this conventional class war is now joined by a trade war — an international conflict over trade barriers like import taxes. Trump's tariff campaign has been undertaken with a goal of re-shoring outsourced U.S. industry after years of corporate globalization, which firms have carried on under the investment provisions of trade treaties. The tremendous scale of these moves, their baffling and shambolic rollout, and retaliation by foreign powers are just the newest trials of the American working class. And while a recent deal between the U.S. and China — Trump's most prominent antagonist in such a trade war — offers some hope that the worst effects of such a war could be easing, any agreement with the constantly vacillating Trump is a thaw at best, not a true peace.

Tariffs are a tax paid by importers bringing foreign commodities into the United States. They are definitely not, as the Dear Leader has claimed, a tax on foreign countries. Tariff taxes are paid by the importing company that usually produces and/or sells the commodity, like Apple when it brings Chinese-assembled iPhones into U.S. ports.

The importers may trim their profit margins (as the auto industry has done) to pay some of the import duty, but many companies will simply increase prices paid by consumers. These higher prices for imports don't attract consumers, who then buy domestic goods made in the home country, if they are available. This, of course, is a goal of protectionism — to shelter domestic manufacturers from imported goods and services. This creates captive demand for domestic industry, which is then able to grow and gain the scale and skill needed to satisfy the domestic demand with less competition from foreign capital.

Tariffs are a tax paid by importers bringing foreign commodities into the United States. They are definitely not a tax on foreign countries.

Trump himself claims his tariffs are justified by our trade deficits with other nations, apparently viewing any such deficit as proof of these countries benefiting from U.S. offshoring, and has openly celebrated that foreign goods will cost more. Despite acknowledging this impact, Trump has strongly resisted the idea that the higher prices deliberately sought by tariffs will aggravate inflation, despite imports being 14 percent of GDP. Inflation is still a painful sore point for many Americans after the last punishing wave, due to the 2022 COVID re-openings and the spike in energy prices caused by the Russo-Ukrainian War.

But it should be understood that trade deficits for the U.S. are trade surpluses for countries like China and Japan, which often take the proceeds and invest large flows of capital back into the U.S. Trade partners invest their large net earnings in Treasury bonds, U.S. real estate, and other sectors. Interest rates in the U.S. are lower than they would be otherwise due to these capital inflows, as they add to the supply of investible capital in the country.

The scale of resulting inflation will depend on the breadth and depth of the tariffs; because Trump is a shallow thinker and impulsive decision-maker, it remains unclear where average tariffs will settle. Tariffs on goods from China, our largest trading partner, were 10 percent on February 1, then 20 percent on March 1, then 54 percent on April 2, then an astronomical 145 percent on April 9, then 30 percent again on June 11, but now 47 percent on average across various products. China has mirrored the U.S. with similar tariffs through this period. The main U.S. allies are now subject to large trade taxes, with 15 percent for European exports and for most Japanese goods, with higher rates on materials and cars. At the same time, huge tariffs of 50 percent have been imposed on many goods from Brazil and India in retaliation for those countries' domestic political decisions, without any regard for economic policy. The cumulative potential for stubborn inflation is clearly real.

Today's extensive border-crossing supply chains, built up over decades of globalization, will likely be at least somewhat snarled by whatever exact tariff regime is in place when the dust settles. Modern production systems often cross international borders as freely as borders between U.S. states, and having to apply tariff taxes to each step for all the parts of a complete product, along with the paperwork, will likely work an ugly effect. Car and truck parts made in the U.S. are sent to Mexico to turn into systems like the chassis or engine, returned to the U.S. for further work, then shipped back to Mexico for final assembly. Prices are liable to ultimately increase for many goods, to make importers whole or to limit profit reductions, contributing to inflation. But we may also see widespread layoffs due to the combined effects of the new trade barriers, significant retaliation by trading partners, and the constant policy shifts which create uncertainty for investors. These will slow economic growth to the point of stagnation and possibly recession.

“Stagflation” is the term for this ugly combination of recession and inflation, a loathsome condition last seen during the 1970s, when government spending on the Vietnam War collided with an oil embargo by the newly-formed Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) against the West over its support for Israel in the 1973 Israel-Arab war. High energy prices fed into prices for all goods, adding to already high price pressures. But the productivity shock also caused a recession, when the economy shrinks instead of growing.

Even with the largest “reciprocal” tariffs on the rest of the world suspended for now, a number of economists, including at the Federal Reserve, have argued that the constant policy uncertainty and the major shock to consumer, executive and investor confidence could do more damage to the economy than the tariffs. A Pew survey found 52 percent of Americans thought the tariffs would have a bad effect on the U.S. economy, and trade association CEOs say the baffling swirl of contradictory tariff news is “undermining long-term investment and growth,” language usually reserved for policies that attempt to ameliorate inequality or fund public goods (what the right often maligns as “socialism”). Falling consumer and investor sentiment, if sustained, will themselves have recessionary effects.

Further, the potential combination of recession, weak growth, and inflation means the Fed can't easily turn to its usual tool: interest rates. Normally the central bank cuts rates to boost the economy during recession, or raises them to cool off the system during high inflation, as in this last cycle. But with weak conditions and high prices, the bank is over a barrel, which, for all its many, many shortcomings, reduces an important institution's ability to help steer the ship away from disaster. Trump's threats to fire his first-term appointee, Fed President Jerome Powell, adds to the stress and is terrifying financial markets. The relative decline of U.S. dominance of global finance systems clears the way for the loose BRICS alliance of developing world countries to gradually build up their alternatives for development financing and payment clearance.

For all his endless spouting of “America First,” Trump really is the mortar of the BRICS.

The moves are already bringing retaliation against the U.S. by its trading partners, adding to recession pressures. The European Union had prepared a sturdy retaliation package of tariffs before a milder deal was reached. But the Chinese countermeasures are most important, including an “unreliable entities” list of Western firms barred from doing business with domestic Chinese firms. Further retaliation has taken simpler forms, like China steering its great soybean orders to feed its millions of chicken and swine to Brazil, as it did in Trump's first term.

More seriously, China has announced a new bureaucratic process for exports of extremely important raw materials and goods made from them. China produces and refines much of the world's rare earth metals, a small class of scarce chemical elements that are essential for a vast number of technological products, from car steering components to capacitors to lasers to computer chips. It produces 90 percent of the powerful magnets derived from these elements, some of which are used in EV motors and cruise missiles. Export licenses are now required to export these from China, and the system for these is in the early stages. The large U.S. industrial firms that need these materials may lay off workers once they exhaust their supplies.

This tactic more than any other appears to have precipitated the recent truce between the two countries, with the U.S. lowering its average tariff to 47 percent, although the duty now varies greatly by product category. China agreed to a looser rare earth review process, restrictions on exports of chemicals used in manufacturing fentanyl, and larger purchases of U.S. soybeans, which have been languishing in grain silos following China's shift in sourcing to Brazil.

China also has further economic weapons up its sleeve, but many of them are seen as too risky to the global trading system. These include heavily devaluing its own currency to take greater shares of world markets, or purposefully selling its mountain of U.S. Treasury bonds, which were bought with the years of large trade surpluses that vex the Trump administration.

Because many of the duties have been delayed or changed so many times, the full effects are taking time to express themselves in the broader economy. Important sectors like autos are just now feeling the pain of higher steel and aluminum costs, higher prices for parts, and White House threats against raising prices. As the Biden-era EV mandates end, car companies are beginning to retrench.

Attention to today's drastically lopsided wealth distribution and the oligopolistic corporate economy are needed if any gains from protectionism are to ever reach the average person on the street.

These twisted developments have been accompanied by a dramatic decline of the dollar, which normally would strengthen when tariffs are hiked. Instead there's been steep off-loading of bonds and dollars in currency markets, although these have partially recovered as the tariffs move up and down. The simultaneous sell-off of U.S. equities, Treasury bonds, and the dollar suggests a real, perhaps lasting change in how world investors view the formerly-ironclad economic stability of the U.S. “De-Americanization” is actually starting to be discussed in investment circles. The Wall Street Journal quotes a fund manager stating “U.S. exceptionalism has peaked.”

In particular, the drastic whiplashing of trade policy appears to be further eroding the status of the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency, which is used to collateralize trillions of dollars in world commodities trades. It is also jeopardizing the role of U.S. Treasury bond yields in guiding interest rates on trillions of dollars in loans worldwide, which means global investors may no longer buy up essentially any amount of U.S. bonds to finance our ever-widening budget deficits. Loss of this reserve status could one day sharply reduce capital flows into the the country and require far higher interest rates to compensate by making the U.S. a more attractive destination for globally-mobile capital.

It's uncharted territory, but for many American voters, the U.S. dollar's world reserve status is like their gall bladders — something they only hear about when it goes wrong.

In addition to the economic consequences, there's another downside to Trump's trade war: It's giving protectionism a bad name.

Make no mistake, Trump's trade policy won't work. The hyper-unpredictability of the policy moves is killing investor confidence, and will also limit the desired return of domestic production. State-of-the-art manufacturing plants can take three to five years to build, with costs ranging between tens of millions up to billions. Trump caved relatively quickly on the global “reciprocal” tariffs, lasting less than a week into negative coverage before he was moved once again, as in his first term and like most presidential administrations, by the gyrations of the markets.

In a further stunning act of contradictory foolishness, current sectoral tariffs cover not just the consumer goods that the administration wants made in the U.S., but also materials needed for capital goods, like steel and aluminum. These of course drive up the cost of essential capital goods made from them, from nails to screws and steel panels, pushing up the cost of factory-building goods. These tariffs on physical capital mean that even for companies that had already wanted to obey Trump and invest domestically, the costs are now so daunting that even phone assembly (let alone making all the components) is “way down the road now,” as a sourcing researcher put it.

But looking past these clownish blunderings, protectionism has a whole history as a legitimate and successful, if challenging to develop, policy tool. Its negative reputation predates Trump, thanks to the fact that its frequent political setting has been various forms of disgraceful authoritarianism, from the U.S. slave republic to the USSR to the Korean military dictatorship of the 1960s and 70s to U.S.-occupied Japan.

But we absolutely do not have to accept ugly hierarchical power-mongering to recognize that various forms of protectionist policies have played major roles in lifting up large populations from poverty, even though they are abhorrent to the average U.S. economist. Modern republics can use these tools to develop or further evolve their economies based on the expressed will of the public, and in settings that bring people to a greater level of internal equality as well. No amount of ham-fisted incompetent bungling from a hideous race-baiting billionaire can change that.

A conspicuous case is Japan, where the famous Ministry of International Trade and Industry was the center of the country's industrial policy as it rebuilt from being firebombed and nuked into oblivion by the U.S. in World War II. It led a complex system of subsidies, research grants, technology access, and trade barriers to rebuild the country into a cutting-edge industrial colossus. For years, aspiring Japanese prime ministers were expected to serve as MITI minister to prepare them for office.

When what became South Korea was recovering from its own annihilation in the Korean War, the U.S.-backed Park military dictatorship had a tight, state-led development regime, including trade barriers, investment in strategic sectors, and extensive restrictions on capital. In particular, forms of capital flight in the country were punishable by death. The ugly authoritarianism came alongside a successful national development program based on protectionism and state guidance, which could be argued to have helped created the minimal living standards that helped bring the large public movement that brought down the Park regime in 1979.

Protectionism though, even if done right, is nowhere near enough for actual improvements in the lot of the common family. Attention to today's drastically lopsided wealth distribution and the oligopolistic corporate economy are needed if any gains from protectionism are to ever reach the average person on the street. Considering the major social movements needed for these core economic issues to be addressed, through wealth confiscation and nationalization of monopolies, mere tariffs are a smaller lift.

Trump's reckless tariff flailing is a destructive turn by a declining power. Countries in decline relative to the influence and power of their rivals often lash out in ways they hope will preserve their power, but in fact hasten its decline — such as the Anglo-French war for the Sinai in 1956, or the Russo-Ukrainian War. Trump's clumsy planless blundering at trade barriers likely falls in this category.

Trade war is hell. Hellishly expensive, anyway.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","Racial Profiling Is ICE's New Norm. Activists Are Mobilizing in Response.","https://truthout.org/articles/racial-profiling-is-ices-new-norm-activists-are-mobilizing-in-response/","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 13:55:20 GMT","

Arizonans long endured grim racial profiling under SB 1070. Now the Supreme Court has greenlighted its use nationwide.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

When the Supreme Court overturned a temporary restraining order in September that kept U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials from questioning and detaining people based on their language, skin color, or occupation — effectively clearing the way for racial profiling — Guadalupe Cardona was not surprised.

Cardona is a member of Unión del Barrio, a national organization that has led resistance efforts against ICE and police violence since its inception in 1981.

Since the Trump administration took office — but especially in recent months — she has witnessed daily scenes of ICE snatching primarily Latino people off the streets and detaining them without identifying themselves or giving due process. When the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration's emergency request to expand ICE's use of racial profiling, Cardona knew it would empower ICE agents to ramp up their raids and kidnappings of community members even further.

“The communities that are being attacked are people who are keeping the world going, producing goods and foods, building things and providing services and doing all the things that are necessary in order for this nation to flourish and continue,” Cardona said.

To Reyna Montoya, founder and CEO of Aliento, an organization that works in Arizona to support immigrant families and Dreamers who came to the U.S. at a young age, the Supreme Court's order greenlighting ICE's racial profiling echoed a reality that people in her state had already lived through: the legalization of racial profiling by law enforcement in order to detain individuals they believed to be immigrants under SB 1070. During this time, from its implementation in 2010 to a settlement stripping several provisions in 2016, Black and Brown communities lived in fear, she said. 

When it was passed in 2010, SB 1070 was one of the harshest anti-immigrant laws in the country. Among other measures, it deputized law enforcement to carry out immigration enforcement by determining the immigration status of anyone they deemed suspicious — even U.S. citizens. Montoya says the law also emboldened people who already had racist ideas. She recalled getting “dirty looks” while speaking Spanish at a supermarket with her mother.

In another instance, Montoya told Truthout, an intern who worked with Aliento at the time said that her father was pulled over, even though he was an authorized resident, because he was Brown. She also heard that people in Latino communities were not reporting crimes — from domestic violence to shoplifting — because they did not trust law enforcement.

“These were stories that I grew up listening to at that time,” 34-year-old Montoya said.

The impacts of legalized racial profiling rippled out to the mental health of Arizona's young people. Cesar Escalante, a researcher at the University of Georgia, found that during the period SB 1070 was in place, youth in Arizona faced isolation, depression, anxiety, and eating disorders due to the stress of either being undocumented or being assumed to be undocumented. 

“Young [Latino] people who went to school, especially middle school and high school … were subjected to a lot of ostracism, labeling, and bullying,” Escalante said.

However, communities mobilized against the law, holding protests and boycotts across Arizona. Two years after the measure passed, the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to make it a crime if people failed to carry documentation to prove their immigration status and to outlaw police from arresting someone for believing them to be deportable. Further provisions to the law were stripped in 2016 when Arizona's then attorney general banned law enforcement from prolonging a stop based on immigration status, although the rule about allowing law enforcement to inquire about immigration status still lingers. 

Montoya is worried that history is repeating itself — only now it will be across the country, not just in Arizona.

“It is heartbreaking,” Montoya said. “Unfortunately, there's probably going to be increased discrimination among the Latino community, among other communities that may appear to look Latino.”

The Supreme Court's decision to greenlight ICE's racial profiling in September came in response to a lower court decision in California, Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem, that attempted to ban the use of racial profiling and roving patrols of ICE agents to detain people. In response to an “emergency request” from the Trump administration, the Supreme Court issued a quick order that overturned the ban, allowing ICE agents to arrest anyone they might deem to be an immigrant based on their language or skin color, without identifying themselves. In legal circles, these are now dubbed “Kavanaugh stops” after the Supreme Court justice claimed that legal residents are only briefly stopped and not arrested, despite lawsuits proving otherwise.

As the American Immigration Council noted at that time: “Crucially, this order is not a final ruling, but it strongly signals the Supreme Court will not uphold strict constitutional limits on the authority of immigration agents to stop and question people they suspect to be immigrants.”

Jorge Loweree, managing director of programs and strategy at the American Immigration Council, said the Supreme Court's recent decision is enormously consequential and could result in even more aggressive immigration raids across the country. Although he anticipates more litigation on this issue, the court's decision could still take years to overturn — during which a lot of damage could be done, he said.

Since Donald Trump began his second term in office, more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by ICE, reporting from ProPublica has found; the government does not track the number of citizens held by immigration agents, so the count could well exceed that number. Loweree is concerned that the ruling could worsen this threat.

“If we live in an environment where ICE can target people based on the way that they look, including U.S. citizens, that's a situation where no one in this country is safe from this sort of action,” Loweree said.

Loweree also noted that ICE is cutting corners during background checks of onboarding officers. These factors are emboldening ICE agents and “things are escalating seemingly every day with many different people impacted,” he said.

“All of this is a recipe for disaster, for some very ugly, negative outcomes impacting many people across the country, and it's all something that was facilitated by the Supreme Court.”

Still, community members have been vigilant. Mario Nodal, creator of Unidos Podemos, a bilingual Instagram page, has spent the last months documenting ICE kidnappings and raids across the country by sharing crowd-sourced videos. 

He said the ICE raids and Supreme Court ruling are very concerning. While Unidos Podemos originally started as a page to uplift Mexican American culture, it quickly turned into a platform to raise awareness about ICE activity after the Trump administration took office.

“People are just doing their job,” Nodal said. “They're just out there doing what they need to do to survive, and ICE just pulls up on them, simply because of how they look and how they sound, and just takes them away. They don't identify themselves. They don't show their faces.”

Nodal said it is important to document the raids and their intensity. People have messaged him about families being separated, neighbors being profiled, and people being afraid to go to work or even leave their homes.

“It's impossible to ignore what is happening,” Nodal said. “There are thousands of videos just showing abuse, discrimination, and just racial profiling.”

“In this moment, there is a beautiful hope that exists in this solidarity and that people are standing up for what is right. There are people out there that care and that are organizing to defend rights, and that's what they are — their rights.”

Nodal shares fundraiser campaigns of people who are impacted by ICE raids. He also said it is important to continue celebrating Latino culture and honoring the sacrifices that have been made to make a life in the U.S.

“In the midst of all of this, we're still trying to push that culture, like Día de los Muertos, still trying to push it in front of people that don't like us, people that hate us, like ‘We don't care, you're gonna see our culture, you're gonna see who we are,'” Nodal said. “We're still here. This is who we are, you're not just gonna get rid of us.”

Cardona said her organization has also been proactive in fighting back against ICE activity. She said Unión del Barrio has been doing “know your rights” workshops and training people on how to spot ICE and report to the community when they do see them. Like Nodal, Cardona also said it is important to document ICE raids and kidnappings to help people understand what they have been seeing and the way ICE goes about these operations.

Advocates have also been organizing patrols and responding to reported ICE activity. Cardona said there have been many instances where community members in Los Angeles have been able to chase ICE agents away and prevent people from being detained.

“We know that less happens to people when there's large numbers of community members, when the agents are outnumbered in large quantities,” Cardona said.

Unión del Barrio also encourages people not to walk on the street by themselves, to stay in large crowds, and to use their right to stay silent, so that it's impossible to distinguish if there's anyone in the group who's undocumented. 

“In this moment, there is a beautiful hope that exists in this solidarity and that people are standing up for what is right,” Cardona said. “There are people out there that care and that are organizing to defend rights, and that's what they are — their rights. These are human rights and civil rights that are being infringed upon. I'm very proud of how community members, community organizers, and of course, my organizations have stood up in defense of our people.”

ICE wants to build a public-private surveillance loop that transforms everyday online activity into potential evidence.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

When most people think about immigration enforcement, they picture border crossings and airport checkpoints. But the new front line may be your social media feed.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has published a request for information for private-sector contractors to launch a round-the-clock social media monitoring program. The request states that private contractors will be paid to comb through “Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Tumblr, Instagram, VK, Flickr, Myspace, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, Reddit, WhatsApp, YouTube, etc.,” turning public posts into enforcement leads that feed directly into ICE's databases.

The request for information reads like something out of a cyber thriller: dozens of analysts working in shifts, strict deadlines measured in minutes, a tiered system of prioritizing high-risk individuals, and the latest software keeping constant watch.

I am a researcher who studies the intersection of data governance, digital technologies and the U.S. federal government. I believe that the ICE request for information also signals a concerning if logical next step in a longer trend, one that moves the U.S. border from the physical world into the digital.

ICE already searches social media using a service called SocialNet that monitors most major online platforms. The agency has also contracted with Zignal Labs for its AI-powered social media monitoring system.

The Customs and Border Protection agency also searches social media posts on the devices of some travelers at ports of entry, and the U.S. State Department reviews social media posts when foreigners seek visas to enter the United States.

What would change isn't only the scale of monitoring but its structure. Instead of government agents gathering evidence case by case, ICE is building a public-private surveillance loop that transforms everyday online activity into potential evidence.

Private contractors would be tasked with scraping publicly available data to collecting messages, including posts and other media and data. The contractors would be able to correlate those findings with data in commercial datasets from brokers such as LexisNexis Accurint and Thomson Reuters CLEAR along with government-owned databases. Analysts would be required to produce dossiers for ICE field offices within tight deadlines — sometimes just 30 minutes for a high-priority case.

Those files don't exist in isolation. They feed directly into Palantir Technologies' Investigative Case Management system, the digital backbone of modern immigration enforcement. There, this social media data would join a growing web of license plate scans, utility records, property data and biometrics, creating what is effectively a searchable portrait of a person's life.

Officially, ICE says its data collection would focus on people who are already linked to ongoing cases or potential threats. In practice, the net is far wider.

The danger here is that when one person is flagged, their friends, relatives, fellow organizers or any of their acquaintances can also become subjects of scrutiny. Previous contracts for facial recognition tools and location tracking have shown how easily these systems expand beyond their original scope. What starts as enforcement can turn into surveillance of entire communities.

ICE frames the project as modernization: a way to identify a target's location by identifying aliases and detecting patterns that traditional methods might miss. Planning documents say contractors cannot create fake profiles and must store all analysis on ICE servers.

But history suggests these kinds of guardrails often fail. Investigations have revealed how informal data-sharing between local police and federal agents allowed ICE to access systems it wasn't authorized to use. The agency has repeatedly purchased massive datasets from brokers to sidestep warrant requirements. And despite a White House freeze on spyware procurement, ICE quietly revived a contract with Paragon's Graphite tool, software reportedly capable of infiltrating encrypted apps such as WhatsApp and Signal.

Meanwhile, ICE's vendor ecosystem keeps expanding: Clearview AI for face matching, ShadowDragon's SocialNet for mapping networks, Babel Street's location history service Locate X, and LexisNexis for looking up people. ICE is also purchasing tools from surveillance firm PenLink that combine location data with social media data. Together, these platforms make continuous, automated monitoring not only possible but routine.

The United States isn't alone in government monitoring of social media. In the United Kingdom, a new police unit tasked with scanning online discussions about immigration and civil unrest has drawn criticism for blurring the line between public safety and political policing.

Across the globe, spyware scandals have shown how lawful access tools that were initially justified for counterterrorism were later used against journalists and activists. Once these systems exist, mission creep, also known as function creep, becomes the rule rather than the exception.

Around-the-clock surveillance doesn't just gather information — it also changes behavior.

Research found that visits to Wikipedia articles on terrorism dropped sharply immediately after revelations about the National Security Agency's global surveillance in June 2013.

For immigrants and activists, the stakes are higher. A post about a protest or a joke can be reinterpreted as “intelligence.” Knowing that federal contractors may be watching in real time encourages self-censorship and discourages civic participation. In this environment, the digital self, an identity composed of biometric markers, algorithmic classifications, risk scores and digital traces, becomes a risk that follows you across platforms and databases.

What is genuinely new is the privatization of interpretation. ICE isn't just collecting more data, it is outsourcing judgment to private contractors. Private analysts, aided by artificial intelligence, are likely to decide what online behavior signals danger and what doesn't. That decision-making happens rapidly and across large numbers of people, for the most part beyond public oversight.

At the same time, the consolidation of data means social media content can now sit beside location and biometric information inside Palantir's hub. Enforcement increasingly happens through data correlations, raising questions about due process.

ICE's request for information is likely to evolve into a full procurement contract within months, and recent litigation from the League of Women Voters and the Electronic Privacy Information Center against the Department of Homeland Security suggests that the oversight is likely to lag far behind the technology. ICE's plan to maintain permanent watch floors, open indoor spaces equipped with video and computer monitors, that are staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year signals that this likely isn't a temporary experiment and instead is a new operational norm.

Transparency starts with public disclosure of the algorithms and scoring systems ICE uses. Advocacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union argue that law enforcement agencies should meet the same warrant standards online that they do in physical spaces. The Brennan Center for Justice and the ACLU argue that there should be independent oversight of surveillance systems for accuracy and bias. And several U.S. senators have introduced legislation to limit bulk purchases from data brokers.

Without checks like these, I believe that the boundary between border control and everyday life is likely to keep dissolving. As the digital border expands, it risks ensnaring anyone whose online presence becomes legible to the system.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","A crucial system of ocean currents may be on course to collapse. This country just declared it a national security threat","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/15/climate/iceland-warming-current-amoc-collapse-threat","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 12:00:01 GMT","


            Iceland's relatively mild climate is shaped by a crucial network of currents that winds its away around the Atlantic Ocean transporting heat northward — without it, the island would be much icier and stormier. As evidence mounts these currents could be on course for collapse, Iceland's government has made the unusual move of designating the risk a national security threat, prompting a a high-level response into how to prepare for this “existential threat.”
    


            “Our climate, economy and security are deeply tied to the stability of the ocean currents around us,” said Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson, Iceland's Minister for Environment, Energy and Climate.
    


            The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation — known as the AMOC — is a looping system of currents that works like a giant conveyor belt, pulling warm water from the Southern Hemisphere and tropics to the Northern Hemisphere, where it cools, sinks and flows back south.
    


            When scientists are asked which potential climate impact terrifies them most, the collapse of the AMOC is often top of the list.
    


            A growing body of research points to the AMOC slowing down, as higher global temperatures disrupt the delicate balance of heat and salinity on which its strength relies. The science is still unsettled on the likelihood and timing of any collapse, but some studies have projected it could be on course to happen this century.
    


            A shutdown of the AMOC “cannot be considered a low likelihood risk anymore in view of the evolving science over the past years,” said Stefan Rahmstorf, a physical oceanographer and climatologist who has studied the AMOC at Potsdam University in Germany.
    


Scientists mapped what happens if a crucial system of ocean currents collapses. The weather impact would be extreme



            The impacts would be catastrophic — ushering in huge global weather and climate shifts, including rising sea levels in parts of the US and Europe, disrupted monsoon systems affecting countries in Asia and Africa, and a winter deep freeze in Europe, with sea ice potentially creeping southward as far as the United Kingdom.
    


            Iceland “would be close to the center of a serious regional cooling,” meaning the country could be surrounded by sea ice, Rahmstorf told CNN.
    


            It's an “an existential threat,” Jóhannsson told CNN. The AMOC regulates Iceland's weather, and its collapse could devastate infrastructure, transport and vital industries including fishing, he said.
    


            Jóhannsson briefed the government on the latest science after research published in August raised “grave concerns” about the AMOC's future stability. In September, Iceland's National Security Council designated the current's potential collapse as a national security risk, marking the first time a climate impact has received this designation in the country.
    


            The decision “reflects the seriousness of the issue and ensures that the matter gets the attention it deserves,” Jóhannsson said. In practice, the designation will mean a high-level, coordinated government response to understand the threat and work out how to prevent and mitigate the worst consequences, he said.
    


            Rahmstorf commended Iceland for its decision and said other countries should follow suit. The impacts of an AMOC collapse would be felt across the globe. Scientists are trying to understand the full range of potential impacts on societies and economies, but research has pointed to destroyed crops and catastrophic flooding.
    


            Iceland's decision marks a shift in how the country understands climate risks, Jóhannsson said.
    


            “What we do know is that the current climate might change so drastically that it could become impossible for us to adapt,” he said. “In short, this is not just a scientific concern — it's a matter of national survival and security.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Trump likely to face long military commitment and chaos if he ousts Maduro in Venezuela, experts say","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/trump-maduro-removal-venezuela","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 10:00:01 GMT","


            President Donald Trump has said he believes Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's days are numbered, and that land strikes inside Venezuela are possible.
    


            Experts say that the US doesn't currently have the military assets in place to launch a largescale operation to remove Maduro from power, though Trump has approved covert action within Venezuela, CNN has reported.
    


            But if Trump did order strikes inside Venezuela aimed at ousting Maduro, he could face serious challenges with fractured opposition elements and a military poised for insurgency, according to experts, as well as political backlash at home for a president who promised to avoid costly entanglements overseas.
    


            CNN reported that Trump received a briefing earlier this week to review updated options for military action inside Venezuela, a concept the White House has been weighing. The administration had not made a decision on whether to launch strikes, CNN reported, though the US military has moved more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops into the region as part of what the Pentagon branded Operation Southern Spear in an announcement Thursday.
    


            The concentration of military assets and threats of further attacks beyond the ongoing drug boat campaign have served to increase pressure on Maduro, with administration officials saying he needs to leave office while arguing that he's closely tied to the Tren de Aragua gang and leading drug trafficking efforts.
    


            But if Maduro does flee Venezuela or is killed out in a targeted strike, experts worry about a military takeover of the country or the boosting of another dictator similar to Maduro.
    


            There are other members of the Venezuelan Chavismo, the leftist political ideology of former Cuban leader Hugo Chavez that Maduro has championed, who could take the reins and subject the country to even harsher rule, experts and former officials said.
    


            “Maduro has said something to the effect of, ‘You want to get rid of me? You think things will get better?' It is something to consider because Maduro is a moderate inside the Chavismo, and someone else could usurp power instead of the opposition with the backing of the military,” said Juan Gonzalez, a resident fellow at the Georgetown Americas Institute who was a former Biden administration official focused on the region.
    


            Another possibility would be a military takeover.
    


            “If the military is still cohesive, and I don't think we see any evidence it is not, they will not collapse because there is a challenge to or an ouster of Maduro,” said John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser in his first term. “They will follow their discipline, assert military control, and suppress anyone who goes into the streets.”
    


            Maduro, whose inner circle is made up of both civilians and military officers who are often in competition with each other, is known to have tight control over his administration and has helped stabilize competing factions. External forces, like Colombian insurgent groups who regularly operate from Venezuela or criminal syndicates linked to cocaine, gold and mineral trafficking further complicate the picture.
    


            Were Maduro to disappear, these pulls could tear the nation apart – descending into a potential civil war, experts said.
    


            “Whether you like it or not, Maduro is the guarantor of the equilibrium,” said a Western diplomat who has spent years in Venezuela, asking to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss with the press. “Everyone knows he's been politically dead since last year's election, but if he leaves there's nobody who can maintain the status quo … so they all close ranks around him.”
    


            The Trump administration may hope that Venezuelan opposition figures would be able to step into a power vacuum created by the removal of Maduro, something that the first Trump administration considered as it propped up Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido after a 2018 election victory for Maduro that was decried internationally as rigged. That first Trump administration officially recognized Guaido as the legitimate leader of Venezuela in 2019, but a failed coup attempt that year meant he never managed to take power.
    


            One current Venezuelan opposition group led by Edmundo Gonzalez, who ran for president last year in an election that the US said Maduro lost, says it has a 100-hour plan to transition the power of Venezuela's government from Maduro to Gonzalez. But experts say that they would be unable to succeed in the short-term or in the long-term without sustained US support – and potentially US boots on the ground.
    


            “The idea that a member of the opposition would be able to rule almost immediately is impossible. There is no way to guarantee their safety or ability to govern without the US providing security,”  Juan Gonzalez said. “Everyone is viewing removing Maduro as the end but it's really just the beginning of what would be a long, drawn-out process.”
    


            US officials have also said that Edmuondo Gonzalez, who is currently residing in Spain, is the rightful leader of Venezuela, based on the results of last year's election. The US has provided limited support to another Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who went into hiding in the country after the election. The assistance includes support, like gaining access to secure communication capabilities, former US officials said.
    


            But in order to keep any of the potential opposition leaders in power the type of support needed from the US would go beyond providing a secure device – there would need to be assistance in reconstructing the army, unfreezing Venezuelan government funds and training their police force, experts said.
    


            The opposition's enemies inside Venezuela are not limited to Maduro himself, which is why such sustained outside support is seen as a necessity, experts said. The opposition would face hostilities from the Venezuelan military; pro-government paramilitary groups known as colectivos; the National Liberation Army (known as the ELN), which is a Colombian guerilla group that currently has safe haven in the country; and other active criminal groups.
    


            It is unclear how much support Trump would be willing to give any opposition leader who seeks to take the presidency from Maduro. But that support would need to be sustained, officials said, to fend off a failed state.
    


            Such an extended US military involvement runs the risk of upsetting the political coalition that propelled Trump into office on promises of keeping America out of overseas wars.
    


            “The American people did not vote for Trump to draw the US into a sustained conflict in Latin America. On that basis securing Trump's commitment to long-lasting support for the opposition is likely to be a challenge,” said a GOP congressional staffer. “And without that support, this won't work.”
    


            Still, if Trump backs away from a potential opportunity to oust Maduro now, some believe it could be viewed as a lost opportunity.
    


            “Trump is calling Maduro a narcoterrorist and a drug trafficker, and has assembled a huge armada. If he backs down now and Maduro survives, there goes all the ‘new Monroe Doctrine' talk and the idea of being supreme in our own hemisphere.” said Elliott Abrams, a former senior State Department official in Trump's first term.
    


            Even while some say that displacing Maduro could be done without US troops on the ground for an extended period, they say that the US commitment following any kinetic strikes needs to be long-lasting or else the effort could easily fall apart.
    


            “If the force is decisive it can disband a full army. But whatever is done cannot be done with a short-term perspective. The use of force needs to create a result and be connected to a political solution with US support, and planning for that support for 5-10 years,” said a regional diplomat.
    


            The Maduro regime is propped up in different ways by Russia, China and Cuba. Experts worry that if US strikes hit assets of those nations the conflict could quickly escalate. While it is unlikely that any of those nations would send their troops to the region to defend against US strikes, it is possible that the effect of US strikes inside Venezuela could be blunted by the support those countries provide to the regime.
    


            All three nations have invested in the Venezuelan regime and have instruments that they could bring to bear to prevent Maduro's ouster, experts said.
    


            This is something that has happened in the past.
    


            “In 2019, the opposition thought that the Cubans had uncovered what they were trying to do with their coup attempt and believe that they made moves to undermine their efforts,” Bolton said.
    


            Further expanding the problem could be a move by Maduro to hit US assets in the region – before the US makes any move to directly oust him.
    


            “There is a chance that if Maduro thinks he is going down he might make a move to hit something the US cares about, such as oil platforms in the Caribbean Sea. It could be a gamble he may be willing to take that would harm US interests in the region,” said Henry Ziemer, a regional expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
    


            Publicly the Trump administration continues to point to its buildup of military assets in Latin America as supremely focused on counter-drug operations – not an ouster of Maduro. Experts have also previously told CNN that the assembled hardware and troops aren't enough for a full-scale invasion.
    


            Still, when asked earlier this month if the US might get into a war with Venezuela, Trump gave an ambiguous answer, saying: “I doubt it. I don't think so.”

            As she oversaw President Donald Trump's emergency Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, case this past week, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson once again proved she isn't beholden to Supreme Court custom.
    


            The least senior justice, who has been the court's most consistent critic of the second Trump administration, appeared to be sending signals not only about the technicalities of the SNAP case but also more subtle messages about the way the court has handled a litany of short-fuse appeals on its emergency docket this year dealing with presidential power.
    


            She did all that, oddly enough, by siding with Trump.
    


            “She's modeling the way that the emergency docket should be used,” said Elizabeth Wydra, the president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center.
    


            Since joining the court three years ago, Jackson has drawn attention for a sharp pen. That has been particularly notable in a series of cutting dissents she has written this year calling out the Trump administration for what she has framed as “lawlessness.” And she has not spared her colleagues for acquiescing to the White House in some of those decisions.
    


            “This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist,” Jackson wrote in August when the court allowed the Trump administration to halt about $800 million in research grants. “Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this administration always wins.”
    


            That pointed prose and her unflinching willingness to criticize her colleagues has made Jackson, who was nominated to the bench by former President Joe Biden, a divisive figure.
    


Examining Brown v. Board, race and ‘equal protection' through the eyes of the modern Supreme Court



            “Even before the SNAP case, Justice Jackson had already emerged as the most vocal, most frequent, and sharpest critic of the majority's inconsistent, difficult-to-justify, and often unjustified behavior in Trump-related cases,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
    


            Her machinations in the case, Vladeck said, underscored “a justice who is using every possible strategic and tactical maneuver behind the scenes to try to push the court toward what she believes the right answer is, but who is unafraid of sending increasingly loud public signals when those efforts are, as they so often have been this year, ultimately for naught.”
    


            The appeal on funding for SNAP emerged as the highest-profile legal case of the government shutdown. A lower court ordered the US Department of Agriculture to transfer $4 billion from another fund to pay full SNAP benefits for November – an order that the administration appealed as an overreach of judicial power.
    


            With a midnight deadline approaching – and benefits for more than 40 million Americans hanging in the balance – the case landed in a rush at the Supreme Court on a Friday evening. Trump wanted the justices to temporarily block the lower court order, known as a “stay.”
    


            Because she handles emergency appeals from the Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals, the case went to Jackson. The “circuit justice” generally plays a straightforward role, setting a briefing schedule and – in big cases – ultimately referring the matter to the full court. 



            But as he has raced up to the Supreme Court this year in case after case, Trump has been asking for something else as well: An even shorter-term order known as an “administrative stay,” which freezes the lower court decision while the justices review the written arguments in the case.
    


            That administrative decision, usually, rests with the assigned justice – in this case, Jackson.
    


            A former trial court judge who recently took up boxing as a way to relieve stress, Jackson ultimately granted Trump's request, a move that initially raised anxiety among liberals and cheers from conservatives on social media. But Jackson also took several steps that were a departure from how other justices have handled administrative stays.
    


            First, Jackson included a few paragraphs of written explanation in her order, breaking from the boilerplate-only language usually found in administrative stays. She wrote that she was granting Trump's request “to facilitate” the appeals court's “expeditious resolution” of the appeal.
    


            The Supreme Court has faced enormous criticism this year for regularly overturning lower court orders on its emergency docket without explanation. While there are sometimes good reasons for brevity in those cases, some justices – such as Justice Elena Kagan – have said the court could provide a little more explanation.
    


            Second, rather than leaving the timing open-ended, Jackson set her administrative order to lift 48 hours after the appeals court ruled.
    


            Jackson likely understood – or at least assumed – there would be a majority to grant Trump's request if she didn't do so. By granting it herself but limiting the timeline, rather than sending it to the full court, she had the effect of bringing the case back to her chambers for a second look in an unusually short order, Vladeck wrote in widely circulated post over the weekend.
    


            Wydra said Jackson handled the case as should be done on the emergency docket. Justices, she said, should deal with the requests “quickly, as transparently as possible, and for logistical reasons, not…make what amount to significant substantive decisions.”
    


            Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston who also wrote about Jackson's maneuvers, agreed that she appeared to be going “her own way.”
    


            “She has a clear vision of how she wants the shadow docket to be run,” Blackman said.

            But, he suggested, it ultimately didn't work. In the end, as Congress drew closer to an agreement to fund the government, the full court extended her administrative stay for a few days without writing to explain why. Jackson wound up in dissent, which she also registered without explanation. And the Trump administration ultimately got what it wanted. 



Trump signed the spending measure late Wednesday, reopening the federal government and funding the food program. Hours later, the Department of Justice sent a letter to the Supreme Court noting that it was abandoning its appeal – an anticlimactic end to a case that had significant real-world consequences.
    


            On Thursday, as the court announced it was reopening its doors to the public, a single line was added to the docket in the SNAP appeal: “Application withdrawn.”

            President Donald Trump's administration said on Friday it was formally withdrawing a plan by his predecessor to require airlines to pay passengers cash compensation when US flight disruptions are caused by carriers.
    


            In December 2024, the US Transportation Department under then-President Joe Biden sought public comment on writing rules to require airlines to pay $200 to $300 for domestic delays of at least three hours and up to $775 for longer delays.
    


            In September, USDOT first disclosed it planned to withdraw the proposal. On Friday, USDOT said the rules would result in “unnecessary regulatory burdens” in explaining why it would not go forward.
    


            Last month, a group of 18 Democratic senators urged the Trump administration not to drop the compensation plan.
    


            “This is a common-sense proposal: when an airline's mistake imposes unanticipated costs on families, the airline should try to remedy the situation by providing accommodations to consumers and helping cover their costs,” said the letter signed by Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal, Maria Cantwell, Ed Markey and others.
    


            Airlines in the US must refund passengers for canceled flights, but are not required to compensate customers for delays. The European Union, Canada, Brazil and Britain all have airline delay compensation rules. No large US airline currently guarantees cash compensation for significant flight disruption.
    


Biden administration will propose rule requiring airlines to compensate passengers for canceled or delayed flights



            USDOT said Friday in abandoning the compensation plan that it would “allow airlines to compete on the services and compensation that they provide to passengers rather than imposing new minimum requirements for these services and compensation through regulation, which would impose significant costs on airlines.”
    


            USDOT also announced in September it was considering rescinding Biden regulations requiring airlines and ticket agents to disclose service fees alongside airfares.
    


            It also plans to reduce regulatory burdens on airlines and ticket agents by writing new rules detailing the definition of a flight cancellation that entitles consumers to ticket refunds, as well as revisiting rules on ticket pricing and advertising.
    


            Airlines have pushed the Trump administration to go further and praised the action to rescind the Biden plan.

MIAMI (AP) — In justifying American military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs, President Donald Trump has asserted that the longtime U.S. strategy of interdicting such vessels at sea has been a major failure.

“We've been doing that for 30 years,” he said last month, “and it's been totally ineffective.”

Trump's comments came around the same time that the U.S. Coast Guard announced it had set a record for cocaine seizures — a haul of 225 metric tons of the drug over the previous year. That milestone, however, has not dissuaded the Republican president from upending decades of U.S. counternarcotics policy. 

Under Trump, the U.S. military has blown up 20 suspected drug boats, resulting in 80 deaths, in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Trump and other top officials have contended that such boats are being operated by narco-terrorists and cartel members with deadly drugs bound for America.

The strikes have generated international pushback from foreign leaders, human rights groups, Democrats and some Republicans who have raised concerns that the United States is engaging in extrajudicial killings that undermine its stature in the world.

Veterans of the drug war, meanwhile, say U.S. resources would be better spent doubling down on the traditional approach of interdicting drug boats, especially in the long term. That is because crews of drug boats frequently have valuable intelligence that can help authorities better target cartels and trafficking networks. Dead men, they say, tell no tales.




The Coast Guard for decades has interdicted small vessels suspected of smuggling illicit narcotics. Much of that work is focused on halting shipments of cocaine, most of which is produced in the jungles of Colombia.

Working with partner nations and other federal agencies — the Drug Enforcement Administration, the departments of State and Justice as well as U.S. Southern Command's Joint Interagency Task Force-South in Key West, Florida — the aim is to inflict heavy losses on traffickers and limit the amount of drugs entering the U.S.

That campaign, by at least one measure, has never been more successful, despite constant complaints by the Coast Guard that it lacks funding to seize even more drugs.

The Coast Guard's recent record cocaine seizure was almost 40% higher than the past decade's annual average. The haul included 38 tons of cocaine offloaded by the cutter Hamilton when it returned from a two-month patrol. It was the largest amount confiscated by a single Coast Guard ship during a deployment, the Coast Guard reported. The interdictions have continued as part of what's known as Operation Pacific Viper even during the federal government shutdown, with several cutters reporting major seizures last month.

In almost every case, drug smugglers have been brought to the U.S. for prosecution, and valuable information about ever-changing smuggling routes and production methods was collected — all without any loss of life and a far lower cost to American taxpayers. Experts said each missile strike is likely to cost far more than the payload of cocaine on every ship.

“The Coast Guard has extraordinary powers and authorities to do effective drug interdiction without killing unidentified people on small boats,” said Douglas Farah, a national security expert on Latin America and president of IBI Consultants. “When resourced, they are far more effective, sustainable and likely legal than the current Pentagon-led operations.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio this week defended the shift in strategy, saying that “interdictions alone are not effective.”

“Interdictions have limited to no deterrent effect,” he added. “These drug organizations, they've already baked in the fact they may lose 5% of their drug shipments. It doesn't stop them from coming.”

Part of the problem is that demand for cocaine is high, and supplies have never been so robust, according to authorities and experts. A sign of that trend: Cocaine prices have been hovering at historical lows for more than a decade.

The Coast Guard also does not have enough vessels or crew to halt it all. At most, it seizes not even 10% of the cocaine that officials believe flows to the U.S. on small vessels through what is known as the “Transit Zone” — a vast area of open water larger than Russia.

Cocaine shipments bound for the U.S. primarily work their way up the west coast of South America to Central America and then overland into the U.S. via Mexico. Shipments heading to Europe are smuggled through the Caribbean, often hidden in container ships.

In social media posts, Trump has claimed that his strikes have blown up boats carrying fentanyl and that each destroyed vessel has saved 25,000 American lives. According to experts and former U.S. counternarcotics officials, Trump's statements are either exaggerations or false.

For the past decade, U.S. officials have sounded the alarm about rising overdose deaths in the U.S., particularly from opioids and synthetic opioids. Overdose deaths from opioids peaked in 2023 at 112,000 but dropped to 74,000 in April. Experts have attributed that decline mostly to Biden administration efforts to boost the availability of lifesaving drugs that prevent overdose deaths.

The drug flowing to the U.S. from South America is cocaine. Fentanyl, on the other hand, is typically trafficked to the U.S. overland from Mexico, where it is produced with chemicals imported from China and India. Cocaine overdose deaths are less frequent than those from fentanyl. In the last year, just under 20,000 people in America died from cocaine overdoses, federal data shows. 

Trump and administration officials have also claimed that the crews of targeted vessels were narco-terrorists or members of cartels.

The Associated Press visited a region in Venezuela from which some of the suspected boats have departed and identified four men who were killed in the strikes. In dozens of interviews, residents of the region and relatives said t he dead men were mostly laborers or fisherman making $500 a trip. 

Law enforcement officials and experts echoed those findings, saying the smugglers captured by the Coast Guard are hired for little money to ferry drugs from point A to point B. 

“They are hardly kingpins,” said Kendra McSweeney, an Ohio State University geographer who has spent years researching U.S. drug policies.

In April, months before Trump launched his military campaign, his attorney general, Pam Bondi, traveled to South Florida to welcome home the Coast Guard cutter James from its latest antinarcotics patrol. It had seized 20 tons of cocaine worth more than $500 million.

Flanked by FBI Director Kash Patel, she praised a “prosecutor-led, intelligence driven approach to stopping these criminal enterprises in their tracks.” 

“This is not a drop in the bucket,” said Bondi, standing in front of the vessel loaded with colorful, plastic-wrapped bales of narcotics stacked several feet high. “Behind you is half a billion dollars of pure, uncut cocaine.”

The U.S. Commerce Department has launched an antidumping review targeting Italian pasta, which could lead to a 92% duty on top of an existing 15% tariff from the Trump administration.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Steel: 50%. Copper: 50%. Cars: up to 25%. But an even bigger Trump-era levy looms: 107 % on Italian pasta. 

Mamma mia.

It started with the U.S. Commerce Department launching what it says was a routine antidumping review, based on allegations Italian pasta makers sold product into the US at below-market prices and undercut local competitors. That has led to a threat of 92% duties, which would come on top of the 15% tariff President Donald Trump's administration imposed on European exports generally.

The news sent shockwaves through Italy, where 13 producers would be subject to the whopping one-two punch. They say sales in their second biggest export market would shrivel if prices to American consumers more than double. And while the measure would hardly prompt pasta shortages, it still has perplexed importers like Sal Auriemma, whose shop in Philadelphia's Italian market, Claudio Specialty Food, has been operating for over 60 years.

“Pasta is a pretty small sector to pick on. I mean, there's a lot bigger things to pick on,” said Auriemma, pointing to luxury items as an alternative. 

But pasta? “It's basic food,” he said. “Something's got to be sacred.”




Italy is a nation of avid pasta eaters. Less known is that most of the tortellini, spaghetti and rigatoni its factories churn out gets sent abroad. The U.S. accounts for about 15% of its €4 billion ($4.65 billion) in exports, making it Italy's largest market after Germany, data from farmers' association Coldiretti show. 

The punitive pasta premium has become a cause célèbre for Italy's politicians, executives and economists. Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida told lawmakers in mid-October that the government was working with the European Commission and engaging in diplomatic efforts, while supporting the companies' legal actions to oppose U.S. sanctions.

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic addressed reporters in Rome last month, stressing the lack of evidence backing the U.S. decision and calling the combined 107% levy “unacceptable.”

Margherita Mastromauro, president of the pasta makers sector of Unione Italiana Food, told The Associated Press that prices for Italian pasta in the U.S. remain high, and certainly higher than American-made rivals — undermining any dumping claim.

She said that the measures could deal a fatal blow to small- and medium-sized producers. Lucio Miranda, president of consultancy group Export USA, agreed.

“A duty rate of 107% would definitely kill this flow of export,” Miranda, who is Italian, said by phone from New York. “It's not going to be something that you can just dump on the consumer and move on, life continues. It will definitely be a deal killer.”

The Commerce Department's investigation started in 2024 after complaints from Missouri-based 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, which owns pasta brand Ronzoni, and Illinois-based Winland Foods, whose multiple brands include Prince, Mueller's and Wacky Mac.

The office's review focused on La Molisana and Garofalo, chosen as primary respondents because they are Italy's two largest exporters, the Commerce Department said in an emailed statement. Any sale price below either producers' costs or the price they charge in the Italian market would be considered dumping, in line with numerous other reviews of Italian pasta since 1996, it said. 

The two companies presented information incorrectly or withheld it, significantly impeding analysis, according to the Commerce Department. And in the face of these alleged deficiencies, the office presented its 92% duty estimate, which it extended to 11 other companies based on an assumption the two companies' behavior was representative.

“After they screwed up their initial responses, the Commerce Department explained to them what the problems were and asked them to fix those problems; they didn't,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in an emailed response to the AP's questions. “And then Commerce communicated the requirements again, and they didn't answer for a third time.” 

La Molisana declined to comment when contacted by the AP. Garofalo didn't respond to a request for comment. 

The sanctions would be applied not just to imports going forward, but also the 12 months through June 2024, according to the Commerce Department. It added that only 16% of total Italian pasta imports may be affected. Its final decision is scheduled for Jan. 2, which could be extended by 60 days.

A little over an hour's drive northeast from Naples is Benevento, a sleepy hilltop town of 55,000 people famed for its ancient Roman theater and Aglianico red wine. It's also home to Pasta Rummo, founded in 1846, which prides itself on its seven-phase, “slow work” production method. 

CEO Cosimo Rummo is outraged by the threat to his company's annual 20 million euros in exports to the U.S.

“These tariffs are completely senseless,” Rummo said in a phone interview. “These are fast-moving consumer goods … Who would ever buy a pack of pasta that costs 10 dollars, the same price as a bottle of wine?”

He added that he has no intention to start producing pasta stateside, as some companies have done and so would be spared the prospective levy. That includes Barilla, which for decades has been the main Italian pasta brand in the U.S. and now has large-scale production facilities there. 

When the transatlantic imbroglio started simmering, Robert Tramonte of Arlington, Virginia sought assurances. The owner of The Italian Store called his supplier, who told him there's enough pasta inventory stocked in the warehouse to keep prices steady until Easter. 

Tramonte's clients count on him for top-shelf product and he was relieved that, at least for the time being, they won't have to shell out for the real deal. Or worse -- perish the thought! -- purchase made-in-America pasta.

“They've tried to make Italian products and use the same ingredients, but the source wasn't Italy,” he said. “And they just didn't taste the same.”

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — New data the Agriculture Department released Friday created serious doubts about whether China will really buy millions of bushels of American soybeans like the Trump administration touted last month after a high-stakes meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

The USDA report released after the government reopened showed only two Chinese purchases of American soybeans since the summit in South Korea that totaled 332,000 metric tons. That's well short of the 12 million metric tons that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said China agreed to purchase by January and nowhere near the 25 million metric tons she said they would buy in each of the next three years.

American farmers were hopeful that their biggest customer would resume buying their crops. But CoBank's Tanner Ehmke, who is its lead economist for grains and oilseed, said there isn't much incentive for China to buy from America right now because they have plenty of soybeans on hand that they have bought from Brazil and other South American countries this year, and the remaining tariffs ensure that U.S. soybeans remain more expensive than Brazilian beans. 

“We are still not even close to what has been advertised from the U.S. in terms of what the agreement would have been,” Ehmke said.

Beijing has yet to confirm any detailed soybean purchase agreement but only that the two sides have reached “consensus” on expanding trade in farm products. Ehmke said that even if China did promise to buy American soybeans it may have only agreed to buy them if the price was attractive.

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Trump said his team spoke with Chinese officials today and they assured the White House they would be purchasing more soybeans, but he didn't offer any details of how much.




“They're in the process of doing not only a little bit but they'll be doing a lot of soybean purchases,” he told reporters.

The Chinese tariff on American beans remains high at about 24%, despite a 10-percentage-point reduction following the summit.

Soybean prices fell sharply by 23 cents to $11.24 per bushel Friday. Ehmke said “that's the market being shocked by the lack of Chinese demand that was confirmed in USDA data today.” Prices are still higher than they were before the agreement when they were selling for $10.60 per bushel, but the price may continue to drop unless there are significant new purchases.

Before the trade agreement, Trump had promised farmers would receive an aid package to help them survive the trade war with China. That was put on hold during the shutdown, and now it's not clear whether the administration will offer farmers aid like Trump did in his first administration.

American farmers have been through this before after Trump's first trade war with China. The trade agreement China signed with the United States in 2020 promised massive purchases of U.S. crops. But the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted trade between the two nations just as the agreement went into effect. In 2022, U.S. farm exports to China hit a record, but then fell. 

Soybean prices are actually still a little higher than they were a year ago even without China's normal purchases of roughly one-quarter of the U.S. crop. That's because this year's soybean crop is a little smaller while domestic demand remained strong with the continued growth in biodiesel production.

But farmers are dealing with the soaring cost of fertilizer, seed, equipment and labor this year, and that is hurting their profits. The Kentucky farmer who is president of the American Soybean Association, Caleb Ragland, has said he worries that thousands of farmers could go out of business this year without significant Chinese purchases or government aid.

Ragland said he's still optimistic that China will follow through on the purchases, but it's hard to be confident in that right now with so few sales reported. 

“We don't want to assume they won't. But it's going to be a wonderful day when we actually deliver those soybeans, and when there's my money in hand and so forth and the transaction's complete,” Ragland said. 

China is the world's largest buyer of soybeans. China bought more than $12.5 billion worth of the nearly $24.5 billion worth of U.S. soybeans that were exported last year. 

But China quit buying American soybeans this year after Trump imposed his tariffs and continued to shift more of their purchases over to South America. Even before the trade war, Brazilian beans accounted for more than 70% of China's imports last year, while the U.S. share fell to 21%, World Bank data shows. 

Ragland said that every vender he talks to has told him they are increasing their prices for next year, which will continue to put pressure on farmers. 

“We're still looking at sharp losses and the red ink as we figure budgets for 26 is still very much in play,” he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced Friday that he was scrapping U.S. tariffs on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and a broad swath of other commodities — a dramatic move that comes amid mounting pressure on his administration to better combat high consumer prices. 

Trump has built his second term around imposing steep levies on goods imported into the U.S. in hopes of encouraging domestic production and lifting the U.S. economy. His abrupt retreat from his signature tariff policy on so many staples key to the American diet is significant, and it comes after voters in off-year elections this month cited economic concerns as their top issue, resulting in big wins for Democrats in Virginia, New Jersey and other key races around the country. 

“We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods like coffee,” Trump said aboard Air Force One as he flew to Florida hours after the tariff announcement was made. 

Pressed on his tariffs helping to increase consumer prices, Trump acknowledged, “I say they may, in some cases” have that effect. 

“But to a large extent they've been borne by other countries,” the president added. 

Meanwhile, inflation — despite Trump's pronouncements that it has vanished since he took office in January — remains elevated, further increasing pressure on U.S. consumers. 

The Trump administration has insisted that its tariffs had helped fill government coffers and weren't a major factor in higher prices at grocery stores around the country. But Democrats were quick to paint Friday's move as an acknowledgement that Trump's policies were hurting American pocketbooks. 




“President Trump is finally admitting what we always knew: his tariffs are raising prices for the American people,” Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer said in a statement. “After getting drubbed in recent elections because of voters' fury that Trump has broken his promises to fix inflation, the White House is trying to cast this tariff retreat as a ‘pivot to affordability.'”

Trump slapped tariffs on most countries around the globe in April. He and his administration still say that tariffs don't increase consumer prices, despite economic evidence to the contrary.

Record-high beef prices have been a particular concern, and Trump had said he intended to take action to try and lower them. Trump's tariffs on Brazil, a major beef exporter, had been a factor.

Trump signed an executive order that also removes tariffs on tea, fruit juice, cocoa, spices, bananas, oranges, tomatoes and certain fertilizers. Some of the products covered aren't produced in the United States, meaning that tariffs meant to spur domestic production had little effect. But reducing the tariffs will still likely mean lower prices for U.S. consumers. 

The Food Industry Association, which represents retailers, producers and a variety of related industry firms and services, applauded Trump's move to provide “swift tariff relief,” noting that import U.S. taxes “are an important factor” in a “complex mix” of supply chain issues. 

“President Trump's proclamation to reduce tariffs on a substantial volume of food imports is a critical step ensuring continued adequate supply at prices consumers can afford,” the association said in a statement. 

In explaining the tariff reductions, the White House said Friday that some of the original levies Trump relished imposing on nearly every country on earth months ago were actually no longer necessary given the trade agreements he'd since hammered out with key U.S. trading partners. 

Indeed, Friday's announcement follows the Trump administration having reached framework agreements with Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina meant to increase the ability of U.S. firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries, while also potentially easing tariffs on agricultural products produced there. 

During an interview that aired earlier in the week with Laura Ingraham of Fox News Channel, Trump hinted that lower tariffs might be coming.

“Coffee, we're going to lower some tariffs,” the president said then. “We're going to have some coffee come in.”

Despite pulling back on so many tariffs, Trump used his comments aboard Air Force One on Friday night to repeat his past assertions that his administration would use revenue the federal government has collected from import levies to fund $2,000 checks for many Americans. 

The president suggested such checks could be issued in 2026, but was vague on timing, saying only, “Sometime during the year.” Trump, however, also said federal tariff revenue might be used to pay down national debt — raising questions about how much federal funding would be needed to do both. 

Trump rejected suggestions that attempting direct payments to Americans could exacerbate inflation concerns — even as he suggested that similar checks offered during the coronavirus pandemic, and by previous administrations to stimulate the economy, had that very effect. 

“This is money earned as opposed to money that was made up,” Trump said. “Everybody but the rich will get this. That's not made up. That's real money. That comes from other countries.”

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi explains why the Department of Justice sued California Gov. Gavin Newsom and how the legal system handles alleged ‘sanctuary cities' on ‘Hannity.' 

Federal agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection are expected to arrive in the Charlotte area within days, local officials confirmed this week amid growing friction between Washington's immigration enforcement priorities and Democratic-run cities.

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday that it had been notified of the impending federal presence but emphasized that it has not been asked to assist or participate in any operations. A department spokesperson told Fox News Digital Friday that the sheriff's office had ""zero involvement or participation in any CBP immigration enforcements or operations.""

The impending immigration enforcement in North Carolina comes as Sheriff Garry L. McFadden, a Democrat, has sought to maintain open communication with federal agencies while distancing his department from federal immigration enforcement.

GOP URGES DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD TO CHARLOTTE AS CRIME SURGES

Charlotte's anticipated CBP deployment is the latest in a series of similar moves by the federal government to extend border-security operations to other parts of the country.

In recent months, CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have sent personnel to major metropolitan areas including Chicago and Washington, D.C.

Those operations have sparked protests from anti-immigration activists. In Portland, Oregon, protests have flared since June. Anti-ICE graffiti has been scrawled outside of detention centers, and demonstrations have become violent at times between protesters and federal agents.

Federal officials have described the deployments as part of an expanded effort to disrupt smuggling networks and track illegal aliens.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said: ""Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations.""

The timing of the announcement comes as Charlotte faces intensifying scrutiny over violent crime.

Homicides and aggravated assaults have risen sharply this year, prompting Republican lawmakers to urge Democratic Gov. Josh Stein to deploy the National Guard. For now, the governor has resisted that call from Republican lawmakers, and local officials have argued that public safety remains a local responsibility.

""Recently, the city faced eight homicides in seven days. The murder rate in uptown Charlotte is now 200% higher than it was a year ago,"" a letter from a trio of Republican lawmakers said. ""According to the Fraternal Order of Police, aggravated assaults involving knives or guns have risen from 86 in 2024 to 111 in 2025, and personal strong-arm robberies have increased from 26 to 31 in the same period.""

MAJOR CITY POLICE UNIONS SUPPORT FEDERAL TROOP DEPLOYMENTS, BUT LOCAL LEADERS ARE PUSHING BACK

According to the Charlotte Police Department's quarterly statistics report, violent crimes, commercial burglaries and larcenies from automobiles have all gone up in Charlotte since last year. But other crimes like homicides, rapes, property crimes and arson have come down modestly from levels in 2024. In many categories, Charlotte's current crime levels are meaningfully lower than rates in 2022 and 2023, with some exceptions. 

On Aug. 22, the stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska garnered attention after her killing was captured on surveillance video while she was commuting home from her pizzeria job. The footage captured the 23-year-old cowering as her alleged killer leered over her with a folding knife seconds before the attack. 

Police revealed that her accused killer was identified as Decarlos Brown Jr., a repeat offender with a lengthy rap sheet. 

In his earlier statement Wednesday, McFadden sought to reassure residents that his office ""remains committed to transparency"" and that any coordination with federal agencies will be limited to information-sharing, not enforcement.

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office said the sheriff, Garry L. McFadden, was contacted by two unnamed federal officials this week who said U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel will be arriving in the Charlotte area either Saturday or early next week.

Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports on politicians and partners of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy allegedly participating in an energy corruption scandal on ‘Special Report.' 

The Trump administration has so far remained silent on a widening corruption scandal inside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government and inner circle.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on a $100 million corruption probe announced this week that has already prompted the resignations of senior Ukrainian officials.

Corruption has long been a friction point in U.S.–Ukraine relations. In 2019, the Trump administration paused roughly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine, citing concerns about government corruption. At the same time, Trump's associates sought information on then–Democratic rival Joe Biden, who served as vice president under Barack Obama.

Meanwhile, Biden's son Hunter held a $50,000-per-month board seat at the Ukrainian energy firm Burisma. As vice president, Joe Biden had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine dismissed prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whom Western governments accused of failing to pursue corruption cases. Shokin later claimed he was fired because he was investigating Burisma — a claim U.S. and European officials dispute.

RUSSIA'S GAS GAMBLE BACKFIRES AS TRUMP'S ENERGY VISION RESHAPES EUROPE

President Donald Trump for months has been working to secure a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, which the U.S. has provided with around $175 billion in aid since the start of the war in 2022. 

Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies — the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAP) — said they spent 15 months on ""Operation Midas,"" a probe that included roughly 1,000 hours of wiretaps. Investigators say the inquiry uncovered a kickback scheme in which contractors for the state-owned nuclear company Energoatom paid 10 to 15 percent bribes, totaling about $100 million, to keep government contracts.

According to prosecutors, the alleged ringleader was Timur Mindich, a longtime associate of Zelenskyy and co-owner of his former production studio, as well as an advisor to Justice Minister German Galushchenko. Authorities say Galushchenko, who served as energy minister until July, helped facilitate the money laundering operation and acted under Mindich's influence.

Mindich fled Ukraine early Monday, hours before investigators raided his home. Both Galushchenko and his successor, Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk, said they would resign at Zelenskyy's request. Five suspects have been arrested, and seven others placed under official suspicion, prosecutors said.

In a statement, NABU alleged that the criminal network transferred funds to ""an unnamed former deputy prime minister of Ukraine,"" identified internally by the codename Che Guevara. Investigators said about $1.2 million was traced to that individual.

""Using their official connections in the ministry and the state-owned company,"" the suspects ""ensured control over personnel decisions, procurement processes, and financial flows,"" Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies said.

Zelenskyy has not been directly implicated, but the revelations cast a shadow over a president who built his career on promises to root out graft. He publicly backed the investigation, saying Monday night that ""any effective action against corruption is very necessary"" and that ""the inevitability of punishment is necessary.""

Earlier this year, Zelenskyy faced backlash after proposing tighter presidential oversight of Ukraine's independent anti-corruption agencies — a plan he later withdrew.

Before entering politics, the former comedian often joked about his country's entrenched corruption. ""Is it possible to become president and not steal?"" he once quipped. ""It's a rhetorical question, as no one has tried so far."" His 2019 election campaign centered on dismantling the oligarch-dominated political system and increasing transparency.

Now, nearly seven years later — with no election planned amid wartime conditions — some Ukrainians view him as increasingly reliant on a small inner circle consolidating their own power and wielding it with limited checks.

Investigators say some of the laundered money had been earmarked for equipment meant to protect energy facilities from Russian missile attacks. Ukraine continues to face rolling blackouts, with many residents limited to five to eight hours of electricity per day as Russian forces target power infrastructure heading into winter.

Last week, the European Commission praised Ukraine's ""significant efforts"" to combat corruption but warned that ""limited progress"" could jeopardize its bid to join the European Union. The commission also cautioned that reports of political pressure on anti-corruption groups ""cast doubt on Ukraine's commitment"" and urged Kyiv to ""prevent any backsliding on its notable reform achievements.""

Margot Kaczorowski and Ellen Holmquist, former teammates of trans swimmer Lia Thomas, join 'Fox & Friends' with their attorney to react to the University of Pennsylvania's decision, saying 'we have a long way to go' in the fight for women's sports.

President Donald Trump nominated attorney Justin Olson, of the firm Kroger Gardis & Regas, LLP, to sit on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.

Olson is one of the attorneys helping to lead a lawsuit financed by the Independent Council on Women's Sports (ICONS) against the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, the Ivy League and NCAA for its handling of a situation involving transgender swimmer Lia Thomas. Olson is also listed as an attorney in ICONS's lawsuit against the Mountain West Conference and representatives of San Jose State University over their handling of a situation involving trans volleyball player Blaire Fleming. 

Trump noted Olson's work on those cases in an announcement of the nomination on Truth Social on Friday.

""It is my honor to nominate Justin Olson to serve as Judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana! Graduating magna cum laude from the Indiana University Maurer School of Law, Justin previously distinguished himself at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Indianapolis and, as a litigator, has been fighting tirelessly to keep men out of women's sports,"" Trump wrote.

""Hoosiers can trust Justin to always uphold the Rule of Law, and strongly protect their Constitutional Rights. Congratulations Justin!""

Former UPenn swimmers Grace Estabrook, Margot Kaczorowski and Ellen Holmquist filed a lawsuit on Feb. 5, alleging UPenn officials led them to feel their concerns over being teammates with Thomas were rooted in a ""psychological problem,"" and that by allowing Thomas to compete, the institutions ""injured them and violated federal law.""

Thomas, a biological male, previously competed for the UPenn men's swimming team from 2017-20 under the name Will Thomas. According to the lawsuit, Thomas was introduced by women's swimming head coach Mike Schnur to the women's swimmers during a team meeting in Fall 2019 as their incoming teammate.

Each of the three plaintiffs claims the experience left them ""repeatedly emotionally traumatized.""

The plaintiffs allege that the university administrators pushed pro-trans ideology onto them throughout the process of accepting Thomas on the team and in their locker room. The plaintiffs also allege that the administrators warned them against speaking out against the situation publicly.

""The UPenn administrators went on to tell the women that if the women spoke publicly about their concerns about Thomas' participation on the Women's Team, the reputation of those complaining about Thomas being on the team would be tainted with transphobia for the rest of their lives and they would probably never be able to get a job,'"" the lawsuit alleges.

Thomas went on to win NCAA Division I national championship in the 500-yard freestyle, earned three All-America honors at the NCAA Championships, and was named the High Point Swimmer of the Meet at the Ivy League Championships. 

UPenn agreed with the Trump administration in June to strip the athlete's swimming records from the women's program archives, and adopt a policy to keep biological males out of women's sports.

Meanwhile, in the SJSU case, former women's volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser filed that lawsuit in November 2024, alongside 10 other former and current Mountain West players. Slusser alleged the Mountain West and SJSU withheld knowledge of Fleming's biological sex from her and other players while having her share changing spaces and hotel rooms with Fleming. 

SJSU is currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for the situation.

Could the Klein Vision AirCar redefine the future of travel? Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses.

Pennsylvania may soon join the few states ready to welcome flying cars. State Sen. Marty Flynn from the 22nd District has reintroduced Senate Bill 1077, also known as the Jetsons Act, during the 2025-2026 Regular Session.

The proposal amends Title 75 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, creating a new legal category for roadable aircraft. These vehicles would have the unique ability to operate both on public roads as motor vehicles and in the air as aircraft.

The legislation was referred to the Senate Transportation Committee on Nov. 5, 2025. Although a similar version failed to pass last session, Flynn remains committed to positioning Pennsylvania as a leader in advanced transportation technology. He believes that laying the groundwork now will allow the state to adapt quickly when these vehicles become commercially viable.

THE WORLD'S FIRST FLYING CAR IS READY FOR TAKEOFF

Technology is advancing faster than most laws can keep up. The rise of advanced air mobility is blurring the line between cars and aircraft.

Several companies, including Alef Aeronautics, Samson Sky and CycloTech, are developing vehicles that can take off vertically or transform from cars to small aircraft within minutes.

Some states are already laying the groundwork for this new era. Minnesota and New Hampshire have passed legislation formally recognizing ""roadable aircraft,"" making them the first states to treat flying cars as both vehicles and aircraft under state law. Pennsylvania now hopes to follow their lead with its own version through Senator Marty Flynn's Jetsons Act.

At the same time, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has begun approving real-world tests. In 2023, the FAA granted a Special Airworthiness Certificate to SpaceX-backed Alef Aeronautics for its Model A prototype, allowing it to operate on roads and in the air for research and development. That approval marked the first time a flying car received official clearance for combined ground and flight testing in the United States.

Senator Flynn wants Pennsylvania to be part of this growing national conversation. In his co-sponsorship memo, he explained that proactive legislation will help the state prepare for the next wave of innovation.

Under Senate Bill 1077, Pennsylvania would officially define a ""roadable aircraft"" as a hybrid vehicle capable of both driving and flying. These vehicles would need to register with the state, display a unique registration plate and meet standard inspection requirements. When operated on highways or city streets, they would be subject to the same rules as other vehicles. When used in flight, they would remain under federal aviation oversight.

The bill also clarifies how drivers and pilots must transition between ground and air operations safely. It allows take-offs and landings only in approved areas, except during emergencies. Flynn emphasizes that clear definitions and consistent oversight will prevent confusion for both motorists and law enforcement. He hopes this clarity will also encourage manufacturers to consider Pennsylvania a test site for future flying car technologies.

If you live in Pennsylvania, this bill could one day change how you think about personal transportation. While flying cars remain in development, legislation like this sets the stage for their eventual arrival. Drivers may one day register, inspect and insure a flying car just like a regular vehicle. Pilots could use the same roadways to reach take-off zones before switching to flight mode.

Even for residents who never plan to own a flying car, the ripple effects could be significant. New rules may influence local zoning, airspace management and infrastructure planning. Communities might see new vertiports or designated landing pads as part of urban development. Insurance companies and safety regulators will need to rethink how they handle this new class of hybrid travel.

The bill also signals a broader change in how states approach innovation. Rather than waiting for federal action, Pennsylvania wants to establish a framework that welcomes new technologies while protecting public safety.

Senator Flynn's Jetsons Act might sound futuristic, but it reflects a growing reality in transportation. As autonomous vehicles, drones and hybrid aircraft evolve, state governments must adapt to keep up. This legislation shows Pennsylvania's willingness to lead rather than follow. While it may take years before you see a flying car parked in your driveway, the groundwork is already being laid. Lawmakers are thinking ahead about licensing, safety and how to integrate flying cars into existing traffic systems. That forward-thinking approach could one day make Pennsylvania one of the first states to see cars take to the sky.

First in Washington, D.C., and now in Memphis, President Donald Trump has surged federal law enforcement officers and National Guard to high-crime neighborhoods, and the results have been unequivocally successful: lower crime, safer streets, and a quiet but telling rise in law-abiding behavior.

When Trump first announced his law enforcement surge for the district, Democrats lost their minds, as though crime were a good thing. At large D.C. Council member Robert White called it an “occupation” and “the opening move in a national move toward authoritarianism.” Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) called Trump a “dictator” who was “pushing democracy to the brink.” There was a lot more nonsense where that came from.

Four weeks later, however, Mayor Muriel Bowser was thanking Trump. “We know that we have had fewer gun crimes, fewer homicides, and we have experienced an extreme reduction in carjackings,” Bowser said. “We greatly appreciate the surge of officers.”

According to the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department data, compared to the previous year, violent crime fell by half during Trump's surge — burglaries were down by 48%, and car thefts were down by 36%. Fare evasion became nonexistent at the Metro as National Guard troops were visibly present at every gate.

But the biggest drops in crime, according to one analysis, happened in what had been the most crime-ridden neighborhoods. Trump's surge of law enforcement did not hang out in Georgetown and Adams Morgan, but in Anacostia, Brentwood, and the U Street corridor. More than 1,000 arrests were made, 115 firearms were seized, and 50 homeless encampments were cleared.

The leadership of Memphis, a blue city in a deep red state, was far more welcoming to Trump's law enforcement surge than the district. Republican Gov. Bill Lee worked with Trump to select Memphis as a targeted enforcement city, and the city's mayor, Democrat Paul Young, while nominally opposed to the surge, has worked closely with the federal government. “My goal is to make sure that anything that's happening in our city, that I'm at the table negotiating in good faith on behalf of the residents of our city,” Young said. “That's my job.”

More than 2,000 federal law enforcement officers and National Guard troops have been in the city since Oct. 10, and the results have been just as dramatic as those in Washington, D.C. More than 2,100 people have been arrested. Robberies and vehicle thefts are both down 70%, aggravated assaults are down 50%, and murders are down 43%. The DMV reports that vehicle registrations are up dramatically as residents who used to drive illegally rush to get their tags to avoid being pulled over.

“It's good they're here,” 61-year-old bartender Ann Morris told reporters. “Traffic is a lot lighter, and hopefully things will get better.” Morris added that she hopes the law enforcement presence will serve as a “wake-up call” to young men in the city.

The costs of law enforcement surges make them unsustainable as a permanent solution. But the results demonstrate that if anything, we have too few, not too many, law officers in most of our communities. 

Trump's surges in the district and Memphis prove that when law enforcement is visible, empowered, and present in the neighborhoods, crime falls and communities stabilize. 

NEWSOM PUSHES CALIFORNIA CLIMATE COLONIALISM IN BRAZIL

Democrats fearmonger about “authoritarianism,” but residents living with daily violence saw something different — safer streets, open businesses, and a renewed sense of order. 

These surges can't last forever, but their success exposes a real problem, which is that too many cities simply lack the officers needed to keep the peace. If leaders truly care about public safety, they should stop attacking law enforcement and start investing in it.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Fresh off wins in the 2025 elections, Democrats are shifting their sights toward their next target: the special election to fill the seat of former Rep. Mark Green (R-TN), after a recent polling index shows the normally solid red district slightly more within reach.

Though President Donald Trump won the Tennessee 7th District by 22 percentage points, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report shifted the race from “solid Republican” to “likely Republican.” The reasoning centered on Democratic nominee Aftyn Behn's affordability agenda and charisma, as well as Democrats' ability to outperform Republicans in non-presidential cycles.

Behn is facing Republican Matt Van Epps in the general election on Dec. 2, a date chosen by Gov. Bill Lee (R-TN) with the hope that it would be overshadowed by the holiday season of Thanksgiving. But a lot is riding on this election: if Republicans can hold on to the seat, it helps boost Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-LA) razor-thin margin. 

Van Epps sailed to victory largely thanks to an endorsement from Trump and his capitalization on his nine active duty tours. But the nonpartisan analyst noted that that may not be enough to rally support from the GOP's voting base, which is already lackluster to vote for ballots where Trump's name is not at the top. 

Behn, meanwhile, was able to win thanks to a solid grassroots campaign. She ran an unapologetic populist and progressive platform, and her campaign pointed to early voting totals in her victory announcement that showed Republicans at 50.52% and Democrats at 49.28%, “underscoring the competitiveness of a race many assumed would be unwinnable for Democrats.”

Affordability was the key issue in the 2025 elections. Although the Democratic Gov.-elects, Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, ran centrist campaigns focused on lowering costs and making their states more affordable, New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani also attracted thousands of voters thanks to his affordability platform.

With Democrats dominating New Jersey, New York, and Virginia, the party further down south is hoping they can make a splash in an otherwise red stronghold by connecting on similar issues.

“You've got someone in Aftyn Behn who knows ― as a social worker, as a community organizer, as a rep ― someone who understands the struggle of average everyday Tennesseans; people who want hope, people who need a champion,” Democratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin told a crowd of canvassers for Behn last week, per the Tennessean.

To boost turnout, Behn has enlisted the help of prominent Democrats, including Martin and Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX). Martin energized over 80 canvassers last week, saying that “anyone who's within 16 points right now is within striking distance.

“And Aftyn is not only within striking distance, she's on the verge of making this happen with all your help,” Martin told the canvassers.

The Cook Political Report said in its analysis that public polling still shows an edge for Van Epps, with an Oct. 16-19 survey finding the Republican leading Behn by single digits, 52% to 44%. 

“We saw what happened last week in America: All across the United States, Democratic energy is up. People are tired of what's going on right now in Washington,” Rachel Campbell, chairwoman of the Tennessee Democratic Party, told NOTUS. “Aftyn Behn gives us an opportunity to send a fresh face, a fresh voice, and a fighter to Congress, and that's what we're excited about and what we're looking forward to.”

Behn told the outlet she thinks her candidacy offers a lead-by-example moment for other House candidates running for traditionally conservative seats.

“If we are able to get close or flip it, I think it is a testament to how the Democratic playbook will be rewritten in the South, which is one of running on affordability issues and not responding to the cultural issues that the right is weaponizing,” Behn said.

Republicans currently have a 2-1 record in House special elections this year, gaining two new GOP lawmakers in the House thanks to Reps. Jimmy Patronis (R-FL) and Randy Fine (R-FL) are holding on to red seats. Democrats won the Arizona special election, with Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-AZ) finally being sworn in on Wednesday after a weekslong delay during the government shutdown.

Democrats will fill the seat left vacant by the late Rep. Sylvester Turner in Texas, with two Democrats advancing to a runoff election that could take place as late as January 31, according to Houston Public Media.

With a projected Republican win in Tennessee and a projected Democratic win in Texas, the House will return to its 220-215 numbers, meaning Johnson can afford to lose only two votes to still pass legislation along party lines.

However, a Democratic victory in Tennessee would narrow that to a one-seat majority, which would be a significant challenge for the speaker, who already faces a government funding deadline of Jan.31.

Based on partisanship in the 7th District, it's likely that the race will remain in Republican hands. However, Nashville Democrats are energized after losing their congressional representation due to redistricting in 2022. The timing of the race, coming two days after the Thanksgiving weekend, is also a bonus for Democrats, as many Republican voters may not be aware that the race is even taking place.

Republicans are working hard financially to bolster Van Epps in the race, with the National Republican Congressional Committee spending $164,000 on the airwaves to boost GOP turnout. Separately, Republicans have outspent Democrats on the airwaves, $160,000 to $64,000, in the race.

White House border czar Tom Homan criticized the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops on Friday after they issued a statement earlier this week opposing “the indiscriminate mass deportation of people.”

“The Catholic Church is wrong,” Homan told reporters at the White House. “I'm a lifelong Catholic, but I'm saying it not only as a border czar, but I'm also saying this as a Catholic,” he added. 

The conference said it was its first time in 12 years to invoke a “particularly urgent way of speaking” to address immigration. The body overwhelmingly approved the special message.

“We are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement. We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants. We are concerned about the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care,” the message said in part.

“Despite obstacles and prejudices, generations of immigrants have made enormous contributions to the well-being of our nation,” they continued. “We as Catholic bishops love our country and pray for its peace and prosperity. For this very reason, we feel compelled now in this environment to raise our voices in defense of God-given human dignity.” 

Both Pope Leo XIV and the late Pope Francis had expressed their concerns about immigration enforcement in the United States. Leo compared the immigration debate to abortion last month.

“Someone who says I'm against abortion but is in favor of the death penalty is not really pro-life,” Pope Leo said. “And someone who says I'm against abortion but I'm in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States, I don't know if that's pro-life.”

Homan argued that a secure border ensures the safety of Americans.

“A secure border saves lives. We're going to enforce the law, and by doing that, we save a lot of lives,” Homan said Friday. “ICE is sending a message to the whole world.”

The second Trump administration has stepped up its immigration enforcement efforts compared to previous administrations, including Trump's first term in the White House. With Homan at the helm, ICE has received billions in new funding and has set out across the country's major cities in search of illegal immigrants.

The Department of Homeland Security announced late last month that the administration had deported over half a million illegal immigrants, as well as 1.6 million who had “self-deported.” Illegal border crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border have also plummeted to low points not seen in decades.

However, the increased immigration enforcement has stirred controversy among the American public. Mass protests have occurred in cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago. Trump deployed the National Guard earlier this year to quell the L.A. protest.

Chicago, currently under ICE operation Midway Blitz, has seen protesters gather outside immigration facilities, on the streets, and outside courthouses. Law enforcement has deployed tear gas to disperse crowds. 

Homan said protesters can exercise their rights, but can't “cross the line.”

“If people would just look at the data and see that the vast majority of what ICE is doing is public safety threats. A lot of media say that a lot of people in ICE detention aren't criminals — wrong,” he said.

“A lot of these people are national security threats, a lot of them don't have criminal history records. It's not okay to be in the country illegally. It's a crime.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump rescinded his support and endorsement of Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene (R-GA) after her public criticism of the GOP during the government shutdown.

“I am withdrawing my support and Endorsement of ‘Congresswoman' Marjorie Taylor Greene, of the Great State of Georgia,” he wrote in a Friday night Truth Social post.

Trump suggested he would support a Georgia primary against Greene, who he says has gone “far-left” after he previously discouraged her from running for a higher office.

The Georgia Republican has split from her party on several occasions recently, including backing healthcare subsidies and pointing the finger at Republicans for a lack of healthcare alternatives to the Affordable Care Act, during the recent government shutdown. Democrats had largely suggested the subsidies were the reason for the shutdown, which ended earlier this week.

Greene was also one of four Republicans to sign on to a discharge petition regarding the release of the Epstein files, which reached the necessary 218 signatures in the House this week.

“All I see ‘Wacky' Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN! It seemed to all begin when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor, she was at 12%, and didn't have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement — which she wasn't about to get!),” he added after touting the administration's accomplishments.

Trump said Greene is “upset” that the president doesn't return her calls, and called her a “ranting lunatic.” He suggested that Greene's appearance on “The View” earlier this month was the tipping point, as the program often criticizes Trump.

“I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day,” he wrote. “I understand that wonderful, Conservative people are thinking about primarying Marjorie in her District of Georgia, that they too are fed up with her and her antics and, if the right person runs, they will have my Complete and Unyielding Support. She has gone Far Left, even doing The View, with their Low IQ Republican hating Anchors.”

Greene hit back at Trump in a post on X, saying the president “lied about” her and that the Epstein files are what “sent him over the edge.”

While Trump's post did not mention the files, a Georgia Republican alleged that the president was trying to “make an example” of her to scare other Republicans out of voting for the files' formal release next week. 

“It's astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,” she added, wishing he would “fight this hard” to help those affected by foreign wars and causes, those who can't afford to feed their families, and are “losing hope of ever achieving the American dream.”

“I have supported President Trump with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him,” she said.

“But I don't worship or serve Donald Trump.”

In an attached screenshot to her post, which appeared to show a text conversation with the president, Greene advised the president to check Epstein's flight logs and to “lean into” what the files revealed. In another text conversation with a “Natalie,” she defended her comments about the files. It is unclear to whom the second message was sent.

Trump later added in comments to reporters on Air Force One that he “already” had people calling to primary Greene in her district. He also said that one of his chief complaints about the Georgia Republican was her criticism of foreign deals.

“You think I want go and be on an airplane for 20 hours…and then get off and make a speech, and get people to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in our country? If you didn't go, you wouldn't be able to have that kind of result,” he told reporters.

Greene has refused foreign aid and said she is “America First, America Only.” She recently suggested Trump has drifted from the “America First” motto. “No one cares about the foreign countries. No one cares about the never-ending amount of foreign leaders coming to the White House every single week,” Greene told NBC News.

Trump also noted Greene's appearance on a popular daytime television show, “The View.” The day after appearing on the program, Greene blamed Republicans for their 2025 general election losses.

“You can't meme and throw red meat rants and interviews and get your way out of this. These people are serious and only support action, they are done with words. And I completely agree with them,” she wrote.

MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE DIGS IN ON ‘AMERICA ONLY' VALUES AFTER WAVING OFF TRUMP CRITICISM

Greene has once solidified herself as the House's most ardent Trump supporter, but earlier this week, she waved off criticism from Trump that she had “lost her way.”

Greene told reporters she “100% hasn't changed” and that she is “okay” with the president not liking her.

“I'm America first, America only,” she reiterated to reporters Wednesday.

One year after President Donald Trump roared back into the White House and swept the GOP into control of both branches of Congress, the Republican Party was confronted with a blaring warning sign in the 2025 off-year elections.

Exit polls showed women voters strongly favored Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia, helping them defeat their Republican opponents.

Women voters were among the top voting blocs that helped Democrats retake the House during the 2018 midterm elections under Trump's first administration. They could once again boost Democrats into power during the 2026 elections.

But winning them over to the Republican side will take a mix of solutions, both political and cultural, that won't be easy to implement. 

“There's a number of things that the Republican Party can be doing right now. And one, it's acknowledging the diversity of the roles that women play in their households,” said Erin Maguire, a GOP consultant who has worked on presidential super PACs. “And starting with that, acknowledging that a lot of women manage their household budgets. This affordability argument that is happening across the country, the American people are screaming for affordability right now.”

Tiffany Justice, executive vice president of Heritage Action, claimed that appealing to women voters isn't “complicated” but takes a common-sense approach. 

“The issues women care about aren't complicated: safety, parental rights, education freedom, protecting our kids, and affordability,” Justice said. “When the GOP speaks directly to those concerns, consistently, boldly, and without apology, women will respond, because they're experiencing the consequences of Democratic policies every single day.”

Gov.-elects Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Mikie Sherrill (D-VA), as well as New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani (D), all ran on a campaign message of affordability that appealed to voters who still feel economic uncertainty under the Trump administration.

Trump's “Liberation Day” tariffs have resulted in higher costs for consumers, and a record-breaking government shutdown will likely cost the nation hundreds of millions of dollars. Concerns about healthcare premium costs and exorbitant housing costs have also added to the unease many voters feel about their finances.

The Republican National Committee and the National Federation of Republican Women launched the nationwide Women Increasing Number in August, but that didn't stop women from defecting to the Democrats. Spanberger and Sherrill, both moderate Democrats, won the total women's vote, according to CNN's exit polls.

They also won women voters of all age groups, including independent women voters, the black women vote, the white women vote, and the Latina vote. The only groups of women they didn't win were white women without a college degree and Republican women voters. Mamdani narrowly won the women vote in his race.

MAGAZINE: WHAT NOVEMBER'S ELECTION RESULTS SAY ABOUT BOTH PARTIES

“Republicans are connecting with women by focusing on the issues that matter most to their families — affordability, safety, and a secure border,” Kiersten Pels, RNC press secretary, said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “In addition, through the Women Increasing Numbers (WIN) initiative, the RNC is providing women with training, tools, and hands-on opportunities to lead on voter registration, poll watching, and get-out-the-vote efforts in their communities.”

Trump won reelection largely by claiming he could fix the economy after four years under former President Joe Biden's leadership. Gas prices have fallen under Trump, but voter malaise over the economy has continued. Proposals such as a 50-year mortgage to ease housing costs have met swift blowback, while possible tariff exemptions for coffee and bananas are an implicit admission by the Trump administration that tariffs are hurting consumers.

“There's an opportunity for an affordability revolution in the United States, and I think that Republicans need to start heeding that now,” Maguire said. “I also think that there is a second part to this, which is that, especially with younger women, that kind of 18 to 34 demographic, I think you're looking at an ideological slant on cultural issues like healthcare for women. I think the Republican Party, and I've said this for you know, for years, does a really poor job talking to women in general about healthcare.”

Although abortion was not the top issue for voters during this year's elections, women's healthcare still remains a key topic as they vote. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion group, recently announced it would invest $80 million to reach 10.5 million voters ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

Polls have also shown that cultural issues remain prominent among Gen Z women voters. A September NBC News survey showed that a slim majority of Gen Z men, 53%, disapprove of Trump's performance, while 74% of Gen Z women disapprove of Trump's performance. But when these young voters were asked to rank their personal definition of success, a significant fissure erupted.

Young women and men, 18-29, who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, ranked having a job or career you find fulfilling as their top choice. But young men who voted for Trump said having children was their top choice, and young women who voted for Trump said achieving financial independence was their top choice.

In the aftermath of the 2025 elections, posts on social media called for the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, to be repealed.

“Is it good that women can vote in America? I don't think so, and here's why,” said entrepreneur-turned-pastor Dale Partridge in a video posted on X.

“Hey @GOP, I know you are a mess after Tuesday, so let me spell this out clearly,” Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, responded. “Listening to quacks like this is the best way to ensure we never win a Presidential election again. We need better messaging not the disenfranchisement of half of American voters.”

Hawkins told the Washington Examiner in an interview that voices like Partridge's don't represent the views of the GOP. “These are not people that have ever been traditionally within the political kind of movement,” she said. “They might have voted for Trump, but they certainly don't like Donald Trump.” 

The GOP having conversations about fixing healthcare and housing costs and helping families survive on one spouse's salary, Hawkins claimed, is necessary to appeal to women.

“If we have this serious conversation about appealing and winning over female voters, we need to have the conversation about homeownership … It's an economic conversation. Women are very practical voters, despite what these fringe a**holes like to say,” Hawkins said. “They're desperate for relevance. They've always been outside of the mainstream, and in the wake of [conservative activist Charlie Kirk‘s] assassination, have increased their podcasts and videos and outlandish posts because they know there's this huge hole, and they want to be able to fill it.”

The effort to repeal the 19th Amendment also comes amid virulent sexism from conservative influencer Nick Fuentes, who blamed women for low birth rates in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in late October.

“The men are extremely conservative, increasingly,” Fuentes said on Carlson's show. “The women are extremely liberal.” Carlson himself claimed during that same interview: “I'm a little sexist.” 

Justice slammed attacks against women as distractions for the GOP. “Call it what it is: noise,” she said. “Fringe internet posters aren't the GOP, and women know it. Republicans win when we stay focused on safety, affordability, and protecting our kids — not when we let leftist trolls set the narrative.”

She continued, “And let's be honest: if the Republican Party spent as much time getting out the vote as some people do trolling online, we wouldn't be in this position. Women want solutions. The movement that talks to moms about real-life concerns that matter to them will be the movement that wins them back.”

Comments from Carlson and Fuentes aren't likely to convince women voters that the GOP is the better party than the Democrats. Nor are op-eds asking if women — or “liberal feminism” — ruined the workplace.

Katie Frost, a Georgia Republican strategist, also cautioned that extremist comments happen on both sides of the aisle. 

“I have had people go online and say things to me from the Left, wishing physical harm on me. What I would just say is online discourse is not the real world, and a few crank tweets does not a policy make,” said Frost.

“And if you look at some of the content that was being consumed by female voters, it happens on both ends of the spectrum. Some of the content online is completely divorced from reality,” she added. 

BIPARTISAN, ANTI-TRUMP GROUP CARRYING 2025 MOMENTUM INTO MIDTERM ‘AFFORDABILITY' BLITZ

Frost instead called on the GOP to offer an “inspirational” message to women voters.

“We have to message to women that the Republican Party is the party that cares about keeping you and your family and your community safe,” Frost said. “We want you to be able to thrive. We want you to be able to afford housing. We want your children to be safe when they go to play at the park.” ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Twenty-somethings aren't delayed or doomed.

The notion that your 20s are the best years of your life is more rumor than reality. It shows up in songs, films, ads, social-media posts—but it says more about Americans' idealization of youth than it does about what it actually feels like to be young today. The 2024 World Happiness Report found that when American adults were asked to rate the extent to which they were living their “best possible life,” those over 60 answered the most positively, followed by 45-to-59-year-olds. People younger than 30 trailed behind. Still, the idea that young adults ought to be at peak happiness is tough to shake, a cliché passed down by older people who know better. A 2021 YouGov poll found that the group most likely to think that their 20s would be their best years are 18- and 19-year-olds who haven't yet experienced them.

For 25 years, I've worked as a developmental clinical psychologist specializing in 20-somethings. Often, when I tell people about my work, their responses are dismissive or confused. They wonder what young people—without the challenges of partners or kids or mortgages or aging bodies—could be so unhappy about. But 20-somethings are the least likely group to have the things that make people happy and healthy: secure homes and careers, stable love lives and friendships. What they do have is more than their share of firsts and worsts with respect to jobs, bosses, relationships, breakups, roommates, and apartments. It's rough. And it's gotten rougher: Rates of depression and anxiety among 20-somethings spiked during the early coronavirus pandemic. Nevertheless, young adults have long been more likely than older adults to struggle with their mental health—at least since I saw my first client, in 1999.

Over the past three decades, adult sources of stability have become more and more likely to be realized in one's 30s rather than one's 20s. Today's young workers will have, on average, nine different jobs by age 37. Only about 40 percent of American adults under 30 say they find their work fulfilling or enjoyable, while almost a quarter say it is overwhelming (these figures improve with age). According to the Pew Research Center, the current crop of young adults is better educated and better paid than their late-20th-century counterparts, yet as of 2024, fewer than half of 25-to-29-year-olds were completely financially independent, and only two-thirds of people in their early 30s were—at least in part because of student debt.

The road toward occupational and financial security is long and winding, and this affects life outside of work as well. It contributes to the fact that, contrary to what Instagram posts may lead us to believe, young adulthood can be the loneliest time of life. Twenty-somethings are the group most likely to move in any given year—often to follow a job or look for a better one—leaving friends and support systems scattered. And with only half married by 35, young adults spend much of their life between families, no longer in their childhood home but not yet in the one they'll create on their own. The median age of first-time homebuyers, which was 28 in 1991, is now at an all-time high of 40.

Read: The one-size-fits-all narrative about your twenties needs to change

The uncertainty that goes along with not having adult sources of safety—and not knowing if you ever will—is hardly fun. The brain interprets uncertainty as danger. In recent years, researchers have discovered that uncertainty is a stressor that puts us at risk for a wide variety of mental-health concerns, including anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and suicidality. As one 20-something client put it, “I don't have a lot of knowns in my life.”

What many 20-somethings do feel sure of is that they're falling far behind peer, parental, and societal expectations when it comes to meeting adult milestones. One 29-year-old told me that she felt like she was “failing” because she was single and didn't have a more prestigious job. A 27-year-old man explained his hopelessness this way: “People used to have a house and a spouse by now. I see it in the news all the time.” So do I, in research and articles that persist in referencing the norms of 1975.

Comparing what's happening now with what life looked like half a century ago—an era that wasn't so great for everyone—isn't helping anyone. Neither is diagnosing generations and blaming their phones. I'm no fan of social media—nor are most of my clients and students—but young people have bigger problems. In a 2024 survey of university presidents, 86 percent named social media as one of the most important drivers of college mental-health woes, compared with only 33 percent of students themselves. Young adults were more likely to point to the struggle to balance schoolwork with personal, financial, and familial duties.

Telling young adults that if they'd just put down their phone, that'd solve things, or that something's wrong with them if they're not happy, only adds to their concerns. If you want to help a 20-something, have some empathy for the uncertainties they wake up to each day, and show them the data about what's ahead: In a 2022 study of adults in the United States, happiness and satisfaction increased across every decade of adulthood from the late teens to the 70s and beyond. So did every other measure of well-being, including close relationships, financial stability, meaning and purpose, and mental health. Importantly, this study, and others that have found a similar upward slope in well-being, include data from the earliest generation said to have “delayed” adult milestones: Gen Xers, who are now in their 40s, 50s, and 60s.

Young adults may no longer have work and love sorted out in their 20s, but they can use their early adult years to build the kinds of skills and relationships they will still feel good about as they age. This is what we ought to be telling them. They're not delayed or damaged or doomed. They're digging in. I don't expect my 20-something clients to have it all. I do expect them, and 20-somethings everywhere, to become happier and healthier over time, as they become more likely to have—and do—what makes people happier and healthier.

This message matters because young adults who have hope for the future are less likely to feel anxious and depressed. They're more likely to eat well, exercise, and set goals and work toward them. If you don't believe the hype that these are supposed to be the best years of your life, you won't panic when they're not. I tell my clients that if their 20s turn out to be the best years of their life, something has gone seriously wrong. Life can—and does—get better as you go.

My weekend with America's biggest anti-vaxxers

Russell Brand had found his people, that much was clear. Last Saturday, in front of 800 fans in a hotel ballroom in Austin, the comedian doled out praise for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (whom he called “Great Brother Kennedy”), disdain for the medical establishment (“flat-out evil”), and gratitude for Jesus Christ (“Thank God we have a forgiving God that died for us”). He also told a bunch of dick jokes and, later, called me a Nazi.

After the show, I'd asked Brand for an interview, and he told me that the media are “Luciferian,” and that reporters are Nazis. “Do you really think that?” I asked him. “You're more like an individual Nazi,” he said, seemingly a concession that I was just following orders. (I didn't get the interview.)

Brand and his fans had gathered for the annual conference of Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit founded in 2018 by the current secretary of Health and Human Services. Kennedy wasn't there, but the movement's other headliners were. Brand—who is awaiting trial for rape and sexual assault in the U.K. and has pleaded not guilty—was onstage with Kennedy's wife, Cheryl Hines, to promote her memoir. Her publisher, Tony Lyons, was there in his role as president of MAHA Action, a nonprofit that holds weekly Zoom calls to galvanize support for Kennedy's agenda. Also on the scene were Andrew Wakefield, who's infamous for his discredited 1998 Lancet study on the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism, along with newer adherents such as Bret Weinstein, the evolutionary biologist, COVID-vaccine critic, and podcast host.

Everyone I spoke with at the conference shared a distrust of vaccines and a sense that, after they'd spent years on the fringes of scientific discourse, Kennedy's rise to power had given them the legitimacy they once lacked. (The theme of the event was “Moment of Truth.”) As Polly Tommey, the program director of the organization's video-and-audio operation, told the audience: “We never thought Bobby would be health secretary—I mean, come on! We're in the best place we've been for ages!” But what should have been a victory lap at times felt like an attempt to rally the troops, or at least reassure them.

Kennedy's tenure has been turbulent. In less than a year, he's sent mixed signals about the benefits of vaccination during a measles outbreak, fired all of the CDC's outside vaccine advisers and replaced them with his allies, axed the director of the CDC just weeks after she took the job, and stoked fears about prenatal Tylenol use as a cause of autism despite recent conflicting evidence. A string of top CDC officials, including the chief science officer, has resigned, and those who remain say morale has never been lower.

Read: ‘It feels like the CDC is over'

But the Kennedy faithful don't care about the health secretary flouting institutional norms or sidelining subject-matter experts, because they view HHS, and the CDC in particular, as either useless or corrupt. In fact, some at the conference worried that Kennedy is not acting with enough urgency. (In an email, the HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard wrote that Kennedy “remains committed to ensuring that all Americans have access to accurate, evidence-based information about vaccines.”)

They want Kennedy to investigate their belief that the government supposedly colluded with Big Pharma to hide the harms of vaccination. In a session on Saturday afternoon, former Republican Representative Dave Weldon, whose nomination to become CDC director was withdrawn in March amid outcry over his criticism of immunizations, called for the creation of an independent body to investigate vaccine-safety data and report only to Kennedy and President Donald Trump. “If it's in the hands of the CDC, you'll never get the answers you need,” he told the crowd. During a session titled “The Enduring Nightmare of COVID mRNA Technology,” Sherri Tenpenny, a veteran anti-vaccine activist who once said that one goal of COVID vaccination was to turn people into “transhumanist cyborgs,” called for the mRNA-based vaccines to be taken off the market: “It's just the next level of atrocity of how they want to damage us and make us customers for life.” Mark Gorton, the founder of LimeWire who is now president of the MAHA Institute, a think tank, favors stopping routine shots altogether until they've undergone further testing. “The medical establishment will scream that plagues will sweep across the land,” he said from the stage. “We need to counter that their plague of vaccine poisoning is already amongst us.”

Read: The neo-anti-vaxxers are in power now

Other attendees were frank about their attempts to personally influence Kennedy. Steve Kirsch, a former tech executive turned anti-vaccine activist, told me at the conference that he texts directly with the health secretary. After getting vaccinated against COVID, Kirsch became convinced that the shot was unsafe and began campaigning against it. He said he later took a supplement marketed to remove spike proteins from the body, which he now blames for causing him to go blind in one eye. Kirsch told me he recently sent Kennedy some data from the Czech Republic that he believes prove that COVID shots increase mortality rates. (Multiple studies have shown that the vaccines reduce mortality rates, particularly in those over 60.) He is frustrated that he hasn't heard back yet. “Kennedy's taking baby steps, and that's a big problem,” Kirsch told me. (When I asked Hilliard about Kennedy's correspondence with Kirsch, she did not provide an answer.)

Although the MAHA merch table sold hats with slogans such as RAW MILK IS MILK and MAKE FRYING OIL TALLOW AGAIN, the attire of conference-goers was mostly vaccine-themed: One popular T-shirt featured an illustration of a syringe with the message COME AND MAKE ME. Mary Holland, the chief executive officer of Children's Health Defense, began the conference by listing some of the environmental triggers that she believes cause chronic childhood disease, including stress, ultra-processed food, and electromagnetic radiation; attendees were asked to switch their phones to airplane mode out of consideration for those sensitive to Wi-Fi. But as she told the crowd, “It is in large part—predominantly—the vaccines.” Gorton agreed. “There's been a lot of progress in terms of the MAHA movement, but if you look at real, meaningful changes in the health system, they're trivial,” he said. He characterized the general feeling about the progress that's been made since Kennedy became secretary as “mixed.”

The forces aligned against Kennedy, everyone at the conference seemed to agree, are formidable. Leslie Manookian, the president of the Health Freedom Defense Fund and the author of a recently passed Idaho law that makes vaccine mandates illegal, railed against the “pit of vipers” that Kennedy must deal with in Washington. In a session titled “Sustaining the Promise of Freedom Through Action,” the crowd applauded when Joseph Ladapo, Florida's surgeon general, announced that the reporters from The Atlantic and The Washington Post in the room “represent forces who are working toward the enslavement of humanity”—though he allowed that he had “nothing against them.” (As The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, told the Post, “In fact, The Atlantic is not working towards the enslavement of humanity, but I appreciate his concern.”) Ladapo spent most of his speech expounding on his experience with psychotherapy and his relationship with his wife. The day after Brand declined to speak with me and called me a Nazi, Alex Jones posted a two-hour interview in which a bathrobe-clad Brand dismissed the allegations against him as a “governmental and media operation.”

Several speakers counseled patience in the face of such powerful enemies, encouraging attendees to keep their faith in Kennedy. Wakefield (who received a hero's welcome himself) insisted that Kennedy was on the right path: “We need, collectively, to give Bobby Kennedy—a very, very brave and smart man—the support he needs to get through the next round.” Del Bigtree, who served as communications director for Kennedy's presidential campaign and identified himself as a lifelong Democrat, emphasized the importance of Republicans doing well in next year's midterms so that Kennedy can continue to carry out the “Make America Healthy Again” agenda.

Kennedy may not have gone far enough yet in realizing the goals of the so-called medical-freedom movement, Bigtree said, but given enough time and popular support, he still might: “We've got to hold it together so that Bobby can just work.”

How a neo-Nazi infiltrated so deep into the Republican Party.

For the past few weeks, conservatives have been having a heated and divisive debate about antisemitism and the sorts of characters that can or cannot be part of the Republican Party. At the center of this argument is a 27-year-old white supremacist and far-right political influencer who hosts an online show called America First with Nicholas J. Fuentes.

On his show, Fuentes shares Christian nationalist, misogynistic, and antisemitic takes with hundreds of thousands of viewers. And it's because of his audience — which has grown since the death of fellow far-right commentator Charlie Kirk — that longtime conservative talk show host Tucker Carlson decided to sit down with him for a friendly conversation.

The backlash came immediately, partially because of recent instances in which Republican officials have been associated with Nazi beliefs and symbols, including the leaked messages of young GOP leaders making jokes about gas chambers, and an American flag merged with a swastika hanging inside the Capitol Hill office of Rep. Dave Taylor (R-OH). But the controversy also rippled out because “[Fuentes] has become incredibly more powerful, and he knows it too. So he's able to leverage that to get people to pay attention to him,” Wired's disinformation and online extremism reporter David Gilbert told Today, Explained co-host Noel King.

Can Fuentes really sway how young conservatives think and vote? Gilbert, who has been watching Fuentes intensely, says yes. He spoke with King to explain Fuentes's allure to young men and to help frame Fuentes within the modern GOP.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What is the tenor of Nick Fuentes's show, for people who have only a passing awareness of him? 

It's pretty well structured. He typically talks about one or two of the biggest stories of the day in his world, at least for a couple of hours. And it's just him talking straight to camera. He's not talking from a script; he's not talking from a teleprompter. But he's incredibly good at speaking off the cuff. He covers a lot of the infighting within the right-wing media. He talks about immigration quite a lot. He obviously talks about the Trump administration quite a lot.

But I suppose one of the main, or the main topic he talks about — and it typically comes back to this every single time — is a deeply antisemitic worldview that he has, that he blames Israel and the Jewish people for all the ills of society.

So there are different strands here: There's the anti-Israel sentiment; there's the antisemitic sentiment; there's the anti-immigrant sentiment. How would you describe his worldview? What does he represent? 

He has a pretty hateful worldview. I think what really is surprising of what we've seen most recently — where his profile has risen and he has kind of been embraced by more mainstream members of the right — is the fact that they're kind of ignoring the fact that he has espoused support for Hitler in the past, that he has talked about raping women as not being that problematic.

He has these really hateful views about the world, where he feels as if he, as a white male Christian (he's a Catholic) is being attacked, and that his homeland is under attack from all these various [forces], whether it's feminism or the woke mob, as he calls it — “the woke mind virus.” He believes that he is the one that is under attack, that white males and especially white Christian males, have been sidelined in their own country. And that's kind of at the crux of what he believes […]

He didn't vote for Donald Trump in the election. He didn't tell his followers to vote, because he felt that Trump was just not being “America First” enough. In terms of JD Vance, it's even worse. He thinks Vance has let down American men by not marrying a white Christian woman. He has said that if JD Vance decides that he is going to run in 2028, which looks like he will, and if the GOP nominates him, then Fuentes will unleash a campaign using his supporters to undermine that candidacy.

In the past couple of years, there has been a cohort of young conservative men and women who have varying relationships with one another, and feuds and alliances and whatnot.

Talk to me about where Fuentes fits in this spectrum of right-wing personalities and what his relationships with them are like. 

It's really interesting, and it's not something that is the same as it was five, six, seven years ago, when he was coming up after Unite the Right. When he began getting noticed, he was viewed as this kind of an outlier, this fringe figure who was not really taken with any level of seriousness. And so he was not really being discussed in the same terms as figures like Charlie Kirk, Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens.

More recently, those same figures have had to pay attention to him because his audience has grown, especially in the last six months. [Fuentes] has become incredibly more powerful — and he knows it, too. So he's able to leverage that to get people to pay attention to him.

We saw, obviously, Tucker Carlson interviewed him recently, which is the most high-profile interview he's had to date. But we've seen figures like Alex Jones, Candace Owens — they've all had him on their podcasts. And they have varying levels of arguments between themselves.

His main antagonist and the person he fought with most was Charlie Kirk, dating back to 2019, when they began what Fuentes labeled the Groyper War — “Groypers” being the name for the people who support Nick Fuentes.

So what he did then was, when Charlie Kirk was going around to colleges, speaking and debating with people, he would get his supporters to go there and question Charlie Kirk about his support for Israel, question him on immigration, question him on the things that Fuentes believed Charlie Kirk was not being questioned enough about, and where he felt he could be attacked because he wasn't being conservative enough; he wasn't being “America First” enough.

Tucker Carlson said [that] he was just talking to Nick Fuentes, and that he doesn't necessarily agree with all the things he said. But at the same time, he's engaging with him. And I think for Fuentes, that is the win. That's what he wants. He wants people to be able to see him.

Why do so many people who seem to disagree with him still invite him on and still talk to him? There is something I assume that they are getting as well. What is this about? 

I think people like Tucker Carlson are afraid of being left behind. Because they clearly understand that Fuentes has tapped into something. His audience is this young, white male audience that is incredibly powerful, and people don't want to miss out. So by Tucker Carlson interviewing him, Tucker Carlson gets a little bit of that aura that Fuentes projects to his supporters.

I think that's the main reason, is that they know Fuentes will drive engagement. If you look at the numbers on Tucker's video, it's huge compared to the others that were posted for the last couple of weeks.

What makes Fuentes so successful? 

I think the fact that he openly talks about the fact that he isn't in a relationship, hasn't really ever had a relationship with a woman, is one of them [his audience] — is one of the people he speaks to: These young men who may be struggling to find their identity in the US, who may be struggling to get a job, struggling to find a house, struggling to find a relationship or a community of friends. Fuentes tapped into that.

There's been an evolution of Nick Fuentes in the last six months, where he has seen his star rise. He has gained a huge amount of followers online; way more people are watching his show every night. Now he's earning a huge amount of money from that show. And he is in a position now that I don't think he even believed he would be back, we'll say, in 2020, when he was kicked off of YouTube and every other platform.

He's in a position now where he can enforce change, I think, within the Republican Party from the inside. He's smart enough to do it by not creating an organization where people can be identified as members of the Nick Fuentes fan club. He tells his followers: Don't identify yourself as Groypers. Do it under the radar. Become a member of your local Republican Party, influence people from the inside, not from the outside.

It's very hard to verify this completely, but he says he's got supporters within the administration. He has got supporters all across the country who are infiltrating local political parties. He is, from the ground up, going to try and influence how the Republican Party acts over the next 10 years. And he's doing it really smartly and in a really dangerous way that it's very, very hard for anyone to know what's happening.

New data shows foreign PhD enrollment remains steady, but the risks to America's foreign talent pipeline are growing.

For most of the 20th century, the center of gravity in science was anywhere but the US. On the eve of World War II, the great laboratories were in Europe, and American research — especially in physics — was widely seen as trailing them.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

Then came the “scientific exodus”: Foreign refugees from fascism — like Einstein, Fermi, Bethe, Szilard, von Neumann, and others — remade US science. One reason we won the war is because America collected foreign talent while its enemies expelled it. And Washington locked in that advantage postwar by building Vannevar Bush's vision of federally funded university science, which turned the country into a scientific superpower, leaving the rest of the world as one big talent pool.

Eight decades later, the US has started turning off that spigot. In June, the Trump administration suspended or curtailed visas from 19 countries, explicitly hitting student and exchange categories. This spring, it even terminated thousands of student SEVIS records — the official Department of Homeland Security status files for international students — before reversing course under legal pressure. August arrival records showed a roughly 19 percent year-over-year drop in new international student entries. That represented the biggest non-pandemic decline on record, even as surveys showed top researchers planning to leave the US in droves.

For an economy that runs on scientific innovation, this is a self-own of historic levels

So, here's the (measured) good news: Despite what appears to be the Trump administration's best efforts, new federal data reported by Nature shows that international PhD numbers are essentially flat year over year. That's not a triumph, but it's not the crash many feared — not yet — and it buys time to mount the political resistance needed to keep America's foreign talent engine running.

It's important to understand that, in the fields that power the technological frontier — computer science, engineering, math — international students are not a rounding error; they are the majority of new US PhDs. In 2023, temporary-visa holders earned 62 percent of computer and information sciences doctorates, 56 percent of engineering PhDs, and 53 percent of math and statistics doctorates.

And contrary to arguments that the US is educating foreign students only to see them take their talents elsewhere, many of those researchers stick around. Roughly three-quarters of international science and engineering PhDs from the 2017–2019 cohorts were still in the US five years later. Keep the pipeline open, and the US keeps the labs, grants, and startup ecosystem that rely on them humming. Close it, and we'll feel the loss in capacity, not just headcount.

Perhaps you're thinking that, if the US restricts foreign students, more seats will go to American-born candidates. But we don't have enough of those candidates.

While more US citizens and permanent residents have been pursuing and attaining science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees over the past decade, the growth in graduate degrees has been uneven, including a 3 percent year-over-year dip in 2022. Far too many American students aren't ready to take those places. 15-year-olds in the US scored below 25 other international education systems in math, while only 15 percent of ACT-tested high school graduates met the standardized test's STEM readiness benchmark in 2023.

If every foreign student in STEM left the US tomorrow, we would barely have a STEM sector. Compare that to China, which is already minting nearly twice the number of STEM PhDs as the US and doing it almost entirely with domestic talent. Yes, China has four times the population, but that's partially the point. To compete, America can't only rely on its own resources.

You can see the downstream payoff of foreign scientific talent everywhere innovation is actually measured. Immigrants produce about 23 percent of US patents — far above their share of the population — and their patents are, on average, at least as influential when judged by citations and market value.

Those discoveries transform into prosperity. Forty-six percent of the companies in the current Fortune 500 were founded by an immigrant or the child of one. In the startup economy, immigrants have founded 55 percent of US “unicorns” (billion-dollar startups), while a large majority of top private AI firms have at least one immigrant founder. A nontrivial share of those founders first came as international students. The country's most dynamic sectors — chips, AI, biotech — are the ones that lean hardest on global talent. Just ask Jensen Huang, the Taiwan-born founder of the AI chip firm Nvidia, who came to the US as a 9-year-old and now runs the most valuable company in the world.

The same pattern shows up at the very top of the scientific pyramid. Since 2000, immigrants have won roughly 40 percent of the Nobel Prizes awarded to Americans in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine. This year, both Jordan-born Omar Mwannes Yaghi, who moved to the US at 9, and Netherlands-born Joel Mokyr, who came to America as a grad student, added to that list. These wins aren't a coincidence; it's what happens when a research system reliably attracts and retains the world's best.

So, the fact that international student enrollment is holding steady for now is reassuring — but only if we take advantage of it. The United States became a scientific superpower by building great labs and then keeping the doors open to the people who wanted to work in them. If we keep that promise — stable study-to-work pathways, predictable visa processing, no sudden rule changes — the evidence suggests those researchers will come, contribute disproportionately to scientific discoveries and new business ventures, and, in many cases, stay.

If we don't, the losses will show up exactly where we can least afford them: fewer grant-winning teams, fewer breakthrough patents, fewer deep-tech startups, fewer laureates, and a country that goes from leading to following.

Google's next big AI rollout is imminent. It could cement a turnaround that's been three years in the making.

Gemini 3.0, the company's next large language model, is expected to drop very soon. Company employees are teasing it. CEO Sundar Pichai has said it will be out by the end of the year. Brace for impact.

Anticipation has reached fever pitch on X and in various Discord channels, where AI truthers are convinced Gemini 3 is already out in the wild. Google has a history of testing its models semi-secretly, so this might not be a total conspiracy.

But it's not just them. Gemini 3 is the name on lips across the AI industry, which is waiting to see what Google pulls out of the hat. Expectations are high that Gemini 3 will be better at coding and multimedia generation (a better version of Nano Banana, Google's viral image tool, is expected to be part of the new model).

Since ChatGPT's launch in late 2022, the narrative surrounding Google has been one of a sleepy incumbent playing catch-up. There was truth to that. Facing its first existential threat in a long time, Google quickly pivoted teams in an effort to push generative AI into many of its top products.

In the time since, the drowsy giant has sprung to life. Gemini users are soaring. AI has (so far) not rocked Google's advertising cash cow. Calls for Pichai to resign have quietened.

To catch up, Google has tapped its ""full-stack"" advantage: It not only builds the models, but also has distribution channels through its products, plus infrastructure from its cloud business.

That's how Google has largely stayed out of the increasingly tangled web of AI companies that are tapping each other for help and fueling fears of a bubble.

Google also has a huge open goal in front of it. OpenAI's highly anticipated ChatGPT 5 landed this year with more of a fizz than a bang. Was it simply a signal that AI was hitting its ""boring"" era? Or did OpenAI no longer have the juice?

If Gemini 3 is a smash hit — and right now, insiders tell Business Insider that the new model is extremely impressive — then it could give Google a shot at taking the top spot, a position it has been vying to reclaim since the generative AI boom began.

That would be a bad scenario for OpenAI, which doesn't have the stack Google has and has so far stayed ahead in the race thanks largely to a first-mover advantage and many industry alliances.

Google still has a brand problem to solve. ChatGPT is still the ""Kleenex"" of AI — the first name that often springs to mind when talking about the technology. It is to chatbots what ""Google"" became to online search.

It's also got a lot of catching up to do with OpenAI for users. Google said its Gemini app has hit 650 million monthly active users, while ChatGPT has about 800 million weekly active users.

Gemini's growing popularity among younger users will help, but there's still a large gap to close.

The company's yearslong bets on cloud, chips, and researchers are finally paying off. If Gemini 3 is a smash hit, Google just has to not fumble it.

No pressure.

You might be hugging your job, but the big boss — not so much.

CEO departures across corporate America remain at record levels, while many everyday workers are clinging to their roles as they face a cooling job market, anxiety over AI, and a resurgent no-nonsense management style.

The result is a corporate split screen: CEOs can generally roll out and land on their feet, while workers feel stuck, said Richard Smith, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School.

Unlike many rank-and-file employees who rely on regular paychecks and fear layoffs, erstwhile CEOs often have a financial cushion. That means they don't have to worry if they go a year or two without working, he said.

""As the old saying goes, it's good to be at the top,"" Smith told Business Insider.

Whether it's worries about job security or just a painful hangover from the role-swapping frenzy of the Great Resignation, metrics like worker engagement and well-being are down.

Smith, who runs the Human Capital Development Lab at Johns Hopkins, has surveyed US employees annually since 2019 and, in newly tabulated data from 2024 involving more than 1.3 million workers, found that managers and senior leaders reported greater rates of well-being than the average employee.

That's a reversal, he said, from the early days of the pandemic, when managers reported lower well-being than workers as leaders were fretting over challenges like running remote teams.

Smith said many workers are now grappling with quality-of-life concerns, such as return-to-office mandates. In other cases, some employees are feeling threatened by AI or otherwise sensing that employers' demands for their skills are softening. For many workers, he said, it's leading to a sense of, ""I can't make a move right now.""

CEOs, for various reasons, don't appear to be as constrained.

By the end of September, 1,650 CEOs at US companies had departed, reports Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The 2025 exits are in line with 2024, which saw the highest annual level since the staffing and coaching firm began tracking CEO turnover in 2002.

Some of the chiefs making moves have high profiles. Linda Yaccarino, who had been running X, stepped down in July. And Spotify's cofounder and CEO, Daniel Ek, plans to become executive chairman of the streaming service in January. On Friday, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, 59, said he would retire in January after about a decade in the role.

CEOs' tenures are also getting shorter. Departing chiefs had been on the job 7.2 years as of the third quarter, less than the average of 8.4 years in 2021 and 2023, the leadership advisory firm Russell Reynolds Associates found.

Not all CEOs give up their jobs because they want to, of course. Boards can be quick to oust underperformers because directors are under a lot of pressure from shareholders, Jesse Fried, a professor at Harvard Law School, told Business Insider.

The third quarter of 2025 saw record levels of global shareholder activism, Barclays reports.

Broadly, CEOs have more things to juggle than leaders did decades ago, Fried said.

""The environment has become much more dynamic, which makes their job harder,"" he said.

The exits come as those in the corner office are also generally getting paid more — a development that Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett assailed on Monday in a letter to shareholders.

CEOs earned a median of 176.7 times what their typical employee made in 2020, rising to 194.5 times in 2024, the data firm Equilar found.

Regardless, hefty pay packages can give CEOs a big cushion to fall back on if they get the boot — or simply get antsy.

In many cases, Fried said, ""If they never want to work again, they can do that.""

In this article

Alphabet and Disney on Friday announced that they've reached a deal to restore content from ABC and ESPN onto Google's YouTube TV.

The deal comes after a two-week standoff between the two companies that started on Oct. 31. The stalemate resulted in numerous live sporting events, including college football games and two Monday Night Football games, being absent from the popular streaming service.

""We're happy to share that we've reached an agreement with Disney that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers and future flexibility in our offers,"" YouTube said in a statement. ""Subscribers should see channels including ABC, ESPN and FX returning to their service over the course of the day, as well as any recordings that were previously in their Library. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers' patience as we negotiated on their behalf.""

Disney Entertainment's co-chairs Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, said in a statement that said the agreement reflects ""how audiences choose to watch"" entertainment.

""We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football,"" they said.

More than 20 Disney-owned channels were removed from YouTube TV, which offered its subscribers $20 credits this week due to the dispute. In addition to ABC and ESPN, other networks that were unavailable included FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. 

The main sticking point between the two companies was the rate Disney charges YouTube TV for its networks. Disney's most valuable channel, ESPN, charges carriage of more than $10 a month per pay-TV subscriber, a higher fee than any other network in the U.S., CNBC previously reported.

It's not the first conflict this year between YouTube and legacy media.

NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement in October, preventing shows like ""Sunday Night Football"" and ""America's Got Talent"" from being pulled.

YouTube TV also found itself in a standoff with Fox in August that almost resulted in Fox News, Fox Sports and other Fox channels going dark on the service just before the start of the college football season. The two sides were able to strike a deal to prevent a blackout.

YouTube said it has the option for future program packages with Disney and other partners.

Disney said that access to a selection of live and on-demand programming from ESPN Unlimited, which includes content from ESPN+ and new content on its all-inclusive digital service coming later this year, will be available on YouTube TV to base plan subscribers at no additional cost by the end of 2026.

Here's the memo that Disney executives sent to employees:

Team,

We're pleased to share that we've reached a new agreement with YouTube TV, and all of our stations and networks are in the process of being restored to the service.

While this was a challenging moment, it ultimately led to a strong outcome for both consumers and for our company, with a deal that recognizes the tremendous value of the high-quality entertainment, sports, and news that fans have come to expect from Disney.

Over the past few years, we've led the way in creating innovative deals with key partners –each one unique, and each designed to recognize the full value of our programming. This new agreement reflects that same creativity and commitment to doing what's best for both our audiences and our business.

We're proud of the work that went into this deal and grateful to everyone who helped make it happen — especially Sean Breen, Jimmy Zasowski, and the Platform Distribution team for their tireless commitment throughout this process.

Thank you all for your patience and professionalism over the past several weeks. As you all know, the media landscape continues to evolve quickly, which makes these types of negotiations complex. What hasn't changed is our focus on the viewer. Our priority is — and will always be — delivering the best experiences and the best value to fans, and we'll continue working closely with our partners to ensure we're fulfilling that mission for our audiences.

We're incredibly optimistic about what's ahead and grateful to all of you for continuing to set the standard for entertainment around the world.

Alan, Dana & Jimmy

In this article

At ThredUp's 600,000-square-foot warehouse in Suwanee, Georgia, roughly 40,000 pieces of used clothing are processed each day. The company's logistics network — four facilities across the U.S. — now rivals that of some fast-fashion giants.

""This is the largest garment-on-hanger system in the world,"" said Justin Pina, ThredUp's senior director of operations. ""We can hold more than 3.5 million items here.""Secondhand shopping is booming. The global secondhand apparel market is expected to reach $367 billion by 2029, growing almost three times faster than the overall apparel market, according to GlobalData.President Donald Trump's tariffs were billed as a way to bring manufacturing back home. But the measures hit one of America's most import-dependent industries: fashion. About 97 percent of clothing sold in the U.S. is imported, mostly from China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and India, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.For years, Gen Z shoppers have been driving the rise of secondhand fashion, but now more Americans are catching on.""When tariffs raise those costs, resale platforms suddenly look like the smart buy. This isn't just a fad,"" said Jasmine Enberg, co-CEO of Scalable. ""Tariffs are accelerating trends that were already reshaping the way Americans shop.""For James Reinhart, ThredUp's CEO, the company is already seeing it play out.

""The business is free-cash-flow positive and growing double digits,"" said Reinhart. ""We feel really good about the economics, gross margins near 80% and operations built entirely within the U.S.""ThredUp reported that revenue grew 34% year over year in the third quarter. The company also said it acquired more new customers in the quarter than at any other time in its history, with new buyer growth up 54% from the same period last year.

""If tariffs add 20% to 30% to retail prices, that's a huge advantage for resale,"" said Dylan Carden, research analyst at William Blair & Company. ""Pre-owned items aren't subject to those duties, so demand naturally shifts.""

Inside the ThredUp warehouse, where CNBC got a behind-the-scenes look. automation hums alongside human workers. AI systems photograph, categorize, and price thousands of garments per hour. For Reinhart, the technology is key to scaling resale like retail.

""AI has really accelerated adoption,"" said Reinhart. ""It's helping us improve discovery, styling, and personalization for buyers.""

That tech wave extends beyond ThredUp. Fashion-tech startups Phia, co-founded by Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni, is using AI to scan thousands of listings across retail and resale in seconds.

""The fact that we've driven millions in transaction volume shows how big this need is,"" Gates said. ""People want smarter, cheaper ways to shop.""

ThredUp is betting that domestic infrastructure, automation, and AI will keep it ahead of the curve, and that tariffs meant to revive U.S. manufacturing could end up powering a new kind of American fashion economy.

""The future of fashion will be more sustainable than it is today,"" said Reinhart. ""And secondhand will be at the center of it.""

In this article

As Warren Buffett gets closer to stepping down as CEO at the end of next month, he told shareholders he will be ""going quiet,"" but only ""sort of.""

More on his Thanksgiving letter, which looks like it could become a substantial annual tradition, below.

First:

There was a notable surprise in Berkshire Hathaway's end-of-Q3 equity portfolio snapshot, released after Friday's closing bell.

Someone in Omaha purchased more than 17.8 million Class A shares of Google's parent, Alphabet.

They are currently valued at $4.9 billion, making them the biggest Q3 addition in dollar terms.

The news sent the stock 3.5% higher in after-hours trading.

At this point, we don't know who made the call.

Buffett has typically made purchases of this size, but it doesn't feel like his kind of stock.

It is up 51.3% year-to-date, including a 37% climb in the third quarter.

Also, he has traditionally shied away from tech stocks. (He considers Apple a consumer products company.)

At the 2019 Berkshire meeting, Buffett and Charlie Munger lamented that they had ""screwed up"" by not buying Alphabet earlier because they ""could see in our own operations how well that Google advertising was working. And we just sat there sucking our thumbs.""

On that day, the shares were going for around $59, and they gave no indication there were prepared to rectify their error.

Incoming CEO Greg Abel isn't encumbered by that history, and Buffett has been handing over many of his duties to him.

Or it could be one or both of the portfolio managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs.

Stay tuned.

Alphabet was by far the biggest Q3 addition at $4.3 billion, based on the September 30 price, well ahead of a $1.2 billion increase for Chubb.

The biggest decreases, Apple and Bank of America, had been foreshadowed by hints in Berkshire's 10-Q almost two weeks ago.

(The Verisign reduction was disclosed in early August.)

Berkshire's Apple position was cut by almost 15%, or $10.6 billion, to around 238 million shares.

It's down 74% since Berkshire began selling two years ago.

But Apple remains Berkshire's largest equity position at $64.9 billion, which is 21% of the portfolio's current value.

The Bank of America reduction was smaller, just 6.1%, or around $1.9 billion.

The remaining 568 million shares are currently valued at $29.9 billion, Berkshire's third largest position, making up almost 10% of the portfolio's current value.

It's been cut by 43% since early last year.

A complete listing of Berkshire's Q3 13F appears below. 

Many of the headlines on news stories about Warren Buffett's Thanksgiving letter on Monday included this quotation: ""I'm 'going quiet.'""

But there was another phrase that followed that line near the top of the letter, getting its own paragraph: ""Sort of.""

Starting next year, Greg Abel, ""a great manager, a tireless worker and an honest communicator,"" will be writing the annual meeting to shareholders and answering questions at the annual meeting. Buffett plans to sit on the arena floor with the other directors.

But he wrote, ""I will continue talking to you and my children about Berkshire via my annual Thanksgiving message.""

This year's letter ran a bit more than seven pages, compared to around three pages last year, and sounded a lot like the annual letters he's been writing for decades, with sections on the importance of luck, getting old, his admiration for Berkshire shareholders, the many friends he has made over the years in Omaha, and his complete confidence in Abel's ability to run the company.

He also revealed that while hospitalized as a child, he received a fingerprint kit and proceeded to take prints from the nuns caring for him, because ""someday a nun would go bad, and the FBI would find that they had neglected to fingerprint nuns.""

(CNBC.com has this summary)

The newsiest bit was his plan to ""step up the pace of lifetime gifts"" to the three foundations run by his children, who, like Buffett, are getting older. (They are 72,70, and 67.)

He wants to ""improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them.""

But he also ""wants to keep a significant amount of 'A' shares until Berkshire shareholders develop the comfort with Greg that Charlie and I long enjoyed.""

The result, at least for this year, is an increase in the Class B shares (converted from Class A) going to each foundation to 400,000 shares from 300,000 shares last year.

Including a fourth unchanged donation to a foundation named after his late wife, the total as of the date of the gifts increased 17% to $1.3 billion.

Playing a more minor role: Class B shares are up 4% since last year's gifts.

Former Federal Reserve Board Gov. Adriana Kugler last year broke the central bank's rules barring trading of individual stocks and executing financial transactions close to meetings where interest rates are set, according to a report by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics released Saturday.

The report comes three months after Kugler abruptly and mysteriously resigned from the Fed's Board of Governors without giving a reason. Kugler joined the Fed in September 2023 after being appointed by then-President Joe Biden.

Fed officials familiar with the matter told CNBC that concerns related to trading activity by her or her husband date to at least September 2024, when she began working with ethics officials to resolve violations of trading policies.

A financial disclosure report that Kugler filed with the OGE this year on Sept. 11 — which contains details of securities transactions by either her or her husband — notes that an Ethics Office official declined to certify the report on Friday.

In a note on the disclosure, an Ethics official says, ""Matters related to this disclosure were referred earlier this year"" by the office to the independent Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. An inspector general is an internal ethics watchdog for federal departments and agencies.

Another note on the report says, ""Consistent with her September 15, 2024, disclosure, certain trading activity was carried out by Dr. Kugler's spouse, without Dr. Kugler's knowledge and she affirms that her spouse did not intend to violate any rules or policies.""

Kugler is married to Ignacio Donoso, who is an immigration lawyer.

Her disclosure shows two kinds of violations of Fed rules regarding financial transactions by senior officials at the central bank: purchases of stock shares of individual companies, as opposed to mutual funds; and purchases of securities during so-called ""blackout periods"" leading up to and after meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee.

The FOMC meetings set key interest rates. Speculation about those meetings and their actual outcome can significantly affect the prices of stocks and bonds.

Kugler's violations were related to purchases of stock in companies including Apple, Southwest Airlines, Caterpillar and Cava Group, the report indicates.

Kugler participated in FOMC meetings during her tenure at the Fed. But she missed the FOMC's meeting this past July due to what the Fed had publicly said was a personal matter.

Shortly before the July meeting, Kugler asked for a waiver on the Ethics disclosure filing deadline to address the issue of impermissible holdings within her investment portfolio, Fed officials told CNBC.

Two months earlier, she had asked for and received a standard extension for filing annual ethics disclosures, officials said

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, given the repeated efforts to deal with Kugler's issues, denied her request for another waiver, which led to her not participating in the FOMC meeting in July.

Shortly afterward, on Aug. 1, Kugler announced her intention to resign on Aug. 8

In another disclosure filed in October 2024, Kugler likewise pointed a finger at her husband Donoso for four stock purchases — three of Apple shares in July that year, and one of Cava shares that September — which violated Fed trading rules.

""These four purchases were carried out by my spouse, without my knowledge, and I affirm that my spouse did not intend to violate any rules,"" Kugler said at the time.

""Upon learning about the purchases, I immediately notified ethics officials, and at their direction, I initiated divestiture of these assets as soon as possible under FOMC ethics policies.""

CNBC has reached out to Kugler and to the Fed for comment on the new Ethics disclosure report, which also discloses that Kugler received more than $41,000 worth of ""pro bono legal services"" from the law firm Arnold & Porter.

Pro Bono means for free.

CNBC has also requested comment from Donoso.

After she resigned from the Fed, Kugler returned to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where she is a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy and Economics.

In early 2022, the Fed adopted new rules that banned officials from trading in individual stocks and bonds, as well as cryptocurrencies.

That move came after revelations that then-regional Fed presidents Eric Rosengren of Boston and Robert Kaplan of Dallas traded stocks and stock funds shortly before the central bank adopted broad measures to support the U.S. economy during the first weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Rosengren and Kaplan were cleared of any legal wrongdoing, but both of them resigned amid questions about the propriety of Fed officials possibly using privileged information for financial gain. Other trades from Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, also faced scrutiny and drew intense criticism from the public and on Capitol Hill.

Kugler's surprise resignation allowed President Donald Trump to appoint Stephen Miran to replace her for the remainder of her term on the Fed Board of Governors.

Miran, whose current term ends on Jan. 31, took an unpaid leave of absence as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors.

In 2024, the Fed's inspector general found that Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who is retiring in February, violated trading rules.

Oops, something went wrong

Harvard University has expanded its Bitcoin ETF holdings by 257% in the third quarter, making the iShares Bitcoin Trust its largest disclosed position with 6.8 million shares valued at $442.8 million as of September 30.

The move represents one of the most significant institutional endorsements of Bitcoin exposure among elite university endowments, ranking Harvard as the 16th-largest holder of the BlackRock-managed fund.

The latest 13F filing shows Harvard increased its stake from 1.9 million shares reported in June, while simultaneously growing its gold ETF holdings by 99% to 661,391 shares worth $235 million.

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted the rarity of top-tier endowments purchasing ETFs, calling it “as good a validation as an ETF can get.“

Harvard's substantial Bitcoin allocation stands in contrast to earlier predictions from its own economics faculty.

Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, stated in 2018 that Bitcoin would more likely trade at $100 than $100,000 within a decade.

“I think bitcoin will be worth a tiny fraction of what it is now if we're headed out 10 years from now,” Rogoff told CNBC, adding that removing money laundering and tax evasion would leave Bitcoin with “very small” transaction uses.

He argued that government regulation would trigger price drops, though he acknowledged such frameworks would take time to develop globally.

Rogoff recently reflected on his earlier assessment, acknowledging that he had misjudged Bitcoin's role in the global underground economy and underestimated the regulatory conflicts of interest.

“I was far too optimistic about the US coming to its senses about sensible cryptocurrency regulation,” he wrote in his new book Our Dollar, Your Problem.

He added that he “did not anticipate a situation where regulators, and especially the regulator in chief, would be able to brazenly hold hundreds of millions (if not billions) of dollars in cryptocurrencies seemingly without consequence given the blatant conflict of interest.“

Balchunas referenced Rogoff's earlier skepticism, noting it “must feel so great” for Bitcoin advocates to see Harvard's institutional validation.

The $443 million position represents approximately 0.75% of Harvard's $57 billion endowment.

However, Bitwise analyst Ryan Rasmussen predicts that this allocation will grow to 1% and eventually 5% as peer institutions follow suit.

Harvard joins a widening cohort of institutional investors increasing cryptocurrency exposure through regulated investment vehicles.

The State of Michigan Retirement System tripled its Bitcoin ETF holdings to 300,000 shares valued at $11.4 million in the second quarter, while maintaining a $13.6 million Ethereum position through the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.

The State of Wisconsin Investment Board holds over 6 million shares of BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, worth approximately $387.3 million, making it one of the largest state pension allocations to Bitcoin-linked products.

Meanwhile, Emory University disclosed a $15 million stake in the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust in 2024, becoming one of the first major US endowments to reveal crypto ETF exposure.

Beyond traditional universities, the University of Austin launched a dedicated $5 million Bitcoin fund within its $200 million endowment in February, becoming the first US university endowment to establish a Bitcoin-focused investment.

At that time, Pantera Capital reported an eight-fold increase in endowment and foundation clients since 2018, while Yale University invested in crypto venture funds during Bitcoin's earlier price levels.

Despite growing adoption, some institutional investors remain cautious. Cornell University professor Eswar Prasad warned that cryptocurrency remains “purely speculative financial asset and one that doesn't provide very much hedging relative to other risky assets,” with volatility exceeding that of traditional risky assets.

Brian Neale of the University of Nebraska Foundation told the Financial Times he does not consider cryptocurrency an “institutionally investable” asset class due to limited adoption among traditional allocators.

BitMine Immersion Technologies is rapidly reinventing itself as an equity-funded, Ethereum-heavy corporate treasury, betting big that ETH will become the backbone of global on-chain finance.

Self-custody remains the gold standard for holding cryptocurrencies, but that doesn't mean corporate treasuries can't offer compelling exposure as well. One of the most interesting cases today is BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), a company that has rapidly transformed itself into the largest listed holder of Ethereum (ETH-USD). Understandably, the stock has endured extreme volatility earlier this year, and now stands almost 370% higher year-to-date.





What began as a niche immersion-cooled Bitcoin miner has, under the leadership of chairman and Fundstrat co-founder Thomas Lee, transformed into a full-scale Ethereum-centric treasury vehicle. In just a few months, BitMine has amassed 3,505,723 ETH—an extraordinary milestone that redefines how investors approach corporate crypto exposure. 

More importantly, as digital assets continue to secure a permanent place in investor portfolios, companies like BMNR and Strategy (MSTR) are increasingly standing out as legitimate long-term investment vehicles, rather than mere meme-stock proxies for speculative crypto bets. Given the exotic setup, I'm tentatively Bullish on BMNR.

BitMine's strategic overhaul took place over the summer, when it shifted away from its mining roots and recast itself as an Ethereum treasury vehicle. The company's simple proposition: if Ethereum is becoming the base settlement layer for tokenized finance, then ETH isn't just a digital token—it's infrastructure equity with a native yield. Ethereum's proof-of-stake system allows ETH holders to earn staking rewards in the range of 3–4%, and as of mid-2025, nearly 30% of all ETH is locked in staking.

This thesis is anchored in Ethereum's continued dominance in stablecoins and tokenization. Roughly 70% of all stablecoin supply exists on Ethereum, with stablecoin transactions accounting for about one-third of network fees. The global stablecoin market has already surpassed $300 billion and continues expanding. 

Meanwhile, tokenization is surging: tokenized real-world assets have crossed $30 billion, and when including funds, RWAs, and wrapped instruments, estimates place the Ethereum-based tokenized stack near $200 billion. Major financial institutions—BlackRock (BLK), Franklin Templeton, Fidelity (FNF)—are already building on Ethereum rails. For BitMine, these three pillars—money, capital markets, and staking yield—position ETH as a uniquely powerful treasury asset.

Central to BitMine's thesis is what the company calls the “Alchemy of 5%”: its stated goal to acquire 5% of all Ethereum in existence. With the disclosed 3.5 million ETH stake, BitMine claims to have reached roughly 2.9% of the supply, placing it more than halfway toward its target.

This accumulation has been funded almost entirely through equity issuance. A pivotal $250 million raise at $4.50 per share in June jump-started the strategy, and the company has since layered on at-the-market offerings to steadily buy more ETH. The model is equity-driven and debt-free—no major loans, no bond stack—just relentless issuance to expand the treasury.

However, transparency remains a lingering gap. Unlike MicroStrategy's weekly BTC disclosures, BitMine provides only periodic press releases, leaving questions around how much ETH is actually staked or deployed on-chain. The company may need to adopt more detailed reporting if its aggressive capital-raising continues, especially should it venture into convertibles or preferred equity.

As a treasury-style company, BitMine is best evaluated through its net asset value (NAV). In this week's update, BMNR reported holdings of:

This amounts to approximately $13.2 billion in crypto, equity stakes, and liquid assets. With about 284.7 million shares outstanding and shares trading around $40–41, the market cap is roughly $11.5 billion.

Using the asset values above yields an NAV around $45–46 per share, which would imply a discount—if the share count were accurate. But BitMine's infrequent SEC filings leave the true dilution unclear. A more conservative assumption places NAV closer to $38–40 per share, suggesting the stock may actually trade at a slight premium. Critically, BitMine would not issue stock below NAV, which offers investors a directional hint on valuation.

BMNR currently holds a Moderate Buy consensus on Wall Street, based on the view of two analysts. Fedor Shabalin from Riley Securities and Ashok Kumar from ThinkEquity are both bullish on the stock. In a research note published last month, Shabalin initiated coverage of BMNR and set a $90 price target.

Currently, BMNR stock carries an average stock price target of $90, suggesting ~146% potential upside over the coming year. Of course, the coverage is limited, and the company's rapid dilution means investors must closely track treasury updates.

BitMine Immersion Technologies represents a new breed of corporate balance sheet—one built explicitly around digital monetary infrastructure. The company's unwavering commitment to Ethereum, its belief in on-chain capital markets, and its aggressive accumulation strategy all point toward a long-term bet on ETH becoming foundational financial collateral.

Execution risks and transparency issues remain real. But for investors seeking ETH exposure through equity rather than direct ownership, BMNR offers a uniquely levered and highly focused vehicle. Whether it proves visionary or overly ambitious, BitMine is undeniably positioning itself at the front edge of the on-chain finance transition—and that alone makes it worth watching. For crypto-curious investors with a firm grasp of risk tolerance, BMNR is a good fit.

The crypto-market roller coaster is showing no signs of slowing down. With Bitcoin under severe pressure and altcoins flashing mixed signals, the Solana SOLUSDT price enters the weekend at a critical inflection point. The token's resilience has surprised many traders, but its latest tightening structure suggests a decisive move may be approaching. While some analysts expect a rebound toward $170, others warn that the current range may be masking deeper weakness.

Will Solana defend its key support and stage a late-week recovery, or is the market preparing for another downward swing? The next 48 hours could set the tone for the rest of November.

Current Price Action

Solana SOLUSDT is trading near $141.50, maintaining its footing above the crucial $130–$135 support band that has shaped market structure for several weeks. Earlier dips toward $136 were quickly absorbed, demonstrating that buyers are active at lower levels even as broader sentiment remains shaky. Resistance continues to build near $155–$160, where momentum stalls repeatedly. With price increasingly compressing between these two zones, the next breakout or breakdown is likely to dictate SOL's trend direction in the coming sessions.

Solana Tests the Bottom of Its Long-Term Channel

Solana has slipped to the lower boundary of its multi-month ascending channel, a zone that has acted as a strong accumulation region since early 2023. The weekly candle shows SOL tapping this trendline near $140–$145, signalling that buyers are once again attempting to defend the broader uptrend. However, the recent breakdown into the cloud support region indicates growing market uncertainty, especially after last week's sharp rejection from the mid-channel resistance around $185–$190.

The structure now leaves SOL trapped between two critical levels: the channel support at the bottom and the cloud resistance overhead. A clean rebound from the lower boundary could revive bullish momentum and reopen the path toward $165, followed by $185–$190, where the previous weekly rejection occurred. But sustained weakness below the channel floor would mark the first major structural break in over a year, exposing downside targets at $125 and potentially $110 over the coming weeks.

The narrowing space between channel support and cloud resistance signals an approaching trend resolution—and whichever side breaks first is likely to define Solana's direction into early December.

What to Expect This Weekend

The weekend will likely bring heightened volatility, especially if Bitcoin continues to struggle near its lower range. For Solana, the immediate focus lies on two critical questions:

A bounce from current levels could put the $170 target back on the table as early as next week. But if support gives way, traders should brace for deeper retracements before any meaningful recovery attempt.

FAQs

According to our Solana price prediction 2025, the altcoin might chug up to a maximum of $400 by 2025.

As per our Solana price prediction 2030, with a potential surge, the price of SOL could reach a maximum of $1,351.

Solana stock, with its strengths in fundamentals, still holds significant prominence. That said, we can expect its glory to shine brighter with resolutions to shortcomings and major Solana news.

As per our latest SOL price analysis, Solana could reach a maximum price of $11,698.

By 2050, a single Solana price could go as high as $72,459.

Share this article

Bitcoin profits are declining while altcoin profits stabilize during a deep capitulation phase, creating an unusual divergence between the two market segments, according to Glassnode.

The current market environment reflects continued pressure across crypto assets, with both Bitcoin and altcoins showing signs of capitulation rather than growth. However, the stabilization in altcoin profits contrasts with Bitcoin's ongoing decline.

Social media discussions highlight that most altcoins are underperforming, with only a small portion generating profits for investors. This underperformance has contributed to the stagnation in altcoin profits relative to Bitcoin's recent trajectory.

The divergence marks a shift from typical market patterns where Bitcoin and altcoins often move in similar directions during major market phases.

As Bitcoin's price plunges below $97,000, the crypto market is in flux, offering both challenges and opportunities. How do altcoins and stablecoins provide stability for DAOs amidst this chaos? What are the implications for businesses and fintech startups? Let's navigate this landscape together.

Bitcoin has taken a significant hit, falling below the $97,000 threshold after a large market selloff. This has resulted in a loss of around $450 billion in total crypto market capitalization. The selloff is raising eyebrows, particularly among institutional investors and traders, with technical indicators suggesting a bearish outlook. This situation has many in the market on edge, wondering what comes next.

Stablecoins like USDC and Tether (USDT) are pegged to reserve assets, usually the US Dollar. This structure aims to eradicate the volatility that typically plagues Bitcoin's price, allowing DAOs to make transactions, manage treasuries, and execute smart contracts without worrying about wild price swings. For DAOs, this price stability is crucial.

Decentralized stablecoins such as Dai (DAI) maintain a USD peg through a mix of cryptocurrencies, using an algorithmic system to stabilize prices. This is invaluable for DAOs that prioritize decentralization and want to avoid reliance on traditional banking systems.

Altcoins like Ethereum come with the added benefit of programmable smart contracts. These contracts allow DAOs to execute complex transactions autonomously. Unlike Bitcoin's limited scripting capability, Ethereum and its counterparts provide the rich functionality that DAOs require to navigate through this volatile environment effectively.

The recent price movements carry significant regulatory implications, particularly for European SMEs. The decline has prompted businesses to prefer regulated crypto banking solutions over direct Bitcoin investments. This is a strategic pivot, as companies seek more stable financial frameworks in an evolving regulatory landscape.

The shift towards regulated solutions is complex. Even though initial regulatory scrutiny slows down adoption, unified regulations can create a safer space that fosters innovation. European SMEs are now grappling with fragmented regulations, and the lack of clear guidelines complicates compliance efforts.

The regulatory framework is changing, potentially easing compliance burdens for SMEs. The repeal of outdated accounting standards has eliminated barriers for regulated custodians, allowing them to develop digital asset custody solutions at scale. Stablecoin legislation could also streamline regulations, making it easier for companies to navigate compliance.

Fintech startups in Asia have a unique opportunity to enhance their crypto payroll solutions amidst this volatility. Here's how:

Given Bitcoin's unpredictable price, paying directly in Bitcoin risks losing value, so companies can opt to pay in stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies. This way, they maintain value stability while still utilizing blockchain efficiency.

Platforms like Stellar allow for automated payroll disbursements, offering low fees and compliance-ready infrastructure. This not only reduces costs but also allows companies to swiftly respond to market volatility or regulatory shifts.

The ongoing volatility in Asia creates opportunities for trading and liquidity. Fintech startups equipped with risk management strategies can take advantage of short-term price dislocations to optimize treasury management or offer innovative payroll features like real-time payments.

Institutional investors are not sitting idle; they are shifting gears to adapt to Bitcoin's decline, emphasizing risk management, portfolio diversification, and leveraging improved infrastructure.

Investors are enhancing risk controls by increasing due diligence, employing AI-driven market monitoring tools, and using derivatives such as put options to hedge against risks. This disciplined approach could be crucial in a turbulent market.

Instead of focusing solely on Bitcoin, investors are diversifying their portfolios. They're adding stablecoins, DeFi projects, altcoins, tokenized assets, and even regulated products like ETFs to their portfolios to balance risk and stability.

The innovations in custody solutions, staking platforms, and infrastructure-backed contracts are lessening counterparty risks and allowing Bitcoin to function as a yield-generating asset. All of these developments could build institutional confidence, even in a bearish market.

In a world where Bitcoin's price is anything but stable, the role of altcoins and stablecoins seems more vital than ever. For DAOs and businesses alike, these alternatives provide a path through the storm. Innovative strategies are essential for surviving and thriving in today's volatile market. It's an arduous journey, but one that can lead to long-term success in the crypto space.

Stock Analysis

Find companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value.

 To own Franklin Resources, an investor must believe in the company's ability to adapt to fee pressure and capture growth from global and digital innovation, particularly as it invests in blockchain-enabled solutions. The recent Benji-Canton blockchain move showcases technology leadership, but on its own, is unlikely to materially offset persistent industry-wide fee compression in the short term, which remains the biggest near-term risk. 


 Among Franklin's recent developments, the new low-fee pricing on its Core Equity Funds in Canada stands out for its immediate relevance, as it responds directly to competitive pressures and addresses a key catalyst, broadening investor access to modern portfolio building blocks as the firm navigates pricing headwinds. 


 By contrast, investors should not overlook how fee compression can limit near-term margin expansion even as new digital offerings emerge...

Franklin Resources is projected to reach $8.9 billion in revenue and $1.4 billion in earnings by 2028. This outlook assumes a 1.0% annual revenue growth rate and an earnings increase of approximately $1.1 billion from current earnings of $270.9 million.

Uncover how Franklin Resources' forecasts yield a $24.73 fair value, a 12% upside to its current price.

In crypto, “biggest” and “largest” are words thrown around daily. Most of the time, they're marketing fluff. But every once in a while, a project appears that actually earns those words. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a project,  a network that spent over $100 million building before selling a single token.

While other presales operate on whitepapers and future promises, ZKP begins its journey with working technology, global hardware, and verified infrastructure. As its whitelist opens now, investors aren't buying into an idea; they're securing early access to a network being built from the ground up for real-world use.

For those looking for substance over hype, ZKP might just be the top altcoin to buy now, not because it shouts the loudest, but because it's building where others only promise..

Every cycle, crypto investors see flashy websites, vague roadmaps, and empty promises. ZKP breaks that cycle. It meets every benchmark of a credible, mature blockchain project:



Where most presales ask investors to fund development, ZKP flipped the model,  building first, selling later. This reversal of the norm is what gives it weight in a market flooded with vaporware.

The $100 million ZKP spent pre-launch wasn't theoretical spending; it produced verifiable results across three key fronts:



This makes ZKP unique in presale history. Every system that typically takes months post-launch to deploy is already built and entering its final readiness phase before the first public auction.

That's not marketing. That's infrastructure.

At the technical level, ZKP's blockchain isn't a prototype; it's a functioning architecture comprising four integrated layers:

This combination allows ZKP to process private computations faster than most existing networks, merging blockchain's transparency with AI's computational power,  a breakthrough that places it among the top altcoins to buy now for long-term value.

When the presale opens, ZKP will implement one of the fairest token distribution systems ever created, with daily on-chain auctions. Each 24-hour cycle releases 200 million ZKP tokens, distributed proportionally to contributions.

Everyone, from retail participants to institutional investors, competes on equal footing. This model eliminates manipulation and ensures transparency that traditional presales simply can't match.

Participants can use ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, and over 20 other payment methods to join a global access framework built for inclusion, not exclusivity.

ZKP's hardware, the Proof Pod, bridges the gap between crypto and physical utility. Each Pod will perform real computations, verify tasks, and generate zero-knowledge proofs.

Once connected, it begins earning ZKP coins automatically. The network uses these devices to power privacy-preserving AI and decentralized compute operations worldwide.

Participants can upgrade their Pods up to Level 300 via software boosts, scaling daily earning capacity with network demand. This synergy between token utility and compute performance makes ZKP's model economically circular,  where growth reinforces value.

It's a system of proof, not speculation.

In blockchain, capital deployment before revenue signals commitment and confidence. Spending $100 million pre-launch is unprecedented, not for marketing, but for engineering.

That kind of investment isn't spent on promise; it's spent on delivery. It ensures reliability, compliance readiness, and resilience from day one.

For due diligence investors, this is the key differentiator between ZKP and the speculative wave of untested projects. It's infrastructure-grade crypto, a foundation-level opportunity similar in scale to Ethereum's early architecture, but with the benefit of hindsight and proven tech.



This is why institutional analysts are labeling it one of the top altcoins to buy now,  not as hype, but as an asset built for measurable adoption.

The phrase “largest presale” usually means marketing noise. In ZKP's case, it means scale, structure, and substance. With $100 million already deployed, $17 million in hardware ready to ship, and a fully built four-layer blockchain, this is infrastructure that exists,  not promises waiting for funding.

The top altcoin to buy now isn't the loudest token; it's the one with systems already running before launch. ZKP stands apart as the world's first verifiable, privacy-driven compute network,  ready, proven, and open to the world.

The whitelist is live. The infrastructure is built. The next era of blockchain begins with proof, not promises.

Join the whitelist before the largest and most credible presale in crypto history goes live.

Barcelona announced on Friday a new sponsorship agreement with blockchain company ZKP, or Zero Knowledge Proof. The deal has raised eyebrows, not least because of whom the company chooses to be associated with.

The sponsorship deal entails ZKP becoming Barcelona's global blockchain partner until 2028 for the nxt two years. The company is based on ‘decentralised AI' according to the club statement, and they will make use of their digital advertising assets across the club's communication channels.

Image via FC Barcelona

Most of Barcelona's sponsors are global brands with significant history and a track record of putting up big numbers. However ZKP was only formed in 2022, and only became a public company in 2025, as per their own website.

Notably, the company's Twitter/X account at the time of writing has just 141 followers. They will launch their blockchain on the 27th of November in less than two weeks, and have just two official partners; Barcelona and NRL-side The Dolphins. Interestingly, ‘Zero Knowledge Proof' is a theory based on convincing people of a statement based on other information than conveying that the statement is true.

More surprising still, is that ZKP have chosen to platform a tweet from Andrew Tate, which is their pinned tweet on their profile. They say that Tate's view on AI and blockchain is ‘the future'.

Tate is currently awaiting trial in Romania for charges of human trafficking, child trafficking, rape and sex with a minor. In the United Kingdom, he also has 21 charges against him for rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking. Given Barcelona is a club that publicly epouses the values of equality and feminism, it is surprising that they would be in league with a company that supports a figure such as Tate, given his criminal and abhorrent media history, arguing for the subjugation of women.","{'href': 'https://ca.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News Canada'}","cryptocurrency"

Discover the 2025 Ronin Collector's Guide to collecting NFTs and digital collectibles, setting up a Ronin Wallet, and exploring rare Axies, Pixels land plots, and Moku Mokis in the web3 gaming space.

Eliza Crichton-Stuart

Updated Nov 15, 2025

The Ronin blockchain has grown into a central hub for gaming-focused NFTs and digital collectibles. Built with web3 gaming in mind, Ronin hosts numerous NFT collections and in-game assets, providing players and collectors with opportunities to engage with rare items and historical assets. The 2025 Ronin Collector's Guide aims to help newcomers understand how to get started, what types of NFTs are worth exploring, and how to navigate the ecosystem efficiently.

Earlier in the year, notable web3 enthusiasts including Jihoz, cloudwhiteNFT, and Puffy introduced Rick Harrison and Chumlee from the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop to the Ronin Network. This event highlighted the growing appeal of blockchain collectibles to mainstream audiences. Ronin Market now lists more than 80 NFT collections, ranging from high-value items to affordable entry-level collectibles.

Collectors on Ronin are drawn to NFTs that offer rarity, historical significance, or in-game utility. Mystic Axies are among the most sought-after due to their limited numbers and VIP benefits. With fewer than 1,500 in existence, Mystic Axies provide early access to in-game features, presales, and exclusive community channels. They are considered a top-tier collectible for serious Axie Infinity players.

Origin Axies, on the other hand, hold historical value as the first Axies ever created. With just 3,900 in circulation, these NFTs are regarded as foundational pieces of the Axie Infinity universe and are often treated as heirlooms by collectors. For those seeking visually striking NFTs, Japanese Axies offer unique designs, such as ornamental Maiko ears and Dokuganryu eyes. These collectibles remain accessible while providing both aesthetic appeal and in-game functionality.

To begin collecting NFTs, users must first set up a Ronin Wallet. The wallet is available through the official Ronin website and supports both RON and ETH for transactions. During setup, users create a seed phrase that must be stored securely offline. The seed phrase acts as a private key, and sharing it or storing it digitally can result in loss of assets. 

Once the wallet is ready, users can fund it through several methods, including purchasing RON via exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, bridging tokens to Ronin, or exchanging fiat currencies through debit or credit cards. Users in specific regions, such as the Philippines, can also obtain RON through platforms like GCash.

Beyond Axies, the Ronin ecosystem features a variety of NFTs tied to games and digital experiences. Genesis Mokis, small AI-powered characters, provide access to upcoming Moku Grand Arena events and holder-only perks. Pixels land plots, inspired by pixel-based farming games, allow collectors to access exclusive in-game features and rewards. 

Meanwhile, Cambria Cores support MMO-style gameplay, enabling participation in prediction markets and competitive events while offering Shard Points redeemable for in-game companions and cosmetics.

Each of these collectibles serves a dual purpose: they hold value within their respective games while also acting as digital assets in the broader Ronin ecosystem. Collectors can choose items based on personal interest, in-game utility, or investment potential.

For first-time collectors, the process begins with creating a wallet and funding it with RON or ETH. From there, users can explore Ronin Market to identify NFTs that align with their interests. Historical Axies offer a mix of rarity and accessibility, while game-based NFTs like Mokis and Pixels plots provide ongoing engagement through in-game benefits. By understanding the different types of collectibles and their value, new collectors can make informed decisions and gradually build a meaningful collection.

What is Ronin?Ronin is a blockchain platform designed for gaming and digital collectibles. It supports NFTs, in-game assets, and web3 applications, offering players and collectors secure and scalable options for digital ownership.

How do I set up a Ronin Wallet?To set up a Ronin Wallet, download the app from the official website, create a seed phrase, store it securely offline, and fund the wallet with RON or ETH. The wallet is required to trade and hold NFTs on Ronin Market.

What are Mystic Axies?Mystic Axies are rare NFTs in Axie Infinity, valued for their scarcity and VIP benefits, including early access to in-game features, presale opportunities, and exclusive community channels.

What other NFTs can I collect on Ronin?Collectors can explore Origin Axies for historical value, Japanese Axies for visual appeal, Genesis Mokis for AI-powered game access, Pixels land plots for farming simulation gameplay, and Cambria Cores for MMO-style activities and rewards.

How can I buy RON to fund my wallet?RON can be purchased on exchanges such as Coinbase or Binance, bridged from other blockchains, swapped in the Ronin Wallet, or exchanged using debit or credit cards. Specific regional platforms, such as GCash in the Philippines, also support RON purchases.

Are Ronin NFTs suitable for beginners?Yes. Ronin offers collectibles across a wide range of price points. New collectors can start with accessible options like Japanese Axies or small land plots and gradually expand into rarer or historically significant NFTs.

HYTOPIA has officially launched its new token, $HYBUX, on the Base Chain, marking one of the most significant steps in the growth of its onchain ecosystem. The launch opens the door for new rewards, staking systems, creator tools, and a future marketplace designed to power the expanding HYTOPIA world.

HYBUX sits at the center of the game's economic framework and will support both player rewards and creator monetization across HYTOPIA's universe. The token contract is verified on Base, and rapid ecosystem updates are already following the early rollout.

$HYBUX is now LIVE on @base.A key milestone in expanding the HYTOPIA ecosystem by enabling seamless onchain activity, smoother player rewards, and broader accessibility.Official Contract Address: https://t.co/biAi9nOypF pic.twitter.com/dcsxG2J0NM

With the launch of HYBUX, HYTOPIA is now connected to one of the most active and scalable chains in Web3. Base offers low fees and high performance, making it well suited for gaming transactions, creator activity, and everyday player interactions.

The token's listing pages on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko are expected to be updated within hours of the launch.

HYTOPIA is a creator-driven game world where players build experiences, design environments, and interact socially through a sandbox-style universe. It is known for its creator tools, accessible gameplay and its vision of a connected world that links players, builders and communities.

The platform has developed a strong global audience thanks to its user generated content model and plans to introduce deeper onchain features supported by HYBUX.

HYTOPIA is introducing a new web3 interface that will allow players to stake HYBUX as well as multiple HYTOPIA NFT collections. Staking pools will distribute large allocations from the initial token supply.

Staking Pools• Worlds: 1.1 billion HYBUX• Avatars: 200 million HYBUX• GrayBoys: 100 million HYBUX

The final vesting schedule for these rewards has not yet been confirmed.

Staking NFTs will allow holders to earn a share of these large pools, which positions them at the center of HYTOPIA's long term economic design. A dedicated node pool interface is also being introduced with an initial allocation of 500 million HYBUX. Users will be able to inspect the total tokens accumulated in the node pool and burn their node to claim the entire reward pool.

All four HYTOPIA NFT collections continue to benefit from a non expiring revenue share from the upcoming HYTOPIA marketplace. The marketplace is expected to launch in December and will allow creators to sell items and experiences for real currency.

Fifteen percent of every primary sale and five percent of every secondary sale will flow directly into the NFT reward pool. This design allows long term collectors and creators to benefit from future marketplace activity.

Beginning in January 2026, HYBUX will transition into an inflationary model. Staked tokens will earn an estimated annual yield of two point five percent in the first year. Stakers who pair HYBUX with HYTOPIA NFTs will be eligible for boosted yields that can reach up to ten percent.

The combination of token staking, NFT staking, and marketplace rewards creates a multi layered reward structure that supports both players and creators.

The HYBUX airdrop was completed successfully and the project is now preparing a series of upcoming releases. These include the staking interface for HYBUX and NFTs, the node pool interface, and the launch of the official HYTOPIA marketplace. With these systems in place, HYTOPIA is entering a new era of onchain activity, economic depth and community involvement.

 By NFTPlazas Editorial Team

The crypto market is entering one of its most unpredictable phases in months. Ethereum is flashing sharp swings, SUI is clinging to a critical support line, and traders are scrambling to understand which project might lead the next breakout wave. The hunt for the next leading bullish crypto is getting louder as volatility pushes every narrative to the surface at once.

Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) enters this backdrop with a completely different approach. Instead of leaning on price charts or social buzz, it introduces income-generating hardware built to deliver measurable returns. In a market full of speculation, Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) puts real work and real output at the center of the conversation.

Zero Knowledge Proof introduces a model built on verifiable computational work rather than waiting for hype cycles. The project has already produced more than $17 million worth of hardware, all scheduled to ship five days after the presale launches.

Its $249 Proof Pods arrive fully prepared to validate AI tasks and generate privacy proofs. A Level 1 Pod earns around $1 daily, and every $100 software upgrade increases this by exactly $1, scaling up to $300 daily at Level 300.

These Pods appeal to people hunting for a leading bullish crypto with predictable income that does not require price speculation. All earnings are visible on-chain and tied directly to the daily Initial Coin Auction, which distributes 200 million Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) coins every twenty-four hours.



This structure keeps all rewards aligned with real network demand. The whitelist opening has intensified attention, with many seeing this as one of the most unconventional and high-momentum utilities in the current cycle.

Ethereum remains a major contender due to its ability to attract large-scale buyers even in periods of volatility. The Ethereum price recently plunged to around $3,098 before staging a notable rebound.

The real story came from the reaction of whales and institutions. Across a three-day period, major holders purchased more than 394,600 ETH, valued at over $1.37 billion. This buying spree reflects confidence well beyond the short-term turbulence visible on price charts.

Following the accumulation wave, Ethereum traded between $3,400 and $3,600, with analysts projecting possible 2025 targets between $6,000 and $10,000. The “Fusaka” upgrade and more than $12 billion in real-world assets already deployed on Ethereum continue to build long-term excitement.



Traders watching the Ethereum price today see a blend of high volatility and major future catalysts, a combination that keeps Ethereum firmly positioned among popular bullish crypto candidates.

SUI is navigating a tense technical setup around the $2.00 support zone. The recent breakdown through several price floors has created instability, with the token fluctuating just above a level that could determine its direction for the coming weeks.

A failure to hold the $2.00 support could send SUI toward $1.85, reflecting increased selling pressure. A rebound would require clearing $2.16 and $2.37, both of which represent key resistance levels for short-term recovery.

Longer-term projections are far more ambitious. Analysts point toward earlier models suggesting a path to $9.00 if SUI breaks above $3.60. Others forecast ranges between $14.50 and $16.00.



Real-world adoption contributes to this potential, including Crypto.com's new institutional custody offering launched on November 11. This mix of volatility, technical pressure, and institutional interest keeps SUI firmly in the conversation for traders pursuing the next big bullish crypto.

The market's current landscape shows three completely different forms of speculation unfolding at once. Ethereum continues drawing institutional buyers. SUI battles to protect its chart structure. Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) introduces hardware-based income tied to measurable computational output.

These separate storylines reflect a broader transformation, where traders and long-term participants each chase different catalysts. For those searching for the next leading bullish crypto, the comparison highlights a diverse field of opportunities, each shaped by a different form of momentum.

How many people watched early crypto chances pass by because they waited too long, scrolled too much, or trusted someone saying the market was “too late”? It happens every year. Miss one big run and the regret camps build up fast. The funny thing is that LivLive ($LIVE) is starting to pull the same early signs many old giants showed, making it the best crypto to buy now.

LivLive ($LIVE) is catching attention because its first presale numbers already look strong. At the same time, Cardano (ADA) and other major coins keep shaping the overall market tone through their price movements and news updates. The mix of old giants and new fire shows how the market keeps opening new chances for people who want something fresh. That is why the best crypto to buy now appears again during strong shifts.

Cardano (ADA) had one of the most doubted early runs in crypto history. Its ICO price sat near fractions of a dollar, and many said it would never rise. Then it climbed thousands of percent and created life changing returns for early buyers. People still talk about how big that run was.

ADA crushed all early doubts and proved how wrong crowds can be when they ignore new tech. Many still say they should have taken that chance. But crypto keeps giving new entries to those who missed old ones. Every cycle brings coins that start tiny and then rewrite their whole story.

LivLive ($LIVE) is not just a token. It is a real world operating system that turns everyday actions into rewards. Walking, checking in, reviewing places, attending events, or visiting shops all create XP and $LIVE tokens. It upgrades real life into a reward system where daily steps start to matter.

Below are the biggest reasons why people say LivLive ($LIVE) can change the lives of those who get in early, especially as the presale gains traction.

These numbers matter because the rising price steps reward early movers with bigger positions. Growth in raised capital signals strong belief from the community. More holders in the first stages show real demand before listings even start.

• Global AR Game LayerTurns real cities into a reward map where movement and check ins earn $LIVE.

• Pokémon GO Style MissionsReal world quests that unlock tokens, XP, and nonstop activity.

• 2.5M Dollar Treasure VaultToken packs open vault chambers, including the 1M ICON reward.

• Dual Rewards SystemEarn $LIVE plus real world perks, items, events, and brand rewards.

• AI Personalized MissionsAdaptive quests that change based on behavior to boost long term engagement.

The bonus pack just dropped and people are already stacking their entries because the numbers are too powerful to ignore. This is the moment many watch from the sidelines while others grab huge multipliers. It is the classic story where early movers walk away smiling while latecomers talk about missed chances.

• Up to 2,000 dollars use EARLY100 for 100 percent bonus• 2,000 dollars or more use BOOST200 for 200 percent bonus

Those who enter now lock the biggest multipliers before the next price step hits. Those who delay usually end up paying the full rate while early adopters enjoy bigger stacks.

Tap in now and unlock your LivLive presale position before the next price step pushes the entry cost higher.

Cardano showed what early belief can do. The market keeps repeating the same pattern where new projects rise fast after a strong start. LivLive presale offers bonus codes, referral rewards, and a growing community that wants to enter before the next stage. Those who join now with EARLY100 or BOOST200 get the strongest benefits.

Key Takeaways

The  initial coin offerings (ICOs) era was supposed to be over, buried with the wreckage of the 2017–18 bubble.

Yet six years later, the fundraising model that defined crypto's wildest boom is quietly resurfacing.

New launches like Yield Basis and Monad are pulling investors back in, hinting at a revival few saw coming.

When blockchains were still a novel concept and the crypto community was in its infancy, there were relatively few projects seeking to raise money.

However, once the new technology garnered more mainstream attention, blockchain development began to snowball, as did the fundraising activity required to sustain it.

From just $222 million in 2016, total ICO volume ballooned to around $14 billion  in 2018.

At the height of the frenzy, the EOS token sale raised $4.2 billion, eclipsing the three largest venture capital rounds  of that year combined.

At a time when few institutions were interested in crypto, most of the funding came from retail investors.

When the market soured in late 2018, many ICO participants saw the value of their assets plummet.

In turn, this prompted regulatory scrutiny and the ensuing crackdown suppressed what little ICO momentum remained.

From 2018 onward, new crypto projects increasingly turned to venture capital funding in place of public sales.

Rather than selling coins to retail investors, platforms like Solana (SOL) favored private deals with a select group of institutions.

Meanwhile, the rise of airdrops and launchpads provided alternative distribution pathways for the new generation of memecoins and DeFi tokens.

Despite the collapse of the classic ICO model, a trickle of new blockchain projects continued to raise funds from the public after 2018.

However, the industry implemented new guardrails to prevent unscrupulous actors from abusing the public's appetite for new cryptocurrencies.

In 2019, Binance Launchpool reimagined the way issuers connect with retail investors. In its role as an intermediary, the exchange acts in a curatorial capacity, ensuring that any new listings meet minimum standards.

Following Binance, OKX, Bybit, and KuCoin sought to emulate the centralized launchpad model. But faced with regulatory uncertainty, U.S. exchanges initially chose not to get involved.

With past crackdowns in the rear view, however, Kraken and Coinbase have finally joined the party.

For its debut offering, Kraken selected YieldBasis (YB)—the utility token for a new DeFi yield protocol.

Developed by Curve founder Michael Egorov, Yield Basis borrows key elements from the decentralized stablecoin exchange to generate a yield of WBTC and ETH deposits.

In an interview with CCN, Egorov explained how Curve's algorithmic foundation inspired the new platform. 

“It occurred to me that […] if you use a similar algorithm to keep your leverage constant” via a BTC-stablecoin pool, “you create a position which is priced like BTC, without impermanent loss,” he said.

Starting with this idea, Egorov set about building a new platform, “and on the way, I improved a little bit on Curve tokenomics, and arrived at what Yield Basis is currently,” he recalled.

Although the exchange has emphasized the regulatory compliance of its new ICO platform, for now, Kraken Launch isn't available to U.S. users. 

However, starting on Nov. 17, Coinbase plans to host a new token sale each month, with a focus on strictly vetted projects and regulatory compliance.

In a blog post , the firm boasted that “U.S. retail traders can now widely participate in public token sales for the first time since 2018.”

For its ICO debut, the American exchange selected Monad—a high-performance Layer 1 (L1) blockchain promising parallel execution and EVM compatibility.

With its mainnet launch scheduled for Nov. 24, Monad is among a new generation of blockchains reinvigorating L1 development.

The other major L1 ICO of 2025 is  Nexchain, whcih has almost concluded a $50 million sale that started in March.

Home - Crypto Presales - Monero (XMR) ICO Miss Still Hurts but LivLive ($LIVE) 200% Bonus Turns It Into the Next 100x Crypto to Buy

How many people scroll past crypto charts, ignore early stages, and then act shocked when a tiny project becomes the talk of November 2025? It happens every cycle. So many missed their ticket to life changing gains because they waited for “proof” instead of opportunity. This time, LivLive ($LIVE) sits in that exact spotlight and carries the next 100x crypto to buy energy.

LivLive ($LIVE) enters the scene with a strong presale start that signals real traction long before launch. Meanwhile, Monero (XMR) and the broader market keep showing how fast trend shifts hit when no one expects them. Both have strong news phases, but today's focus is on how LivLive ($LIVE) positions itself as the next 100x crypto to buy with real utility and a growing community.

Many early crypto users doubted Monero (XMR) from the first day. The ICO price was near pocket change, yet those who took the risk created life changing stories while others stayed on the sidelines. It multiplied thousands of times, proving that hesitation can be the most expensive decision in a bull cycle.

People watched Monero (XMR) move from a quiet niche to a respected privacy asset. Those who dismissed it still talk about the lost chance. This is the emotional punch of older cycles. The misses still echo today, but the good thing is crypto keeps giving new opportunities to those ready when the right launch appears.

LivLive ($LIVE) positions itself as a lifestyle upgrade where daily actions convert into measurable value. This is not another basic GameFi attempt. It aims to reshape how people move, shop, attend events, and interact with cities through a reward system powered by blockchain and augmented reality. LivLive ($LIVE) builds a digital layer over the physical world so every action carries purpose, value, and progress that goes far beyond simple gameplay.

Below is a structured breakdown of how LivLive ($LIVE) transforms real world activity into a long term ecosystem with benefits that early buyers care about. Each point highlights how the functions help people gain value and why the early crowd is already forming around it.











 • Daily actions turn into token rewards, XP, and collectable assets
 • AR missions prove physical presence so rewards stay fair
 • Wearables verify movement and unlock higher earning levels
 • Local businesses plug in to offer real perks like event tickets or merchandise
 • Leaderboards add motivation for competitive participants
 • Referral model gives both sides instant benefits

LivLive ($LIVE) has also gained strong engagement from people who want an app that rewards activity instead of draining time. Movement, exploration, and real presence become currency. This concept gains traction fast in markets that seek utility beyond speculation.

The presale performance shows why early buyers are calling it a breakout contender. Stage 1 price began at $0.02. More than 2.1M USD has been raised with 250 holders so far. The next stage price is set at $0.04 and the launch is lined up at $0.25. This climb reflects rising interest in AR ecosystems and RWA backed reward layers.

LivLive offers a reward burst that supercharges any entry size. The community is already filling spots because the math is too strong to ignore. Every second counts as the presale strengthens. People who act early get bonus allocations while others end up scrolling through chats where early buyers brag about scoring bigger positions.

LivLive shakes the space with a heavy bonus system that multiplies entries instantly. This is not a small perk. It is a resource pack for early presale strength and it explains why so many are rushing before the next price jump. Missing these multipliers means paying full price later while others enjoy higher stacks from the same spend.

 • Up to 2,000 USD: use code EARLY100 for +100 percent
 • 2,000 USD or more: use code BOOST200 for +200 percent

The ones who move now take the larger share. The ones who wait watch allocations shrink while the next price step approaches.

Secure your allocation now, claim your codes, build your position, and enter LivLive presale while the stage pricing still favors early movers.











LivLive brings real world rewards, AR missions, and strong presale traction into one ecosystem that stands out in November Q4 2025. The flash bonuses, referral rewards, and presale momentum position it as a strong candidate for the next 100x crypto to buy. Join the LivLive presale, use the bonus codes, and stack referral rewards while the early stages remain open.

November 15, 2025 @ 11:43 am By Michael Wong 

Singapore's central bank has completed a live trial of using a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) to settle overnight interbank loans, moving its experiments with tokenised assets onto an operational test network.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said the trial, conducted on its Singapore Dollar Test Network (SGD Testnet), involved three of the city-state's largest lenders – DBS, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC) and United Overseas Bank (UOB).

Transactions were recorded in the banks' official books and regulatory filings, marking the first live issuance of a Singapore dollar wholesale CBDC, MAS said in a statement.

The SGD Testnet is a shared ledger infrastructure that allows banks and other financial institutions to settle tokenised assets in central bank money.

MAS said it is designed to cut settlement risk and fragmentation by using a common digital Singapore dollar as the settlement asset across different platforms.

The system also supports programmable payments, enabling banks to embed conditions from their counterparty agreements so that transfers are executed automatically once pre-defined terms are met.

In addition, it can support so-called atomic settlement of both cash and securities legs of a transaction, so that neither side is exposed to the risk of one asset being delivered without the other.

Wholesale CBDCs, which are used only by financial institutions, are being explored as a way to improve the plumbing of money markets.

Singapore is among a number of financial centres testing such designs as central banks consider how distributed ledger technology could be applied in funding markets and cross-border transactions.

MAS said it plans to build on the pilot by testing the issuance of tokenised MAS Bills to primary dealers, with settlement to be carried out using the wholesale CBDC on the SGD Testnet.

The central bank said further details of that trial would be released in 2026.

The UAE has been exploring the issuance of a CBDC since 2019, but the first Digital Dirham was issued as legal tender only in 2024 on the CBDC issuance platform

The UAE recently reached a major milestone with the Digital Dirham, its central bank digital currency (CBDC), by completing the first government-to-government (G2G) transaction on a blockchain platform. The transaction, carried out between the UAE Ministry of Finance and the Dubai Department of Finance, was settled in under two minutes, bypassing traditional intermediaries such as banks or clearing houses. This marks the first major live test since the Digital Dirham pilot launched in March 2025.

The transaction was processed via mBridge, a multi-CBDC platform jointly developed by the Central Bank of the UAE, BIS Innovation Hub, the Bank of Thailand, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Digital Currency Institute of the People's Bank of China. mBridge leverages blockchain for secure, immutable ledgers and smart contracts to automate settlements. This enables direct peer-to-peer transfers in central bank money, reducing costs by up to 50 per cent and eliminating reconciliation delays that typically take days in legacy systems like SWIFT.

The UAE has been exploring the issuance of a CBDC since 2019, but the first Digital Dirham was issued as legal tender only in 2024 on the CBDC issuance platform. Around the same time, the Central Bank of the UAE conducted a real-value retail pilot to evaluate the Digital Dirham's design, technology, and advantages. It also developed four digital-economy use cases to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the Digital Dirham as an innovative universal payment method that could open up new business models and spur financial innovation through interoperability, accessibility, and programmability.

With wider acceptance, the UAE expects the Digital Dirham to become a primary channel for remittance flows to countries such as India. The Central Bank of the UAE has said that the Digital Dirham is designed with a focus on efficiency, lower costs, financial inclusion for key user groups, and dedicated cross-border infrastructure. It aims to be widely accessible and to serve populations most involved in sending remittances. The bank has also noted in a recent policy paper that widespread accessibility is expected to expand financial services for unbanked or underbanked individuals—a critical factor for many remittance users who lack traditional bank accounts.

The Digital Dirham uses an intermediated distribution model, with licensed financial institutions—including banks, payment service providers, and exchange houses—acting as wallet providers. Exchange houses have long played a central role in the remittance ecosystem, and the system is expected to evolve into a hybrid, wallet-based access model, which is often easier for individuals without conventional banking relationships. By lowering barriers and expanding access, the Digital Dirham is likely to promote financial inclusion and ensure more equitable distribution of the benefits of digitalisation. A notable design feature is that non-residents will also have access, which is essential for enabling cross-border transfers by people who do not permanently reside in the UAE.

For the Digital Dirham to become a primary remittance channel, it must overcome familiar pain points in traditional remittance systems, such as high costs and slow settlement. Many observers expect it to simplify cross-border payments by reducing fees and enabling instant settlement in central bank money. Instant settlement and broad accessibility are central goals of the CBDC.

The success of the first major live test may influence trade between India and the UAE. As early as July 2023, the two countries signed MoUs to enable trade settlement in their national currencies and to link their payment and messaging systems. In March 2023, when the Central Bank of the UAE launched its “Digital Dirham” strategy, along with the soft launch of mBridge for real-value cross-border trade settlement and proof-of-concept work on domestic CBDC issuance for both wholesale and retail, the third stated goal involved India. It called for proof-of-concept work on a bilateral CBDC bridge with India. Once this CBDC bridge is operation, it is expected to further India's economic ties with the UAE.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs), stablecoins and tokenization are rapidly expanding XRP's real-world use cases amid SEC Chair Paul Atkins signaling the agency will ease Bitcoin and crypto rules.

XRP is entering a new era of utility. Adoption is surging across ETFs, stablecoins, and tokenization, marking a transformative moment for institutional and retail investors alike, according to XRP Update.





XRP-backed ETFs are becoming a key gateway for mainstream crypto exposure. By offering regulated access, they attract both institutional and retail investors, boosting demand, liquidity, and trading volumes, while cementing XRP's role in global finance.

Stablecoins are driving a new wave of XRP utility. Thanks to its low costs and high throughput, XRP is increasingly used to bridge fiat and blockchain-based stablecoins, enabling faster, cheaper, and more secure cross-border payments. 

By reducing dependence on traditional banking corridors, XRP is proving itself not just as a speculative asset, but as a practical tool for global liquidity and financial efficiency.

XRP's Interledger Protocol (ILP) makes it a prime platform for tokenizing real-world assets, from real estate to commodities. Tokenization converts tangible assets into tradable digital tokens, unlocking liquidity, enabling fractional ownership, and opening new investment opportunities. This positions XRP not just as a payment solution, but as a foundational layer for a more digital, accessible financial ecosystem.

The rise of ETFs, stablecoins, and tokenization marks XRP's evolution from a digital currency into a versatile financial network. 

Beyond speculation and remittances, XRP is now powering diverse financial instruments and institutional strategies. For investors, this signals long-term growth potential; for institutions, it provides a secure, efficient gateway into the digital asset ecosystem.

On-chain analytics firm BankXRP recently flagged comments by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins, who told Fox Business that his agency is actively working to ease regulation on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. 

According to BankXRP, this marks a significant pivot in the SEC's posture, one more supportive of crypto innovation than the enforcement-heavy era that preceded him.





Atkins, who assumed the SEC chairmanship earlier this year, has publicly committed to a more collaborative, rules-based approach. He said rulemaking is underway, with the goal of building a “stable platform” for crypto companies to launch products without being hampered by legacy securities regulations.

SEC Chair Paul Atkins signals a regulatory shift: revisiting custody rules to reflect modern blockchain practices and clarifying which tokens qualify as securities under U.S. law.

In a recent policy speech, SEC Chair Paul Atkins revealed that the agency is developing a token taxonomy to clearly separate securities from non-securities in crypto. He also noted a key legal insight: tokens issued under investment contracts may no longer qualify as 'securities' once their contractual obligations are fully met.

If realized, these steps could transform the U.S. crypto landscape, cutting regulatory uncertainty, boosting capital formation, and making the country a hub for blockchain innovation. For BankXRP and on-chain analysts, it signals that the SEC may finally be aligning regulations with the realities of crypto technology.

XRP's expansion into ETFs, stablecoins, and tokenization shows it is far more than a payment tool or speculative asset. 

Its integration into regulated products, cross-border transactions, and digital ecosystems highlights its transformation into a versatile, future-ready financial network, unlocking efficiency, access, and opportunity for investors, institutions, and innovators alike.

Meanwhile, SEC Chair Paul Atkins' recent remarks hint at a turning point in U.S. crypto regulation. By emphasizing clarity, innovation-friendly rules, and collaboration, the SEC aims to balance investor protection with digital asset growth. This shift could cut regulatory uncertainty, spur blockchain adoption, and position the U.S. as a leading hub for crypto innovation

The digital age has introduced a myriad of innovations that have altered the very fabric of society. From the rise of the internet to the explosion of artificial intelligence, these technological advances have fundamentally reshaped the world. However, perhaps one of the most revolutionary developments in recent history has been the invention of cryptocurrency. Born out of the desire for financial freedom and decentralization, cryptocurrency went from being a mysterious and obscure concept in the deep web to a powerful force that influenced global politics, even reaching the highest echelons of government—The White House.



The Mysterious Beginnings: A Digital Currency for the Free



The story of cryptocurrency begins in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, a time of economic collapse, widespread disillusionment with central banking systems, and a desire for alternative solutions. In October 2008, a whitepaper titled ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" was published by a pseudonymous figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto. This paper laid the foundation for what would become Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, and introduced the revolutionary concept of a blockchain—a public, transparent ledger where all transactions are recorded without the need for a central authority like a bank.



At the heart of Nakamoto's vision was the idea that money could exist outside of government control, free from the inflationary pressures of fiat currencies, and completely anonymous. This idea struck a chord with many, particularly libertarians, technologists, and those frustrated by the corruption and inefficiencies of traditional financial systems. However, the true impact of this idea would not be fully realized for many years.



For the first few years, Bitcoin existed primarily in the shadows. It was a currency used by a niche group of people—cryptographers, libertarians, and hackers—who valued privacy and the idea of a financial system without middlemen. One of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin was the deep web—the hidden part of the internet where illegal activities were often carried out. The most infamous of these was Silk Road, a black market for illicit goods, where Bitcoin became the preferred payment method. In this realm, Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature made it ideal for untraceable transactions.



But as time went on, cryptocurrency began to attract attention from outside these dark corners of the internet.



The Rise of Cryptocurrency: Mainstream Recognition



By the early 2010s, cryptocurrency had grown from a niche idea to a phenomenon. Bitcoin's value started to rise, and its potential as a legitimate alternative currency was recognized by a growing number of investors, entrepreneurs, and developers. In 2013, the value of a single Bitcoin surpassed $1,000 for the first time, sparking widespread media attention and bringing cryptocurrency into the public eye.



However, despite its growing popularity, cryptocurrencies remained highly controversial. Many viewed them with suspicion, associating them with criminal activities in the deep web and dark web. Governments and financial institutions around the world remained skeptical, and regulatory challenges loomed large.



That all began to change in 2017 when a series of events changed the trajectory of cryptocurrency. Ethereum, a new cryptocurrency created by Vitalik Buterin, introduced the concept of smart contracts—self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Ethereum expanded the possibilities of blockchain technology, moving beyond simple transactions to more complex applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (dApps).



As the technology evolved, major financial institutions, tech giants, and even governments started to take notice. In 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) held its first public hearings on the regulation of cryptocurrencies, signaling that the digital currency movement was gaining traction.



Cryptocurrency and the White House: A New Era of Digital Diplomacy



While cryptocurrency began as a financial tool for individuals and businesses on the margins, its growing influence soon captured the attention of powerful political institutions. In 2021, the cryptocurrency landscape had evolved to the point where it could no longer be ignored by major governments. Countries like El Salvador had embraced Bitcoin as legal tender, and China had launched its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). The U.S., too, found itself grappling with the implications of the cryptocurrency revolution.



As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies gained in legitimacy, the White House took an interest in how these digital currencies could impact the global economy, financial systems, and the future of U.S. monetary policy. The rise of decentralized finance, the integration of blockchain technology into traditional sectors like banking, and the growing influence of cryptocurrency on global trade and investment meant that cryptocurrency was no longer just a fringe movement—it was becoming a central issue in global finance and governance.



In 2021, the White House began hosting roundtable discussions and meetings on cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and the regulatory challenges posed by decentralized finance. Biden's administration invited a wide range of experts to participate, including cryptocurrency developers, bankers, financial regulators, and even representatives from the crypto industry itself. The goal was to explore the potential benefits and risks of cryptocurrencies and to develop a framework for their regulation, ensuring that innovation could continue without jeopardizing the stability of the global financial system.



What was particularly striking about these meetings was the shift in tone. No longer was cryptocurrency viewed solely as a tool of criminals or anarchists. The focus was on how this new financial ecosystem could be integrated into the existing financial infrastructure. The U.S. Treasury Department began to explore ways in which cryptocurrencies could be taxed and monitored to prevent illegal activities, while the Federal Reserve began to evaluate the possibility of creating a digital dollar, which would operate alongside cryptocurrencies.



Cryptocurrency's Impact on Global Governance: A New Form of Diplomacy



As the U.S. government began to seriously engage with cryptocurrency, it also recognized that this new financial system could be used as a tool for global diplomacy. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology offered a way for nations to transact across borders without relying on traditional financial institutions. This could potentially reduce the influence of global powers like the IMF or World Bank, creating a more decentralized financial system.



Furthermore, blockchain's transparency and immutability made it an ideal tool for combating corruption and promoting democratic governance. In some countries, blockchain technology was being explored as a way to secure elections and track the flow of foreign aid.



But while the White House was focusing on the positive applications of blockchain and cryptocurrency, it was also keenly aware of the challenges. One of the key issues discussed at the White House was how to balance the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies with the need for regulation and oversight. The potential for cryptocurrencies to be used for money laundering, fraud, or tax evasion was a major concern, and policymakers were determined to create frameworks that would address these risks while still allowing for innovation.



The Legacy of Cryptocurrency: A New World of Digital Finance



Today, cryptocurrency is no longer confined to the dark web or seen as a tool for criminal activity. It has become an integral part of the global financial system, with billions of dollars in market capitalization and a rapidly growing number of use cases. In the wake of the 2020-2021 crypto boom, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others have gained legitimacy and have been adopted by major institutions, including governments, tech companies, and investment firms.



The White House, too, has embraced this new reality. Cryptocurrency is now discussed not only in terms of financial policy but also in relation to national security, international diplomacy, and economic sovereignty. The growing influence of digital currencies has become a central theme in the world of international relations and global finance, and the U.S. government recognizes that the future of money may very well be digital, decentralized, and borderless.



In a sense, the invention of cryptocurrency, from its beginnings in the shadows of the deep web, has come full circle. It has moved from a tool of anonymity and rebellion to a catalyst for political and financial change, impacting everything from global governance to the policies of the White House. As cryptocurrency continues to evolve, its story will undoubtedly shape the future of money and governance in ways that we can only begin to imagine.

In many western countries the promotion of cultural acceptance has become intertwined with the strong encouragement of groups and communities to maintain and cultivate their differences. Terminology such as the “Cultural Mosaic” in Canada, celebrates this mentality. The concept of the Cultural Mosaic, in which each culture remains distinct, and the pushing of individuals to maintain their “uniqueness” have become synonymous with the concept of multiculturalism, when in fact they are not.

As Beijing tightens the grip on stablecoins, Alibaba chooses another path: that of the deposit token backed by banks. This is not a technical detail, it is a full-scale test of the limits of the Chinese model: zero tolerance for private onshore stablecoins, but calculated openness for regulated tokens, useful for exports.

Alibaba does not talk about launching “a new crypto”. The group wants to use a technology resembling a stablecoin, but within a classic banking framework. The idea is simple: a deposit token is a blockchain token that represents a direct claim on a deposit in a commercial bank. Legally, it is not a casino chip, it is a regulated liability of the issuing bank.

In practice, Alibaba's cross-border e-commerce mainly seeks to streamline international payments. Today, an SME selling via Alibaba juggles currency conversions, SWIFT delays, and hidden fees. With a deposit token, settlement could become almost instantaneous, programmable, traceable, while remaining within the banking perimeter understood and controlled by regulators.

This choice does not come out of nowhere. A few days earlier, JPMorgan deployed its own deposit token for institutional clients. The message sent to the market is clear: big banks no longer want to leave the tokenized payments field to stablecoin issuers alone. If banks get involved, they give the State what it demands: innovation, but under surveillance.

For months, China has been repeating the same scenario: technical interest, political rejection. Ant Group, JD.com, and other tech giants showed interest in stablecoins or tokenized products in Hong Kong. Beijing called time out: projects were frozen, clear signals that “made in China” stablecoins will not circulate freely on the mainland.

The implicit message is harsh but understandable. On one side, China pushes its digital yuan (e-CNY), fully public, programmable, controlled by the central bank. On the other, it does not want a jungle of private stablecoins creating competing quasi-currencies, hard to control, and potentially exploited for fraud, money laundering, or unauthorized capital flows.

In this context, Alibaba's version of the deposit token appears as a political compromise. The token remains tied to a classic bank deposit, under existing regulation, audited, capitalized, supervised. In the eyes of authorities, it is not a new currency but a new technical interface for an old concept: the bank deposit. Crypto remains outside; “bank tokenization” is tolerated as long as it does not challenge the Chinese monetary hierarchy.

This stance aligns with another movement: pressure on research, reports, and seminars dedicated to stablecoins, a dynamic that contrasts sharply with the United States where the Fed, affected by these debates, is regularly pushed to adjust its monetary policy reflection. By cutting off the intellectual oxygen of the sector, Beijing clearly shows it does not want a domestic stablecoin industry to emerge. But it still leaves some leeway to actors willing to evolve within a strictly banking framework and under enhanced supervision.

While China locks down onshore stablecoins, it allows offshore yuan stablecoins and initiatives related to the Belt and Road to develop. These projects target foreign markets, off-continent companies, strategic payment corridors. In other words, the technology serves economic influence but must not disrupt the domestic monetary ecosystem.

Alibaba's deposit token fits this logic. It primarily targets cross-border payments for merchants, not speculative trading on Binance or DeFi platforms. If the project materializes, it could become an invisible tool for the end user: buy in fiat, sell in fiat, but in between, value flows as bank tokens on a blockchain infrastructure.

For the crypto market, the signal is ambivalent. On one hand, it confirms that the “crypto vs banks” narrative is outdated: the same tokenization mechanisms, instant settlements, and programmability can be captured by banks and big tech without volatile native tokens or mass-market stablecoins. On the other hand, it shows that governments, particularly authoritarian ones, can recover crypto technology bricks while neutralizing its truly open dimension.

The strategic question then becomes clear: is Alibaba opening a breach or closing the door? In the short term, its deposit token could accelerate the global movement toward regulated bank tokens interoperable with existing rails, to the detriment of pure stablecoins issued by crypto companies. In the long term, it tests how far China is willing to go: accept blockchain infrastructure without ever tolerating a digital currency that escapes its control.

For months now, bitcoin has followed a frustratingly familiar pattern for the bulls: seemingly over-correlated with the Nasdaq 100 when that stock gauge headed lower, but losing nearly all correlation when the leading tech index moved higher.

This week proved no different, with the Nasdaq tumbling on 2% on Thursday and bitcoin plunging twice as much. Friday then brought a modest rally for tech stocks, one that bitcoin didn't come close to matching.

Headed into the last 6 six weeks of 2025, year-to-date gains for the Nasdaq 100 now stand at 20%, while bitcoin is barely in the green, up just 3%.

What's happening, according to a report this week from Wintermute's Jasper De Maere, is not a loss of correlation with the Nasdaq 100, which remains high at about 0.8.

""This isn't a breakdown of correlation, but a reflection of asymmetry, the uneven way BTC responds to risk,"" said De Maere. ""When equities rally, BTC's reaction is muted. When they sell off, BTC tends to move more sharply in the same direction.""

De Maere measures this through ""performance skew,"" with ""positive skew"" being bitcoin outperforming in a risk-on environment and ""negative skew"" being bitcoin lagging in a risk-off environment.

It will be no shock to anyone paying attention that skew has been solidly negative for some time.

Attempting to put a number on it, Da Maere charted the percentage of days on a 365-day rolling basis in which BTC has seen positive performance skew versus the Nasdaq.

What he found is that it's fallen to levels not seen since the bottom of the last major bear market in late 2022.

Why so bad? Da Maere suggests a loss of mindshare for bitcoin as both institutional and retail speculative appetites have been quite satisfied in stocks. There are also liquidity issues as ETF inflows have slowed, stablecoin issuance has plateaued and market depth across exchanges still remains below early 2024 levels.

""Historically, this kind of negative asymmetry doesn't appear near tops but rather shows up near bottoms,"" concluded Da Maere. ""When BTC falls harder on bad equity days than it rises on good ones, it usually signals exhaustion, not strength.""

""The current BTC/Nasdaq performance skew suggests that BTC investors are somewhat exhausted and have been for a while.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Crypto bottoms ‘rarely occur' when everyone says they do: Santiment","https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-market-bottoms-sentiment-social-media-forecasts-santiment?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 02:25:55 GMT","

 Crypto sentiment platform Santiment warned that when many people start calling a crypto market bottom, it's wise to stay skeptical. 

Crypto market lows are unlikely to form at moments when many analysts and traders are calling for one, according to crypto sentiment platform Santiment.

“Be cautious when you see a widespread consensus forming about a specific price bottom,” Santiment said in a report on Saturday, adding that “true bottoms often form when the majority expects prices to fall further.”

Santiment said that this has recently emerged as a trending topic on social media after Bitcoin (BTC) briefly fell below $95,000 on Friday amid a wider technology stock decline. “This suggests many traders believe the worst is over,” Santiment said, arguing that historically such sentiment is often followed by further downside.

Crypto market participants often make calls that the market has bottomed when psychological price levels are breached, such as Bitcoin falling below $100,000. 

Despite the bottom-calling, prominent figures such as BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and BitMine chair Tom Lee have recently reiterated their forecasts that Bitcoin could still rally to $200,000 or higher by the end of the year.

Santiment also pointed out that the ratio of positive to negative comments about Bitcoin is at its lowest point in over a month. 

“As Bitcoin's price fell, its social dominance soared to over 40%, showing it is the main topic of a very fearful conversation,” Santiment said.

The sentiment platform added that many traders pinned the recent Bitcoin price drop on Strategy chairman Michael Saylor selling off Bitcoin, with social media mentions of “Saylor” surging sharply as Bitcoin fell.

During an interview with CNBC on Friday, Saylor denied reports that the company was offloading some of its Bitcoin amid a flash crash in the asset's price.

Related: Bitcoin ETFs bleed $866M in second-worst day on record, but some analysts still bullish

Meanwhile, Santiment said that the significant spot Bitcoin ETF outflows in recent times may be a positive sign for Bitcoin's spot price.

“Large ETF inflows have often marked local price tops, while significant outflows have coincided with market bottoms, suggesting retail panic,” Santiment said.

Over the past three trading days, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.17 billion in outflows, according to Farside.

On Thursday, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $866 million in net outflows, marking their second-worst day on record after the $1.14 billion daily outflows on Feb. 25.

Scientists Measure the Temperature of the Universe Just after the Big Bang

Quark-gluon plasma, a bizarre state of matter that mimics the early cosmos, is the hottest thing ever made on Earth

For the past quarter-century, scientists using a particle collider on Long Island have been smashing the nuclei of gold atoms together at nearly the speed of light to create the hottest matter ever made on Earth. The soup of particles born from the collision mimics the universe as it was just after the big bang. Now researchers have at last accurately measured the temperature of this matter for the first time.

After the gold nuclei crashed, the protons and neutrons within them melted into a seething cloud of quark-gluon plasma. This inferno re-creates conditions from the dawn of time, when the universe was too hot and dense to form regular atoms—or even their ingredients such as protons and neutrons. Instead the primordial cosmic soup would have been a blazing mess of the fundamental particles called quarks, as well as gluons, which carry the strong force that binds atomic nuclei together. “These are the building blocks of the particles that make up the visible world, and we're trying to figure out how they work,” says physicist Zhangbu Xu of Brookhaven National Laboratory and Kent State University.

The experiment took place at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), within the STAR (Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC) detector. There, gold nuclei racing along a 2.4-mile loop reach mind-boggling speeds before they bang together and disintegrate into quark-gluon plasma. Each primordial cloud lasts for only a split second, churning out many particles as it cools, including photons (particles of light) that decay into pairs of electrons and their antimatter counterparts, positrons.

Physicists measured the mass ranges of such particle pairs to gauge the energy of the photons that birthed them, which in turn showed the temperature at which the photons were emitted. This revealed that temperature to be an astonishing 3.3 trillion degrees Celsius (5.94 trillion degrees Fahrenheit)—roughly 220,000 times hotter than the core of the sun. The scientists reported their results in Nature Communications.

Determining this temperature will help physicists figure out when and how the fiery primeval universe transitioned from quark -gluon plasma to the building blocks of atoms. These two states are different phases of matter, akin to the more familiar solid, liquid and gas phases of everyday life. “We want to map out what you could call the most fundamental ‘phase diagram' that we know of,” says Frank Geurts of Rice University, a spokesperson for STAR. “What could be more interesting than the phase diagram of the fundamental building blocks of the universe?”

The RHIC accelerator and its STAR experiment are in the final stages of their last run, after starting up 25 years ago. The machines will shut down in the next few months to make way for a larger facility called the Electron-Ion Collider, which is due to open in the early 2030s. Even after STAR closes, however, scientists will analyze its last batch of data over the next few years to further hone their measure of this original cosmic fire.

Math Puzzle: Falling Through

By Emma R. Hasson 

Some say the reason most manhole covers are round is that a circle cannot fall through a smaller circular hole. Which of these other two-dimensional shapes cannot fall through a hole that is the same shape but slightly smaller?

Amanda Montañez

Shapes 1, 2 and 3 can all fall through their own holes. Shape 4 cannot.

Amanda Montañez



Challenge problem: Can you find another shape that cannot fall through a slightly smaller hole of the same shape?

The circle is one of an infinite family of shapes that have a constant diameter—that is, no matter what angle a line crosses it at, the widest point of the shape will always be the same. The Reuleaux triangle is another example and thus another shape that cannot fall through a slightly smaller hole of the same shape.

Amanda Montañez

You could also find a shape similar to number 4 whose individual straight segments are smaller than the smallest diameter of the shape.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists reverse kidney damage in mice, hope for humans next","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251114094525.htm","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 02:42:53 GMT","

Serious injury to short-term kidney function, known as acute kidney injury (AKI), can be life-threatening and also raise the likelihood of developing permanent chronic kidney disease. AKI can occur after major stressors such as sepsis or heart surgery, and more than half of all intensive care patients experience it. No approved medications currently exist to treat this condition.

Researchers at University of Utah Health (U of U Health) have discovered that fatty molecules called ceramides initiate AKI by damaging the mitochondria that supply energy to kidney cells. By using a backup drug candidate designed to alter how ceramides are processed, the team protected mitochondrial structure and prevented kidney injury in mice.

""We completely reversed the pathology of acute kidney injury by inactivating ceramides,"" says Scott Summers, PhD, distinguished professor and Chair of the Department of Nutrition and Integrative Physiology in the University of Utah College of Health and senior author on the study. ""We were stunned -- not only did kidney function stay normal, but the mitochondria were unscathed,"" Summers says. ""It was truly remarkable.""

The results are published in Cell Metabolism.

Ceramide spikes may serve as an early warning

Earlier studies from the Summers lab showed that ceramides can harm organs such as the heart and liver. When the researchers measured ceramides in AKI models, they found a strong connection: levels rose sharply after injury in both mice and in human urine samples.

""Ceramide levels are very elevated in kidney injury,"" says Rebekah Nicholson, PhD, first author on the work, who completed the research as a graduate student in nutrition and integrative physiology at U of U Health and is now a postdoctoral fellow at the Arc Institute. ""They go up quickly after damage to the kidneys, and they go up in relation to the severity of the injury. The worse the kidney injury is, the higher the ceramide levels will be.""

These findings indicate that urinary ceramides could act as an early biomarker for AKI, giving clinicians a tool to identify vulnerable patients, including those preparing for heart surgery, before symptoms begin. ""If patients are undergoing a procedure that we know puts them at high risk of AKI, then we can better predict whether or not they're actually going to have one,"" Nicholson says.

Altering ceramide production protects kidney function

The team nearly eliminated kidney injury in a mouse model by modifying the genetic program that controls ceramide production. This change produced ""super mice"" that did not develop AKI even under conditions that typically cause severe damage.

The researchers then tested a ceramide-lowering drug candidate created by Centaurus Therapeutics, a company co-founded by Summers. Mice treated ahead of time avoided kidney injury, maintained normal kidney function, remained active, and had kidneys that appeared close to normal under the microscope. Nicholson notes that their model places extreme stress on the kidneys, making it ""really remarkable that mice were protected from the injury.""

""These mice looked incredible,"" Summers adds.

The team found that ceramides harm mitochondria, the parts of the cell responsible for energy production. Damaged mitochondria in kidney cells become distorted and function poorly. Adjusting ceramide production, whether genetically or with the drug, kept mitochondria intact and working even under strain.

Potential for future therapies targeting mitochondrial health

Summers explains that the compound used in this study is closely related to, but not identical to, the ceramide-lowering drug that has entered human clinical testing. He emphasizes that mouse results do not always predict human outcomes and that further research is needed to confirm safety.

""We're thrilled by how protective this backup compound was, but it's still preclinical,"" Summers says. ""We need to be cautious and do our due diligence to make sure this approach is truly safe before moving it into patients.""

Even so, the researchers are encouraged by the findings. If the results extend to people, the drug could potentially be administered ahead of time to individuals who face a high risk of AKI, including patients undergoing heart surgery, where about one quarter experience the condition.

Because the drug appears to work by maintaining mitochondrial health, the team believes that the approach may have relevance for other disorders linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.

""Mitochondrial problems show up in so many diseases -- heart failure, diabetes, fatty liver disease,"" Summers says. ""So if we can truly restore mitochondrial health, the implications could be enormous.""

The results are published in Cell Metabolism as ""Therapeutic Remodeling of the Ceramide Backbone Prevents Kidney Injury.""

A friend once told me something I've never forgotten: “You seem like a crafty person, but you actually aren't crafty at all.” She's right. I have a good eye for design, but I'm not particularly good at making things. My best handiwork is my smart lock installations and digital craftsmanship, like fun holiday cards I can design on tools like Canva. Anything else that needs to be made by hand is better left to someone who isn't me.

That digital design skill can come to life with the help of a vinyl cutter like Cricut. I had a vision to turn a happy birthday banner into a “Soup-giving” banner for my soup-themed Friendsgiving day, and I was able to easily pull up the Cricut app, choose a font that spoke to my party vibe, and instantly print it out and stick it onto the backs of the banner for a whole new look. It was easy and painless once I figured out what size I wanted, and I pulled this off with the newer Cricut Explore 4 ($229), which made my letters in seconds. WIRED reviewer Kat Merck has and loves the less expensive Cricut Joy Xtra ($149), with which she can create stickers and iron-on decals from designs she uploads. The vinyl can go on all kinds of things, from posters to cups, letting you get as specific with your decor as you want without any heavy lifting.

The biggest lift before a party? Cleaning the house. I have a preschooler who gets sand, leaves, and shredded cheese everywhere he goes, so there's always a lot of cleaning to be done before my home feels habitable. (Or livable without wearing the thickest house slippers I can find.) While I can't automate away the Hansel and Gretel-like trails of snacks off the couch, there is an automation that can help me with the floors: a robot vacuum.

I'm currently testing the Narwal Flow Robot Vacuum and Mop ($1,500) for our guide to the Best Robot Vacuums, but any robot vacuum and mop we recommend can help with this task. Just turn it on and let it work; I let the Narwal vacuum and mop while I installed a light strip around my kitchen island and printed out letter decoration with my Cricut. I especially like the vac-mop combos since my home is almost entirely hard flooring—nothing feels as good as my floors after a good vacuuming sesh followed by a mop job. It does take the main floor of my house the better part of two hours to get fully vacuumed and mopped, so make sure to do this well ahead of party time. But I can confirm the Narwal was able to make the crazy amount of crumbs and dried-up Play-Doh disappear from my floors; just make sure to move things like chairs or toddler towers out of the way of particularly messy spots that you want to make sure the vacuum can deep clean without any furniture legs blocking the way. The Narwal didn't get stuck on any furniture I left out, though, which was nice to see. If you're looking for something more affordable and don't mind missing out on a mop, a great affordable robot vacuum is the G10+ robot vacuum.

Ambience is a key party factor. I'm an inveterate hater of The Big Light, as nothing is less of a vibe than turning on a light so bright you feel like you're trapped in a fluorescent classroom. Certainly not the holiday party ambience you want, let alone the vibe I like when I'm just playing Hades 2 at the end of the day.

The solution is layered lighting, bringing lighting options at various eye levels that aren't insanely bright but instead distribute light nicely throughout the room. The best way to do that is with a combination of smart lights and light strips, as you'll see in the TikTok above. These are such a great way to perfect your lighting since you can choose the right shade of white, or choose colorful holiday scenes or just colors you like. I really like GE Cync's lights, especially since both the light strips ($36 for 16 inches) and light bulbs ($35 for two) can sync to music using a built-in microphone. The microphone is at the base of the light strips, so place your speaker accordingly.

Cync's indoor light strip and kitchen cabinet lights ($52 for three), which I installed in my kitchen, introduce a beautiful, layered lighting look. My personal go-to for a cozy feel is the Candle Light Show you'll find in Cync's presets. It glows and flickers in shades of warm yellow and orange, but there are also light shows themed to the Christmas holidays, fireworks, and a winter aurora. You can also set up for the lights to turn on at certain times of day to automate your home brightening as the party goes into the evening.

My biggest struggle when I'm hosting is answering the door. The entry to my home is on a separate lower floor than the rest of my house, and I have a young child and a gate to keep him upstairs, so answering the door is a multilayered effort to get past my child, the gate, and the stairs to finally reach the door. Luckily, I have just the smart home hack for this: a smart lock.

I can't rave enough about how much smart locks have improved my daily life, including automating my parties. It's not easy to check if the door's locked when your anxious little mind starts wondering at 10 pm whether you left it unlocked, and it's not any easier when you're trying to entertain guests on the second floor while still letting people in on the bottom floor.

Instead, for my event, I gave my guests their own code to use to let themselves in. It was honestly such a relief not to have to jump the gate and run down the stairs every time someone arrived. I still had the Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch on my door for the party, but all of our smart lock picks let you add codes and even create temporary ones that will automatically expire after the party, so you don't have to worry about someone trying to waltz back into your home later.

You can also use video doorbells to help you answer your door, or at least be alerted when someone's arrived. I have a Ring doorbell that will make my Echo devices alert me when the doorbell is rung, which can be a nice solution if you don't want people to let themselves in, but want to be able to see who's at the door without leaving the kitchen. You can also set up your smart speaker to unlock your door with a voice command, though you'll have to access the settings to specifically allow that—for security reasons, it doesn't work by default.

I'm the designated Photo Friend. You know me, you love me, I took the pre-pandemic Facebook profile photo you still haven't changed. If you're the host and also the photo-inclined friend, it can be hard to juggle getting group pictures while also doing everything else you need to for the party.

There's an automated solution, though. For my latest parties, I brought the HP Sprocket Photo Booth Machine ($600), and it was a hit. It's a 21-inch-tall, portable photo booth that both automatically prints 3 x 4-inch pictures and lets you download digital versions via a QR code. I love that you can create events on the device and set up customized filters—mine had the word “Soupsgiving” on the bottom, though it was in an incredibly small font compared to the regular filter designs—and you can also add settings like how many prints of one picture guests can print. We left the default setting of two on for the soup-themed Friendsgiving, but I think I'll bump it up to at least three for future gatherings. Make sure to stock up on HP's Zink paper packs ($40 for 50) for the photo booth to print with, especially if it's a big gathering. It will need both Wi-Fi access and a power outlet.

Feeding a crowd is hard. Feeding a crowd that includes some serious allergies and dietary restrictions doesn't make it any easier. In the spirit of automating everything I could, I turned to ChatGPT to come up with my appetizer for a group that featured two vegetarians and someone whose allergies include avocado, beans, shellfish, and eggs. (Getting those two sets of friends their protein needs at the same time has a singular overlap in the Venn diagram of what they can all eat: tofu.)

ChatGPT did a good job brainstorming some possible options, and when I asked for a holiday angle, it came up with new options that were nice and seasonal. I chose to go with the lowest-lift option—pomegranate and ricotta crostini—but the baked brie bites were a big contender too. I was able to have this digital conversation and get the recipes all on ChatGPT's free tier, but you can hit the paywall when you ask too many questions or ask things that need more research from the artificial intelligence.

Fellow WIRED reviewer Matthew Korfhage is currently testing two different robots that will cook your dishes for you, but in the meantime, the closest I've found is the 10-in-1 Ninja Foodi PossibleCooker Pro ($119). You can choose from options ranging from sear and slow cook to sous vide and even bake. It turned my broccoli-cheddar soup experiment (I was on a quest to replicate my favorite Panera soup for Soupgiving) into a one-pot dish where I could sauté my onions, stir up my béchamel, and then mix in all my ingredients and let it simmer until done. It even comes with an integrated utensil.

It was really helpful to use in an already busy kitchen, and I imagine it would be indispensable for big, Thanksgiving-style dinners where the stove and oven are monopolized. While I still had to do the cooking, I was able to hang out in my own little spot and let the PossibleCooker help me. It has a timer in the front to help remind me how long I've been cooking on a setting, though I do wish there were a medium setting (your choices are low and high for the cooktop settings).

There are a lot of food scraps when you're cooking for events like Thanksgiving and holiday dinner parties. I really loved grabbing the canister from the FoodCycler and bringing it next to where we were cooking soups so everyone could throw their food scraps in as we went. When it's full, just set it in the machine and it will grind-and-dry the scraps (or leftovers!) into a sort of nutrient-rich meal that can be mixed in with potting soil or sprinkled on your lawn. I have the new FoodCycler Eco 5, and WIRED reviewer Kat Merck recommends the FoodCycler Eco 3 as one of her favorite home food recyclers.

The holiday season is only just starting, and I'll be testing more gadgets and gear all season long. Here's some of what I'm testing next:

The Bartesian Cocktail Maker ($349): This cocktail maker promises to be the Keurig of cocktail machines, with capsules for cocktail mixes instead of coffee. You'll need to bring your own liquor, but once you fill up the included containers with the liquid, the machine should be able to take it from there. I'll be testing some of the fun holiday cocktails too.

Moen Align Smart Faucet ($554): If you're tired of water splashing everywhere behind your sink, or wish it were easier to automate turning on your kitchen faucet or to measure the perfect amount of water for a recipe, Moen's touchless smart faucet with voice control is the answer. It even connects to smart assistants like Alexa.

Pura 4 Smart Home Fragrance Diffuser ($50): I was hoping to try our favorite nebulizer from our guide to the Best Scent Diffusers for my soup-themed soiree, but my husband's Hungarian goulash filled our whole home with its scent a full hour before the party even started. WIRED reviewer Kat Merck has multiple Puras and says they're a great solution for areas with stale air, like my entry stairwell with no windows (but a lot of shoes).

This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

It can carry life-threatening diseases. It's difficult to find and hard to kill. And it's obsessed with human blood.

The Aedes aegypti is a species of mosquito that people like Tim Moore, district manager of a mosquito control district on the Western Slope of Colorado, really don't want to see.

“Boy, they are locked into humans,” Moore said. “That's their blood meal.”

This mosquito species is native to tropical and subtropical climates, but as climate change pushes up temperatures and warps precipitation patterns, the Aedes aegypti—which can spread Zika, dengue, chikungunya and other potentially deadly viruses—is on the move.

It's popping up all over the Mountain West, where conditions have historically been far too harsh for it to survive. In the last decade, towns in New Mexico and Utah have begun catching Aedes aegypti in their traps year after year, and just this summer, one was found for the first time in Idaho.

Now, an old residential neighborhood in Grand Junction, Colorado, has emerged as one of the latest frontiers for this troublesome mosquito.

The city, with a population of about 70,000, is the largest in Colorado west of the Continental Divide. In 2019, the local mosquito control district spotted one wayward Aedes aegypti in a trap. It was odd, but the mosquitoes had already been found in Moab, Utah, about 100 miles to the southwest. Moore, the district manager, figured they'd caught a hitchhiker and that the harsh Colorado climate would quickly eliminate the species.

“I concluded it was a one-off, and we don't have to worry too much about this,” Moore said.

But then, a few years later, it happened again. They found two more of the invasive mosquito species in traps in 2023.

“Coincidence is not a word you use much in science,” said Hannah Livesay, biologist at the Grand River Mosquito Control District, which is based in Grand Junction.

The team bought different traps and adjusted their techniques to hunt for the mosquito. Scientific literature and mosquito researchers told them the effort was bound to be pointless. It was unlikely the mosquito would make it through the winter.

Then, the results started coming in. In 2024, the first year of the Aedes aegypti surveillance program, the district caught 796 adults and found 446 eggs.

These mosquitoes weren't just surviving in Colorado—they were thriving.

Mosquitoes are often called the most dangerous species on the planet for their ability to spread life-threatening diseases to humans. Of those, malaria, carried by female Anopheles mosquitoes, has long been one of the most devastating.

However, as climate change allows the Aedes aegypti to move northward, survive at higher elevations and stay active for longer into the fall, dengue virus is fast emerging as one of the most dangerous of the world's diseases transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks, researchers say.

Between 2000 and 2024, dengue cases reported to the World Health Organization increased more than twentyfold, as climate change, urbanization and global travel and trade pushed the mosquito vector for the disease into new areas. Climate change has also lengthened the season during which the insect can breed and thrive in areas where it's endemic. About half the world's population is now at risk of dengue, according to the WHO, and between 100 and 400 million infections occur each year.

The virus is often mild or asymptomatic, but for some people, it can become severe, so painful that it's nicknamed “break-bone fever.” It can even be deadly. More than 2,500 dengue-related deaths have been reported globally in 2025, with outbreaks in Brazil, India, Australia and other countries. In the US, dengue is most common in Florida, where the Aedes aegypti mosquito has thrived for centuries in the subtropical and tropical climates.

In Colorado, state medical entomologist Chris Roundy said that while the mosquito is in Grand Junction, the state's public health officials are not too worried about disease spread—yet.

“The presence of those mosquitoes does not mean that dengue is going to be there,” Roundy said.

For the mosquitoes to spread disease, they need to feed on a human who is already sick: Someone who traveled to Florida, contracted dengue and then returned to Grand Junction while they're still infected, for example.

In other words, the chances of an outbreak of dengue or another of the diseases the Aedes aegypti carries in western Colorado remain pretty slim. Still, he said, “we are keeping a very close eye on [the mosquitoes] to see if they expand their area in Grand Junction, or if we start seeing them in other counties.”

On a warm and sunny October morning in Grand Junction, David Garrett, team lead for the Grand River Mosquito Control District's Aedes aegypti program, parked his white truck on what the team calls their “epicenter street” in the old residential neighborhood of Orchard Mesa, where the Aedes aegypti found a foothold in Colorado.

It was collection day.

Across the rest of Colorado, mosquito control operations aimed at preventing the spread of West Nile virus are winding down. Populations of the native Culex tarsalis mosquitoes, the primary vector for the virus, were declining rapidly in the autumn chill.

But in Grand Junction, Garrett is still in the field looking for the invasive mosquito species that seems to get active in the fall.

The traps need to be close to humans—the food source—and an inviting place for the mosquitoes to lay eggs. Unlike the mosquitoes that are native to the Western Slope, which breed in standing water like ditches and ponds, the Aedes aegypti mosquito prefers to breed in containers like potted plant saucers, watering cans, and decorative yard fixtures. The traps for them look like unassuming black plastic buckets with an oddly shaped funnel attached to their tops. The district has snuck them into corners of front yards, between bushes and along fences throughout the neighborhood.

Garrett plucks out the sticky papers that have been inside the traps for the previous week, replaces them with clean sticky papers and adds a bit of fresh water. He'll take the samples back to the lab to count how many Aedes aegypti they snagged.

But before doing that, he paused to peel one of the sticky papers apart and counted four invasive mosquitoes stuck to it. Their jet black bodies with reflective white markings are easy to differentiate from the dusty brown of the native desert mosquitoes.

As of mid-October, the district had caught 526 adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in 2025, all in the Orchard Mesa area.

The mosquitoes don't lay all their eggs in one basket. They skip from container to container, laying a few eggs in each. “You don't find one and find them all,” said Livesay, the district's biologist. “So, it's really difficult to track them down.”

Back in the car, control district staff wound through the neighborhood. From the passenger seat, Livesay pointed with a frustrated sigh at an old tire lying in a yard. “Tires are one of the most common places you find them,” she said.

The species' preference for backyards and gardens makes it incredibly difficult to control, Livesay said. The district had to get permission from dozens of homeowners in the Orchard Mesa area to set up and maintain traps on private property, and only a handful of homeowners have allowed them to spray insecticides in their yards.

“You don't find one and find them all. So, it's really difficult to track them down.”

Public awareness of the mosquito's presence, and the potential health risk it could pose, has been gradual; the district has passed out fliers and chatted with residents, but the campaign doesn't appear to have quite taken root. On the day the team checked its traps, several residents said that they weren't aware that an invasive mosquito was present in their neighborhood.

The new species is also expensive to control: It has cost the district about $15,000 this year in new traps, additional staff who must stay later into the season and different insecticides after learning that the mosquitoes had a resistance to the one they use for the native mosquitoes—permethrin.

Given how costly it is to control them, further expansion of their range on the Western Slope is Moore's biggest concern. Right now, the Aedes aegypti occupies about 100 acres of the Orchard Mesa neighborhood. He doesn't want it to gain any more ground.

“If we can't get rid of them, or at least confine them,” Moore says, “that's a huge game changer for us.”

While it's virtually impossible to know how the mosquitoes got into Colorado, experts said, the pathway could've been as benign as a Grand Junction resident bringing home a potted plant from out of state.

Robert Hancock, a mosquito researcher and biology professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver, said that, since the mosquito follows humans and is easily transported by the containers it breeds in, he's not surprised when it pops up in Colorado and other high and cold locations. What does surprise him is when the mosquito can survive winters in those areas.

Hancock noted it's recently been found to endure the winters in Utah, California, and Oregon—and now in Colorado.

“That's the scary part, because it made it to the next summer in Grand Junction,” Hancock said, speaking in his Denver lab while feeding his own colony of Aedes aegypti, reared for research. (He allows the mosquitoes, which are completely free of disease, to feed on his own arm.)

As the climate warms, Hancock said, “Aedes aegypti is performing at an extraordinarily high level.”

More than half of pathogenic diseases can be aggravated by climate change, a 2022 article in the journal Nature Climate Change found.

Livesay, the biologist, suspects the newcomer mosquitoes are wiggling their way into basements and greenhouses to weather the Colorado winter, which doesn't have as many freezing nights as it used to.

Grand Junction had only 17 days of below-freezing temperatures in 2024, the fewest on record, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Typically, the area gets more than two months' worth of freezing weather. Winters there have, on average, warmed 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1970.

“We need a cold winter for the mosquitoes to not make it through,” Livesay said. “Things are hovering just above freezing, and they're able to last.”

A lot of apps are adding artificial intelligence to their products in the most in-your-face manner possible. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta are all adding colorful buttons and pop-ups to their user interface, and barraging their customers with marketing emails, all of which are loudly begging users to try out the new AI features.

It was refreshing, in that context, to talk to indie app makers Omni Group about their approach to AI. The Seattle-based company makes OmniFocus, a powerful task management application long loved by reviewers and enthusiasts for its extreme flexibility. If you can imagine a way you'd like to manage your tasks, OmniFocus is flexible enough to enable it without ever feeling overly cluttered. And the plan for AI is in line with that: The development team wants to keep AI offline and private, and empower users to set it up however they like.

This means the average OmniFocus user won't see any pop-ups imploring them to use AI in the application itself. AI is instead added as a potential tool for anyone who wants to build automations, or anyone who installs one of the automations built by someone else. A few people have already done exactly that; you can find a handful of such automations here. Here's how to give them a spin.

To get started you'll need to be running one of Apple's new “26” operating systems—macOS, iOS, and iPadOS are all supported. These operating systems all support one of the least-discussed new features in macOS 26—third-party applications can now utilize Foundation, the large language model that powers Apple Intelligence.

To use these new features you'll also need an up-to-date version of OmniFocus, which is currently the only Omni application that supports AI. (These features are coming to other Omni applications like OmniPlanner and OmniGraffle eventually, according to company representatives.)

Next, head to the Omni-Automations directory and click one of the productivity tools that looks interesting. You'll see the source code for the automation, but you can always click the Install Plugin-In button above the code for the plug-in itself. (You may have to enable scripts from external applications before you can install anything.)

One, called Help Me Plan, can break any task in your inbox into subtasks. I tried this out on a task titled “Write about OmniFocus Automation features” and several subtasks were quickly added below, from research to drafting to finalizing. Now, these steps aren't exactly how I'd proceed in writing an article, but the idea is more to get yourself started when you feel stuck.

My favorite automation, Clipboard Events, turns whatever's on your clipboard into a task, or multiple tasks, complete with an accurate description and due dates. It's a great way to turn an overwhelming block of text into a concise reminder of what you need to do next.

You can use these features without any understanding about how they work, but what I find interesting is how far Omni goes to explain how it works. There's extensive documentation, including a video, explaining how the automation features can connect to Apple's new Intelligence APIs, as well as how Omni's new APIs connect to it. And you can read the source code for every automation before installing it—they're generally not very long.

In other words this is an automation platform built with power users in mind. The idea is for enthusiasts to build on top of the AI in ways that fits into their workflow. “This is ignition, not even liftoff,” said Naomi Pearce, who does public relations for Omni. “It's very early days.”

I've written before about how I don't think chatbots are the future of how we'll use AI, pointing to the indie app Substage as an example of how machine intelligence features might be used instead. That application lives under the Finder and lets you manipulate files by typing plain text commands. I like how that puts the language model to work in a way that doesn't make you think about it. Omni's automation-based use of AI is similar. Once a plug-in is set up, you can use it with just a click, without having to think much about the technology. I hope all AI becomes similarly invisible in time.

You've seen it on social media: “This $15,000 Chinese EV will DESTROY the auto industry!!” In fact, 2025 was to be the year when electric vehicles reached global price parity with gasoline cars in their segments: They'd cost the same, regardless of whether they had an engine or a battery with electric motors. In North America, that didn't happen.

As US vehicle prices continue to soar, it begs the question: When will the US get EVs that are more affordable, as cheap as gas cars, to make mass-market shoppers pay attention? They face new headwinds: The $7,500 national EV purchase incentive ended September 30. That month brought the highest ever EV sales—and many predictions of doom to follow.

Let's define “affordable” as around $30,000. The average new vehicle in the US now sells for an eye-watering $50,080, and that number will likely rise. Cheaper EVs are coming, though not as fast as they have in Europe and China. WIRED spoke to industry analysts as well as executives at Ford, General Motors, Kia, and others about how they see the market, and, crucially, when we'll have affordable EVs in volume.

Every maker is keenly aware of the global threat posed by Chinese contenders like BYD. The existential question is whether non-Chinese makers will innovate fast enough to be competitive when today's tariff barriers ultimately fall.

There are three basic ways automakers can cut EV prices and still make money: First, radically simplify the vehicle and build process; second, use far cheaper batteries; and third, make vehicles smaller. Most makers combine elements of all three approaches, but stress one or another.

Ford CEO Jim Farley has been vocal about how good Chinese EVs are, after six months with a Chinese Xiaomi SU7 as his daily driver in Detroit. He said last October he “didn't want to give it back,” and he acknowledges that Ford must compete globally with the best of those companies.

He's also said Ford won't build and sell any EV on which it can't make money within a year. For that reason, Ford killed a planned midsize EV crossover and delayed the opening of a second battery plant. Then in August, it announced an entirely new, radically simpler EV platform.

In interviews with Farley and Ford's chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field, they told WIRED the company's “skunk works” in Southern California rethought every aspect of designing and manufacturing an EV to lower costs, streamline development, and simplify assembly.

The first of its new vehicles will be a 2028 electric pickup truck roughly the size of the current Ford Maverick, possibly called the Ranchero. It'll come from a retooled assembly plant in Louisville, Kentucky, in the second half of 2027. Its platform will spawn two further EVs, now scheduled for 2028: replacements for the current full-size Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup and the Ford e-Transit commercial van.

Field told WIRED the group started with a “clean-sheet process” untethered to Ford's traditional development process. Small teams will now design different aspects of the car concurrently and collaboratively, rather than handing off from one team to the next. They looked hard at every single component or assembly, stripping each down to the bare essentials. “The best part is no part,” said Field.

The company, Farley told WIRED, is investing heavily in large die castings, similar to those used by Tesla, in which giant cast structures replace dozens of smaller stampings welded together. The new vehicles will also use “structural batteries,” meaning the metal top of the battery case serves as the vehicle's floor. Seats and carpets are installed directly on top of the pack.

The rethought assembly process is a “tree” rather than a traditional line: “Three different lines feed into a relatively short end of line.” Field characterized those processes as “the front, the middle, and the rear.” Overall, the new process will supposedly eliminate one-third of existing fasteners and 130 separate stations from the process. Farley said the combined effect of fewer parts and simpler assembly improves production speed by 40 percent over a comparable internal-combustion vehicle from the Louisville plant.

Field's team also focused on cutting aerodynamic drag to the absolute minimum, to use battery energy most efficiently. A reduction of “one count [0.01] of Cd [drag coefficient] is worth $25 of battery,” he said. “I'm obsessed by this,” Field told WIRED. Farley added that in the future, Ford's “battery could be so small, so much smaller” than a battery in a comparable BYD model that the lower cost would potentially offset BYD's advantage from vertical integration.

Earlier this year, Ford told analysts it has also benchmarked the best and lowest-cost EV parts makers in the world, meaning it may add new suppliers from outside the traditional industry ecosystem. In the summer, it also asked its existing EV suppliers to reduce costs.

Producing modern battery cells is complex and very expensive; economies of scale are crucial. That's why most EV makers first bought cells from the biggest, most experienced global makers: Panasonic, LG Energy Solutions, and CATL. Only later did makers form joint ventures to bring cell fabrication in-house. Tesla was first, as it often is.

The least expensive battery chemistry is lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP), invented in the US but extensively developed by Chinese scientists over 25 years. It uses none of the metals (cobalt, manganese, nickel) that make today's cells expensive—iron ore is cheap and plentiful—but its energy density is roughly 30 percent lower by weight. It's taken 15 years of development for LFP cells to reach a density that gives US vehicles adequate range.

Although General Motors has two joint-venture NMCA (nickel manganese cobalt aluminum) cell plants with its partner LG, none of the dozen EVs it now offers has LFP batteries. The upcoming 2027 Chevrolet Bolt, built in Kansas, will be its first to use LFP cells in volume. It's a refreshed Bolt EUV (electric utility vehicle) with an entirely new battery, motors, and power electronics, and 265 miles of range. Cells will be imported from CATL in China until its Ultium plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, starts to make LFP cells by late 2027.

GM's EV sales have quietly surged this year: It's on track to become the second-highest-volume seller of EVs in the US after Tesla. The Chevrolet Equinox EV, with a version starting around $36,500—below the crucial $40K mark—is now selling close to 10,000 units a month, In a Bolt press release, Chevy said, “Together, Bolt and Equinox EV are expected to account for most of Chevrolet's 2026 EV volume”—suggesting it believes buyers will be there for affordable EVs.

GM revealed its longer-term battery strategy back in May. Within a few years, Ultium Cells plants will manufacture cells based on a revised chemistry dubbed LMR, for “lithium manganese-rich.” The company says the chemistry provides one-third higher energy density than comparable LFP cells—but at the cost of LFP. It's targeting full-volume production in 2028.

Ford, too, is creating a battery plant to make prismatic LFP cells for future EVs. The site in Marshall, Michigan, has attracted political opposition amid controversy over Ford's decision to license intellectual property for those cells from CATL, China's largest battery company. Ford pushed back on the criticism, arguing that America needs LFP batteries to lower EV costs and “reshore” a technology initially invented in the US. GM, meanwhile, says the IP in its LFP cells is fully owned by the two Ultium partners, LG and itself.

So far, Hyundai-Kia has not said it will offer LFP cells in any of its US EVs. The release date of its 2026 Kia EV4 compact sedan, expected in 2026, is now “delayed until further notice” due to “changed market conditions.” The EV4 was thought to be priced in the mid $30,000s. No VW Group brands, Toyota, Nissan, or other EV makers selling in the US have announced LFP plans.

The largest single segment in the US market is small crossover SUVs. Future low-cost EVs will be “the same subcompact and compact segments we know today,” says Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. “The larger the vehicle, the higher the cost, and the larger the battery it needs.”

New low-cost EVs can't be much smaller than today's small SUVs, and yet they have to remain utility vehicles. The 2026 Nissan Leaf and the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt fit this mold (kind of): They're tall hatchbacks with the “presence” and “stance” of SUVs, minus all-wheel drive.

The new Leaf S+ starts at $31,485 including mandatory destination fee—and offers an EPA-rated 303 miles of range. The more popular mid-range SV+ still stickers below $36,000 for 288 miles, And Nissan promises a bare-bones Leaf S to come in below $30,000. When the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt LT hits dealers early next year, it will start at $29,990—but a 1LT trim with fewer features will follow later in 2026 for $28,995.

Another approach is to offer a very different vehicle at a very low headline cost. Startup Slate Auto plans to offer a $25,000 compact pickup truck that radically simplifies the vehicle: no central touchscreen (drivers mount their phones on the dash), one color (wraps are optional extras), no power accessories (the windows wind manually!). The basic vehicle is a two-door, two-seat, small pickup roughly the size of the gasoline and hybrid Ford Maverick. Slate may be onto something: Reportedly, Toyota is now planning its own smaller EV pickup models.

The $25,000 “Blank Slate” version will have 150 miles of rated range. The sole factory option is a larger pack, at 84.3 kWh versus the base 52.7 kWh, to take range to an estimated 240 miles. Slate hasn't revealed a price for the bigger battery. A $5,000 accessory converts the two-seat pickup into a five-seat SUV, which can be installed by the owner (out of a flat pack) or by a distributor for a fee. The most popular Slate may cost around $35,000, if it ships by the end of 2026 as planned.

Slate CEO Chris Barman told WIRED that every aspect of the truck and its production were designed to keep costs low. The decision to make one single model allows Slate to build EVs more efficiently by eliminating the complexity of multiple variants—including paint. “Not having metal stamping presses [for large body panels] and a paint shop saved Slate $350 million to $500 million,” she said, based on a projected scale of up to 150,000 vehicles a year.

Will the Slate, Bolt, Leaf, and Ford pickup be joined by other cheap EVs? Sam Fiorani, VP of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, is pessimistic. With the end of incentives, “we shouldn't expect much growth in the entry-level EV market until around 2030 or later,” he said.

However, for analyst David Thomas of CDK Global, the question is whether shoppers seeking an affordable, efficient car will pick an EV from a known brand over a similarly priced Toyota Prius or Honda Civic Hybrid. A report from Urban Science cites key trends (rising consideration of EVs as more are seen on the road, more manufacturer deals, and better charging infrastructure) that will keep EV sales growing as reasons for optimism.

The overarching factor defining when cheaper EVs will spread across the US is when Chinese mass EV makers will venture into North America—the most prestigious and profitable global market they're not presently in. That seems unlikely before the end of the current president's final term. His first administration put in place steep tariffs on Chinese goods, which were left intact and later reinforced. Canada is a possible wild card; it is rumored to be considering the end of all barriers to Chinese EV imports.

Any foreign maker faces unique challenges in the US market. They're not insurmountable, as Japanese makers and then Hyundai-Kia showed, but they require decade-long commitments and billions of dollars.

As such, several reasons affect the kinds and prices of Chinese EVs that will be sold in the US. First, to make new-car buyers aware of your brand inevitably costs an awful lot of time and money. For example, Kia's digital ad spend in the US alone reached $142 million in 2021, 28 years after starting to sell cars in the country. Makers must barrage consumers with ads to let brand awareness sink in, most intensely in the short window when they're actively shopping.

Second, North Americans drive much bigger vehicles and more SUVs than cars. A 17- to 20-foot Ford F-150 pickup weighing 2 to 3 tons is largely unsellable in much of the rest of the world. Truck buyers are also more brand loyal, and more focused on towing specs than are shoppers for passenger cars and SUVs. That's tough for affordable EVs. Meanwhile, US sales of “compact” cars—a VW Golf or Jetta, say—have fallen as trucks and SUVs take over the market.

Third, US drivers log more miles each day on average than drivers in Europe, Britain, Japan, Korea, or China. American vehicles cover 33 miles a day on average in the US. A comparable figure for China is 28 miles, and just 20 miles for the European Union. Which means that range is paramount.

The current state of on-road EV fast charging in the US is hardly stellar. On a six-hour, 350-mile journey to visit relations, one charging stop may be OK, even if it's longer than a fueling stop, but two or three isn't. Nor is hunting for a working station. Hence, higher range is mandatory—meaning higher-capacity batteries at greater cost.

In other markets, a 150-mile EV may be a sensible choice. Trains are often faster for longer trips anyhow. Not so in the States. Shoppers will only consider EVs that offer “enough” range, which GM surveys show is minimum 300 miles, to ensure an EV can do every trip a gas vehicle can.

Crucially, the Chinese test cycle for determining EV range, known as China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle (CLTC), is even more biased toward lower speeds and stop-and-go city driving than the European version, WLTP—and neither is as grueling as US EPA range ratings. That “300-mile Chinese EV” might well be rated up to one-third lower on the EPA cycle.

For these reasons, many inexpensive EVs now on sale in Europe and China aren't well suited to North American life. Then there's the issue of “Federalization”: fitting equipment to comply with US motor-vehicle rules, plus safety structures to ace Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash performance ratings. This makes all US vehicles larger, heavier, and pricier.

Analysts vary in their predictions for low-cost EVs and the impact of Chinese models. S&P Global's Brinley notes “the timing is far from clear,” and Chinese makers' ability to replicate the same low-cost structure they enjoy at home is unknown.

The final word comes from China automotive hand Michael Dunne, of Dunne Strategies. In the UK, he noted, Chinese EVs—led by BYD and MG—are roughly 15 percent cheaper than Japanese and Korean models. They've captured 13 percent of the new-car market, which dealers expect to double or more within two years. “The Chinese don't have to be scary cheap,” Dunne said. “They just need to be priced low enough to make you pause—then take a closer look.”

With Chinese EVs blocked from the US for the short term, buyers' best hope right now for cheaper EVs lies in the incremental advances that produced 120 years of auto-industry innovation. Cheaper batteries that improve at roughly 8 percent a year; simpler design and assembly processes; and smaller, more basic cars will all play roles. Shoppers will see more offerings below $40,000, and within a few years, under $30,000.

Will there be 300-mile SUVs for $15,000, as social-media blurbs trumpet? Not any time soon. Consider the frequent best-selling electric model in China, the $6,200 Wuling Hongguang Mini EV. Its sales alone are more than double the total of every EV sold by GM in the US. It's also just 10 feet long in its four-door version, tops out at 62 mph, and has a range of 75 to 100 miles based on the old, very gentle NEDC driving cycle. American buyers won't buy a vehicle like that.

The BYD Seagull, now on sale in Europe, is a better candidate, but it's still rated at only 190 or 250 miles of range on a gentler test regime, and it's just 12 feet, 4 inches long. Known as the Dolphin Surf in European markets, it costs $25,000 to $30,000 there versus its Chinese price of half that amount—meaning a version that meets European requirements isn't that much cheaper than a new Bolt EV or Nissan Leaf.

TL/DR: Don't believe the clickbait. Cheap Chinese EVs present an existential threat to the world's automakers, no question. But you ain't getting a $15,000 compact SUV with 300 miles of EPA-rated range and US safety ratings anytime soon. The laws of physics haven't changed that much. Want an EV for $15K? Buy a used one.

Valve made a big return to PC hardware this week. The company, most famous for its PC gaming platform, Steam, announced a new home console called Steam Machine alongside a new version of the Steam Controller, and a new virtual reality headset dubbed the Steam Frame.

The Steam Machine is a revival of Valve's original Steam Machine, a failed attempt to bring PC gaming to the living room almost exactly 10 years ago. Now, it's back, built on the success of the Steam Deck handheld. Valve claims the new Steam Machine is six times more powerful than the Steam Deck, and it's kind of like a compact PC. We don't have exact measurements yet, but some early hands-on impressions have called it similar in size to the Nintendo GameCube. The Steam Machine uses a custom Zen 4 CPU from AMD, and will reportedly be sold in several memory and storage configurations, which are user-upgradable. The new Steam Controller is meant to be paired with the Steam Machine, and it has two haptic-feedback trackpads and the typical assortment of thumbsticks, buttons, triggers, and bumpers.

Lastly, there's the Steam Frame. This long-awaited VR headset is the follow-up to the Valve Index, which is over six years old. Valve calls the Steam Frame a “streaming-first” VR headset, meant to be connected to a PC for lag-free, wireless gaming. To overcome the problem of latency, the Steam Frame will come with a dedicated wireless module to connect to your PC to ensure all the visual data is transferred as smoothly as possible.

The Steam Frame can also be used as a stand-alone headset, running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, meaning you'd be playing x86 games on ARM in SteamOS. It's a tricky endeavor, but based on the success of the Steam Deck in juggling the emulation layers required, I trust Valve to do it in a way Microsoft has always struggled with. As for the headset itself, it only weighs 440 grams, which is significantly lighter than both the Meta Quest 3S and the recently announced Samsung Galaxy XR. It has two pancake lenses with two LCD screens at 2160 x 2160 pixels per eye.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

There's a lot more to learn about these devices, and none of the new hardware has a firm release date or price yet, as is customary with Valve. All we know is that these devices will begin shipping in early 2026. —Luke Larsen

You've probably already seen or heard about the iPhone Pocket. Inspired by a “piece of cloth,” it's a tiny shoulder bag designed to carry around your iPhone, and it stems from a collaboration between Apple and Japanese design brand Issey Miyake. The two companies have enjoyed a long history—Steve Jobs famously wore Issey Miyake's black turtlenecks on stage during every major launch event.

The cloth is a singular 3D-knitted construction made in Japan and will be able to fit any iPhone model. This isn't the first time Apple has suggested you put one of its products in a piece of cloth. In 2004, Apple debuted the iPod Socks, a simple and fun way to keep your iPod screen protected when traveling. They cost $29 at the time (about $50 today).

Unfortunately, you'll be paying a heck of a lot more for the iPhone Pocket. The pouch comes in a short-strap version for $150 and a long-strap design for $230. Both are available in a range of colors, but since this is a special-edition release, you're only able to purchase them at select Apple Store locations and Apple.com in France, China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, the UK, and the US. (It's already sold out online.)

You already have your boarding pass on your iPhone, why not your passport, too? That's the idea behind Apple's new Digital ID, a new way to add information from your US passport into Apple Wallet. Acceptance is rolling out in beta at TSA checkpoints in more than 250 airports around the US for domestic travel, though Apple says that will expand in the future.

You'll be able to present this form of identification even if you don't have a Real ID-compliant driver's license or state ID. (You can already add your driver's license to Apple Wallet, but this is only available in select states.) It's important to remember, though, that Apple's Digital ID does not replace a passport, which is still required for international travel.

Samsung has announced a new line of “portable” monitors that are meant to travel with you around your house or office. The Movingstyle (LSM7F) and Movingstyle M7 Smart Monitor (M70F) are standard 27- or 32-inch displays, with one big twist: They come with a rollable floor stand with hidden wheels. Rather than have separate large screens in each room, the idea behind these Movingstyle monitors is to have a screen on the go—similar to LG's StanbyMe range. It's not hard to imagine scenarios where this could be convenient. Maybe you're following a recipe in the kitchen or want to finish a show you're watching on your television in the bedroom. Samsung claims the wheels are quiet and stable on both hardwood floors and carpet.

To emphasize the “portability” of the monitor, the 27-inch model works more as an oversized tablet, including a handle, a built-in kickstand, three hours of battery life, and a touchscreen. While the 32-inch version lacks those features, it can still be swiveled, tilted, and even rotated into portrait mode. It also comes with a higher 4K resolution. Outside of the three hours you get on the 27-inch model, you'll still need it to be plugged into power. For that, the monitors come with a 13-foot power cable.

Both models come with the normal assortment of Samsung smart monitor features, but the 27-inch model is clearly the higher end, sporting not only extra portability features but also a faster, 120-Hz refresh rate. I'm interested to see how the 27-inch model in particular could fit into my day-to-day life. —Luke Larsen

DJI has announced the new Neo 2 drone, an update to the company's tiny 4K selfie drone. The new version offers lidar obstacle detection, better-quality video, and longer battery life. The Neo 2 is also the first DJI drone to offer a small front display, which shows the current shooting mode.

We liked the HoverAir X1 better than the original DJI Neo, in part because the Neo was slow, but also because the footage wasn't as good as the HoverAir's. The good news is that the DJI Neo 2 is much faster—up to 27 mph—and the new 12-MP, 1/2-inch sensor should deliver much nicer video quality. There are new video modes, including the ability to shoot 4K 60 frames per second, up from 4K 30 fps in the original.

So far, the company has announced no plans to sell the drone in the US, a pattern we've seen for the last few drone launches. As it stands, if there is no federal security audit of DJI by December 23, 2025, most of the company's products will likely disappear from shelves. DJI has requested the audit, but so far none of the five federal agencies responsible has undertaken the required review. It costs £209 in the UK. —Scott Gilbertson

Insta360 has released a slew of new add-ons for its Ace Pro 2 action camera. There are three new lenses available, mimicking GoPro's Hero 13 Black lens lineup with an Ultra Wide Lens, Cinematic Lens, and Close-Up/Macro Lens. A complete bundle of all lenses, the camera, handgrip mount, and two batteries is available for $740. The new accessories can also be purchased individually.

There's also a new handgrip that turns the Ace Pro into something more like a point-and-shoot camera. Controlling the camera still requires using the touchscreen, but at least you can hold it and press a shutter button just like a traditional point-and-shoot. The final, and perhaps most interesting new add-on is an instant printer that attaches to the bottom of the handgrip, turning your Ace Pro into a Polaroid-style instant camera. The Flash Print Bundle, as this is called, goes for $580 (includes camera, grip, and printer).

To go along with the hardware, there's a firmware update for the Ace Pro 2 that adds two new Leica color profiles: Leica Eternal and Leica B&W High Contrast. Alas, there is still no 10-bit color or Log video support. —Scott Gilbertson

Just over 100 days until Audi makes its F1 debut, the car company has taken the covers off its racing design. While the final car reveal will be in January, according to Audi, this R26 Concept previews the color scheme and design of the brand's first Formula 1 race car.

For three years now, Audi has been developing its power unit for Formula 1 in Neuburg an der Donau (the only operational location of an F1 team in Germany.) The hybrid setup is a turbocharged V6, an energy recovery system, energy storage, and a combined electric motor and generator, as well as an electronic control unit—a computer ""brain"" of the car, controlling the engine, hybrid systems, gearbox, and other components.

Audi says the output of the electric motor will, in the future, be on a comparable level with the combustion engine, which will be powered by sustainable fuels from 2026. However, despite the new tech and a new car, Audi's CEO, Gernot Döllner, seems well aware it will likely take years for the brand to be competitive for the world championship. “We are not entering Formula 1 just to be there,"" says Döllner. ""We want to win. At the same time, we know that you don't become a top team in Formula 1 overnight. By 2030, we want to fight for the World Championship title.” —Jeremy White

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

[Editor's Note: Agents of Transformation is an independent GeekWire series and 2026 event, underwritten by Accenture, exploring the people, companies, and ideas behind the rise of AI agents.]

What separates the dot-com bubble from today's AI boom? For serial entrepreneur David Shim, it's two things the early internet never had at scale: real business models and customers willing to pay.

People used the early internet because it was free and subsidized by incentives like gift certificates and free shipping. Today, he said, companies and consumers are paying real money and finding actual value in AI tools that are scaling to tens of millions in revenue within months.

But the Read AI co-founder and CEO, who has built and led companies through multiple tech cycles over the past 25 years, doesn't dismiss the notion of an AI bubble entirely. Shim pointed to the speculative “edges” of the industry, where some companies are securing massive valuations despite having no product and no revenue — a phenomenon he described as “100% bubbly.”

He also cited AMD's deal with OpenAI — in which the chipmaker offered stock incentives tied to a large chip purchase — as another example of froth at the margins. The arrangement had “a little bit” of a 2000-era feel of trading, bartering and unusual financial engineering that briefly boosted AMD's stock.

But even that, in his view, is more of an outlier than a systemic warning sign. 

“I think it's a bubble, but I don't think it's going to burst anytime soon,” Shim said. “And so I think it's going to be more of a slow release at the end of the day.”

Shim, who was named CEO of the Year at this year's GeekWire Awards, previously led Foursquare and sold the startup Placed to Snap. He now leads Read AI, which has raised more than $80 million and landed major enterprise customers for its cross-platform AI meeting assistant and productivity tools.

He made the comments during a wide-ranging interview with GeekWire co-founder John Cook. They spoke about AI, productivity, and the future of work at a recent dinner event hosted in partnership with Accenture, in conjunction with GeekWire's new “Agents of Transformation” editorial series.

Successful AI agents solve specific problems: The most effective AI implementations will be invisible infrastructure focused on particular tasks, not broad all-purpose assistants. The term “agents” itself will fade into the background as the technology matures and becomes more integrated.

Human psychology is shaping AI deployment: Internally, ReadAI is testing an AI assistant named “Ada” that schedules meetings by learning users' communication patterns and priorities. It works so quickly, he said, that Read AI is building delays into its responses, after finding that quick replies “freak people out,” making them think their messages didn't get a careful read.

Global adoption is happening without traditional localization: Read AI captured 1% of Colombia's population without local staff or employees, demonstrating AI's ability to scale internationally in ways previous technologies couldn't.

“Multiplayer AI” will unlock more value: Shim says an AI's value is limited when it only knows one person's data. He believes one key is connecting AI across entire teams, to answer questions by pulling information from a colleague's work, including meetings you didn't attend and files you've never seen.

“Digital Twins” are the next, controversial frontier: Shim predicts a future in which a departed employee can be “resurrected” from their work data, allowing companies to query that person's institutional knowledge. The idea sounds controversial and “a little bit scary,” he said, but it could be invaluable for answering questions that only the former employee would have known.

After a year of frenzied dealmaking and rumors of an upcoming IPO, the financial scrutiny into OpenAI is intensifying. Leaked documents obtained by tech blogger Ed Zitron provide more of a glimpse into OpenAI's financials — specifically its revenue and compute costs over the past couple of years.  

Zitron reported this week that in 2024, Microsoft received $493.8 million in revenue share payments from OpenAI. In the first three quarters of 2025, that number jumped to $865.8 million, according to documents he viewed.

OpenAI reportedly shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft as part of a previous deal where the software giant invested over $13 billion in the powerful AI startup. (Neither the startup nor the people in Redmond have publicly confirmed this percentage.)

However, this is where things get a little sticky, because Microsoft also shares revenue with OpenAI, kicking back about 20% of the revenues from Bing and Azure OpenAI Service, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Bing is powered by OpenAI, and the OpenAI Service sells cloud access to OpenAI's models to developers and businesses.  

The source also told TechCrunch that the leaked payments refer to Microsoft's net revenue share, not the gross revenue share. In other words, they don't include whatever Microsoft paid to OpenAI from Bing and Azure OpenAI royalties. Microsoft deducts those figures from its internally reported revenue share numbers, according to this person.

Microsoft doesn't break out how much it makes from Bing and Azure OpenAI in its financial statements, so it's difficult to estimate how much the tech giant is kicking back.

Nevertheless, the leaked documents provide a window into the hottest company on the private markets today — and not just how much it makes in revenue, but also how much it's spending in comparison to that revenue.  

So, based on that widely reported 20% revenue-share statistic, we can infer that OpenAI's revenue was at least $2.5 billion in 2024 and $4.33 billion in the first three quarters of 2025 — but very likely to be more. Previous reports from The Information put OpenAI's 2024 revenue at around $4 billion, and its revenue from the first half of 2025 at $4.3 billion.  

Altman also recently said OpenAI's revenue is “well more” than reports of $13 billion a year, will end the year above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate (which is a projection, not guidance on actual revenue), and that the company could even hit $100 billion by 2027. 

Per Zitron's analysis, OpenAI may have spent roughly $3.8 billion on inference in 2024. That spend increased to roughly $8.65 billion in the first nine months of 2025. Inference is the compute used to run a trained AI model to generate responses.  

OpenAI has historically almost exclusively relied on Microsoft Azure to provide compute access, though it has also struck deals with CoreWeave and Oracle, and more recently with AWS and Google Cloud. 

Previous reports put OpenAI's entire compute spend at roughly $5.6 billion for 2024 and its “cost of revenue” at $2.5 billion for the first half of 2025.  

A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that while OpenAI's training spend is mostly non-cash — meaning, paid by credits Microsoft awarded OpenAI as part of its investment — the firm's inference spend is largely cash. (Training refers to the compute resources needed to initially train a model.)

While not a complete picture, these numbers imply that OpenAI could be spending more on inference costs than it is earning in revenue. 

And those implications promise to add to the incessant AI bubble chatter that has seeped into every conversation from New York City to Silicon Valley.

They shipped a box and allowed me to swap out a hard drive for a spare (I had study data on there), I then used the box to ship the laptop to them. A few weeks later the laptop gets shipped back with a parts replacement list, which was essentially every single PCB in the laptop and I asked them to replace the keyboard too because one key was sticking. Brand new parts in a slightly cracked chassis.If Dell still has customer service like that, it's double thumbs up from me.I'm currently using a Lenovo laptop which has been solid so far. I do want my next laptop to be open to repairability (even if I have to create it myself).

Don't buy any recent Intels. Some Intel ThinkPads have accelerometers built-in just to throttle your PC to oblivion when it moves. Basically unusable in any moving vehicle such as a train. It's basically anti-portability baked-in.When it doesn't throttle, it just has abysmal battery life compared to AMD Ryzen ThinkPads of the same generation. Both lose horribly to Apple's ARM chips though.They also tend to have soldered WiFi modules, making it impossible to upgrade later when newer and better WiFi iterations come out. If that had been the case with a few of the older models I still have, they would be unusable at this point.There are plenty of firmware bugs as well. For example plenty of Lenovo (especially Intel as far as I've seen) models have stuttery and freezing touchpads. Though the touchpads tend to be horrible anyways.I'd say the older (5+ years old) generations might have had slightly better driver support or they're finally fixed at this point. But there's nothing I'd spend my money on if I can just as well install Asahi on an M-series laptop.

I have tried just one cheap Dell laptop, Vostro 3515, which works mostly fine with Linux (it came with Ubuntu, I have installed Debian), but the touchpad becomes unreponsive sometimes (probably after a sleep), and at some point it refused to charge, which required an UEFI firmware update to fix, which in turn required Windows (I had to use Windows PE) to install, as the direct update (from the UEFI itself) was failing, and there is no Linux option.Could have been worse, but now considering a Lenovo ThinkPad as a future replacement.

Build quality that rivals MacBooks, but with superior keyboard, very nice battery life and an oled screen on top of it.The problem I had with the oled screen is that I thought it oversaturate reds out of the box on Linux, which I corrected using hyprshade: https://github.com/gchamon/archie/blob/main/hypr/shaders/vib.... I am looking for a better solution because the filters get picked on screenshots and washes out the colours. I need to find an ICE profile or export one from Windows.The camera also behaves a bit weirdly. It has noticeable quality difference when using chromium and other browsers, the latter with perceptible quality degradation.Other than that, a very good mobile linux driver, snappy, cool, quiet, charges fast and a joy to use.

The way secure boot evolved is disgusting. Specially because, at the time it was becoming popular, people we're warned that was more a tool of control than for security. Having to install a proprietary OS to install another should be forbidden.

Linux boots fine using standard secure boot, so if it refused it's either NixOS using an unsigned bootloader (which is surprising to me) or secure boot just being bugged to hell.Another option is that NixOS uses secure boot but uses a signature that's too recent: one of the secure boot CAs is expiring soon, and an old BIOS may not carry the new key if NixOS opts to sign their bootloader with the latest key. This issue doesn't just affect Linux, certain Windows images won't boot on older devices either if this mismatch happens.My bet is on NVRAM getting into a weird state or a buggy BIOS. That's the most obvious thing that would get fixed by updating the BIOS.

The most critical issue would be the fans still spinning to cool down the machine when it was sent to sleep. That creates the vicious cycle when bagged right after sleep, where the fan try to lower the temp, but their running in a closed environment warms the confined air, which pushes the fan to run faster yet.That's the recipe for a hot and dead battery when you take it out of the bag.I had that with MacBooks and Windows laptops alike.

The readability of error messages was always my beef with macro-based generics. Maybe 15 years ago I played around with using UTF characters for the brackets and type separators when translating a generic type into name-mangled type, so at least the generated source and error messages would still be clear and understandable.Robust UTF support for identifiers and preprocessor was still kind of inconsistent across compilers though, so it only sort of worked. I expect this has improved considerably now though, so maybe I should try again and write something up. You can embed a surprising amount of advanced programming language theory into suitable name resolution.

This is secretly two way generation: you can edit The generated file, recompiling until until the code works, commit that, and then edit the M4 inputs until CI passes.As another example of the same principle, whenever I am required to have a requirements.txt and setup.cfg in the same puthon library, I now verify that they match in a CI check instead of trying to single source of truth by having a setup.cfg import the requirements.txt through some clever hack.

The solution to this doesn't have to be ""rewrite everything in Rust"", but it does mean that you need to provide safe, easy implementations for commonly-screwed-up patterns. Then you're not asking people to be perfect C programmers; you're just asking them to use tools that are easier than doing the wrong thing.

reply

Sure, but since there's 10x more opaque footguns in C+++, there is much less discipline needed than when coding in C++.The footguns in C are basically signed-integer over/underflows and memory errors. The footguns in C++ include all the footguns in C, and then add a ton more around object construction type, object destruction types, unexpected sharing of values due to silent and unexpected assignments, etc.Just the bit on file-scope/global-scope initialisation alone can bite even experienced developers who are adding a new nonlocally-scoped instance of a new class.

TS, on the other hand, is usable wherever JS is, and its disadvantages are much less pronounced.

reply

reply

C++ has many advantages over C, but it also brings some clear disadvantages that matter more when you want to be aware of every operation. When comparing language A against language B, it's not enough to consider what A does better than B; you also have to consider what it does worse.That's why I don't think that the comparison to TS/JS is apt. Some may argue that C++ has even more advantages over C than TS has over JS, but I think it's fairly obvious that its disadvantages compared C are also bigger. For all its advantages, there are some important things that C++ does worse than C. But aside from adding a build step (which is often needed, anyway), it's hard to think of important things that TS does worse than JS.

                Reading time 2 minutes
      

Digital hoarding becomes inevitable when you're storing years of family photos, 4K video projects, game libraries or comprehensive backup archives. Cloud storage subscriptions drain your wallet month after month, and smaller external drives fill up faster than expected. Seagate's 22TB Expansion external hard drive offers massive capacity at a price that finally makes sense, currently reduced to $299 on Amazon from its original $599 price. That represents an all-time low for this drive and works out to approximately one cent per gigabyte of storage.

See at Amazon

The 22TB equates to roughly 5,500 hours of HD video, 440,000 photos at 5MB each or your entire Steam library a few times over, with room to spare. This amount of storage means no more constant juggling over what to keep and what to delete; you can have complete and uncompromised archives. Photographers working with RAW files store whole shoots over several years while video editors can hold project files and source footage on hand without getting mired in slow cloud retrieval or having to hot-swap several smaller drives.

USB 3.0 connectivity provides transfer speeds of up to 5Gbps in theory, though real-world performance with mechanical drives typically settles around 120 to 150MB/s for sustained transfers. A 100GB folder would transfer in roughly 10 to 15 minutes at these speeds, which remains practical for most backup and archival workflows. The drive draws power through an included AC adapter rather than by USB bus power which makes sense given the power requirements of a high-capacity mechanical drive and ensures reliable operation during large file transfers.

All that's required for setup is to plug in the power adapter and hook up the USB cable to your computer. Windows systems automatically recognize the drive. Mac users can use it right away for standard file storage but if you want to use it with Time Machine for automated Mac backups, you'll need to reformat it to a Mac-compatible file system which only takes a few minutes through Disk Utility.

Seagate includes Rescue Data Recovery Services with this drive, which provides a safety net in case the drive fails and you need professional data recovery. This service alone normally costs hundreds of dollars separately, and having it included adds more value beyond just hardware. The peace of mind factor does count when you store irreplaceable family memories or critical work files on this drive, knowing that even in worst-case scenarios you have options to recover them.

That works out to roughly a cent per gigabyte, which undercuts both cloud storage and smaller capacity drives handily in terms of cost per gigabyte. A plan for 2TB of cloud storage often runs $10 to $20 per month so you'd pay $120 to $240 per year for a fraction of this drive's capacity. Over two years, those subscription fees alone are more than you're paying for 22TB of local storage that you own outright. The math gets even more favorable over three, four, or five years of use.

Screenless fitness trackers can sometimes feel like they aren't doing the job they set out to do. Sure, there's no constant stream of data to obsess over every time you turn your wrist. But in the absence of that quick peek, I find myself opening a tracker's companion app—constantly—to check on the data it's collected. In the end, I find myself spending more time staring at those charts and figures than if I took a look at the tiny screen on my wrist every now and again.

So when I began testing the Polar Loop—a new screen-free wearable health and fitness band—I wasn't all that excited. After all, the new product from Polar (the company that introduced the first wireless heart rate monitor nearly 50 years ago in 1977), almost exactly resembles the Whoop 5.0. In fact, the device, which came out in early September, has been nicknamed the subscription-free competitor to Whoop. The Polar Loop costs $199 and all its features are free in the accompanying—again, free—app. Whoop on the other hand, includes its band in the membership, but that starts at $199 a year and goes up from there.

Polar Loop

If you want a true break from all the distracting data some health trackers provide, but still want to track your basic health, the Polar Loop could be an ideal companion. 

Pros

Cons

If you anticipate using your device for more than a year, the cost of a Whoop 5.0 really adds up whereas the Loop, literally, does not at all. I spent a few weeks training with the Loop, and in the end, what made me fall in love with it was less about the cost (which, obviously, is still crucial to making a decision about purchasing a wearable) and more about what the Loop does not do: dump tons of health and fitness data at you.

If this sounds counterproductive, that is almost the point. If the goal of creating a screenless fitness tracker is to make you spend less time looking at the thing, and more time living your life, then the accompanying app should match that same tone. And there are almost no screenless wearables on the market today that do just that. Here's a deep dive into more.

Polar is a company that is no stranger to monitoring our health. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the company introduced the first wireless heart rate monitor, the Sport Tester PE2000, which was initially designed for elite endurance athletes, particularly cross-country skiers. The design—a chest-strap transmitter connected to a wrist receiver watch—allowed for real-time monitoring without wires, which was revolutionary at the time.

But a chest strap worn 24/7 would annoy just about any regular person. These days, almost all heart rate tracking systems on the market use an optical heart rate monitor, which works by shining a light into the skin to detect changes in blood volume with each heartbeat.

There's so much you can ascertain from your heart rate, and most wearables today use heart rate to track everything from sleep to step count to exercise and recovery. The Polar Loop is no different in this regard. The accompanying app, the Polar Flow, provides a detailed picture of your last night's sleep and includes other basic metrics like step count and heart rate.

The step count and heart rate lined up with what my Apple Watch was telling me (I often wore both of them at the same time, though not always). The sleep tracking also seemed to match with the Oura 4 Ceramic, which I was also testing at the time. While it's impossible to know for sure how accurate the sleep trackers are, as I don't know the exact moment I fall asleep or wake up throughout the night, they seemed fairly in line with when I went to bed and woke up. During a few of the testing nights, my cat woke me up to get fed at around 4 a.m., and the Loop successfully tracked that wake-up and the fact that I fell back asleep as well.

One aspect of the Loop's sleep tracker that I particularly liked was that it actually asks each morning how restful I thought last night's sleep was (with a series of emojis ranging from a sad face to a happy face). So much of sleep tracking science is still a black box. Scientists don't yet know enough about the correlation between time spent in various sleep stages and a good night's rest. So the basic question of how well rested you feel is still pertinent. While there's nothing you can actually do with that data right now, I still found it useful to reflect on my night's rest rather than just rely on the app telling me I got a good night's rest.

But what stands out for the Loop is what it puts emphasis on and what it leaves out. The bulk of the Polar Flow app focuses on fitness training. When you open it, you're automatically given a “Cardio Load Status,” which is essentially a measure of how fit you are. It estimates this based on the workouts you've done (again, nothing any fitness watch like Polar's own running watch or the Garmins or Coros' of the world can't do).

The Polar Loop excels because of its simplicity. There were days when I could go out for a run with nothing but the Loop and forget about pace, time, and distance and just enjoy the run. That's something that most running watches and fitness trackers don't really do. Technically, you could just set a running watch or your phone to a 30-minute timer, but the accessibility of seeing your pace, distance, and heart rate with the turn of your wrist is too tempting for me (and most runners I know).

To me, all of this is what sets the Polar Loop apart. Its pared-down app accompanied by its nonexistent screen means that, if you want, you can actually passively track your health and not obsess over it. Perhaps this will soon change as the app seems to be in its infancy and major updates are expected over the next year. But right now, the Polar Loop is an ideal health companion for me: not too much information, but not too little, either—and the ability to zen out during a run knowing you are still tracking it is exactly what I want right now.

This begs the question: Is there a perfect or ideal health or fitness tracker? Absolutely not. That'd be like demanding there be a perfect pizza topping. The perfect one is the one that fits all your wants and needs at any given time, and we all prioritize different things when it comes to fitness and health tracking. One size doesn't fit all, despite what a certain fruit-named company wants everyone to believe with its smartwatches.

The battery life on the Loop is pretty amazing. Polar says that it lasts eight days on one charge and it can store data without syncing for up to four weeks.

While I want to refrain from only comparing the Whoop 5.0 to the Loop, one small quibble I had with the Whoop 5.0 was that for whatever reason it was so uncomfortable on my tiny wrist. The Loop, on the other hand, I found incredibly easy to put on, take off, and wear indefinitely until it was time to charge. To me, a device that's intended to be worn all day long for days needs to be comfortable—and the Loop delivers. For stat nerds: the tracker itself is 27 x 42 x 9mm and it comes with a fabric band (which comes in two sizes) and weighs 29 grams. The Loop also comes in three colors: Greige Sand, Night Black, and Brown Copper.

Aesthetically, both the Loop and the Whoop 5.0 look and feel generally the same (though I'd argue the Loop is way more comfortable for people with smaller wrists). At their core, they are each screenless, passive health monitors. The key differences are their price and what they offer in their apps. Because the Whoop requires a subscription, year over year, it will be far more expensive than the Loop, which is a one-time expense with an accompanying free app.

As for what they both offer, they couldn't be more different. The Whoop is an all-encompassing health tracker that is attempting to cram as much health information into its app as it can and spit out a daily strain and recovery score, which is focused on optimizing your overall health—essentially becoming a health perfectionist. The Loop is almost like its laid-back cousin. It's going after the same goal of improving health but with a more relaxed, casual approach. To get into the nitty-gritty, they both offer heart rate, heart rate variability, sleep stages, and fitness training status. In addition to these, Whoop also offers body temperature, oxygen saturation, and advanced insights like strain and recovery scores, so you do get more tracked stats.

Taking all of that into account, Whoop is better for users who want to dig deeper into their health and wellness, whereas the Loop, at least in its current iteration, is more geared towards people who want to just wear it and forget it and get a more basic daily update on their health without inundating themselves with extra insights or needing to achieve a perfect strain or recovery score.

While I can't see someone who is training for a specific fitness goal, like a marathon, using the Polar Loop as their sole device, I can see it being used in two ways: 1) as a sole device for someone who just wants to passively track their everyday health and fitness without a specific goal in mind or 2) someone who does use a fitness watch for workouts and wants something else that just tracks their everyday health that they don't have to look at or obsess over. Though it's important to note that the Loop doesn't have an internal GPS. That means the Loop estimates distance (and pace) based on internal sensors (accelerometer, wrist movement) rather than satellite data. On that note, the Polar Loop does sync with Polar's fitness watches, which are arguably among the most accurate around for tracking heart rate, pace, and distance, though their tradeoff is that they aren't as sleek or compact as smartwatches like the Apple Watch Series 11 or Pixel Watch 4.

So whatever way you like to track your health, the Polar Loop could be ideal to add to the mix.

My parents always used to say, “You get what you pay for,” and at the ripe old age of 33, I've often found that to be true. If you buy a knockoff, that's usually what you're going to get: an imitation of something that's cheaper, but probably not quite as good as the real deal. Usually, that's what you're going to get. But not always.

Sometimes, if Soundpeats' new Clip1 wireless earbuds are any indication, what you actually get (for a lot less money) is your favorite new pair of open-style wireless earbuds for the price.

Soundpeats Clip1

The Clip1 are a great-sounding pair of open-style wireless earbuds with an enticing price.

Pros

Cons

I've used a few pairs of open wireless earbuds in my day, and there was always one pair that stood as my favorite: Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds. I personally love Bose's clip-on design, which is comfortable and (at least in my opinion) looks pretty good—more like a piece of jewelry than a pair of wireless earbuds. Also, Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds shouldn't work, but they do. The wireless earbuds actually tuck the speaker behind your ear, while a solid plastic lip rests inside and holds the whole thing in place. Despite that strange, very indirect method of delivering audio, they sound great. There's just one problem, and that's that they're kind of wildly expensive.

Coming up on nearly two years since their release date, the Ultra Open Earbuds are still $300. That's a steep price to pay for wireless earbuds that you're probably not going to want to use all the time, every single day. But $70? Now we're talking.

Unlike Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, Soundpeats' Clip1 start at less than half the price. While you might be raising your eyebrows, wondering what kind of sacrifices you're making in the sound department, I'm here to tell you that the Clip1 might be a lot less of a compromise than you'd expect. Immediately upon sliding the Clip1 onto my ears and loading up Spotify, I noticed that Soundpeats paid special attention to fidelity.

I started off with some jazz, Wes Montgomery's “While We're Young,” and noticed ample low end and very little distortion even with the volume turned up past 75% on my phone. Guitar tones sounded natural and nuanced, like I was in the room. I could hear subtle string buzzes and even the soft fuzz of the recording process from 1961, an artifact of how the tune was recorded back then. More than a solid start.

Other genres translated equally as well. I listened to some rock songs with a lot more going on instrument-wise and in the production department, and the Clip1 crushed it. In “Castleman” by Floatie, I was able to hear all of the guitar tracks clearly and separately, with very little distortion. Vocals stood apart from the mix but weren't too pronounced, and the low end was present but not overwhelming. Similarly, with electronic music, the Clip1 continued to impress. I listened to Todd Terje's “Delorean Dynamite,” and the driving arpeggiated synths sounded perfectly gritty, with shakers and other reverberated percussion came across as atmospheric but well-accounted for.

If this all sounds like I'm gushing, well, I kind of am. The Clip1 exceeded my expectations in the sound department, and it's clear that Soundpeats made the effort on a hardware level to deliver. Inside the Clip1, there are 12mm drivers, which are backed up by dual magnets. The use of two magnets, according to Soundpeats, is meant to decrease distortion and deliver a more precise, uniform sound, since the two magnets equate to less variability in the way the wireless earbuds' diaphragm moves. The results are clear—literally. These are some of the best-sounding open wireless earbuds I've used to date, and I've used quite a few now from Sony, Nothing, and Bose.

On top of sounding great, I also find them to be equally as listenable in louder volume scenarios as Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, if not a little more so. Because of the design of open wireless earbuds, no pair will ever be ideal in high-volume situations where you'd want a more traditional pair of wireless earbuds with tips and active noise cancelation (ANC). There's a middle ground to be struck where you can still hear your audio well while also being able to hear your surroundings, though. In my humble opinion, Soundpeats strikes that balance well.

On the crucial subway test, I was able to hear my post-work Buffalo Bills sports talk podcast while still keeping one foot in the environmental sound. That's more than I could say for other entrants in the open-ear audio game, which have a bad habit of being drowned out in loud environments.

Outside of being able to hear your surroundings more, another reason why people buy open-style wireless earbuds is that they're just a lot more comfortable than using something that gets put inside your ear, even if it's only a little bit.

While both the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds and Soundpeats' Clip1 have a similar design (a clip that you wrap around your ear), there are subtle differences between the two you should know. As I mentioned, Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds have a plastic knob that goes inside your ear, while the speaker, a round little drum, actually gets tucked behind your ear. The indirect approach to delivering audio somehow produces solid, well-balanced sound.

Similarly, the Clip1 also tucks around your ear like a clip, but instead of tucking the speaker behind your ear like Bose, the speaker rests in your outer ear in the Clip1, while the battery and magnets actually located behind. I've already covered how that design seems to deliver sound, and as satisfied as I am with that end, I'm equally as satisfied with the comfort. The Clip1, like Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds are great to wear over long periods and feel sturdy and comfortable while wrapped around my ears. If you're the type of person who hates the feeling of shoving silicone tips into your ears like you would with wireless earbuds that have ANC, the Clip1 will feel like a massive relief. The Clip1 might even have a slight edge over Bose, since Soundpeats manages to get the weight of each of its earbuds down to 5g as opposed to Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, which weigh 6.3g per earbud.

Like Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, the Clip1 also allows for a good amount of ambient noise bleed, which, in this case, is exactly what's supposed to happen. While wearing the Clip1, I was still able to hear colleagues and respond to people in my office, while they were unable to hear what I was listening to; in this case, that happened to be a podcast at about 75% volume. While I didn't test the Clip1 on a bike, I would be more than comfortable wearing these open wireless earbuds in a situation where I needed to hear my surroundings. I

f you're in need of hands-free controls, the Clip1 also have touch inputs which allow you to double and triple-tap the piece that rests behind your ear on either earbuds to play and pause, and skip tracks respectively. It's a little awkward at first, tapping behind your ear like that, but once you get the hang of it, they work just fine.

As long as we're talking about design, it's worth mentioning one area that I actually don't think the Clip1 takes the crown over Bose in, and that's looks. There's nothing particularly offensive about the Clip1 design, but it's not my cup of tea if Bose is the comparison. The Clip1 is a little bit lower profile compared to the Ultra Open Earbuds, which is nice, but I actually appreciate the almost cyberpunk look, even if they're more noticeable when they're clipped onto your ears. Similarly, the charging case of the Clip1 is fine but very cheap-feeling, thanks to the shiny, smooth plastic as opposed to Bose's almost matte plastic.

That's a minor gripe, all things considered, and even more forgivable when you keep in mind that the Clip1 is $70 compared to Bose's current $300 price tag on the Ultra Open Earbuds.

Open wireless earbuds may not have the benefit of canceling noise like other wireless earbuds, but that lack of ANC is actually a blessing in some ways, mostly when it comes to battery life. According to Soundpeats, the Clip1 should get 8 hours on a single charge when being played at 60% volume. That battery life tracks in my testing; after more than two hours of listening, I was at about 80%, though I wasn't listening to audio the entire time (I took some short breaks intermittently).

I wouldn't call 8 hours impressive by wireless earbuds standards, but it does notably beat the Bose Ultra Open, which get about 7.5 hours on a single charge. For context, some wireless earbuds that I've tested this year, like the Technics EAH-AZ100, get 10 hours on a single charge with ANC activated. Again, though, those wireless earbuds are also $300 compared to the Clip1's $70 price tag, so maybe that comparison is a little unfair. For me, I have no major complaints in the battery life department when it comes to the Clip1; I think they'll last long enough to satisfy most people.

As for features, there are quite a few things to take advantage of in the Soundpeats app, including the ability to toggle on Dolby audio for “movie mode” and “music mode,” which are meant to provide “immersive 3D sound.” I tested both, and while I could do without movie mode (sorry, I know it's supposed to give in-movie audio a sense of space, but I think it just makes everything sound worse), music mode actually sounds pretty good. I don't need music mode toggled on to enjoy how the Clip1 sound, but I do think using it provides a heightened sense of space and atmosphere in most songs.

There are also additional EQ options in the Soundpeats app, including preset EQ for genres like rock and electronic, and even one for enhancing treble, and also a granular 10-band EQ if you're that kind of person. There is an option to custom-tune the EQ with a hearing test so that the wireless earbuds conform to your specific hearing, but when I tried to take the test, I noticed that lots of the tones being played for me were hard to hear. Picking them up is a lot harder when you're wearing a pair of open earbuds, where ambient noise is a factor. For that reason, I'm going to go ahead and assume that while you can take the hearing test for personalized EQ on the Clip1, you should make sure you're in a very silent location when you do so.

As an added bonus, the SoundPeats app also has free, playable white noise for when you just want to zone out (think rain sounds and airplane noises) as well as something called “EQ space” where people can share their custom EQs for things that they like to listen to. Let's be honest, most people are never going to take advantage of that sort of thing, but having the option is always nice.

As I mentioned previously, there are a lot of open-style wireless earbuds on the market nowadays, so making a decision can be tough. Ultimately, though, the equation is simple. Most people, when it comes to open audio, just want something that sounds good, is audible in a range of settings, and is comfortable and practical in terms of battery life and features.

For the Clip1, all of those boxes are checked, and while the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds still have the edge in terms of design, that only matters if you really care about that sort of thing. For most, the $70 price tag and great fit and sound should be enough to give Soundpeats a shot at being their go-to open-ear wireless buds.

Paying $4,000 for a laptop puts premium computing out of reach for most people. Normally, Dell's Inspiron 16 5640 laptop (Intel Core 7 150U, 32GB DDR5 RAM, 1TB SSD) carries that eye-watering $3,999 price tag, but Amazon has slashed it down to $999 in what amounts to a 75 percent discount. That all-time low pricing turns a business-class laptop with professional specifications into something actually accessible for everyday users.

See at Amazon

The Intel Core i7-150U processor has 10 cores, 12 threads and a turbo speed of up to 5.4GHz, thus providing computing horsepower that handles demanding workflows with ease. In this processor architecture, workload splits between performance and efficiency cores enable the system to power through heavy applications, such as video editing or data analysis, while continuing to deliver responsive performance for background tasks.

It features 32GB of DDR5-5200MHz RAM, and offers ample headroom for memory-intensive professional applications. This is ample to run several large files with a photo editing application like Adobe Photoshop, video editing timelines featuring dozens of clips, and development environments running multiple containers.DDR5 technology provides faster data transfer rates than the older DDR4 RAM which in turn translates to quicker application launches and snappier multitasking if users rapidly switch between memory-intensive programs.

Storage comes via a 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD that offers both capacity and speed for an operating system, applications, and files. NVMe drives operate at a much faster pace compared to traditional SATA SSDs, normally offering read speeds over 3,000MB/s compared to around 550MB/s for SATA drives. The consequence of such a stark difference in speed is that Windows will start up in seconds instead of minutes, files will copy rapidly, and applications launch almost instantaneously.

The 16-inch FHD+ touchscreen comes with a resolution of 1920×1200, 300 nits brightness, and IPS technology for wide viewing angles. Meanwhile, the 16:10 aspect ratio is a little taller than standard 16:9 screens, providing extra vertical space handy when working with documents, spreadsheets, or web pages that show more content without the need to scroll.

The connectivity options are catered for using USB-C ports to connect modern peripherals and facilitate faster data transfer, HDMI output to connect external displays or projectors, Wi-Fi 6E for the latest in wireless networking speeds, and Bluetooth 5.3 for wire-free accessories. Wi-Fi 6E extends into the 6GHz band, offering less congestion in wireless connections with an environment full of competing networks.

For $999, it's a laptop with specifications that easily command $2,000 or more in today's market.

Believe it or not, physicists want to keep it simple. That's why many scientists, including Albert Einstein, believe physics could eventually converge into a single, overarching paradigm that describes the universe—a theory of everything.

Enter string theory. Very broadly speaking, string theory is a mathematical framework that replaces point-like particles with one-dimensional “strings” as the fundamental building blocks of matter. It was initially proposed as an explanation for a different phenomenon but quickly caught the attention of physicists working to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity—two extremely successful, equally valid theories that notoriously don't get along.

Then followed two “superstring revolutions,” which saw impressive strides in mapping out the details of how string theory could capture the complexity of our universe. The fervor of string theory naturally leaked over to popular conversations—science enthusiasts of the 1990s and 2000s, I'm looking at you—producing famous documentaries such as PBS's The Elegant Universe and a trove of popular and academic books.

With the turn of the century, however, the limelight over string theory appeared to fade. Granted, public opinion is fickle and blasé, and that non-academics don't care doesn't mean that the idea is dead. Still, if Google's Ngram viewer is any guide, string theory's clout has staggered over the past decade or so.

That's the question we posed to physicists for this Giz Asks. Whatever happened to string theory? Clearly, physicists haven't given up on a theory of everything. But is string theory the leading candidate—if it ever was? Or are there now better alternatives? Has it truly diminished in popularity and significance? If so, why?

The following responses may have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Particle physicist, University of California, Irvine, and the ATLAS Collaboration at CERN.

String theory is not dead! The major objection is that its predictions are for things at a microscopic scale that we cannot yet test, so it has not provided a falsifiable prediction. But that doesn't mean it never will. Group theory was a mathematical curiosity for a century before we discovered that it was essential for describing particle physics and quantum field theory. I'm not a fan of categorizing things as “science” or “not science,” because who knows what nerdy curiosity will lead to a discovery?

Theoretical physicist, California Institute of Technology; discovered the Green-Schwarz mechanism, which ignited the first superstring revolution in 1984.

The subject took off [around 1984] and has been very active ever since. The annual string theory conferences are still going strong and typically have several hundred participants. […] A large portion of the theoretical particle physics community is now convinced that we are on the right track to discovering the correct unified theory of our universe (and many naysayers have repented).

That said, we also realize that there is much more that remains to be understood, and it may take a long time to obtain experimental evidence in support of this theory.

Mathematician and physicist, Columbia University; author of Not Even Wrong and the eponymous blog.

The idea of string theory as a new fundamental unified theory has been dead for a long time. To simplify a bit, it needs ten space-time dimensions, but we only see four, so you have to get rid of six. Simple scenarios that do this don't look like the real world; complicated ones can give you almost anything, so predict nothing.

The final nail in the coffin was the negative results at the LHC about supersymmetry, which is a crucial part of most scenarios and the only thing with any hope of being seen experimentally. The term “string theory” has come to be used to refer to a huge range of different ideas that grew out of trying to make a unified theory work. Most “string theorists” now work not on the failed unified theory but on very different subjects.

These have generated some important new ideas in mathematics but no new insight into fundamental physics in our world. In particular, while people study lots of “quantum gravities,” these are theories that don't explain quantum gravity in our four-dimensional world.

Theoretical physicist, Leuven University in Belgium; specializing in supergravity, string theory, holography, and cosmology.

Yes, [string theory has diminished in popularity]. The reason is that 20 years ago science outreachers and grant writers promised the heavens. It never made any sense. We also knew 20 years ago that string theory has a so-called landscape of ground states and so has no unique predictions.

But the so-called alternatives cannot compete at all, and it remains a puzzle of sociological dynamics how they were able to frame themselves as alternatives. Let me be clear, it's great that people study other options. But there is simply no reason to say they achieved a quantum mechanical description of gravity.

People say that without experiment we cannot call one theory better than another. That is plain wrong. There are many consistency checks, which are ridiculously hard to pass. Can you compute black hole entropy? String theorists were able to compute it in very idealized circumstances and reproduced Hawking's famous formula for black hole entropy!

This is where science can progress without experimental input and it is a point that is largely misunderstood by philosophers: in physics we study the whole time unphysical things… But it means you create idealized circumstances so you are able to make computations and test a framework. In quantum gravity the very game of passing mathematical consistency is so strong that it makes the search for theories almost converge uniquely towards strings.

Similarly, string theory can be just a toy model. But even that is great! I can for instance, in this model, look at a space with a Big Bang singularity and ask myself, how does this theory deal with it? It must give an answer since it is a mathematically complete theory. So it has to tell you what the beginning of time looks like in this (toy?) model.

Theoretical physicist, Centre de Physique Théorique de Luminy in France; Rovelli is a founder of loop quantum gravity, a rivaling account to string theory.

Especially in the last 10 or 5 years, to the large physics community, the appeal of string theory has very much decreased. For three reasons. The first is that the theory has indicated that a number of physical predictions could be verified, such as supersymmetric particles observable by the [LHC], a negative cosmological constant, the production of mini black holes in particle physics experiments, modifications of Newton's law at a short scale, and so on. None of these predictions has turned out to be correct.

These repeated failures do not completely kill the theory, which can always be “adjusted” to take care of the negative result. But they have decreased the confidence in the theory for the majority of scientists.

The second reason, probably even more important, is that the theory gained much attention in the 1980s and 1990s because it promised to solve open questions in particle physics. For instance, computing the free parameters of the Standard Model from first principles, understanding why there are three generations of particles, why those particular gauge groups, and so on. The theory never succeeded in this. This failure has also diminished the credibility of the string hypothesis.

The third reason is that after 50 years we do not yet have a well-defined formulation of string theory. We have a patchwork of related results but no clear overall theory defined by a well-posed set of equations.

Theoretical physicist, California Institute of Technology; key contributor to mathematical developments in string theory.

Unifying quantum mechanics with “general” relativity is 25 times more difficult than unifying it with “special” relativity. […] It took physicists 50 years to develop a concrete model based on quantum field theory to describe particle physics phenomena (the Standard Model) and another 40 years to confirm all of its predictions (the Higgs boson discovery).

Therefore, one could argue that it would take 1,250 years to construct a realistic model of the universe from string theory and another 1,000 years to verify it experimentally. Now, I don't think it would really take that long, but this illustrates how difficult the problem is. Therefore, I would expect achieving such a unification to produce 25 times more rewarding results and have 25 times more impact on a broad range of physics and mathematics.

Currently, string theory is the only promising candidate for achieving unification. No other proposals have comparable impacts on a broad range of sciences or mathematical depth. So, in some sense, we theoretical physicists are developing a language to understand nature.

One thing I want to point out is that, of course, our ultimate goal is to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics and then test that experimentally. I hope that there'll be a positive test, but if it is rejected, that's also progress in science, so I would accept it.

Theoretical physicist, Harvard University; Vafa received the 2017 Breakthrough Prize in physics for his work in applying string theory to the study of black holes and the universe.

Puzzles often come in pairs, each serving as the other's solution! This is what seems to be currently happening in physics. Recent cosmological observations by two groups, DESI and DES, in their 2024 and 2025 data have found evidence that the standard model of cosmology, which assumes the dark sector does not deplete over time, does not match the data. Currently our string-motivated model is the best model fitting their data!

In a parallel development there are experiments underway in Austria and the US that aim to directly detect the dark dimension [hypothetical extra dimension in string theory]… These experiments are within years of producing their first data.

So it seems that both the large-scale cosmological observation and the small-scale tabletop experiments are both on their way to confirming string theory predictions. We may be at the cusp of a major scientific discovery. We should have a clearer picture within 5 to 10 years.

The result is, unsurprisingly, a pile of world record benchmark scores.

An incredibly ambitious hardware modder with a penchant for both sublime and ridiculous GPU tinkering has boosted an RTX 5050 to nearly 3.5GHz with a camping freezer. The result is clocks boosted to nearly 3.5GHz, a 23% uplift, and a handful of broken world records. This test was performed as part of what Trashbench calls ""the dumbest competition on YouTube"" in a video about his battle against fellow overclocking YouTuber Clock Bench to see who can push the GeForce RTX 5050 harder.

 




Determined to win, Trashbench shunt-modded his Gigabyte RTX 5050 card to unlock the card's power limits and crank it as hard as possible. He ended up with a sustained clock rate of 3468 MHz, some 23% increased over the stock 2820 MHz. This pushed the little GB207 GPU to the top of the 3DMark benchmark charts, and indeed, it is probably the fastest GB207 on the planet—for what dubious merit that honor awards. #1 is #1, though, no matter the context.

 




Thanks to the Techni-Ice freezer and the 60/40 glycol mix, GPU temperatures apparently hovered between -12℃ and 15℃, depending on the benchmark load. The GPU reported a power draw of just 78W, but of course, due to the shunt mod, that value is completely inaccurate. Shunt mods work by replacing or bypassing the sensing resistors on the GPU's +12V lines, so the card isn't able to detect its own power consumption correctly; this has the effect of unlimiting the power, so you're only capped by voltage and thermal limits.

With a freezer like the one Trashbench used, then, you're really only limited by the voltage the card can supply, which is exactly how he achieved his impressive 23% overclock. To be frank, 23% doesn't sound like all that much to this greybeard's ears, but the days of 100% overclocks are sadly long gone; most modern GPUs struggle to achieve 10% even with a shunt mod.

I've always said that Australians and Texans are kindred spirits. There's no mystery here: we both like our humor dry and a little disturbing, we both tend to minimize even mortal peril, and we both share a love of self-reliance. These qualities manifest in many ways, but one of the most visible is our willingness to rig up just about anything to make a point, like ol' mate Trashbench, who was also the bloke responsible for the world-record Intel Arc B580 overclock about two weeks ago. That card wasn't modified beyond replacing the cooling, though.

Buc-ee's trucker hats off to Trashbench for his achievement; it's readily recognizable redneck ingenuity from the other side of the planet.

With no replacement parts, the victim has no choice but to hope Nvidia sends them a free RTX Pro 6000 replacement

Broken PCIe fingers are becoming a frustrating trend among Nvidia's latest flagship graphics cards based on its RTX 5090 Founders Edition design. Computer technician NorthridgeFix on YouTube published a video detailing the story of one of his customers who suffered such bad luck on not just any high-end RTX Blackwell GPU, but Nvidia's crazy-expensive $10,000 RTX Pro 6000 workstation graphics card. According to the video, the card snapped under its own weight during transit after the unfortunate owner (a tech YouTuber with 40 million subscribers, apparently) didn't uninstall it before moving it.

The technician showed off the PCIe connector itself on the now $10,000 paperweight, revealing that it snapped cleanly into two pieces near the middle. Due to the component's complexity, it is impossible to repair the PCIe connector, so a replacement part is required.

If only that were actually feasible — NorthridgeFix revealed that Nvidia astonishingly does not provide any replacement parts for its OEM graphics cards, despite them boasting a design that allows easy repairability of the PCIe connector alone.

NorthridgeFix revealed this is a big problem with Nvidia's latest Founders Edition designs and spoke about a previous encounter he had with a customer who accidentally broke their RTX 5090 Founders Edition while installing a waterblock. After inspecting the damaged RTX 5090, the technician reported that if Nvidia had provided replacement parts, the card could have been saved.

We covered this story and how the user got a free RTX 5090 Founders Edition replacement from Nvidia. Apparently, Nvidia watched NorthridgeFix's rant on YouTube about the lack of replacement parts for their GPUs, and that was enough to get Nvidia to replace the broken card for free, even though it was technically the customer's fault for breaking it with a waterblock in the first place.

Hopefully, the same thing will happen with the customer of the now-dead RTX Pro 6000 workstation card. Nvidia's latest flagship Founders Edition graphics card design has the unique trait of having modularity in its design, something that is very uncommon in the graphics card world. The RTX 5090 Founders Edition and RTX Pro 6000 graphics cards are made up of three primary PCBs, including a PCB that houses all of the important bits like the GPU core, VRAM, and power delivery system, and a secondary PCB that is only responsible for providing PCIe connectivity to the graphics card.

This design, by nature, makes them uniquely well designed for repairability, at least in theory. If the PCIe connector on a traditional graphics card fails, either the whole PCB has to be replaced or the connector has to be repaired. Both require specialized tools and a qualified technician to do the job. With Nvidia's latest Blackwell OEM graphics cards, their design should allow you to simply swap out the PCIe connector component with a replacement part as if you were replacing DRAM on a motherboard. However, as this unfortunate user found out, Nvidia doesn't dish out the parts, rendering the modular and repairable design somewhat obsolete.

Maybe one day Nvidia will provide replacement PCBs for its flagship graphics cards, but for now, if you own one of these cards, NorthridgeFix warns users that these graphics cards are not easily repairable. If the card breaks, there's a good chance you'll have to beg Nvidia customer support for an entirely new GPU replacement.

The U.S. Department of Justice just announced that it has convicted five individuals, including four U.S. citizens and one Ukrainian national, for facilitating the illegal employment of North Korean IT workers at American companies. According to its press release, these people used their own identity or provided false or stolen identities to North Korean workers seeking employment with U.S.-based firms. They also hosted the company-provided laptops in locations across the United States. They used remote desktop software to give the illusion that the work was being done within its borders. All in all, the various schemes run by the subjects earned North Korea, formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or DPRK, at least $3 million in revenue.

“These actions demonstrate the Department's comprehensive approach to disrupting North Korean efforts to finance their weapons program on the back of Americans,” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg said in a statement. “The Department will use every available tool to protect our nation from this regime's depredations.”

The North Korean regime has been using the direct labor of its people to make money for the state. But because Pyongyang faces heavy sanctions from various nations, including the U.S., its workers need false identities to gain employment, especially in the U.S. Despite many seeing the DPRK as a state where most citizens lack access to the latest technology, it actually has an elite group of hackers. In fact, the FBI identified it as the source of the biggest crypto hack in history, and it's already using artificial intelligence to help its agents get remote freelance jobs. Despite doing the remote work, the North Korean workers do not get the bulk of their wages; instead, the state uses the proceeds to help fund its various weapons programs.

“FBI investigations continue to expose the North Korean government's relentless campaign to evade U.S. sanctions and generate millions of dollars to fund its authoritarian regime and weapons programs,” FBI Counterintelligence Division Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky said. “These guilty pleas send a clear message: No matter who or where you are, if you support North Korea's efforts to victimize U.S. businesses and citizens, the FBI will find you and bring you to justice. We ask all our private sector partners to improve their security process for vetting remote workers and to remain vigilant regarding this emerging threat.”

Both companies and workers have benefited from remote work. Still, it also comes with challenges like these. While institutions rely on cursory document checks and monitoring the IP addresses of their laptops to determine their actual location, these can easily be circumvented by facilitators who are paid for their services. The people involved reportedly received somewhere in between $3,000 and $90,000 for lending their identities, hosting the issued devices, and even running a laptop farm for the North Koreans. One of the convicted felons even forfeited $1.4 million as part of their plea deal, which shows how lucrative this illegal activity can be.

Gaming can be a pleasure on many kinds of computer monitors, but when you have one perfectly suited to what you're playing, the experience jumps to another level. The feeling of immersion is especially important in racing or flying simulations. The sense of being in the car, plane, or spaceship heightens when you can wrap the screen around your viewpoint.

Simulators are dominated by the best gaming monitors with ultra-wide and mega-wide screens in either 21:9 or 32:9 aspect ratios. The mantra is, “the wider the better,” but height is essential too. Enter the 45-inch 21:9 category, where you get tremendous screen area and, if the curve is extreme enough, the true feeling of being in a cockpit.

LG's Ultra Gear 45GX950A is ideally suited for driving and flying sims. It delivers a high pixel density of 125ppi with a 5120x2160 (5K2K) array on an OLED panel with an 800R curve. It also sports a 165 Hz refresh rate with a dual-mode switch to 330 Hz at 2560x1080, plus Adaptive-Sync, DisplayHDR 400, and wide-gamut color. Let's take a look.

If you're building a driving or flying simulator, a monitor like the 45GX950A is a natural choice. You could expand your view with multiple screens, but then there are those annoying dividing lines that you can't unsee. A 32:9 screen brings the width, but current 49-inch models aren't very tall. They impart a view that's like looking out of a racing helmet, which is fine for driving but not so much for flying.

45 inches at 21:9 means 18 inches vertical, more than a 32-inch 16:9 monitor. To bring the sides into the user's peripheral vision, the 45GX950A has a very tight 800R curve radius. That means a circle of them would only be 1.6 meters across. It's so tight that you can hear your voice bounce off the sides of the screen — it's a unique experience.

Onto the important stuff: The 45GX950A is a very high-resolution panel with a resolution of 5120x2160 pixels. That equates to 125 pixels per inch, denser than a 27-inch QHD monitor but not quite as dense as a 32-inch Ultra HD screen. It's more total pixels — over 11 million — so fast frame rates will require a stout video card.

However, you won't need to worry about motion blur, thanks to the 45GX950A's OLED panel. It doesn't have a Quantum Dot layer, but the color gamut covers almost 98% of DCI-P3, so the vivid saturation is there. You also get high brightness with 1,300 claimed nits in HDR mode for a 1.5% window. I measured 673 nits from a 25% window so that tracks. There are two levels of variable brightness as well, so SDR peaks can top 450 nits.

The native refresh rate is 165 Hz, and you get a 330 Hz mode at 2560x1920 resolution. It's easily accessed with a switch in the OSD. The 45GX950A is certified G-Sync Compatible and for FreeSync Premium Pro as well. There's plenty of bandwidth available through the DisplayPort 2.1 input, and you get two HDMI 2.1 ports, along with a USB-C port that supports DisplayPort and delivers 90 watts of power. Two USB downstream ports handle peripherals, and you get a nice pair of internal speakers. The headphone jack is a four-pole design that supports surround sound and DTS Headphone:X.

There is little that the 45GX950A doesn't have, and all that goodness will cost you $1,600 at this writing. For that sum, you're getting something relatively unique that brings a new level of immersion and realism to your favorite flying and driving simulators.

The 45GX950A arrives in a huge box with plenty of crumbly foam inside. It's needed to support that extremely curved panel, and my sample showed up unscathed. The stand and base are substantial and assemble without tools. Cables include DisplayPort, HDMI, and USB-C. You also get an enormous external power brick that thankfully has a cord long enough that you can put it on the floor.

The 45GX950A is impressive from any angle, not only in size but in shape. An 800R curve is tighter than anything you've seen before, unless you read my review of the AOC AG456UCZD, which is the same size but has lower resolution. When you sit two or three feet from the screen's center, the sides aren't that far from your ears. It's about as immersive as you can get short of VR goggles.

The stand has a relatively small footprint thanks to its heavy cast metal base. The upright is wide and features a 4.7-inch height range, plus 10/15 degrees tilt and 10 degrees swivel. I appreciated that it set the screen high enough to keep it perfectly vertical with my eyepoint centered. This is especially important for a monitor as curved as the 45GX950A. Any tilt ruins the immersive effect. The height adjustment is firm, nicely dampened, and wobble-free.

The back is perfectly smooth and features a ring of LEDs controllable from the OSD and an LG logo. The cable hole in the upright is trimmed in purple. Underneath the center is a single joystick that controls all monitor functions. The headphone jack is also under the front edge, making it easy to access. The remaining ports are up and under and include two HDMI 2.1 ports, a DisplayPort 2.1 port, and a USB-C port with DisplayPort function and 90 watts of power. You also get two USB downstream ports. A snap-on cover helps to hide the cabling.

The 45GX950A's OSD appears when you press the joystick. It's game-focused with a slick look that includes color and fade effects, with important info always displayed at the top.

Game Adjust is the first menu up, and it starts with the 45GX950A's picture modes. There are 13 in total, including sRGB, HDR emulation, and two calibration memories that work with LG's Calibration Studio app. Personalized Picture is another memory that connects with the LG Switch app.

Dual-Mode is the refresh rate/resolution toggle, offering 5120x2160 at 165 Hz and 2560x1080 at 330 Hz. You can also change the aspect to 16:9 or 21:9/39” to accommodate games that distort the image at full-screen settings. The switch was seamless every time; I didn't need to set it up in the Nvidia Control Panel beforehand. LG and I recommend that you make the switch before starting up a game. Additional gaming aids include aiming points and a frame rate counter.

In the Picture Adjust menu, you'll find the Peak Brightness setting, which is LG's term for variable brightness. It has two levels, both of which render the image without clipping. On High, you'll get 457 nits for SDR and 673 nits for HDR from a 25% window pattern. That's very bright indeed. This menu also has four gamma presets and five color temps. Manual changes the temp by Kelvin value, and Custom uses the RGB sliders to help tweak grayscale tracking. You also get hue and saturation sliders for all six colors. If you get lost during calibration, you can reset just this menu.

Sound comes from two internal speakers that play with 10 watts of power. Or you can use the headphone output, which supports DTS Headphone:X. This requires compatible headphones with a four-pole connector, but once plugged in, the surround-sound experience is incredible. If you typically play with headphones, I recommend going for DTS Headphone:X models. It takes audio to another level.

The 45GX950A supports PIP and PBP, so you can view two video signals at once. The side-by-side view is especially useful if you have a PC and console hooked up. In the General menu are OLED care options that include pixel orbiting, a screen saver and image cleaning, which runs automatically at regular intervals. And the two of the joystick directions are programmable for different quick access functions.

The 45GX950A can be enjoyed without calibration in its default Gamer 1 mode. When I tweaked the RGB sliders, I was able to improve grayscale tracking slightly, but gamma was negatively affected. I wound up leaving the settings at their defaults for the best picture. Color is spot-on in either case. I noted that the sRGB mode allowed calibration, which is something I rarely see. I've provided my brightness settings below. They are valid when Peak Brightness is turned off. If you use the high or low setting, you might need to lower them a tad to compensate.

In HDR mode, you get six of the 13 picture modes, Gamer 1 is still the best. You can also adjust brightness, and the Peak Brightness setting is available too, which is a nice touch. Most monitors have no brightness options in HDR mode.

I rarely have a new gameplay experience, given the over 450 monitors I've reviewed in the past 10 years. But the 45GX950A provided just that. You've undoubtedly heard the cliché, “it brings the action closer.” Well, it does, truly. I had to readjust my perceptions when playing familiar maps in Doom Eternal and Call of Duty WWII. Getting close to enemies makes them uncomfortably close until you adapt.

Movement and control are blindingly quick. I had no trouble with lag or hesitation of any kind. 165 Hz means there's a tiny bit of motion blur, but it never distracted during gameplay. I played for a bit at 330 Hz and found it was smoother, but the loss of resolution was significant. While I gained clarity by removing all traces of blur, it was lost in the lowered pixel density. I noted that it was no problem to maintain 165 fps using a GeForce RTX 4090. This same setup typically runs around 220 fps with the best 4K gaming monitors.

The HDR image was simply stunning. The 45GX950A is a bit brighter than other ultra-wide OLED monitors I've reviewed. That made up for its lack of Quantum Dot color. It was rich and vibrant with highlights that popped and deep shadow detail. It also had a textural quality that made me want to reach out and touch objects on the screen.

For daily use, the extreme curve took some getting used to. The 45GX950A is different from anything else except the AOC AG456UCZD which I reviewed last year. And the LG has a higher resolution than that screen, making it well-suited for graphics and photo work. There is some image distortion from the extreme curve, but it should be easy for users to adjust. It's important to keep the screen vertical so your eyepoint is equal to all parts of the screen. The 45GX950A's stand is high enough for this purpose.

My physical interactions with the 45GX950A were all positive. The menu is well laid out and easy to navigate using the joystick. I didn't have to calibrate, so there's little to no setup involved. The only choice to make is whether to use Peak Brightness or not. This is LG's version of variable brightness, and it has low and high settings. I left it off for work tasks, set it on low for video, and high for HDR content. That extra flexibility was a nice touch that not all HDR monitors have.

Takeaway: Despite its extreme shape and size, the 45GX950A is a superb gaming monitor in all respects. It might be a little too in-your-face for shooters, but I can't imagine a better screen for racing or flying sims. The dual refresh feature isn't terribly useful because it lowers pixel density too much. But it was more than smooth and responsive enough at 165 Hz to be addictive. This is truly a monitor to crave. It takes gaming to a new level of immersion and realism.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is marking its first official observance of World Prematurity Day with the launch of a new global clinical practice guide for Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) – a simple, proven and life-saving intervention that significantly improves survival for preterm and low birth-weight babies.

Each year, an estimated 15 million babies are born too soon (before 37 weeks of pregnancy), and complications from preterm birth are the leading cause of death among children under five years of age. In the poorest countries, most extremely preterm babies die within days – whereas in high-income countries, almost all survive.

KMC – which combines prolonged skin to skin contact with breast-milk feeding – has been shown to dramatically improve outcomes for small and preterm newborns, and to be feasible and cost-effective in all settings. Among other positive impacts, it is associated with a more than 30% reduction in newborn deaths, a close to 70% reduction in hypothermia and a 15% reduction in severe infections – as well as improved weight gain and better longer-term health and cognitive development.

KMC is not just a clinical intervention – it empowers mothers and families and transforms newborn care. It should now be universal clinical practice for all small and preterm babies, ensuring they have the best chance to survive and thrive.""

Dr. Jeremy Farrar, WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Care

Geared at health workers, facility managers as well as caregivers, the new WHO guide offers detailed, step-by-step, adaptable guidance for initiating, maintaining, and monitoring KMC. It states that all preterm or low birth weight newborns should receive KMC starting immediately after birth - unless they are unable to breathe on their own or their blood pressure and circulation drops to dangerously low levels, requiring urgent treatment.

While mothers should typically be the primary providers, fathers and other family members can also give KMC if the mother is unable – as well as providing critical emotional and practical support. KMC can be practiced at all levels of health facilities – from the labour room or the operating theatre to postnatal wards and special or intensive newborn care units – and can be continued at home.

The guide includes practical tips on how to secure the baby in the KMC position, whether using simple cloth wraps, elastic binders or specially designed garments. It also outlines how health facilities create enabling environments for KMC through supportive policies and training staff. Family-friendly approaches are crucial for successful implementation, the guide notes – including ensuring mothers can always be together in the same room as their babies.

On this World Prematurity Day, with the theme 'A strong start for a hopeful future', WHO is calling on governments, health systems and partners to prioritize quality care for preterm and low birth weight babies. This means ensuring dedicated wards or facilities with specially trained neonatal staff providing round-the-clock care for small and sick newborns, as well as universal access to essential equipment and medicines like antibiotics.

Because they have less time in the womb, many preterm babies have underdeveloped lungs, brains, immune systems and capacity for temperature regulation. This increases risks from infections, hypothermia, heart problems, respiratory distress, and other life-threatening complications.

""No newborn should die from preventable causes,"" said Dr Per Ashorn, WHO's Unit Head for Newborn and Child Health and Development. ""It's time to ensure every baby gets the attention they need, by investing in special care for small or sick babies, alongside quality maternity services that can prevent many occurrences of preterm birth.""

Chao-Yi Wu, PhD, OT, from the Department of Neurology and Edmarie Guzmán-Vélez, PhD, of the Department of Psychiatry at Mass General Brigham, are the lead and senior authors of a paper published in eClinicalMedicine, ""Effects of Nicotinamide Riboside on NAD+ Levels, Cognition, and Symptom Recovery in Long-COVID: A Randomized Controlled Trial.""

Q: How would you summarize your study for a lay audience?Millions of people worldwide continue to experience lingering symptoms after COVID-19, a condition known as long COVID. These symptoms can affect people of all ages and often include neurological issues such as ""brain fog,"" which makes thinking and memory difficult. Because these problems can significantly disrupt daily life, researchers are working to find effective treatments.

Our clinical trial tested whether raising levels of NAD⁺ - a molecule that helps cells produce energy -through nicotinamide riboside (NR), a form of vitamin B3, could improve health outcomes. Participants took NR supplements for up to 20 weeks, and we tracked changes over time.

Q: What question were you investigating? 

The NAD⁺ molecule is present in all human cells and is essential for energy production, immune function and inflammation control. Previous research suggests COVID-19 may interfere with NAD⁺-related biological processes, possibly contributing to neurological symptoms.In our study, we wanted to know if boosting NAD⁺ through NR supplementation could improve cognitive function and ease common long COVID symptoms.

Q: What methods or approach did you use?

We ran a 24-week clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital between August 2021 and September 2023. We enrolled 58 people with long COVID and randomly split them into two groups:

To ensure unbiased results, neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was getting the real supplement at first.

We measured NAD⁺ levels through blood tests and asked participants to complete surveys and cognitive tests about memory, sleep, fatigue and mood at the beginning, at 10 weeks and at 20 weeks.

Q: What did you find?

Of the 58 people who joined the study, 37 started NR right away, and 21 began with the placebo. Only 18 people completed the full 22-week protocol. The others left the study for reasons such as getting COVID again, moving, changing medications or experiencing possible side effects.

When we compared the two groups, we didn't see major differences in thinking or memory scores, which were the main focuses of the study. Other symptoms like fatigue, sleep and mood also didn't show big differences between groups.

However, in exploratory post hoc analyses with a slightly larger sample size of everyone who took NR for at least 10 weeks, we observed improvements in self-reported fatigue, sleep, and depressive symptoms after 10 weeks of NR supplementation compared to baseline. Some also performed better on a task of executive functioning, a set of mental skills that help us, for example, plan, organize, and switch between tasks. This suggests that some people may benefit from the use of NR, even if the overall results didn't show clear differences between groups.

Q: What are the implications?

Long COVID affects an estimated 400 million people worldwide, yet its causes remain unclear. In this study, high-dose NR safely boosted NAD⁺ levels. While results were mixed, findings suggest that boosting NAD⁺ may play a role in easing symptoms like fatigue and poor sleep for some people. This points to a promising direction for future treatments.The most common side effects were mild, such as easy bruising or rash. None were serious, and only a few participants discontinued due to side effects

Q: What are the next steps?

Future studies should include larger and more diverse groups to confirm these findings and identify who benefits most. For example, do men and women respond differently? Are people with lower baseline NAD⁺ levels or higher inflammation more likely to improve? Because long COVID often involves inflammation, an important question is whether boosting NAD⁺ can help reduce it.

We also plan to analyze physical activity data collected during the trial, as well as examine whether other supplements taken by participants influenced NR's effects.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Improved birth experiences through integrated midwifery care at NYU Langone Health","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251114/Improved-birth-experiences-through-integrated-midwifery-care-at-NYU-Langone-Health.aspx","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 02:02:00 GMT","

Although midwives have long been associated with home births, roughly 90 percent of midwife-attended births in the U.S. now occur in hospitals. At NYU Langone Health, midwives are fully integrated into obstetric care, giving patients the benefits of personalized guidance in an environment equipped for urgent, advanced treatment.

That approach shaped the experience of Juliette Sardou, who planned to deliver her first child at home until a scan during a third trimester prenatal appointment revealed that her baby had an irregular heartbeat. She was referred to NYU Langone for further testing, where an evaluation by Colin K. Phoon, MD, a pediatric cardiologist in the Pediatric Congenital Heart Center at Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at NYU Langone, revealed a twisted (tortuous) ductus arteriosus - a heart condition that would require ongoing monitoring. The ductus arteriosus is a vessel that helps circulate blood before birth.

To help ensure the safety of both Sardou and her baby, Dr. Phoon advised against having the birth at home, but he wanted to make the transition to hospital-based care more comfortable for Sardou and her partner. Dr. Phoon referred Sardou to NYU Langone's maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists and midwifery team to oversee the rest of her perinatal care.

We knew Juliette had a strong vision for her birth experience, so our goal was to support that as much as possible while also providing the specialized monitoring her baby needed. This is a great example of how we coordinate with multiple specialties to balance patient safety with an experience that feels personal and supportive.""

 Colin K. Phoon, MD, pediatric cardiologist, Pediatric Congenital Heart Center at Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at NYU Langone

At 37 weeks, Sardou developed high blood pressure and was admitted to the hospital for delivery. Midwives Kathryn Mulholland, CNM, and Karry K. Li, CNM, helped her maintain her preferred birth plan as much as possible, including avoiding an epidural and choosing her labor and birthing positions.

""I felt like every single midwife really had my back,"" Sardou said. ""They handled any stressful moment with a lot of ease. They put my needs first and were also very communicative with my partner.""

Sardou's son was born healthy and was cleared to go home without additional care or ongoing monitoring from the cardiology team.

""I feel so grateful for the midwives,"" Sardou said. ""They made an overwhelming situation manageable, supportive, and joyful.""

At NYU Langone, certified midwives are integrated members of the labor and delivery team, offering patients personalized care during pregnancy, birth, and beyond. In Manhattan, patients are seen at the Mignone Women's Health Collaborative and can deliver with midwives at Tisch Hospital. Midwives also attend births at NYU Langone Hospital - Brooklyn.

""Our midwives focus on education, empowerment, and respecting the natural process of labor,"" said Eugenia Montesinos, CNM, director of midwifery services. ""We take time to understand each person's values and preferences to create birth plans that prioritize mobility, comfort, and minimal intervention when medically appropriate.""

The midwifery team works closely with obstetrician-gynecologists and maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists, allowing patients to go through labor as naturally as possible while having access to additional medical support if complications arise. The collaborative approach also means that some high-risk patients can still have midwifery-attended care.

""Patient safety is always our top priority,"" said Justin Brandt, MD, director of the maternal-fetal medicine division. ""Because we work hand in hand with our midwifery colleagues from the start, we can anticipate needs, respond quickly when circumstances change, and make decisions together with the patient. That level of mutual trust and shared decision-making helps us deliver care that's both safe and aligned with each patient's goals.""

When Alison Ferrell became pregnant with her first child, she was relatively new to New York City and didn't yet have an established obstetric provider. She initially sought care at another practice, but each visit left her feeling rushed and unheard.

The experience changed when she transferred her care to NYU Langone's midwifery team. From her first appointment, Ferrell noticed a different approach. Visits seemed unhurried, and the midwives encouraged her to explore her priorities and develop a birth plan focused on mobility and low intervention. When answers to her questions weren't immediately available, she received follow-up phone calls.

""I felt like the care I received was better than any medical care I've ever received in my life,"" Ferrell said. ""I didn't feel like a number. I felt like somebody that was being cared for in a very personalized way.""

During labor, unexpected challenges developed, including an infection that required antibiotics. Under Montesinos's care, and with partnership from the generalist obstetrics team, each step was explained clearly, with safety prioritized alongside her goal for mobility and minimal intervention. Ferrell delivered a baby girl, Sydney, and both went home in good health.

Support continued after discharge. Recognizing that postpartum recovery can be overwhelming, Montesinos followed up with a call just to check in.

""That meant a lot to me,"" Ferrell said. ""I felt like I was still being taken care of even though I was out of the hospital setting.""

""Every pregnancy is unique,"" Montesinos said. ""Our role is to listen, to guide, and to make sure each person feels heard - whether their journey is straightforward or involves multiple specialists.""

Climate change is already driving a global health emergency, with over 540 000 people dying from extreme heat each year and 1 in 12 hospitals worldwide at risk of climate-related shutdowns, warns a new special report, released today jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Government of Brazil (COP30 Presidency) and the Brazilian Ministry of Health.

The COP30 Special report on health and climate change: delivering the Belém Health Action Plan, notes that rising temperatures and collapsing health systems are claiming more lives, and calls for immediate and coordinated action to protect health in a rapidly warming world. It follows the launch of the Belém Health Action Plan, a flagship initiative of Brazil's COP 30 Presidency, unveiled on the dedicated Health Day of COP30 – 13 November 2025.

The climate crisis is a health crisis - not in the distant future, but here and now. This special report provides evidence on the impact of climate change on individuals and health systems, and real-world examples of what countries can do - and are doing - to protect health and strengthen health systems.""

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General

With global temperatures now exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the world is already experiencing mounting health impacts. The report finds that 3.3 to 3.6 billion people already live in areas highly vulnerable to climate change, and hospitals are facing 41% higher risk of damage from extreme weather-related impact compared to 1990. This underscores the urgent need to strengthen and adapt health systems to protect communities from climate-related shocks.

Without rapid decarbonization, the number of health facilities at risk could double by mid-century, which stresses the critical importance of implementing adaptation measures to safeguard health infrastructure. The health sector itself contributes around 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and needs rapid transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient systems.

The report identifies persistent gaps that require urgent attention. Only 54% of national health adaptation plans assess risks to health facilities, and fewer than 30% of health adaptation studies consider income, 20% consider gender, and less than 1% include people with disabilities.

""The evidence is clear: protecting health systems is one of the smartest investments any country can make,"" said Professor Nick Watts, Chair of the Expert Advisory Group and Director, NUS Centre for Sustainable Medicine. ""Allocating just 7% of adaptation finance to health would safeguard billions of people and keep essential services operating during climate shocks – when our patients most need them.""

There is progress being made; between 2015 and 2023, the number of countries with national Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems (MHEWS) doubled to 101, now covering about two-thirds of the global population. However, only 46% of Least Developed Countries and 39% of Small Island Developing States have effective systems in place.

The report's central message is clear: there is now more than enough evidence to scale up action, today. Cost-effective, high-impact, and no-regret interventions exist for each component of the Belém Health Action Plan. But adaptation strategies could ultimately fail unless they address the root causes of health inequity – both within health systems and across society.

The report calls on governments to:

The Government of Brazil also released a companion report, Social participation, climate and health: a special report to support implementation of the Belém Health Action Plan, which focuses on social participation, governance, and community engagement as a critical dimension of the Belém Health Action Plan. The report highlights that climate change poses profound risks to human health, particularly for vulnerable and historically marginalized populations, and that effective adaptation requires the active involvement of communities in designing, implementing, and monitoring health policies.

""By releasing this report, Brazil and WHO reaffirm the importance of COP30 as the COP of Truth. The report provides clear data and evidence that climate change is already directly affecting health systems around the world,"" says Dr Alexandre Padilha, Minister of Health, Brazil. ""Recent tragedies show that now is the time to implement policies and actions that address the impacts of climate change on health. The Belém Health Action Plan and this report offer countries the tools they need to turn scientific evidence into concrete action.""

Together, the two reports provide complementary pathways for translating the Plan's objectives into practice - one focused on evidence and implementation, the other on inclusive participation and leadership across societies.

The Belém Health Action Plan, a flagship outcome of Brazil's COP 30 Presidency, is structured around two cross cutting principles and concepts: health equity and 'climate justice' and leadership and governance on climate and health with social participation.

The Plan also outlines three lines of action for climate-resilient health systems:

The COP30 special report was prepared under the guidance of an Expert Advisory Group of global public health leaders, chaired by the NUS Centre for Sustainable Medicine and with the leadership of the WHO and the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Drawing on more than 70 case studies from around the world, the report identifies practical interventions already delivering results – from early warning systems and green hospital design to climate-informed health planning and sustainable financing.

LISTEN: Bad credit can keep you from getting a job, a car loan, or an apartment to rent. For many Americans, health care debt is to blame. KFF Health News senior correspondent Noam N. Levey appeared on WAMU's “Health Hub” on Nov. 12 to explain why new federal guidelines on health care debt and credit reports worry some consumer protection advocates.

More than 100 million Americans are estimated to have health care debt. In response, more than a dozen states have instituted laws to keep these unpaid bills off consumer credit reports.

The Trump administration has been chipping away at these protections.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, headed by President Donald Trump's budget director, issued new guidance that challenges state laws, saying only the federal government can decide what can go in a credit report. Consumer advocates say that move could undercut state-level protections and worsen the financial strain on Americans burdened by medical bills.

KFF Health News senior correspondent Noam N. Levey appeared on WAMU's “Health Hub” on Nov. 12 to explain why state laws like these could be especially important in the wake of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, set to kick millions off Medicaid, and the potential lapsing of enhanced tax credits for people buying health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

Women's Soccer

Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman will be a free agent this offseason. Scott Taetsch / Getty Images

Trinity Rodman's representation is in negotiation with the National Women's Soccer League over her future in the league, as interest from teams abroad continues. While the Washington Spirit would like to retain Rodman, the talks are currently beyond the club's control due to existing roster constraints, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. The 23-year-old will be a free agent this offseason.

Rodman's agent has spoken directly to commissioner Jessica Berman about deals to keep her stateside; however, one of the key points of contention is the player's salary. Under the current salary cap, teams outside of the league can offer far more than the Spirit — or any NWSL team. Rodman's team has had talks with at least three teams in the English Women's Super League, according to sources familiar with the discussions.

The Spirit declined to comment, and the NWSL did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.

The NWSL operates under a salary cap, currently set at $3.3 million at each club. That maximum will rise every season until it hits $5.1 million in 2030, in accordance with the most recent collective bargaining agreement between the NWSL Players Association and the league.

While the minimum player salary for this season is $48,500 and will rise to $82,500 by 2030, there is no maximum salary for an individual player. Still, the Spirit currently has 27 players' salaries to cover (with three players on loan), whereas teams in Europe do not have to abide by such caps.

After her breakout rookie season in 2021, Rodman signed a three-year contract extension with an option for a fourth year, which was exercised this year. In 2022, the deal, worth $1.1 million, made the then 19-year-old the highest-paid player in the league at the time.

Rodman told ESPN's Futbol W at the start of the season that she has “always thought about playing overseas at some point” in her career. The Spirit's owner, Michele Kang, owns multiple teams across the U.S. and Europe, including OL Lyoness and London City Lionesses and considers herself a “globalist” when it comes to player movement, but has made it clear that keeping Rodman has been a top priority.

“We're going to do everything in our power to hopefully keep her here,” Kang told reporters in March. “She's an integral part of our success, our success meaning the Spirit as well as NWSL.”

Multiple U.S. players have made the move to Europe this season, including defender Naomi Girma and former Angel City forward Alyssa Thompson, both of whom went to Chelsea. While it isn't the only draw, the ability for overseas teams to pay higher salaries is a factor in the growing global market.

In March, Kang ruled out a loan for Rodman to one of the other teams in her multi-club investment company, Kynisca Sports International, but said that players should experience different types of soccer throughout their career.

“The European players should actually go at some point to experience the American football or different football. The same thing with the American football players as well,” Kang said. “Experiencing different styles, different leagues, it's actually a good thing.”

The Spirit selected Rodman with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2021 NWSL Draft, and the teenager had an instant impact. She was named rookie of the year in 2021, recording seven goals and seven assists, including one to Kelley O'Hara against the Chicago Stars to secure the team's first NWSL Championship title.



Before her time in NWSL, Rodman was a standout for the U.S. youth national team, scoring nine goals in the team's successful 2020 Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship. She has been equally as impactful for the senior national team. Rodman has 11 goals and nine assists in 47 games with the U.S. women's national team. She was one-third of the publicly-branded “triple espresso,” alongside Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson, who led the U.S. to gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Rodman has spent much of this season dealing with injuries, first with a persistent back problem that limited her to 15 appearances and nine starts through 26 regular-season games.

Upon her return in October, she sprained her MCL during a Concacaf Champions Cup match, keeping her out of the Spirit's final two games of the season. She was on the bench for Washington's penalty kick shootout win over Racing Louisville in the NWSL quarterfinals last week, but never changed out of her warm-ups, instead helping guide players from the sideline.

Still, she has been impactful for the Spirit, playing a contributing role to Washington securing the No. 2 spot in the NWSL standings. She has been impactful for the NWSL as a whole in terms of marketing, too, and was recently the only U.S. player featured in an Adidas campaign for the 2026 men's World Cup.

Rodman participated in full training on Friday ahead of today's semifinal match at Audi Field between the Spirit and the Portland Thorns.

CHESTER, Pa. – For something that is technically seasonal, there is an omnipresence about the World Cup. It is almost never too early to frame things around the quadrennial tournament for a number of obvious reasons, chief among them the indisputable fact that most players work day in and day out with the World Cup in mind. Four years is a lot of time to accomplish those goals but often it can feel like no time at all, depending on how you look at it.

""It always feels close,"" U.S. men's national team defender Tim Ream said on Friday. ""Even when it felt far away, it felt close.""

There is, though, something undeniable about the looming deadline of their opening game at next summer's tournament, now just under seven months away.

""We have 10 training sessions to go,"" Ream said about the next two international windows, ""so when you talk about length of time, number of days, probably not, but when you talk about number of games, number of training sessions, number of camps, it's knocking on our door.""

Call it What You Want: A weekly podcast where Jimmy Conrad, Charlie Davies and Tony Meola cover all things USMNT and the state of the beautiful game in the United States. Catch the show YouTube live every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. ET.

A new layer of seriousness has naturally seeped into the USMNT's training sessions, the number now sliding into the single digits. Saturday's friendly against Paraguay is the fourth-to-last before head coach Mauricio Pochettino names his World Cup roster, intending to have his group together as soon as they commence their pre-tournament training camp in late May. There is a sense of finality this month, though -- this will be the last time the USMNT convene before March, something Pochettino has emphasized since naming his roster last week. He is intent on getting as many looks at his vast player pool, having called in 71 players in his year-plus in the job, half of his 24 player roster for November's games made up of players who did not take part in October's camp.

""It's to give a big boost and motivation and it's a big opportunity in November because the squad is the squad that we selected,"" Pochettino said about the fresh faces, including forward Ricardo Pepi, who returns to the group after an injury-plagued year. ""It's great to [see him] after one year because last game from him in the national team was in November in St. Louis [a 4-2 win over Jamaica] and today, if we [did] not give him the chance today to come, we need to wait four months more, I think March, to see [him] again.""

The turnover from October's friendlies, a 1-1 draw with Ecuador and a 2-1 win over Australia, is the direct result of several key players being unavailable – midfielder Tyler Adams picked up an injury over the weekend, for example, while Christian Pulisic is only in the early stages of his recovery from a hamstring injury. Cohesion may be an issue as a result on Saturday against Paraguay, though the head coach has chosen a glass half full approach as he continues to embrace a spirit of experimentation.

""I think it's a good test for us even if for us, it's maybe the first time that we play with this starting 11,"" he said. ""I think it's good because I think we need to translate our capacity to adapt quick, the capacity to be quick in the culture, the philosophy and the idea that we want to play. Even if we don't know too much, I think we did everything to try to create the chemistry in between the players, even if they didn't play too much together.""

The specifics of the philosophy are still being worked out, though the foundation seems to be in place. ""Intesnity"" and ""aggressiveness"" are words that frequently come up when describing Pochettino's ethos, a wide-ranging fundamental that carries tangible and intangible demands for players.

""I think there's definitely a style [of play] andI think it comes down to the work ethic,"" midfielder Diego Luna said. ""I think that's the biggest thing for us because the talent is there with whoever we bring in and whatever players we have. At the end of the day, it's about the determination and the grime, both with the ball and without the ball,that this team has to have good performances.""

Some of Pochettino's tactical preferences are finally clear to see, too, particularly in a recent switch to a back three. The formation is quickly becoming a constant but the head coach has always insisted this look is one of several the team could break out and as Ream described it, a back three can mean a variety of different things.

""It's not a full on, stick with it three at the back but it's important for all the guys to get the reps to understand that sometimes we start with a four, build with a three [or] start with a three and build with a three, sometimes we play five and build with a three,"" Ream said. ""It'll be important for all the guys that are here who haven't gotten as many reps to watch the film, make sure we're really focused in the meetings because that's where a lot of the work can really be done and a lot of the understanding can happen and then translate that and then take it out onto the field so we've worked a bit on that, a good bit on that in the last couple of training sessions and I think everybody has a pretty good understanding of it.""

Focus has so far been the theme of the week for the USMNT, no matter each player's relative newness to Pochettino's approach.

""There's a little bit more bite in training, there's intensity, there's more aggressiveness,"" Ream said. ""Guys are doing everything they possibly can to be a part of the team and as we've gotten closer and closer, I think we've seen that more and more and that's a good thing. Guys are desperate to be a part of the group and be a part of the team and be part of a World Cup on home soil.""

Even if the USMNT seem to be in a constant push-and-pull between experimentation and cohesion, they are attempting to make up the difference in their moments off the pitch.

""There's not that many trainings we get to have, not that many times you get to connect with guys leading into games,"" Luna said. ""It's about more, I think, connecting off the field, building that chemistry and that bond to build to kind of have that trust on the field and stuff like that. I think that's the biggest thing.""

The ever-changing USMNT roster, though, has one particular perk for Pochettino – it reinforces the idea that ""no one is safe"" and that they will need to put in the work to earn a spot at the World Cup.

""It's challenging, but at the same time, it's super cool,"" Luna said about the comings and goings from camp to camp. ""You got a bunch of guys coming in that are representing the badge and I think to get their opportunity and stuff shows that we have a bunch of talented players and keeps the competitive nature at the top.""

The long list of fresh faces includes midfielder Gio Reyna, who is back with the USMNT for the first time since March's defeats in the Concacaf Nations League Finals. Pochettino has used club form as the foundation for his roster decisions, which almost automatically ruled Reyna out of the running since last winter. Since moving from Borussia Dortmund to Borussia Monchengladbach, though, Reyna is slowly building some match fitness -- but it is not the only noticeable change to the player's situation.

""He's not really let the challenges overseas seep into camp, which is great to see,"" Ream said. ""I've had a few conversations with him, nothing crazy, but he's speaking up a lot more in the trainings in terms of, 'I'm seeing this, what are you seeing?' He's really getting involved in the understanding of the movements and what we're kind of doing in the buildup and in the defensive shape so I feel like he's more in tune and more focused on the field than I've seen in the past, which is a great thing and I think weather it was injury or other things that were going on, I think his focus is so much greater now and that's a good thing. I think that's something that, as young players -- he's not the only one – you see it a lot. I was guilty of it as well. You kind of lose focus a little bit as trainings go on. Like I said, his focus seems so much more intense and greater this time around after missing out for so many camps.""

Reyna is also joined in camp by midfielder Sebasitan Berhalter, the son of ex-USMNT head coach Gregg, the pair on opposite sides of a family feud that included their parents. Days after the U.S.' elimination at the 2022 World Cup, Gregg spoke at a summit and disclosed that a player was nearly kicked off the roster for his conduct, reports later emerging that Reyna was the player in question. Reyna's parents, former national team players Claudio and Danielle, had complained to U.S. Soccer about his playing time and Danielle eventually shared a decades-old domestic violence incident involving Gregg and his now-wife Rosalind, which led U.S. Soccer to launch an investigation that eventually cleared Gregg of wrongdoing. The issue seems to well and truly be in the past, though.

""I heard something but for me, it's not important,"" Pochettino said. The most important thing, he added, ""is the national team. And if we believe that Sebastian and Gio are important for us — and, because I think these two guys are really intelligent and very clever — if something happens, for sure, they are mature enough to deal with that.""

It was not top of mind for anyone else in camp, either.

""I completely forgot about it until the third or fourth day and I was like, 'oh wait a minute,'"" Ream said. ""But no, it's not really been discussed amongst the team. Their relationship has looked pretty normal to me and to everybody else and I think what happened happened and we've all kind of moved on from it and they have as well and that's a good thing. Like I said, everybody's trying to make this team. Everybody's trying to be a part of the home World Cup and those two guys are no different than myself, than Chris [Richards], than Tanner [Tessman], than everybody in the group. It's good to see that their focus is here and now and hopefully both of those guys can impress over the next couple of months.""

CHESTER, Pa. --  We're still more than six months out from the World Cup, but the gravity of the tournament is beginning to close in as the United States men's national team's final camp of 2025 is in full swing. Mauricio Pochettino's squad has done plenty to inspire optimism during their three-match unbeaten streak to enter this camp, but now they're preparing to take the pitch without Christian Pulisic, Tyler Adams, Chris Richards, Tim Weah, and Weston McKennie, in what are critical matches as preparation time runs short. 

The USMNT will start off facing Paraguay before a clash with Uruguay, again facing two teams who have qualified for the World Cup as they continue to test themselves under Pochettino. But without regular starters, this could be one of the final chances during this World Cup cycle for players like Gio Reyna to impress and show why they need to be in the squad when the dust settles. Pochettino has consistently maintained that he doesn't shut the door on anyone who may not be in camp, but he has also been clear to the players about his expectations for them while here. Perform to those expectations, and there are spots to earn in that final roster, but otherwise, plenty of players are waiting in the wings for a shot as Pochettino has dug deep in the pool during his time in charge.

""The way Poch wants us to play, he wants everyone to know their role, he wants everyone to be onboard and he wants nobody to think their postion is gaurenteed so I wouldn't say [regular players missing] affects preperation too much but of course at the same time wer're missing some key players and when we get to the important games and where it matters we're gonna want everyone fit and availible,"" Folorian Balogun said, speaking ahead of the match. ""But the most important thing is to manage what we have, and of course, the players who aren't here get healthy and look after themselves.""

Call it What You Want: A weekly podcast where Jimmy Conrad, Charlie Davies and Tony Meola cover all things USMNT and the state of the beautiful game in the United States. Catch the show YouTube live every Tuesday and Thursday at 10 a.m. ET.

For those who are here, one who has a massive opportunity to make an impact is midfielder Gio Reyna. He hasn't appeared for the USMNT since March of 2025 in the third-place game of Concacaf Nations League play and has since moved to a new club in Borussia Monchengladbach. Now getting some minutes for them, albeit as a consistent substitute not a starter, this will be a chance to end 2025 on a high note while looking to make a second consecutive World Cup and earn playing time while there.

Minutes have been hard to come by for Reyna since his move to Gladbach in the Bundesliga, as he's struggled with injuries and adjusting to the club after leaving Borussia Dortmund. With only 147 minutes during the season, it's unknown how fit Reyna will be for gametime, but there are few players in the squad who can bring his vision and ability on the ball to the table, which is why he's here at this critical time. 

With the move from Dortmund, a lot has changed in Reyna's life since being in the 2022 World Cup squad, and it shows to the players around him.

""He's a lot more mature, you know, he's married now and he's a lot more mature and to himself,"" Balogun said. ""He seems focused and like he wants to put the injuries and the noise behind him to play and do what he does best, so I'm happy and looking forward to seeing him.""

What happened in the past between the families of Reyna and Sebastian Berhalter is just that, in the past. During the road to the World Cup, they're here and coexisting with a common goal of making the squad and leading it to glory on home soil. We'll need to see what happens when Reyna takes the pitch, but as he's spoken about in the past, he knows what he needs to do. Now is the time to show that he can do it on the pitch.

One of the most capped members of the attack, with 21 appearances for the USMNT, the pressure will be on Balogun to carry the attack without the USMNT regulars beside him. The World Cup is drawing closer, and with goals in his last two starts, Balogun is showing why there was so much promise behind his commitment to the USMNT as a dual national. He's been able to create space for others with his movement and holdup play while putting shots on frame to keep defenses honest. 

In form for club and country, if the USMNT are going to get results from games in this window, they'll need Balogun at his best but his role will change a bit depending on the lineup. If Reyna does start, his ability on the ball will help create space but otherwise, Balogun will need to operate in smaller windows of space than he has become accustomed to. It's a good test for him as it'll be one that prepares him for his first World Cup.

As camps continue, it feels like the back three is here to stay. Not only are players comfortable in it from their time at club level and under Pochettino, but the USMNT have also secured results in the formation. But it's also not a strict back three as well. Tim Weah referred to his role as a fake wing back when he played during the September international break, and Tim Ream also echoed that flexibility.

""It's not a full on, stick with it three at the back, but it's important for all the guys to get the reps, to understand that sometimes we start with a four, build with a three [or] start with a three and build with a three, sometimes we play five and build with a three, so it's important for everybody to understand what we're doing and what's being asked, the different ways that we can play,"" Ream said.

With plenty of players who can play multiple positions like Joe Scally in this camp, Pochettino will have even more options in how build up looks even without one of his defensive stalwarts in Richards. Being able to push forward and grow with different players in this formation will only add to Pochettino's options while also increasing the confidence that the team has in what they can do.

TAMPA — The U.S. Men's National Soccer team takes the field at Raymond James Stadium Tuesday for an international friendly against Uruguay. The game is a tune-up for next summer's World Cup. It's the first time since 2018 that the U.S.A. squad will play in Tampa. 

Former U.S. men's national team defender and current Vice President of Sporting Oguchi Onyewu is excited to bring another major sporting event to the Tampa Bay region. 

""So many soccer teams, hockey teams, football teams, baseball teams. There's a plethora of sports in this city,"" Onyewu said this week. ""There's no city better to highlight what we want to bring to the country next summer than right here in Tampa Bay.""

The game is technically a friendly, and the U.S. already qualifies for the World Cup field because it's a host country. But Onyewu says the goals for this team are constant: play well and earn a win on home turf.

""Our objective is to play top-quality teams in the lead-up to the 2026 World Cup,"" he added. ""So this is going to be an unbelievable opportunity for us to highlight our talent and fine-tune everything before next summer.""

Defender Alex Freeman made a couple of stops in Tampa ahead of Tuesday's game. He got to do a jersey-swap with Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman and former Buccaneers lineman Ali Marpet.

""It felt good, I can't lie,"" Freeman laughed when talking about getting the chance to go to a Bolts game and a Bucs game in the same week. ""It felt good, to experience that kind of atmosphere. Being able to go to a Bucs game against a very good opponent. It was very good. Both atmospheres were very good, and it was good to get that kind of treatment.""

At 21 years young, Freeman is fighting for a spot on the final World Cup roster, and he knows he can't skip any steps between now and next summer.

""It's simple. You've got to impress, every camp. You don't know when the moment can get away from you,"" he said frankly. ""It's best to be able to go 100% in these camps and be able to know you can fight for this team and give 100% and be able to just stand your ground, you know.""

Kickoff for Tuesday's game is set for 7 p.m.

The Match Day Fan Zone will run from 3-7 on Tampa Bay Blvd. It's free for all ticket holders. The event will include representatives from the Buccaneers, Rowdies and Tampa Bay Sun F.C. It will feature player meet and greets, live music, games, custom shirt stations, product samples and giveaways.

Uruguay comes in at 15th in the latest FIFA world rankings, one spot ahead of the U.S.

Mauricio Pochettino insists that ""no one can feel safe"" about their chances of being included in the United States' World Cup squad for next year's tournament.

The USA automatically qualified for the World Cup as co-hosts, alongside Canada and Mexico, and are stepping up their preparation with friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay this week.

With Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams both missing this international break through injury, Pochettino has the chance to see more of his options as he starts to narrow down his squad for next year.

And the Argentinian warned that certain players are not guaranteed a place based on merit.

""For me, these are the players that they deserve to be here and are the players that we want to see. They are the players that are our choice, our selection,"" Pochettino said.

""And then no one can feel safe, or no one can feel that they're going to be [on the roster], even the names that you say: [Christian] Pulisic or Tyler Adams.

""I think the federation is bigger than the names that [are in] the national team.""

Pulisic has made 82 appearances for the USA, scoring 32 goals in that time, but has been limited to just six appearances in 2025.

He has opted out of the two November matches after suffering a low-grade hamstring injury during the USA's 2-1 friendly win over Australia last month.

""[Pulisic] was perfect when he played against Australia, but that happened, and we see what happened,"" Pochettino said.

""The most important thing is that all the players arrive fit, in a very good condition, on the day that we are going to start the World Cup, or maybe a little bit before, because I need to prepare the roster.""

USA face Paraguay on Saturday, before taking on Uruguay on Tuesday.

Christian Pulisic's name sits at the top of the U.S. men's national team conversation once again, but this time because he will not be on the pitch when the United States meets Paraguay at Subaru Park. The USMNT faces Paraguay in an international friendly that arrives at a pivotal moment, yet the team enters this camp without its most influential attacker, sparking questions that stretch far beyond simple squad rotation. 

The manager, Mauricio Pochettino, must lead a squad stripped of several first-team pillars, but none leaves a shadow as long as the Milan winger. The opening lines of every American squad discussion include him—this time, only to point out the void he leaves behind.

The USMNT arrives with momentum: two October friendlies, a draw against Ecuador and a win over Australia, stretched their unbeaten run to three. The tactical switch to a 3-4-3 suits Pochettino's personnel, and players such as Folarin Balogun, Gio Reyna and Tanner Tessmann now step into expanded roles. The problem? All of these roles initially revolve around Pulisic, whose gravity and cutting influence shape the system's identity. Without him, the U.S. enter a phase that feels less like experimentation and more like survival.

His absence isn't the only concern. The U.S. also lack Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Malik Tillman, Chris Richards and Antonee Robinson. But the tone of the camp shifted when the manager confirmed that Pulisic wouldn't join the squad at all.

Yet the mystery around the 27-year-old lingered. He had returned to action for Milan on November 7 in a 2-2 draw against Parma, proving that his condition wasn't catastrophic. Which raised a sharper question: if he was fit enough for club soccer, why not for the national team?

The reason Christian Pulisic is not playing against Paraguay is because AC Milan issued a firm ultimatum. As per MilanNews.it, the club reached an agreement with the U.S. Soccer Federation to keep Pulisic in Italy during the break, allowing him to fully recover rather than risk reinjury on transatlantic travel. For the Serie A side, that's welcome news — and perhaps a small victory in a season that's already been full of injuries.

The American camp, reluctantly, respected the decision. Pulisic's name was removed from the squad list before it was even published. His October injury—sustained during the friendly against Australia—left the Serie A giant stunned and upset. The club medical staff had warned of overload risks heading into the fall, and the late-cycle World Cup preparation window was deemed an unnecessary gamble.

“Speaking with the people at Milan, but also when I was leaving the national team, we had good conversations,” Pulisic explained in a recent interview for Paramount+. “I haven't come back and played yet.

“So I don't think it's right for me to fly over there and try to get my first games back with the national team. When I just want to make sure I have the time now to fully care for myself and make sure that my hamstring is doing well and allow other guys to take the place. So I think it's just the best decision for everyone right now,” he added.

Despite having only recorded one point in their World Cup qualifying group, Sweden secured a place in the World Cup playoffs on Friday night without even playing. 

Sweden, despite currently being last in their World Cup qualifying group, have now secured a playoff spot for the World Cup thanks to their Nations League C group victory. 

The four best Nations League group winners who do not finish in the top two in the World Cup qualifying group will receive a playoff ticket.

The results in the other groups mean that Sweden's place is now guaranteed after Croatia's group victory on Friday night, as well as Germany's win in Luxembourg, which means that Germany and the Czech Republic will at least finish second in their respective groups. 

There is still a small chance that Sweden can finish second in their World Cup qualifying group and thus get a better seeding than through the Nations League place.

Sweden have otherwise had a dismal World Cup qualifying campaign, where they have lost to unsung Kosovo on two occasions and have only one point to show for four matches. This led to the dismissal of Jon Dahl Tomasson, who was replaced by Graham Potter. ","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

Mic'd Up: The former UNC stalwart knows college soccer is as crazy as ever, and figuring out who might win the NCAA Tournament is a frightening prospect. 

College soccer is increasingly hard to predict. At least, that's what Kacey White thinks. This is a changing sport, full of competition, with more jeopardy than ever. Conference realignment has packed some of the biggest divisions in the U.S. The constant churn of players, movement into the pros, and alternative pathways have made the thing that was once the crux of American women's soccer just a little more chaotic.

White covers it for ESPN+. She also loves it. Players get better, she argues.

""Everything about this part of the game and development is about understanding competition and knowing that you have to bring your best every day. A lot of times, you'll see where, whether it's in youth soccer, college soccer, or professional soccer, if you don't have those moments to show resilience, or have those moments where there's adversity that sets in, you don't know how to deal with that,"" she tells GOAL. 

Never is that clearer than in the ACC. White's beloved UNC won the national championship last year. This season, a repeat would be a major upset. 

""There's always been a lot of parity, but it seems to get tighter and tighter every year. A team like North Carolina doesn't have a lot of numbers that they use in their substitutions, and they have a very young roster, so they finished just outside the top six [in the ACC],"" she adds. 

The next steps are trickier to figure out, too. The abolishment of the NWSL draft means players have a bit more freedom to move. Change is afoot at all levels. White thinks players just have more options.

""I just see it as different. I think there's not necessarily a waiting game now to go through the draft for players that may have accelerated growth and they would like to go to the professional game for whatever reason is personal to them. You just don't have to wait till that moment,"" she says. 

As for NCAA tournament predictions? Who knows. White is just here for the ride. She knows, after playing for UNC, representing the USWNT, and spending six years as a professional, that making any sort of projection is a fool's errand. Still, she's backing Stanford to win it all.

White talks the ACC, college drafts, conference realignment, and who might just win it all in the latest edition of Mic'd Up, a recurring feature in which GOAL taps into the perspective of analysts, announcers, and other pundits on the state of soccer in the U.S. and abroad. 

NOTE: This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.

GOAL: First of all, what has happened to UNC? They were convincing winners last year and are struggling this season...

WHITE: Well, I think it speaks to just the parity that's in the ACC. We've seen that for years, even 10-20 years ago, there's always been a lot of parity, but it seems to get tighter and tighter every year. A team like North Carolina doesn't have a lot of numbers that they use in their substitutions, and they have a very young roster, so they finished just outside the top six. But I think we have other teams like that, too. Wake Forest was in the finals last year with North Carolina, and they're in ninth place in the ACC. And for me, it's not so much a drop off of those schools. It just speaks to the incredibly competitive environment that the ACC has year in and year out, and there are such fine margins that separate teams.

GOAL: Has conference realignment shifted things? Is it more competitive now?

WHITE: I think it has, and especially when you look at the ACC, when you add Stanford and Cal into it, to programs that have always been at the top of the college game, and are very well thought of. Especially Stanford, having won titles, and you add that into the mix that already existed in the ACC, it becomes incredibly competitive. And we are seeing that in other conferences as well. But with a conference like this that tends to get many teams, sometimes double digit teams, into the NCAA tournament, you've now added two more to the mix, and it just really muddies the water, but in a great way.

GOAL: So you vouch for chaos? The more hectic, the better?

WHITE: I do. I believe everything about this part of the game and development is about understanding competition and knowing that you have to bring your best every day. A lot of times, you'll see where, whether it's in youth soccer, college soccer, or professional soccer, if you don't have those moments to show resilience, or have those moments where there's adversity that sets in, you don't know how to deal with that. And so I think, for these conferences getting stronger, that they're able to face each other earlier, and it prepares them for down the road, not only from a program perspective, but individual players, too. 

GOAL: We've seen a lot of change in women's college soccer over the last few years. Would you say that the pipeline to pro is easier? Is it more difficult? Because obviously, you don't have a draft anymore, how do you see that as a changing landscape?

WHITE: I just see it as different. I think there's not necessarily a waiting game now to go through the draft for players that may have accelerated growth and they would like to go to the professional game for whatever reason is personal to them. You just don't have to wait till that moment. But I just think it's different. I don't think it's necessarily a better or worse thing, just a different landscape that players are now navigating.

GOAL: So was the draft maybe holding players back a little, by extension?

WHITE: I don't know if I can necessarily put a direct answer to that, because it's such an individual decision. You can't necessarily make a universal statement that affects all players on whether the draft is better or not, or whether it not being there has done that. I think it's just very personal.

GOAL: To round it off, give me your college cup picks. And then, if you had to tentatively say, ""I don't know, but I'd vouch for *insert team"", who are you going with? 

WHITE: Okay, so let's go with this. I do believe that the ACC will have a minimum of two teams in the College Cup. We saw four teams last year. I do think the ACC will get two in. And I will say this, not because it's at the forefront of my mind, but the way that Stanford played in the first half of the ACC semifinal, I didn't think any team could stop them. But if I had to say right now, I would say, of all the games that I've seen and what I've watched this season, I would go with Stanford.

GOAL: So, at least two ACC teams and Stanford to win it?

WHITE: That gives you a little bit of wiggle room!

Toulouse FC midfielder Abu Francis faces a long road to recovery after suffering a serious ankle injury that could rule him out of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The 25-year-old, representing the Black Stars, was injured during Ghana's 2-0 defeat to Japan in the 2025 Kirin Challenge Cup at Toyota Stadium on Friday.

In an attempt to block a shot from Japan's Ao Tanaka, Abu fractured his ankle, forcing him off the pitch.

Following the match, Toulouse issued a statement confirming the severity of the injury and casting doubt on his World Cup participation.

“After sustaining a terrible injury against the Japanese, our midfielder will be sidelined for several months and will, unfortunately, likely miss the 2026 World Cup in the United States…,” the club said.

Abu had just returned to the national team after missing the previous two call-ups, but was unable to complete the game on his comeback.



The Ghana Football Association (GFA) confirmed that he is in stable condition after receiving emergency treatment and is expected to return to France to begin his rehabilitation.

Meanwhile, the Black Stars have travelled to Seoul with a 21-man squad ahead of their final friendly against South Korea on Tuesday.

A road win over Georgia on Saturday could seal Spain's spot at the 2026 World Cup.

European champion Spain travels to Georgia on Saturday with lofty ambitions as it looks to continue a perfect run through World Cup qualifying and guarantee its place at the 2026 World Cup. La Roja sit three points clear at the top of Group E and are certain to finish first if they manage to beat Georgia while Turkey drops points at home to Bulgaria.

That being said, a first-place finish is all but guaranteed either way as long as Spain beats Georgia, with Turkey facing an almighty deficit in goal difference ahead of its trip to Seville in the final qualifying match. Spain has dominated its rivalry with Georgia in recent years and won each of its six encounters the the Crusaders over the past four-and-a-half years.

Georgia's sole win in this fixture was a friendly victory back in June 2016, but the odds of that result being repeated in Tbilisi this weekend appear incredibly slim. Georgia has won just once in four qualifiers thus far and needs three points to keep alive any chance of stealing second place, though even that would be ruled out should Turkey beat Bulgaria as expected.

One change each as we get underway for the second stanza.

2025-11-15T17:55:34Z

HALF-TIME

Spain are at their dominant best this evening against Georgia, with La Roja now all but assured passage to next summer's World Cup barring a heroic comeback by Jvarosnebi.

Goals from Oyarzabal (11' Pen), Zubimendi (22'), and Ferran (35') separate the two sides at Boris Paitchadze National Stadium.

2025-11-15T17:51:09Z

CHANCE!

A top-class kick save from Mamardashvili denies Oyarzabal his first-half brace and Spain an even more commanding 4-0 lead.

2025-11-15T17:38:43Z

GOAL!

It's surely done and dusted in Tbilisi, as Ferran Torres makes it 3-0 in the 35th minute.

A tap-in from close range after getting on the end of Oyarzabal's ball across the goal face was an easy finish for the Barcelona man.

La Roja are rampant, and that's Ferran's 100th goal for club and country across all competitions.

2025-11-15T17:32:14Z

It's been a whirlwind run of outings for Spain by Oyarzabal, who has unquestionably become a vital cog in the La Roja wheel.

2025-11-15T17:25:15Z

GOAL!

Arsenal's Martin Zubimendi makes it 2-0 with a delicate chip from inside the box!

Spain have been at their best once again, matching the form that has seen them run riot during World Cup qualifying.

Georgia will have to dig deep if they have any chance to claw their way back into this before the half-time interval.

2025-11-15T17:21:10Z

CHANCE!

Nearly 2-0 minutes later! Álex Baena smashes a long-range effort off Giorgi Mamardashvili's post!

2025-11-15T17:13:42Z

GOAL!

It's 1-0 to Spain as Mikel Oyarzabal slots home from 12 yards out to put the European giants that much closer to officially qualifying for the 2026 World Cup!

2025-11-15T17:12:44Z

Benoît Bastien is now taking another look at the screen...and yes, penalty for Spain!

Handball by Giorgi Gocholeishvili!

2025-11-15T17:11:28Z

CHANCE!

Spain come close to breaking the deadlock inside the opening ten minutes, with La Roja players claiming handball on the end of Ferran's chance at the back post.

It's now under review by VAR for a potential penalty...

2025-11-15T17:03:53Z

Spain gets things started against the home side, with Georgia settling into what will likely be a low block for the majority of the evening in the capital.

2025-11-15T16:57:39Z

Moments away from kick-off in Tbilisi. National anthems, and then we're underway at Boris Paitchadze National Stadium.

For you Georgian fans out there, here is the Jvarosnebi XI fielded by Willy Sagnol

2025-11-15T16:18:40Z

It could be a historic night for Luis de la Fuente's side, with Spain on the cusp of making it 30 unbeaten in competitive fixtures.

Though they'll be without Lamine Yamal, La Roja no doubt remain confident on the back of having yet to surrender a goal across their qualifying campaign.

2025-11-15T16:15:58Z

Spain are a win or a draw away from officially booking passage to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with kickoff in Tbilisi less than an hour away.

The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) is preparing a submission to FIFA to prevent Cristiano Ronaldo from being suspended for more than one match following his sending off against the Republic of Ireland, a source from the organisation told Lusa on Saturday.

The submission, which is being prepared with the direct involvement of FPF president Pedro Proenca, aims to ensure the player is not suspended at the start of the 2026 World Cup and is based on three main points: the pre-match atmosphere created by the coach of the Republic of Ireland, the incident itself, and Ronaldo's lack of prior disciplinary issues, as he had never been sent off while playing for the national team.

According to the federation, which has already been notified by FIFA of the disciplinary proceedings against the forward, the statements made by coach Heimir Hallgrimsson - who accused Ronaldo of influencing the refereeing during the match between the two teams at Alvalade (a 1-0 win for Portugal) - ""created a clearly and demonstrably hostile environment around the national team captain.""

The FPF also argues that, in the incident leading to the sending off, Cristiano Ronaldo ""was, as on many other occasions during the match, blatantly held inside the box"" and reacted out of ""frustration,"" resulting in the Portuguese international elbowing Irish defender Dara O'Shea.

The organisation further points to the player's clean record, noting that the sending off in the 61st minute of the match in Dublin was ""the first time Cristiano Ronaldo had ever been sent off in more than 200 appearances for the national team, which is truly remarkable and demonstrates his consistently exemplary conduct.""

According to the same source, ""the FPF is confident that these arguments are more than sufficient mitigating factors to convince FIFA that Cristiano Ronaldo does not deserve a suspension longer than one match.""

Ronaldo was released from national team duties on Friday, with Portugal set to face Armenia in Porto on Sunday, in the sixth and final round of Group F qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.

If the Al Nassr superstar is handed a suspension of more than one match, and Portugal secures direct qualification, he could miss games at the 2026 World Cup, which will take place from June 11 to July 19 in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

On Thursday in Dublin, Ronaldo was sent off for the first time while playing for the Portuguese national team, after 226 matches, when Swedish referee Glenn Nyberg showed him a straight red card following an incident involving O'Shea.

In a match where Portugal could have secured their ninth and seventh consecutive qualification for World Cup finals, they were defeated by the Republic of Ireland 2-0, thanks to a brace from Troy Parrott.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

Venezuela and North Korea square off in Round of 32 action of the FIFA U-17 World Cup. Here's everything you need to know ahead of kickoff, including how to watch.

Venezuela enter the knockout rounds unbeaten after an impressive group stage, earning wins over England and Haiti while drawing with Egypt. The South American side has displayed a strong balance between defensive organization and dynamic counterattacking play, highlighted by their 3-0 shutout of England to close group play. North Korea, meanwhile, opened with a dominant 5-0 win against El Salvador but couldn't maintain momentum, drawing Germany and falling 2-0 to Colombia. Both teams have shown flashes of attacking flair, but Venezuela's consistency and recent form make them a tough opponent for the disciplined North Korean squad.

The Africa Cup of Nations is back this December and January, with the continent's very best set to battle it out in Morocco as they aim to take Cote d'Ivoire's crown after their unlikely victory at the start of 2024. AFCON's prestige, drama and quality remains up there with the Euros and Copa America, but the downside for European clubs is it's another tournament which falls slap bang in the middle of their seasonal calendar, meaning most teams will be losing players for up to a month.

The Premier League's growth to become a truly global competition means all but three teams - Arsenal, Chelsea and Leeds United - will be affected, though some will feel the pinch a bit more than others.

We at GOAL have ranked the remaining 17 clubs based on whose prospects of a successful season will most be damaged by players leaving for AFCON. Let's dive in...

Number of absentees: 1 - Evann Guessand (Cote d'Ivoire)

Arriving from Nice as one of Ligue 1's most exciting forwards this summer, Evann Guessand hasn't quite hit the ground running at Aston Villa, scoring once in 15 games for his new club. Thus, his absence this winter shouldn't really be to the detriment of Unai Emery, who has plenty of other forwards capable of finding the net to rely upon.

Number of absentees: 1 - Yoane Wissa (DR Congo)

As is the case with Guessand at Villa, Yoane Wissa hasn't impressed for his new club yet. In fact, he hasn't even played a single minute for them at the time of writing. After missing part of Brentford's pre-season campaign to force through a move to Newcastle, the striker picked up an injury on duty with DR Congo and hasn't been fit since. He's expected to recover in time for AFCON and make his long-awaited Magpies debut in the near future.

Why do Newcastle rank above Villa then? Because Eddie Howe could seriously do with another source of goals, and the availability of their £55 million ($72.5m) attacker would be nice.

Number of absentees: 1 - Amine Adli (Morocco)

Another team with only one player departing in December, Bournemouth's thin squad becomes tested at the first sign of absence. Amine Adli, a Bundesliga title winner with Bayer Leverkusen, is yet to win the full trust of Andoni Iraola, but the Cherries' high intensity means they need to count on every first-team player, and they will need to find someone to replace those minutes. In better news for Bournemouth, Antoine Semenyo won't be going anywhere as Ghana somehow failed to qualify for the finals.

Number of absentees: 2 - Omar Marmoush (Egypt), Rayan Ait-Nouri (Algeria)

If this were a list ranking teams by how much individual quality each team will lose for AFCON, then clearly Manchester City would be towards the very top. Yet, such are the riches of depth in Pep Guardiola's squad, they will barely be troubled by Omar Marmoush and Rayan Ait-Nouri's exits, especially given the Catalan manager has openly reiterated his desire to trim down his roster.

Marmoush has missed much of this season with a knee injury, while Ait-Nouri has been sidelined with an ankle injury after joining from Wolves. City will probably be just fine.

Number of absentees: 1-2 - Pape Matar Sarr (Senegal), Yves Bissouma (Mali)

One of the players to have improved most under Thomas Frank at Tottenham is Pape Matar Sarr, who has continually proven one of their key men when given the nod over the more senior duo of Joao Palhinha and Rodrigo Bentancur.

Yves Bissouma, meanwhile, is yet to make an appearance in the Frank era and is on his way back from a knee injury. Should he return in the next month, he'll undoubtedly be whisked straight into action with Mali. Ghana's absence from the tournament means summer signing Mohammed Kudus will, however, definitely remain at Spurs through the winter.

Number of absentees: 1 - Carlos Baleba (Cameroon)

Back to another club with only one player to set go to AFCON, but with more increasing importance as we work our way up this list. In another life, Carlos Baleba would have joined Manchester United this summer, but Brighton were not interested in sanctioning a sale. His form has since nosedived this season, but given the Red Devils are still keen on Baleba given his outrageous potential, he will be fairly difficult for the Seagulls to do without.

Number of absentees: 2 - Dango Ouattara (Burkina Faso), Frank Onyeka (Nigeria)

A summer of mass change left many believing Brentford would struggle in the fight against relegation this term. Keith Andrews clearly took that personally and his Bees are flying. However, they will face a challenge without being able to call upon £42.5m ($56m) winger Dango Ouattara, who has been a massive hit after joining from Bournemouth, as well as midfielder Frank Onyeka.

Number of absentees: 2 - Aaron Wan-Bissaka (DR Congo), El Hadji Malick Diouf (Senegal)

West Ham are in their own fight to beat the drop and have been rejuvenated with the appointment of Nuno Espirito Santo as manager. But the Portuguese boss is facing some significant squad upheaval during the four weeks of AFCON. First-choice full-backs Aaron Wan-Bissaka and El Hadji Malick Diouf will both be jetting off to Morocco for the tournament, limiting Nuno's options to shore up a far from fearless defence.

Number of absentees: 1 - Mohamed Salah (Egypt)

No club will be impacted more by losing a single player than Liverpool and Mohamed Salah. Sure, he hasn't been firing on all cylinders for a struggling Reds side this season, and this may even be the opportune time to trial a frontline for the future without him, but the 'Egyptian King' still reigns at Anfield and they will be losing one of the world's most fearsome goal threats.

There was talk before the season started about Jeremie Frimpong being bumped up to right wing to make up for Salah's absence, but that would clearly represent a massive downgrade no matter which way you spin it.

Number of absentees: 3-4 - Ismaila Sarr (Senegal), Christantus Uche (Nigeria), Chadi Riad (Morocco), Cheick Doucoure (Mali)

Though Jean-Philippe Mateta, Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton are Crystal Palace's star attractions nowadays, they would be a far worse team if they didn't have Ismaila Sarr, who has already contributed eight goals and two assists in 16 games across all competitions heading into the November international break.

Once more, Senegal's tag as a team likely to go all the way means the Eagles could be without Sarr for a month. That's already a scary prospect as is, but when you consider how small Oliver Glasner's squad already is and that they will have European and cup commitments to tend to in that span, it could become a nightmare pretty quickly.

Beyond Sarr, squad players Christantus Uche and Chadi Riad could receive call-ups, though Cheick Doucoure is likely to miss the tournament through injury.

Number of absentees: 3-4 - Ibrahim Sangare, Willy Boly (both Cote d'Ivoire), Taiwo Awoniyi, Ola Aina (both Nigeria)

Few would have predicted last season's surprise package Nottingham Forest being in a relegation scrap this time around, but that's the situation they find themselves in at the City Ground. Sean Dyche, their third manager already this term, is also tasked with getting their Europa League campaign back on track.

It's a shame for Forest, then, that they could lose up to four players, including two key starters, for AFCON. Ibrahim Sangare is now a trusted midfield option, though Ola Aina's participation with Nigeria will depend on his injury recovery having missed several months with a hamstring issue. Willy Boly and Taiwo Awoniyi aren't regular starters, but competing in Europe means Forest will feel the pinch once they can no longer be selected.

Number of absentees: 3 - Lyle Foster (South Africa), Axel Tuanzebe (DR Congo), Hannibal Mejbri (Tunisia)

To Burnley's credit, they have half a chance of beating the drop this season. They are not the team marooned to the foot of the Premier League table and have picked up some respectable results on their return to the top-flight.

Tough times could be coming, however. Striker Lyle Foster is likely to be involved at AFCON, as are ex-Manchester United duo Axel Tuanzebe and Hannibal Mejbri. Perhaps the silver lining for Scott Parker is that this trio all play in different positions, so his squad won't feel completely depleted in one area.

Number of absentees: 3 - Alex Iwobi, Calvin Bassey, Samuel Chukwueze (all Nigeria)

A summer of transfer malpractice has seen a consistently mid-table side in Fulham become embroiled in a relegation scrap this season. Marco Silva's future is already in jeopardy, so he'll be delighted to know he'll be losing some of his best players over the next couple of months. Alex Iwobi, one of the most underrated players in the Premier League, will join Calvin Bassey and Samuel Chukwueze for Nigeria's AFCON campaign, with the Super Eagles looking to end their run of 13 years without a continental trophy.

Number of absentees: 3 - Iliman Ndiaye, Idrissa Gueye (both Senegal), Adam Aznou (Morocco)

David Moyes will be sad to see the back of two Senegalese midfielders who provide very different qualities. Iliman Ndiaye, or 'Skilly-man' to the kids, has run Everton's attack ever since he joined the club in 2024 and is now recognised as one of the Premier League's best players outside the 'Big Six'. Meanwhile, veteran anchor Idrissa Gueye has long ensured that the Toffees don't give up too many chances through the middle of the pitch and his absence will surely be felt off the ball.

Adam Aznou is also a contender to feature for hosts Morocco, though he hasn't played for Everton since signing from Bayern Munich back in July. If anything, getting minutes at AFCON could prove valuable at setting up the second half of the teenager's debut season at Hill Dickinson Stadium.

Number of absentees: 5 - Marshall Munetsi, Tawanda Chirewa (both Zimbabwe), Tolu Arokodare (Nigeria), Emmanuel Agbadou (Cote d'Ivoire), Jackson Tchatchoua (Cameroon)

Long gone are the days of Wolves boasting elite-level talent such as Ruben Neves and Joao Moutinho, while their Premier League status is now under serious threat after a dreadful start to the season. New manager Rob Edwards is expected to lose up to five players this winter, including one of Micah Richards' favourite players in box-to-box midfielder Marshall Munetsi, so reports suggesting a busy January transfer window may need to be accurate if they're to somehow avoid relegation to the Championship.

Number of absentees: 3 - Bryan Mbeumo (Cameroon), Amad Diallo (Cote d'Ivoire), Noussair Mazraoui (Morocco)

Ruben Amorim must surely have benefitted from having extra time on the training pitch with his Manchester United players so far this season, with his side not competing in Europe and having been dumped out of the Carabao Cup in the second round back in August. There is less of a strain on his squad, but there soon will be a challenge to contend with.

United are in line to lose the entire right-hand side of their starting XI, with versatile defender Noussair Mazraoui, winger turned wing-back Amad Diallo and star forward Bryan Mbeumo all likely to headline AFCON for their respective nations. The build-up to the tournament is already on the agenda at Old Trafford, too, with United keen to avoid another club-vs-country row with Mbeumo's Cameroon following previous discretions over Andre Onana. Amorim will thus hope to keep Mbeumo in England right up until the tournament's start on December 21.

Number of absentees: 7 - Chemsdine Talbi (Morocco), Reinildo (Mozambique), Habib Diarra (Senegal), Simon Adingra (Cote d'Ivoire), Bertrand Traore (Burkina Faso), Arthur Masuaku, Noah Sadiki (both DR Congo)

Sunderland's incredible transformation has been among the most fun storylines of this Premier League campaign. The Black Cats were only promoted back to the top tier by the skin of their teeth in May, edging out Sheffield United in a dramatic play-off final that was decided with the last kick of the match. Now, there is talk of them competing for a place in Europe.

The real test of those credentials will come from December to January, with head coach Regis Le Bris set to forfeit seven star players to AFCON, including exciting winger Chemsdine Talbi, who scored their winner at Chelsea, and Granit Xhaka's reliable midfield partner Noah Sadiki. If Sunderland can maintain their form throughout the winter, however, they will indeed be seen as the real deal.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

WSL leaders Manchester City asserted their dominance with a resounding 3-0 win over rivals Manchester United. The game was ended as a contest in the space of four minutes, when Bunny Shaw slid in for her side's second before Lauren Hemp capped her return from injury with a powerful strike on the stroke of half-time after Rebecca Knaak had initially opened the scoring.

The hosts exerted their control from the off and almost took the lead in the opening minutes when Yui Hasegawa's shot was cleared off the line. United grew into the game, counteracting City's high line with balls over the top, but the course of the game was turned when City took the lead in the 26th minute. A Lauren Hemp inswinger to the back post was nodded back across goal by Shaw, with Knaak guiding the ball back across goal past Safia Middleton-Patel. 

Still United pushed forward but City were far more ruthless, doubling their lead in the 43rd minute when Kerstin Casparij's cross was met by a sliding Shaw to slot home. Hemp capped off a brilliant first half, both for herself and her team, with a thunderous third. The Lionesses star was given far too touch time at the edge of the United box, allowing her to power a left-footed effort into the near top corner. 

Knaak might've been sent off in the second half for what probably should've been a second yellow but, that aside, the second half passed by with little incident as City extended their lead at the WSL summit to four points, with second-placed Chelsea in action against Liverpool on Sunday.

GOAL rates Manchester City's players from the Etihad Stadium.

Ayaka Yamashita (6/10):

Commanded her box well from set pieces but had little to do otherwise.

Kerstin Casparij (7/10):

Her inviting cross set up Shaw for the second. Bombed up and down the right flank throughout. 

Jade Rose (7/10):

Rebuffed United's advances after the introduction of Malard in the second half. Strong in the tackle. Put her head on the line to clear a late goalmouth scramble.

Rebecca Knaak (7/10):

Took the opener brilliantly, powering her header back across goal giving a scrambling Middleton-Patel no chance. Lucky to avoid a second yellow when her lunging tackle on Malard went unpunished with the referee playing advantage. 

Leila Ouahabi (5/10):

A touch indecisive on the ball at times. Her failure to deal with a long ball could have set up a United goal, or got Knaak sent off.

Yui Hasegawa (6/10):

Denied an early goal when her effort was cleared off the line. Screened her back four with minimal fuss. 

Laura Blindkilde Brown (7/10):

A perfectly neat and composed performance. Sarina Wiegman will want to give her a competitive cap as soon as possible. 

Vivianne Miedema (8/10):

An early effort clipped the outside of the United post. Linked up well with Hemp and showed flashes of her brilliance on the ball. Dropped into a holding midfield role in the final 15 minutes and looked just as comfortable. Pure class.

Aoba Fujino (6/10):

So strong in possession, her low centre of gravity making it impossible for United's defenders to win the ball. 

Lauren Hemp (9/10):

Back in the side for the first time since September. Provided attacking impetus down the left and on set-pieces. Her thunderous strike from the edge of the box killed the contest.

Khadija Shaw (8/10):

A constant aerial threat and a willing runner in behind and her decision to nod back into the box set-up Knaak's opener. Slid in with authority to double the lead shortly before the half-time break. Took a bang to the head that ended her afternoon. 

Iman Beney (6/10):

Came on in the 74th minute, winning a corner almost instantly with her direct dribbling. An exciting prospect.

Sydney Lohmann (5/10):

Helped to ice the game in the middle of the park. 

Grace Clinton (N/A):

Introduced for Shaw in the 82nd minute. Little time, or need, to affect proceedings. 

Andree Jeglertz (7/10):

Clearly saw no need to make any major changes. He will be thrilled with his side's tenacity in keeping a clean sheet.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Despite their financial constraints, Barcelona remain confident of signing a new world-class No.9 to replace Robert Lewandowski, with Bayern Munich star Harry Kane one of the options being considered. Lewandowski is in the final few months of his existing contract and is expected to leave the club as a free agent next summer as the Catalan giants are unlikely to offer him a new deal.

With just a few months left on Lewandowski's current Barcelona contract, the 37-year-old striker has been closely linked with a move away from the Spanish side next summer as a free agent. The Polish forward's representative, Pini Zahavi recently claimed that the striker could leave the Catalan side, saying: ""Lewandowski's contract with Barcelona expires in the summer of 2026, and no decisions have been made yet. We'll have to wait and see what happens in the coming days."" 

With the Lewandowski chapter possibly coming to an end, the Catalan giants have started to prepare for life beyond their star striker. According to Mundo Deportivo, the club have prepared a shortlist of five forwards, which includes world-class options like Julian Alvarez and Kane. 

The report adds that Barcelona's financial department remains confident that the club would be able to secure the transfer for a top striker, with the club's eyes on Atletico Madrid star Julian Alvarez. But to afford the new player, they will have to return to La Liga's 1:1 rule. Once Lewandowski leaves, €40 million (£35m/$46m) will be freed up with which the new transfer can be funded.

As of now, Barcelona are close to achieving the 1:1 balance, with pending payment for the VIP seat instalments due in December. In the 2024-25 settlement, €70m out of the €100m (£88m/$116m) has already been paid and the club will receive the remaining €30m by December. With that they will be able to match the 1:1 balance. 

A second clause will be to draw up a financial structure to cover the transfer amount and Barcelona believe that the projected revenue growth after full opening of the Camp Nou will help them to cover that ground.

After ruling out the prospect of signing Erling Haaland due to the financial requirements, the favourite candidate to replace Lewandowski as Barcelona's main No.9 is Alvarez from Atletico. The shortlist also consists of Bayern and England star Kane, along with Galatasaray's Victor Osimhen, Borussia Dortmund's Serhou Guirassy and a low-cost option in Etta Eyong. 

The latter, who just joined Levante in the summer, said this week that his dream is to play for the Catalan club and labelled Camp Nou icons Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto'o as his childhood idols.

While Barcelona have not offered Lewandowski a new deal, their star attacker Lamine Yamal reportedly wants the veteran striker to stay. The relationship between the two players at opposing ends of their respective careers has apparently strengthened both on and off the field. Yamal is said to view the ex-Bayern star as 'a mentor', with there being a productive understanding between the pair as they look to pose problems to La Liga and Champions League opponents.

Yamal now wants to see Lewandowski remain in his current surroundings beyond the summer of 2027, when free agency is set to be reached. He is said to be of the opinion that there is nobody better suited to continue fostering his development, while providing much-needed leadership.

The veteran forward has also been linked with a move to Serie A giants AC Milan as Zlatan Ibrahimovic reportedly wants to sign him, while there have also been reports that claimed that the 37-year-old might even consider announcing his retirement from professional football.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'They blamed me for everything'","https://www.goal.com/en-in/lists/samuel-umtiti-reveals-rift-with-barcelona-retired-defender-opens-up-on-bouts-of-depression/blt43fcff5dfd615e32","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 10:29:11 GMT","

Samuel Umtiti slammed Barcelona as he opened up about his 'rift' with the Catalan club and his 'bouts of depression' during long injury spells in Spain. The French defender, who joined Lille in 2023 after seeing his Blaugrana contract mutually terminated, retired from professional football this summer at the age of just 31 after years of knee problems.

Umtiti started his professional career in 2012 at Ligue giants Lyon and spent four seasons with the Ligue 1 side before heading to Spain to sign for Barcelona. The French international had a bright start at the Blaugrana and was a regular starter under Luis Enrique, winning multiple trophies including back-to-back La Liga titles between 2017 and 2019. During this period, he also won the 2018 World Cup with Les Bleus and was experiencing a high in his career. 

However, he was soon plagued by several knee injuries that started to limit his playing time for club and country. Umtiti was eventually released by the Spanish giants in 2023 after mutually terminating his contract. He returned to France to join Lille but his career was cut short due to persistent injury, which prompted him to announce his retirement in September this year.

Due to the recurring injury issues, the centre-back barely played following the World Cup success as he battled hard to get back onto the field. However, disagreements with Barcelona over treatment options and the mental toll of dealing with his physical issues caused problems between the player and the club. 

Umtiti, who now works as a pundit for DAZN, recently told RMC: ""After the World Cup, I wanted to take some time to find out exactly what I had and make the right decisions about my treatment. We weren't necessarily in agreement with the club, so I decided to look elsewhere, to see specialists so that everyone could give me their opinion. Most of them told me that I didn't need to have surgery. In the end, Barcelona listened to my choice, to what I wanted.

""But I think there were things that happened internally that people didn't necessarily appreciate, whereas I have enormous respect for everyone. Just because I'm not doing my rehabilitation with you doesn't mean I don't love you. No, it's just that I had decided on something else because what you offered me didn't work out. But ultimately, from that moment on, I think the rift was created and people started talking, saying things that weren't necessarily true, putting all the blame on me. The most important thing for me was to come back.""

Umtiti added: ""Looking back, I know that mentally I was very, very, very affected by it, perhaps by the bouts of depression. There were so many things… I didn't even leave my house. People didn't know all of this. They thought: 'Anyway, if he doesn't show anything on social media, it means he's not doing anything.'"" But I worked so hard, I was doing two or three training sessions a day, I had a prep course... It was incredible what I was doing, I didn't even really have a life, I didn't see my friends. When I read everything that came out in the press, I thought to myself: 'How can they think that about me? I'm not like that, money isn't what motivates me. I just wanted to play football

""I tried to do things the way the club wanted, but it didn't work; my knee was always swollen. I decided to do things differently, but I still followed the advice I was given because I'm not a doctor. I also read books about the problem I had, I stopped eating meat and fish, I followed an incredible diet that helped me get rid of the inflammation. My inflammation was so severe that I had to change my diet. Some people didn't necessarily do what they should have done, and for me, when you're a professional, you can't be that incompetent. I had a lot of resentment before, but I've done a lot of work and I don't hold a grudge against anyone. I'm at peace with all of that.""

While he is currently working as a pundit, his ultimate ambition is to become a coach as he told OLDTV: ""I'm so passionate, I watch every match. I know I'm going to get my diplomas in the next few weeks. It's going to take a few years, but being a coach is the ultimate goal I'll set for myself. He added that his 'inspiration' will come from 'a bit of everything' he has learned throughout his career, underlining his passion to stay connected to football.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Man Utd women's player ratings vs Man City: Ella Toone & Jess Park stifled as Elisabeth Terland has a shocker to leave WSL title hopes in tatters","https://www.goal.com/en-qa/lists/man-utd-women-player-ratings-man-city-ella-toone-jess-park-elisabeth-terland-shocker-wsl/blt04efb96a8b4f19b3","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 15:34:21 GMT","

Marc Skinner's side shipped three first-half goals to effectively put the game to bed as the Red Devils toiled in the Manchester derby and saw their rivals pull seven points clear of them in the WSL table. It'll surely take something spectacular for United to get themselves back in contention now, even after only nine games, as they struggled to contain the likes of Lauren Hemp, Vivianne Miedema and Bunny Shaw and were comfortably beaten 3-0.

City would break the deadlock after an even start when Shaw rose above Elisabeth Terland and nodded across to box for Rebecca Knaak to head home what was her third goal in a Manchester derby to give the hosts the lead.

United, who failed to muster a single shot on target over the entire 90 minutes, tried to get going, with Ella Toone and Jess Park showing flashes of their quality in and around the box, but City's defence were having none of it, and Andree Jeglertz's side would double their lead on 43 minutes. Shaw, who looked a class above all game, would be involved again, this time scoring herself as she raced in front of a sleeping Dominique Janssen and slotted home for 2-0, bagging her sixth WSL goal of the season in the process.

And the game was effectively over just before the half-time whistle blew, when Hemp, afforded far too much time and space to pick her spot, arrowed a ferocious drive past a helpless Safia Middleton-Patel to end the afternoon as a contest.

GOAL rates Manchester United's players from the Etihad Stadium...

Safia Middleton-Patel (6/10):

Powerless to stop any of the goals and saved well from Shaw in the second half to stop it being four.

Jayde Riviere (5/10):

She found life tough against a resurgent Hemp and failed to stop the cross on more than one occasion.

Dominique Janssen (4/10):

Should've been more switched on to the danger posed by Shaw for City's second goal and struggled to contain the Jamaican goalscoring sensation all afternoon.

Maya Le Tissier (5/10):

Her and Janssen will be having nightmares about Shaw tonight. Couldn't really blame her for any of the goals but will be angry that United shipped three having been so consistent at the back this season.

Anna Sandberg (5/10):

Struggled to deal with Kerstin Casparij's marauding runs from right-back and should've got out to the Netherlands international far quicker to try to prevent the cross that led to Shaw's goal.

Julia Zigiotti Olme (4/10):

Had a bit of a nightmare. Lost the midfield battle and allowed Hemp all sorts of time and space to get her shot away for City's third goal.

Hinata Miyazawa (5/10):

Not her day. Loose with her passing and couldn't stop City dominating the midfield area.

Ella Toone (6/10):

No hat-trick at the Etihad this time. A really frustrating afternoon for Toone, who looked bright in possession but failed to put her stamp on the derby.

Jess Park (5/10):

Linked up well with Toone at times but was well marshalled by her former City team-mates. Struck the post with United's best chance of the game when she should've really hit the target.

Elisabeth Terland (3/10):

Given the nod in attack but hardly had a touch and was dominated in the air by Shaw for City's opener. Hauled off at half-time for Malard.

Leah Galton (5/10):

Still working her way back to full fitness and the rustiness showed, with her end product particularly poor. Hooked midway through the second half.

Melvine Malard (6/10):

On at half-time and looked far more of a threat than the ineffective Terland but ultimately the game was already over.

Fridolina Rolfo (5/10):

Bright on midway through the second half but it was game over by this point and she had little impact.

Hannah Blundell (5/10):

Brought on as United legs began to tire but couldn't help spark any sort of recovery.

Rachel Williams (5/10):

Introduced for Park but it was 3-0 and there was no way back.

Simi Awujo (N/A):

On for the final few minutes.

Marc Skinner (4/10):

Made the decision to switch things up after the midweek win over PSG and it backfired. Dropping Malard for Terland was the biggest call and it didn't go his way, with United now needing a minor miracle to get back in the WSL title picture.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Mic'd Up: The former UNC stalwart knows college soccer is as crazy as ever, and figuring out who might win the NCAA Tournament is a frightening prospect. 

College soccer is increasingly hard to predict. At least, that's what Kacey White thinks. This is a changing sport, full of competition, with more jeopardy than ever. Conference realignment has packed some of the biggest divisions in the U.S. The constant churn of players, movement into the pros, and alternative pathways have made the thing that was once the crux of American women's soccer just a little more chaotic.

White covers it for ESPN+. She also loves it. Players get better, she argues.

""Everything about this part of the game and development is about understanding competition and knowing that you have to bring your best every day. A lot of times, you'll see where, whether it's in youth soccer, college soccer, or professional soccer, if you don't have those moments to show resilience, or have those moments where there's adversity that sets in, you don't know how to deal with that,"" she tells GOAL. 

Never is that clearer than in the ACC. White's beloved UNC won the national championship last year. This season, a repeat would be a major upset. 

""There's always been a lot of parity, but it seems to get tighter and tighter every year. A team like North Carolina doesn't have a lot of numbers that they use in their substitutions, and they have a very young roster, so they finished just outside the top six [in the ACC],"" she adds. 

The next steps are trickier to figure out, too. The abolishment of the NWSL draft means players have a bit more freedom to move. Change is afoot at all levels. White thinks players just have more options.

""I just see it as different. I think there's not necessarily a waiting game now to go through the draft for players that may have accelerated growth and they would like to go to the professional game for whatever reason is personal to them. You just don't have to wait till that moment,"" she says. 

As for NCAA tournament predictions? Who knows. White is just here for the ride. She knows, after playing for UNC, representing the USWNT, and spending six years as a professional, that making any sort of projection is a fool's errand. Still, she's backing Stanford to win it all.

White talks the ACC, college drafts, conference realignment, and who might just win it all in the latest edition of Mic'd Up, a recurring feature in which GOAL taps into the perspective of analysts, announcers, and other pundits on the state of soccer in the U.S. and abroad. 

NOTE: This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.

GOAL: First of all, what has happened to UNC? They were convincing winners last year and are struggling this season...

WHITE: Well, I think it speaks to just the parity that's in the ACC. We've seen that for years, even 10-20 years ago, there's always been a lot of parity, but it seems to get tighter and tighter every year. A team like North Carolina doesn't have a lot of numbers that they use in their substitutions, and they have a very young roster, so they finished just outside the top six. But I think we have other teams like that, too. Wake Forest was in the finals last year with North Carolina, and they're in ninth place in the ACC. And for me, it's not so much a drop off of those schools. It just speaks to the incredibly competitive environment that the ACC has year in and year out, and there are such fine margins that separate teams.

GOAL: Has conference realignment shifted things? Is it more competitive now?

WHITE: I think it has, and especially when you look at the ACC, when you add Stanford and Cal into it, to programs that have always been at the top of the college game, and are very well thought of. Especially Stanford, having won titles, and you add that into the mix that already existed in the ACC, it becomes incredibly competitive. And we are seeing that in other conferences as well. But with a conference like this that tends to get many teams, sometimes double digit teams, into the NCAA tournament, you've now added two more to the mix, and it just really muddies the water, but in a great way.

GOAL: So you vouch for chaos? The more hectic, the better?

WHITE: I do. I believe everything about this part of the game and development is about understanding competition and knowing that you have to bring your best every day. A lot of times, you'll see where, whether it's in youth soccer, college soccer, or professional soccer, if you don't have those moments to show resilience, or have those moments where there's adversity that sets in, you don't know how to deal with that. And so I think, for these conferences getting stronger, that they're able to face each other earlier, and it prepares them for down the road, not only from a program perspective, but individual players, too. 

GOAL: We've seen a lot of change in women's college soccer over the last few years. Would you say that the pipeline to pro is easier? Is it more difficult? Because obviously, you don't have a draft anymore, how do you see that as a changing landscape?

WHITE: I just see it as different. I think there's not necessarily a waiting game now to go through the draft for players that may have accelerated growth and they would like to go to the professional game for whatever reason is personal to them. You just don't have to wait till that moment. But I just think it's different. I don't think it's necessarily a better or worse thing, just a different landscape that players are now navigating.

GOAL: So was the draft maybe holding players back a little, by extension?

WHITE: I don't know if I can necessarily put a direct answer to that, because it's such an individual decision. You can't necessarily make a universal statement that affects all players on whether the draft is better or not, or whether it not being there has done that. I think it's just very personal.

GOAL: To round it off, give me your college cup picks. And then, if you had to tentatively say, ""I don't know, but I'd vouch for *insert team"", who are you going with? 

WHITE: Okay, so let's go with this. I do believe that the ACC will have a minimum of two teams in the College Cup. We saw four teams last year. I do think the ACC will get two in. And I will say this, not because it's at the forefront of my mind, but the way that Stanford played in the first half of the ACC semifinal, I didn't think any team could stop them. But if I had to say right now, I would say, of all the games that I've seen and what I've watched this season, I would go with Stanford.

GOAL: So, at least two ACC teams and Stanford to win it?

WHITE: That gives you a little bit of wiggle room!

Nick Woltemade spoke with confidence after bagging both goals in Germany's 2-0 win over Luxembourg. The towering striker saved Die Mannschaft's blushes after a goalless first half against the international minnows. His manager Julian Nagelsmann praised his first choice goal scorer's work ethic, saying the 23-year-old deserved ""special praise"" after his tireless performance. 

Woltemade's emergence has been a lone bright spark in a labouring World Cup qualification campaign for Die Mannschaft. A 2-0 loss to Slovakia in September has locked both sides in a fierce race for top spot in Group A. A goalless first half in Luxembourg would have given the initiative back to Slovakia after their win against Northern Ireland. 

However, the towering forward's brace nudged Germany top of the group on goal difference ahead of Slovakia's visit to Leipzig on Monday. The Newcastle striker opened the scoring when he stabbed home a Leroy Sane cross in the 49th minute, before sweeping home Ridle Baku's assist twenty minutes later. 

Despite his side's nerviness, Woltemade insisted that he remains confident in his abilities to conjure up a goal, even when he is peripheral in the game or his teammates are providing him with limited service. 

Speaking after the game, Woltemade said: ""I've developed great confidence in my abilities and a really good feeling that I know: no matter how the game goes, I can still score a goal."" 

He did admit that he was ""served very well,"" for both of his goals, however. 

The 23-year-old said he was ""very happy"" to score vital goals for his national team. ""It feels good to score goals, and these two were very important,"" he added. 

So sure of his talents was the ex-Werder Bremen star, that he coolly rebuffed questions about his competition as Germany's main man up front. When asked if he was worried about the return of injured forward options such as Kai Havertz, Niclas Fullkrug or Tim Kleindienst, he replied, ""no honestly, not really."" This success thus far has Woltemade looking forward to next summer's World Cup. He added: ""This is the biggest tournament in the world, a dream for everyone to play in. ""That would be number one.""

Woltemade also told the assorted press, that he intended to give his match worn shirt to his sister. ""My sister already wrote to me that she's really keen on the long-sleeved jersey,"" said the match winner. ""That's probably why I'm going to Bremen.""

Nagelsmann was effusive in his praise of his young striker after the game, praising Woltemade's tireless efforts and admitting he is going to be a key player for the national team as Germany continue to prepare for the World Cup.

""Nick deserves special praise for his work ethic,"" said the 38-year-old. ""He covered a tremendous amount of ground, he's really good and important for us."" 

While Nagelsmann clearly does not rate his striker purely by his goal scoring efforts, it certainly helps that the 23-year-old has started scoring vital goals for Die Mannschaft. 

The German national team has failed to replace Miroslav Klose since he retired after the 2014 World Cup. A slew of striking options have tried and failed to nail down that no.9 spot, with previous managers opting to deploy an extra midfielder or a makeshift option like Havertz to lead the line. 

Having bagged three crucial goals in his last two appearances, including the winner in a laborious 1-0 win over Northern Ireland in October, Woltemade is establishing himself as the saviour of a national side that disappointed at recent tournaments. His confidence in his won abilities will only help the Newcastle star as he progresses in his international career. 

He has another chance to prove himself in Leipzig on Monday, when Germany face off against Slovakia. A draw will be enough for Die Mannschaft to secure automatic qualification to next summer's World Cup, as they lead Group A on goal difference.

Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor has revealed that Hannah Hampton could miss the rest of 2025 with a quad injury, potentially ruling her out of the Lionesses upcoming friendlies against China and Ghana later this month. The renowned shot stopper missed Chelsea's 6-0 win over St. Polten in the Women's Champions League, after picking up the injury during the Blues 1-1 draw with Arsenal last Saturday.

Bompastor confirmed that Hampton will miss the next few weeks of action at the very least, ruling her out of key fixtures for both club and country. The 24-year-old completed her side's draw with rivals Arsenal despite the ailment, but was ruled out of their midweek demolition of the Austrian champions. 

Chelsea travel to Liverpool tomorrow in the Women's Super League, before hosting Barcelona in the Women's Champions League on November 20. The inaugural winner of the Women's Yashin Trophy would have been a nailed on starter for Sarina Weigman's side in the upcoming international window as the European champions work towards the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil. 

Hampton was also absent from England duty last month with an elbow injury. She was replaced by Manchester City keeper Khiara Keating, who conceded twice in the first 20 minutes of her debut against Brazil. The Lionesses eventually fell to a 2-1 defeat to the Selecao. 

In her pre-match press conference ahead of the Liverpool clash, Bompastor said: ""Hannah won't be here. She picked up a quad injury.

""She will be out for a few weeks. We'll see if we see her before the end of the year but I'm not sure.""

When the French manager was asked if that would rule the 24-year-old out of international duty, she simply replied: ""It could be the case, yes.""

Hampton's extended absence opens the door for Livia Peng to show her potential in the Chelsea goal. The Swiss stopper joined the Blues in the summer following an impressive two year spell with Werder Bremen. She was named to Kicker's team of the season in 2024-25, as she kept seven clean sheets in 21 league games. The 23-year-old has cemented her spot as Switzerland's no. 1, starting all four of her country's during this summer's European Championship as the host nation was knocked out at the quarter final stage by eventual finalists Spain. She made her club debut in Chelsea's dominant win over St. Polten earlier this week. 

City's Keating will also have the opportunity to stake her claim to be Hampton's clear backup at the very least. The 21-year-old has gone from strength-to-strength since supplanting Ellie Roebuck as the City No.1 during the 2023-24 season. She would go on to win the WSL Golden Globe at the end of that campaign, making her the youngest player to pick up the award. Keating has been in impressive form again this term, keeping nine clean sheets in all competitions. 

After last season's resounding successes: winning the Euros, picking up the award for the best female goalkeeper in the game and winning the WSL for the second time, the start of the 2025/26 season has been a tough ride for Hampton. 

The protracted fallout from Mary Earps autobiography, in which the former Sports Personality of the Year accused her understudy of being ""disruptive and unreliable"" has been an unwelcome distraction. Hampton presumably would have hoped to move on from that saga by letting her play do the talking, especially with the Three Lions on her chest. While she has been in impressive form for her club, conceding just four goals in eight league appearances this term, missing her second international window in succession with injury, is a cruel blow. Hopefully, she can recover before the end of 2025. The league phase of Chelsea's Women's Champions League campaign concludes with ties against Roma and Wolfsburg in December.

After a dramatic round-robin stage at the Nitto ATP Finals, the knockout stage begins Saturday with semi-final action in Turin.

Carlos Alcaraz clinched ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours by going 3-0 in group play, but he needs two more wins to secure a perfect end to a career-best season. His next hurdle will be Felix Auger-Aliassime, who beat Alexander Zverev in what was a win-or-go-home group finale for both men.

Jannik Sinner needed Alcaraz to stumble in Turin to have a chance to finish the year at No. 1, but his Nitto ATP Finals title defence remains firmly in his own hands. After his own 3-0 group campaign, the Italian home favourite will face Alex de Minaur in the semis.

In doubles action, top seeds Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool take on Neal Skupski and Joe Salisbury in an all-British matchup, while Italians Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori meet Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten.

[1] Carlos Alcaraz (ESP) vs. [8] Felix Auger-Aliassime (CAN)
With his World No. 1 mission already accomplished this week in Turin, Alcaraz can now turn his full attention to his bid for a maiden Nitto ATP Finals title. By reaching the semis, the Spaniard has matched his deepest previous Turin run, from his 2023 debut — though he went 2-1 in group play that year.

While Alcaraz's place in the knockout rounds was secured before his 6-4, 6-1 win Thursday against Musetti, that matchup carried enormous pressure: If the top seed lost, he would have faced a semi-final showdown against Sinner, with his position atop the PIF ATP Rankings under threat.

“It means the world to me, to be honest. The year-end No. 1 is always a goal,” said Alcaraz, who admitted to feeling nerves in the high-stakes match. 

After the round-robin drama and all the intricacies of the battle for ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours, the task ahead for Alcaraz is now straightforward: win two knockout matches to claim his ninth tour-level title of the year. His previous high in a season was six in 2023.

The Spaniard will seek his fifth straight Lexus ATP Head2Head win against Auger-Aliassime to earn a spot in his first Turin final. After losing their first three meetings from 2021-22, Alcaraz won all nine sets he played against the Canadian across 2023 (one match) and 2024 (three matches). Their Saturday showdown will be their first encounter this season.

Auger-Aliassime played what effectively amounted to a quarter-final against Zverev on Friday. Making his second Nitto ATP Finals appearance, the Canadian advanced to the semis for the first time with a 6-4, 7-6(4) result — his 50th win of the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. After losing his first three sets of the week — two against Sinner and the opener against Ben Shelton — the 25-year-old rattled off four consecutive sets to extend his stay in Turin.

“This is a high-value tournament for players,” said Auger-Aliassime, who moved up to No. 5 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings with his two wins. Three years after reaching a career high of No. 6 in November 2022, the Canadian will make his Top 5 debut if he matches or betters De Minaur's result in Turin.

He could rise as high as No. 4 with the title, but his full focus Saturday will be on spoiling the trophy hopes of World No. 1 Alcaraz.

""[The Nitto ATP Finals] is like a grand finale and when you have a look at the list of champions, there have been many No. 1s. You want to be in the final, but I'll have to go through a great player to do that. I will take my chance if I have it.""

The first all-British pair to claim Year-End ATP Doubles No. 1 presented by PIF honours, Cash and Glasspool booked their semi-final place with a 6-3, 7-5 victory against Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos in a win-and-advance showdown Thursday. That victory also ensured there will be an all-British finalist: They will meet countrymen Salisbury and Skupski, winners of the John McEnroe Group and both former No. 1s in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings, for a place in the trophy round. Both pairs are seeking the perfect end to their first full season as a team.

The opposite semi-final will see home favourites Bolelli and Vavassori take on Heliovaara and Patten, who advanced with a 7-6(5), 6-2 victory in their own must-win match against Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic on Friday. Both teams are competing at the Nitto ATP Finals for the second consecutive year, with Heliovaara and Patten reaching the semi-finals last season.

While Sinner's semi-final place was secured after his second victory, De Minaur faced a nervous wait Thursday after his 7-6(3), 6-3 win against Taylor Fritz. Alcaraz's evening triumph against Musetti ultimately sent the Aussie through; if Musetti won, he would have advanced.

De Minaur's victory — and Alcaraz's subsequent favour — was the perfect tonic after the seventh seed's brutal defeat to Musetti two days prior. The Aussie led 5-3 in the final set but lost the last four games against the home favourite to drop to 0-2 on the week. His win against Fritz was his first victory in two Turin appearances, following his debut last year.

""I have dealt with a fair bit of heartbreak recently, so it was good to finally get a win here in Turin,"" De Minaur said after earning his first Top 10 win of the season outside team events. ""I have worked really hard so it was good to get some positive feedback or a positive reward for the hard work, so I am very happy with the performance.""

Even Sinner said he was happy for the Aussie, speaking after he wrapped his group campaign Friday with a scrappy 6-3, 7-6(3) win against Ben Shelton: ""When you have these kinds of losses, it's tough. So props to him to come back with an incredible performance against Taylor,"" said the Italian. ""I have to be very careful [in our match], because he doesn't have a lot to lose... I have a lot to lose.""



While both players enter the semi-finals on the back of a win, Sinner could find extra motivation in his fresh hunt for World No. 1. The Italian spoke of his excitement to ""chase"" Alcaraz after the Spaniard dethroned him from the top spot in the PIF ATP Rankings by beating him in the US Open final. Eight weeks later, Sinner regained the top spot — though his stint lasted just a single week.

The 24-year-old may no longer be World No. 1, but he has played like it in Turin. For the second straight year, he advanced through the group stage without losing a set. The defending champion has now won eight consecutive matches and 16 consecutive sets in Turin, having won the 2024 title without dropping a set.

""When you come here and win all three round-robin matches, you have to play at a very high level, which I've done,"" Sinner said. ""Serving very well in important moments has brought me to this point."" The home favourite has saved all eight break points against him in the tournament, seven against Zverev and one against Shelton. 

De Minaur broke serve twice in each of his group matches, including against Alcaraz in his opener. Next he will try to break his duck against Sinner by earning his first Lexus ATP Head2Head win in the pair's 13th match.

Their first meeting came at the 2019 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. After three previous matchups this season, including in the Australian Open quarter-finals, the pair will now meet at the Nitto ATP Finals for the second straight year.

 Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten banished some year-old Nitto ATP Finals heartache in style on Saturday afternoon in Turin. 

 One year on from suffering a semi-final exit on debut at the prestigious season finale, Heliovaara and Patten this time marched to a 6-4, 6-3 last-four victory against Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori. The Finnish-British duo produced a stunning all-around display to overwhelm their Italian opponents and nullify the partisan atmosphere inside Inalpi Arena.

 “We had to dig deep yesterday, but we were ready for this semi-final,” said Heliovaara. “I think we really enjoyed being out on court. We had more experience, and we just executed exactly what we wanted to do today.” 

 Patten advancing to the championship match continued Great Britain's dominance in the doubles competition at this year's Nitto ATP Finals. He and Heliovaara will on Sunday take on an all-British duo in the championship match: Top seeds and Year-End ATP Doubles No. 1 presented by PIF-winning team Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, or Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski. 

 Heliovaara and Patten converted the only break point of the opening set at 1-1, 30/40 to move ahead in Saturday's semi-final, while they also decisively broke serve in the third game of the second. Patten, who started the week in Turin by getting engaged to his partner Ellie Stone, served a double fault at 3-2, 40/30 to gift Bolelli and Vavassori a chance to break at Deuce deciding point, but he followed that with a nerveless lefty serve out wide to clinch the game.

 That proved to be the final moment of peril for Heliovaara and Patten on serve, and the pair soon closed out for a 76-minute victory in which they finished the match having won 87 per cent (20/23) of points behind first serves, according to Infosys ATP Stats. They now hold a 3-1 Lexus ATP Head2Head series lead over Bolelli and Vavassori, having also prevailed in the two teams' Australian Open semi-final clash earlier this year. 

 “Lots of practice. There's no secret really,” said Patten, when asked about he and Heliovaara's returning performance. “They are two very good servers. We've struggled returning against them in the past. Sometimes you get a bit lucky as well. No secret, just lots of hard work and lots of repetitions, really.” 

 The 36-year-old Heliovaara and 29-year-old Patten will on Sunday play for their eighth tour-level title as a team, and their second indoor title of the year after they lifted the Rolex Paris Masters title earlier this month.

Defending champion Jannik Sinner powered to the Nitto ATP Finals championship match for the third consecutive year on Saturday, when he dispatched Alex de Minaur 7-5, 6-2 to maintain his perfect record against the Australian.

Sinner did not drop a set or his serve throughout the round-robin stage and once again dominated in front of his vocal home support in Turin. The Italian remained patient in the first set, converting on his eighth break point to gain the advantage. The 24-year-old then overwhelmed the resilient De Minaur with his intensity and clean ball striking in the second set to become the youngest player since Lleyton Hewitt in 2004 to reach three finals at the prestigious year-end event.

“First of all, I am very happy,” Sinner said. “It is the last event of the year and it is great to finish in this way. It was a very tough match, especially at the beginning of the first set. I felt like he was serving great, very precise. In the second set, I broke very early and then my level rose.

""I tried to be a bit more aggressive and it worked well but it was a tough match. But making the final for three consecutive years means a lot to me. It is a great atmosphere for me to play tennis and a great place for me to close this beautiful season. Tomorrow I will enjoy and try my best to get the best possible result.”



Sinner has won his past 30 indoor matches, with his last defeat coming against Novak Djokovic in the championship match in northern Italy two years ago. He has since captured indoor titles in Rotterdam, Turin, Vienna and Paris, while he helped guide Italy to Davis Cup glory on two occasions.

The second seed will aim to add to his growing trophy cabinet when he meets Carlos Alcaraz or Felix Auger-Aliassime in the title match on Sunday. Alcaraz, who is chasing his first trophy at the year-end event, secured ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours by going 3-0 in the round-robin stage this week, ending Sinner's quest.

Sinner now leads De Minaur 13-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, having beaten the 26-year-old en route to titles at the Australian Open, Beijing and Vienna this season.

Inside a packed Inalpi Arena, De Minaur briefly silenced the 13,000-strong home crowd when he surged to 0/40 in Sinner's opening service game. But when he failed to convert, the Italian steadied and never looked back. From that moment on, the World No. 2 bided his time, probing for openings.
De Minaur dug deep, covering every inch of the court and fending off seven break points to keep pace. But at 5-5, Sinner finally pierced his opponent's defence, ripping a backhand winner down the line to break. The Italian, who won 59 cent of points on De Minaur's second serve in the set, closed out on serve to lead.
Sinner then cemented his control at the start of the second set when he broke the Australian's serve twice. The Italian, who struck 32 winners and made 75 per cent of his first serves in the match, timed the ball cleanly and was locked in a comfortable rhythm to triumph after one hour and 52 minutes.
For De Minaur, the defeat bookends an otherwise standout year. The Australian finishes with a 56-24 record, his first season surpassing the 50-win mark, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. De Minaur's lone title of 2025 came at the ATP 500 event in Washington.
Did You Know?
Sinner joins Djokovic in 2018 as the only men to reach the championship match at the Nitto ATP Finals without dropping serve since ATP Tour began recording serve statistics in 1991. The Italian has held all 40 of his service games this week.

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

It's nearly time for Audi to take their bow in F1, as Lawrence Barretto reports from Munich.

We've known Audi were heading for Formula 1 in 2026 for around three years. But it wasn't until Wednesday, when they hosted a dazzling launch event in Munich to unveil the colours and design that will adorn their first F1 car, that it felt like the German manufacturer had really arrived.

Audi have enjoyed immense success across various motorsport categories, from endurance racing and the famous Le Mans 24 Hours to rallying and touring cars.

That success was on show at this event, with the likes of CEO Gernot Dollner, Head of Audi F1 project Mattia Binotto and Team Principal Jonathan Wheatley, plus their drivers Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto and F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali arriving in a selection of vintage machinery that has won Audi so much silverware over the years.

""This feels like a very significant moment on our journey,"" says Wheatley when we speak on the red carpet at the event. ""To see all the cars – it's like Audi have opened up the toy box and got all of the cars out here tonight. I had a spin in a Quattro Sport, which is one of my favourite cars, round to the event just now. It all feels real, it feels like it's happening.""

Audi are proud of what they've achieved in motor racing so far. They've dipped their toe in, invested heavily in technology and design and then ultimately won. Taking on the challenge of Formula 1 is the natural next step. And while reaching the top step won't be the work of the moment – they intend to find a way to get there before the end of the decade.

""We have got our plans, we know our competitors are strong, but we are here to try to do well,"" Binotto tells me. ""We are aiming to win a championship by 2030. That's our ambition, our goal, our objective.""

That's five years for Audi to turn a Sauber squad who are fighting in the thick of the midfield and have only previously won one race in their various iterations, but have made progress this year under the leadership of Binotto and Wheatley into an operation that can fight the likes of McLaren, Red Bull, Mercedes and Ferrari for race wins – and the championship.

That target shows that the board understand and respect the challenge F1 presents but also shows Audi's big ambitions, as five years isn't very long in F1.

They are ploughing huge amounts of resource into their power unit base in Neuberg, Germany, where the first Audi power unit is coming to life. They are looking to develop Hinwil, which has been Sauber's home since they entered F1 in 1993 and from next year will be responsible for churning out the first Audi F1 car. And they will ultimately want a return on that investment.

For next year, though, they are being pragmatic. No one knows what the pecking order will look like given the sweeping new rules that will see very different chassis – which will feature active aero – and brand-new power units that put a greater focus on battery power and which will run advanced sustainable fuel.

""[The Audi board have given us a] very realistic set of targets,"" says Wheatley. ""They understand the journey we are on, they have been incredibly understanding of how long that may take, the stages along the way, the fact everything needs to be in place, get bigger then consolidate your position for a while, get bigger again and then consolidate.

""So, our target really is to keep building on this momentum, which we started this year. We need to carry that through – and that will make us championship challengers at the end of the decade.""

With their motorsport heritage taking centre stage to open the event, it was then the turn of the R26 Concept car to break cover, donning the colour scheme that will coat their new F1 machines. The Audi red, black and titanium and straight, clean lines, was very Audi. That they conducted extensive research of how the colours will look on TV during the broadcast shows every detail matters to the German firm.

""It's about releasing something really unique,"" says Wheatley. ""If you look at an F1 car in five years, you'll say that's an Audi, in 10 years' time, you'll say that's an Audi. It's about setting a design ethos that will just carry through.""

Underneath the paintjob, but away from prying eyes (as the livery was unveiled on a concept show car) in Hinwil, the first Audi F1 car is coming together. ""It's looking great as a car,"" says Binotto. ""I am enjoying the new regulations, I'm enjoying the challenge from an engineering point of view.

""The entire team at Hinwil and Neuberg are excited, it'll be very special for us in a few weeks' time when we fire up the car – and then later on we will hit the track very soon. Next year, when we are in Melbourne, it'll be a special moment for all of us. The dream is coming close.""

Binotto has an immense amount of experience in Formula 1, with a large chunk of that centred around the power unit, having headed up that division for a period during his long stint at Ferrari. He of all people knows how big a challenge it is for Audi to not only get a power unit ready in a reasonably short amount of time but to do so having never built a Formula 1 engine that has hit the track.

""The challenge is big,"" he says. ""The power unit is a complex and difficult matter. The development of the power unit takes time, it takes longer than the chassis and aero. The team started years ago to develop the power unit and it's running well on the dyno. But for us it will be a long journey, and there will be much we need to learn, but we are all excited.

""On the dyno, we are running through reliability at the moment, ensuring reliability will be alright for the start of the season. There are some tense moments in Neuberg – but that's the challenge.""

He adds: ""I think the power unit challenge is difficult, but to become World Champion, to become the best car on track, all the challenges are tricky. I don't think you can select one or the other being the most difficult. But for a new manufacturer, certainly it's not easy.""

Exciting times ahead, then, for Audi. The German automotive are taking their entry into F1 very seriously – and they want to beat the very best. Based on their approach so far, they've got off to a strong start.

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

F1.com flicks through the archives to relive a selection of special pit lane performances in years gone by.

Max Verstappen added another legendary drive to his CV at last weekend's Sao Paulo Grand Prix when the reigning four-time World Champion rose from the pits to the podium. But who else has impressed with standout pit lane showings over the years? F1.com picks out a few examples…

Early on in what would become a close fight for the 1984 title between McLaren team mates Niki Lauda and Alain Prost, the South African Grand Prix yielded the squad's first 1-2 finish of the season via a significant dose of drama.

After qualifying fifth, Prost's car could not be fired up due to technical trouble and meant he was forced to start from the pits in the spare, which would have gone to Lauda had it not been for a delay brought on by a rival crashing heavily in the warm-up (which allowed mechanics to fix the Austrian's own engine woes).

When the race eventually got under way, Lauda cycled to the front of the pack from P8 on the grid and cruised to victory by more than a minute, but it was pit lane starter Prost who impressively emerged as the runner-up with a tenacious drive.

A few years later, Prost and new McLaren team mate Ayrton Senna had just led the way into the first corner of the French Grand Prix when Leyton House driver Mauricio Gugelmin steamrolled Williams' Thierry Boutsen and Ferrari pair Gerhard Berger and Nigel Mansell.

Mansell took the restart from the pit lane and set about making up lost ground, using Paul Ricard's long straights and mixture of braking zones to pick off plenty of cars, while also benefitting from various retirements – including for
Senna and team mate Berger.

Mansell ultimately took the chequered flag in second position, 44 seconds behind winner Prost, marking a fine way to bounce back after he had been disqualified from the previous race in Canada due to a start procedure breach.

It was a tricky start to the 2003 season-opening Australian Grand Prix for Kimi Raikkonen, who crashed heavily in practice, lost valuable track time as a result, and was subsequently forced to use the spare McLaren car in Qualifying, which he ended back in 15th position.

However, with heavy rain arriving before the race, and the start taking place in mixed conditions, McLaren filled Raikkonen's car with fuel and started him from the pit lane, leading to one of the Finn's finest F1 drives.

Making overtake after overtake, Raikkonen soon found himself leading the race, which he might have converted into the win without a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane by just 1 km/h. In the end, he had to settle for a still very respectable third.

Michael Schumacher sparked controversy at the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix when he came to a halt at the Rascasse corner in the final moments of Qualifying, preventing championship rival Alonso from completing a final effort and overhauling him for pole position.

While Schumacher insisted it was a genuine mistake, many in the paddock questioned the move. When the stewards looked into the matter, the German's lap times were deleted and he was forced to start from the back, which then became the pit lane.

With that drama behind him, Schumacher focused on what would be a challenging recovery drive around Monte Carlo's tight, twisty streets, but the seven-time World Champion this time showed his best side to climb to fifth and salvage a couple of valuable points.

Markus Winkelhock only made one start as an F1 driver, but he still managed to leave his mark on the sport – the German racer brilliantly going from last to first in the opening minutes of a dramatic, rain-hit 2007 European Grand Prix around the Nurburgring.

Given the threat of a downpour, and having qualified almost a second-and-a-half slower than Spyker team mate Adrian Sutil, Winkelhock peeled into the pit lane at the end of the formation lap to bolt on wet tyres, while the rest of the field lined up on the grid.

It proved to be a masterstroke when the rain arrived and sent slick-shod cars sliding off the track, with Winkelhock driving through it all to take the lead before red flags were thrown. While he lost the lead at the restart and later retired due to a hydraulics issue, it was a memorable backmarker display.

All-new regulations led to a pecking order shake-up in 2009, with Brawn GP emerging as the surprise package following Honda's withdrawal from F1 and a host of other teams scrapping to be the ‘best of the rest' behind them.

Toyota were one of those outfits, but Jarno Trulli and team mate Timo Glock suffered an early setback when they were excluded from Qualifying at the Australian Grand Prix opener due to rear wing breaches – turning their P8 and P6 grid slots into pit lane starts.

Both drivers came back fighting on race day, though, overtaking plenty of rivals and benefitting from several incidents – which included a late clash between BMW Sauber's Robert Kubica and Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel – to reach the top-five places.

Trulli, who had crossed the line third, was initially hit with a penalty for passing Lewis Hamilton under a Safety Car, only for that decision to be reversed when it was deemed the McLaren man had misled the stewards post-race.

Hamilton was locked in a fierce title fight with Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg midway through the 2014 season, and his efforts were dealt a blow when his car caught fire in Qualifying at the Hungaroring before he had a chance to post a lap time.

That meant a pit lane start for the Briton, who then spun into the Turn 2 barriers on the first lap with cold tyres and brakes, damaging his front wing and leaving him with an even bigger damage limitation exercise for the rest of the afternoon.

An incident-filled race flipped the script once more, however, with Rosberg particularly hurt by the timing of an early Safety Car, helping Hamilton (on an alternate strategy) to close in and slot ahead – via some team orders drama and tense wheel-to-wheel moments.

Hungary was the scene of another chaotic race in 2021, starting when Valtteri Bottas triggered a multi-car crash at Turn 1 in wet conditions, along with more wheel-banging further down the order – leaving Race Control with no option but to red flag proceedings.

A bizarre sight followed at the restart when Hamilton was the only driver to line up on the grid on intermediate tyres, while the remaining drivers pitted to fit slicks, among them Alpine's Esteban Ocon, who had started eighth and taken advantage of the first-lap incidents.

Ocon found himself in P1 when Hamilton boxed for slicks, a lead the Frenchman would not relinquish as the race developed – despite sustained pressure from Aston Martin man Vettel (who was later disqualified over a fuel sample breach).

Towards the end of a highly competitive 2012 season, which saw seven different drivers take victory at the first seven rounds, Vettel put himself in control of the championship battle with an imperious run of four successive wins.

However, with just three rounds to go in Abu Dhabi, the German was dramatically excluded from Qualifying when officials were unable to take a fuel sample from his Red Bull post-session, forcing him to start from the pit lane while title rival Fernando Alonso lined up sixth.

The action did not stop on race day, with Vettel picking up front wing damage early on but recovering to pull off a series of overtakes and charge through the field – the last being a bold move on Jenson Button to reach the podium.

Verstappen wowed the rain-soaked crowds at Interlagos in 2024 when he somehow turned 17th on the grid into victory – the Dutchman sailing past his rivals in torrential conditions and finishing almost 20 seconds clear of second place.

Fast forward 12 months and, after a dreadful Qualifying session that saw him drop out in Q1 for the first time since the 2021 season, he was forced into another comeback drive, albeit this time without the ‘help' of any wet weather.

With a new power unit in the back of his Red Bull, which also underwent some set-up changes, Verstappen put on another charge for the ages that turned a pit lane start into a scarcely believable third, even after an early puncture.

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

How the 2025 season in F1 ACADEMY unfolded with just days to go until the season finale in Las Vegas.

The F1 Drivers' Championship isn't the only title still on the line, as the fight to be crowned the 2025 F1 ACADEMY Champion is set to go right down to the wire in a showstopping Las Vegas season finale.

Mercedes' Doriane Pin and Ferrari's Maya Weug are separated by only nine points, leaving the title contenders to face a final race shootout that could go either way.

With just under a week to go, we take a look back at how the fight for the title has unfolded from the season opener in Shanghai to the most recent battles on the streets of Singapore.

After claiming the final win of the 2024 campaign, Weug showed why she was one of the favourites for the new season, claiming pole position, nearly half a second clear of Pin.

Lining up eighth for the reverse grid Race 1, both made gains but only Weug walked away with a podium in P3. Red Bull Racing's Alisha Palmowski would lead home a Campos Racing 1-2 ahead of Chambers after inheriting the lead from fellow rookie Nina Gademan, who retired on the penultimate lap with a technical issue.

Pin was the braver of the duo in Race 2 as an overly cautious approach from Weug on the rolling start backfired. After getting past on the opening lap, the French racer held firm despite a Safety Car restart to leave China with a five-point lead over Weug, with Chambers finishing third on track and in the Drivers' standings.

The standings order reversed in Qualifying around the Jeddah Corniche Circuit, with Chambers taking pole by over two-tenths to Pin and Weug was almost a further three-tenths off in third.

Race 1 saw Ella Lloyd emerged triumphant in a drag race to the line with Weug, who once again came through the pack and overtook Palmowski on the penultimate lap for P2. The Ferrari driver got the better of front-row starter Pin off the line, before going wheel-to-wheel with Chambers. Their back-and-forth battle for the lead ended after Chambers was handed a five-second penalty for forcing Weug off the track.

Despite the Red Bull Ford driver's best efforts to extend the gap out front, she was relegated to third at the chequered flag behind Pin, leaving Weug to claim the win and a seven-point advantage in the standings.

A downpour turned Qualifying into a one-lap sprint from the pit lane and it was Chambers who capitalised, taking pole ahead of teammate Palmowski and Pin – with less than seven-hundredths separating the top four. Stuck in traffic on her only lap, Weug found herself languishing in P10.

Unable to achieve a podium in the previous reverse grid races, Pin made up for it in Race 1. A strong opening lap put her on the rear of polesitter Emma Felbermayr and she eventually got the move done to lead Palmowski and Chambers to the chequered flag, with Weug missing out on a podium in fourth.

Sunday proved to be a washout for F1 ACADEMY as Race 2 was postponed due to inclement weather, leaving Weug clinging on to the top of the standings by a point.

The title fight took a dramatic turn on the series' debut in Canada. A dominant display in Qualifying saw Chambers seal her third consecutive pole ahead of Palmowski and Pin. However, Weug's weekend went on a swift downturn after an electrical issue in practice remained unresolved, leaving the dejected Dutch racer down in P15.

After Qualifying first in Miami, Chambers lined up on pole for the first of three races at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve. But it was Pin with the best seat in the house as she watched Chambers and Palmowski collide on Lap 2, leaving the door open for her to take home the win, whilst rival Weug retired early. Lloyd finished in P2 ahead Gademan, with the Alpine driver elevated to her first podium after Felbermayr was disqualified for being below the minimum weight.

Felbermayr bounced back that afternoon in Race 2, seizing her first victory in an epic last lap three-way fight, overtaking Gademan with a handful of corners to spare. Lloyd gave Rodin Motorsport their first 1-2 finish in F1 ACADEMY in second ahead of Gademan. Pin claimed fourth and Weug was left empty-handed in ninth.

Chambers led from lights-to-flag to take her first win of the year in Race 3, promoting her to become Pin's nearest title rival in second. Pin narrowly avoided damage on the opening lap after driving straight into the path of a spinning Palmowski, following contact between the Red Bull Racing driver and fellow Briton Lloyd, and receiving a knock to her front wing.

Surviving the early drama, Lloyd scored her third consecutive P2 finish ahead of Pin. A third Safety Car appearance to end the weekend denied Weug a chance to climb any higher than P6. This left Pin as the new standings leader by 20 points to Chambers, demoting Weug to third, 37 points adrift.

Knowing she had to be perfect from here on out if she hoped to keep her title hopes alive, Weug's home event heralded a welcome change in her fortunes. A tight battle for pole saw her out-qualify Palmowski by 0.039s, with rivals Chambers and Pin forced to settle for fourth and fifth.

The ‘Orange Army' were already celebrating on Saturday as home hero Gademan delivered an emotional maiden win in Race 1 — having been cleared to race after being declared unfit to drive in Free Practice 2 the previous day.

Williams' Lia Block stood on the podium for the first time in F1 ACADEMY in second, keeping out of the clutches of a charging Weug. A scrappy race for Pin saw her finish behind Lloyd and Chambers in sixth, her lowest result of the season so far.

For Chambers, Race 2 was over before it began as the Red Bull Ford driver was forced to retire on the formation lap due to a technical problem.

Out front, Weug was untouchable, with her 7.3s winning margin the second-largest in the series' history. Palmowski and Pin completed the podium, each being promoted up one place after Lloyd was handed a five-second penalty for a false start.

Pin maintained her 20-point lead heading into the penultimate round, with Weug's silverware-laden weekend allowing her to regain the P2 spot from Chambers.

There was a nervous wait for Weug at the end of Qualifying in Singapore as Pin reached the chequered flag in time for one final lap. But the Mercedes junior's efforts were only good enough for second, leaving her rival to take pole by 0.042s.

Block's long-awaited first win finally arrived, as the American held her nerve from reverse grid pole in Race 1 to become the eighth different winner in 2025. An overtaking masterclass around the Marina Bay Street Circuit saw Weug go from eighth to second ahead of Chambers, whilst Pin struggled to make the same inroads in P5.

However, Pin got the better of Weug off the line in Race 2 and looked to be on course for the win. But with six laps remaining, the threat of rain materialised. Both PREMA Racing and MP Motorsport debated pitting their drivers, but both gambled on staying out on slicks.

Holding track position, Pin controlled the restart but Weug had nothing to lose. Gambling on an audacious move on the final lap, the Ferrari junior wrestled the victory away from her disappointed rival. Lloyd's third-place finish moved her up to third in the standings ahead of Chambers, who pitted from fourth and fell out of the title race in 11th.

Left with a nine-point gap between them and tied on three wins apiece, Pin and Weug will have to put together the drives of their lives if they hope to overcome the other and become the third F1 ACADEMY Champion.

A prehistoric adventure about a Cro-Magnon girl adopted by a family of Neanderthals, the film might never have made it to the big screen if it were not for Mark Damon's Producers Sales Organization aggressively walking the halls of the American Film Market in the '80s.

	The film adaptation of Jean M. Auel's novel The Clan of the Cave Bear might never have made it to the big screen if it were not for Mark Damon's Producers Sales Organization aggressively walking the halls of the American Film Market in the '80s, finding foreign buyers for big-name film packages. 


	Producers Gerald Isenberg and Stan Rogow, having optioned the book — a prehistoric adventure about a Cro-Magnon girl adopted by a family of Neanderthals — tried to interest NBC in a movie-of-the-week to no avail. But then PSO, which Damon co-founded, entered the picture, selling off rights to raise financing for the $16 million project, which was shot in British Columbia.

	Daryl Hannah, fresh off her starring role in Splash, was cast as Ayla — images of her in revealing animal furs no doubt proved catnip to AFM buyers. In a prerelease interview with John Hanrahan, she described the grueling shoot. “Logistically, it was difficult,” she said. “There were helicopters, you had to hike, live in a tent. There was no warm water to shower in. It was difficult in that respect. But to me, I don't find that strenuous. It was more difficult because it was so hard to get the script right. It was a difficult book to translate into a film format because it was not in any language that can be readily understood.” Instead, the cast spoke in guttural sounds that were accompanied by subtitles.

	Michael Chapman, the famed cinematographer of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, took the directing reins, but while the finished film, released domestically by Warner Bros. in 1986, had some striking visuals, critics found the drama lacking. Two follow-up films were in the planning stage, but though Clan earned an Oscar nomination for its makeup, after it grossed less than $2 million in the U.S., the proposed trilogy was quietly shelved.

Wong Kar-wai had to rush to complete the film in time for its debut in May 2000 at the 53rd Cannes Film Festival, where it was an immediate sensation.


							By 

	Gregg Kilday


Freelance Contributor


	Over the years, plenty of forgettable movies have been hawked in the hallways of the American Film Market, but there have also been some indelible classics — among the most notable, Wong Kar-wai's swooningly seductive In the Mood for Love, which has consistently topped critics' polls as one of the best films of all time.


	Set in 1960s Hong Kong — though it was actually shot in neighboring Macau and Bangkok over the course of a year — the film stars Tony Leung as Mr. Chow and Maggie Cheung as Mrs. Chan, neighbors in a crowded and shadowy apartment building who gradually come to realize that their respective spouses are having an affair. They then fall into an impossible love with each other themselves.

	In setting the stage for the drama, Wong drew upon memories of his own childhood in Hong Kong, to which his family moved after emigrating from Shanghai. “We shared flats with strangers,” he recalled years later in an interview with the British Film Institute. “There was no such thing as privacy; your life was an open book that everyone read over your shoulder. Today, we barely know who lives next door. But in those days the walls were thin and the connections were thick. The characters in In the Mood for Love are inventions, but the world they move through came straight from my childhood memory.”

	Fortissimo Films acquired worldwide distribution rights to the $16 million project, produced by the filmmakers' own Block 2 Pictures and Paris-based Paradis Films. USA Films, a forerunner of today's Focus Features, picked up U.S. distribution. And Wong had to rush to complete the film in time for its debut in May 2000 at the 53rd Cannes Film Festival, where it was an immediate sensation and Leung took the best actor prize. The film would eventually gross more than $16 million worldwide while securing Wong's reputation as one of cinema's great sensualists.

Bringing legal action follows the U.K. broadcaster apologizing to the U.S. president for a doctored speech, but rejecting any compensation.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	U.S. President Donald Trump has confirmed he will bring a lawsuit against the BBC over an edited speech of his in a Panorama documentary.


	“We'll sue them. We'll sue them for anywhere between a billion and five billion dollars, probably sometime next week,” he told reporters on Air Force One on Friday night, according to White House audio of the press opportunity posted to YouTube.




	Trump was responding to a question from a British reporter over the BBC apologizing for the documentary edit in its Trump: A Second Chance? program, but rejecting any basis for compensation.

	“I have to do it. I mean, they've even admitted that they cheated. I mean, not that they couldn't have not done that. They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth. That's worse than what CBS did with Kamala,” Trump said.

	A BBC spokesperson on Thursday, in a statement, said “BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the program.”


	The U.K. broadcaster's statement added: “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”


	Trump, in his press encounter on Air Force One on Friday, said he would discuss the issue with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer this weekend, and asserted, “the people of the U.K. are very angry about what happened as you can imagine because it shows the BBC is fake news.”

	











	Earlier this week, BBC News CEO Deborah Turness and the corporation's director-general Tim Davie resigned after the BBC was found to have edited a Jan. 6, 2021, address where Trump, speaking before the attack on the Capitol in Washington, D.C., was made to appear as though he was “calling for violent action,” according to BBC chair Shah.


	This week's series of responses from the BBC were intended in part to respond to Trump's threat of a lawsuit against the U.K. broadcaster, much as he has done with U.S. news outlets in the U.S., including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.

	The Aussie rockers, who had been set for a triumphant hometown performance, redirected their entire AU$5,000 performance fee to seven local venues — a gesture that quickly grew into a AU$35,000 bar tab shared across some of the city's most beloved rooms.

	According to ABC Australia, the gig was halted after multiple breaches of the security barrier raised concerns about crowd safety. The Melbourne Arts Precinct Corporation said the decision “wasn't made lightly,” citing risks to the audience, staff, and the band. Fans watching the livestream were stunned as the plug was pulled just eight minutes before showtime.


	Rather than let the night end there, frontwoman Amy Taylor posted a video explaining the cancellation before announcing the band would give the money back to local venues that helped launch their career. 




	“Have a drink on us,” Taylor said in the video posted to social media over the weekend, which has since clocked more than 1 million views. “Just have some fun tonight.”


	Tabs were immediately placed at local haunts The Tote, The Curtin, The Old Bar, Labour in Vain, Hell's Kitchen, Last Chance Rock & Roll Bar, and Cherry Bar, where fans flocked from across the city after the news spread on social media. Several venues reported packed rooms, lines down the street, and tabs running dry within hours.


	The moment arrives during one of the biggest years of the band's career. Their 2024 album Cartoon Darkness debuted at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart and later landed in the U.K. top 10. It also collected major honors at the 2025 AIR Awards, including Independent Album of the Year and Best Independent Punk Album or EP. The band is up for multiple ARIA Awards this year — including Album of the Year and Best Group — marking a new peak in their national profile.


	Their international momentum has accelerated, too. Amyl and The Sniffers earned a Grammy nomination earlier in 2025 and are nominated at the Brit Awards for International Group of the Year. They also joined AC/DC for a run of Australian stadium dates in November, cementing a milestone for a band that cut its teeth in the same small rooms they helped support on Friday night.


	Friday's bar-tab blowout underscored the deep roots Amyl and The Sniffers maintain in Melbourne's grassroots scene, even as their profile accelerates worldwide. For many fans who raced between venues to claim a drink, the night became an instant chapter in the city's music mythology — a chaotic, communal celebration born from a disappointment that could have easily overshadowed a landmark homecoming.

Vicki Gunvalson is officially returning to The Real Housewives of Orange County as a full-time housewife.


	It was during the taping of The Bravos amid BravoCon in Las Vegas that Andy Cohen presented Gunvalson with her orange.


	”Vicki, would you join us as a housewife for Season 20?” Cohen asked Gunvalson on stage. 


	Gunvalson got emotional when Cohen handed her the orange while accepting to return to RHOC. 


	Deadline understands that no deal has been finalized yet but the offer is now on the table to start negotiations. 


	The OG of the OC will be returning for the epic Season 20. It was RHOC that started the franchise, which gave way to The Real Housewives franchise, expanding to other cities, including New York City, Atlanta, Potomac, Beverly Hills, Dubai, Miami, Salt Lake City, and more.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Gunvalson had been honored with the Wifetime Achievement Award at The Bravos in 2023, and many believed that was her farewell from the Bravo universe. However, the honor of holding an orange again as a full-time housewife to celebrate 20 years of the franchise proved that Gunvalson remains an icon.


RHOC premiered on Bravo in 2006, and Gunvalson quickly became a fan-favorite for her outrageous personality and her ability to “Whoop it up” at Andale's in Puerto Vallarta, or any of the cast's trips. She remained a full-time housewife for 13 seasons before being downgraded to a “friend of” role in Season 14. Gunvalson has continued to make guest appearances, but it will be in Season 20 where viewers will get to see her full-time return to the franchise.


RELATED: Jeff Lewis Set For Bravo Return With ‘Still Flipping Out' Series


	Gunvalson's return comes as she and fellow RHOC co-star Tamra Judge appear to have reconciled following a feud that played out in the media and on social media. Judge had been estranged from Gunvalson and Shannon Beador, and Season 20 of the series will surely chronicle how the “Tres Amigas” will hash out their differences and get the trip back together.

	As Millie Bobby Brown says goodbye to Stranger Things, she's come a long way from the 12-year-old who broke out on Season 1 of the Netflix show in 2016.


	The 2x Emmy nominee snapped back at a red carpet photographer who apparently told her to smile as she attended the London premiere of the fifth and final season on Thursday at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square.


	“Smile? You smile!” said Brown in a viral clip before marching off down the carpet.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In March, Brown opened up about growing up “under public scrutiny,” calling out reporters who have previously gone after her looks. “This isn't journalism. This is bullying,” she said in a video at the time.

	











	“The fact that adult writers are spending their time dissecting my face, my body, my choices is disturbing,” added Brown in part. “Disillusioned people can't handle seeing a girl become a woman, on her terms, not their own. I refuse to apologize for growing up.”

	Brown stars in Stranger Things as the psychic-powered Eleven, who escapes Hawkins National Laboratory in Season 1, where she was subject to experiments with the Upside Down.


	Season 5 continues in the fall of 1987. Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, with the characters united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will's disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming — and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they've faced before. To end this nightmare, they'll need everyone — the full party — standing together, one last time.

	











	The highly anticipated fifth and final season will release on Netflix across three premiere dates with Volume 1 on November 26 (four episodes), Volume 2 on Christmas (three episodes), and The Finale on New Year's Eve. Each volume releases at 5 PM PT.

	A year later, Lady Gaga is reacting to the negative reviews around Joker: Folie à Deux after “pouring” herself into the role of Harley Quinn.


	The Oscar winner recalled finding the harsh criticisms of the DC movie to be “so unhinged,” while admitting the experience was “a little bit more painful” when the fallout lasted for longer than expected.


	“There was a ton of negativity around Joker. And I think I was feeling artistically rebellious at the time,” she told Rolling Stone.

	“I wasn't, like, unfazed. It's funny, I'm almost nervous to share my reaction,” explained Gaga. “But the truth is, when it first started happening, I started laughing. Because it was just getting so unhinged.”

	











	With tied 31% critic and fan ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, Joker: Folie à Deux earned Razzies for Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel and Worst Screen Combo for Gaga and Joaquin Pheonix‘s Joker.


	Gaga added, “When it takes a while for something to kind of dissipate, that can be a little bit more painful. Only because I put a lot of myself into it.”

Well, the movie was objectively terrible.  Neither new fans or fans of the original comics based material liked it.  If you want positive feedback, it is really necessary to create good material.

I actually really realy liked it, surprisingly after these reviews.

It was ahead of its time for the average comic book Joe. The Rocky Horror Picture Show  was too.

It's a fantastic movie, but it's sure not for everyone. For maximum enjoyment it helps to be a little unhinged yourself. The soundtrack is a demented masterpiece.

movie was unhinged tho

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


Jon Voight doesn't just want to help Donald Trump to Make Hollywood Great Again, the Enemy of the State star now wants the former Apprentice host to save an apparently in-peril New York City. Specifically, Voight is asking POTUS to stop the newly-elected Zohran Mamdani from taking over as mayor — apparently by any means necessary.


	“We the people have put our trust in the President of the United States, Donald J Trump, he and only he, can stop this horror, as this mayor, Mamdani, will try to destroy New York's wealth and turn it into a socialist crap city,” the Yonkers-born and now Beverly Hills-based Voight said late Thursday in a video he posted railing against self-declared democratic socialist “Muslim” Mamdani. “Let this be a warning to the people,” the octogenarian says near the end of the two-minute video before an awkward look away from the camera and fade to black.

	











	“This city will turn into a forbidden place of darkness,” the rambling Voight said earlier in the low-fi offering. “The blood, sweat and tears that the city of New York was built on will turn into a virtual refugee shelter for the radical Muslim ideology,” he added with a scripted dash of Winston Churchill it seems.




			Watch on Deadline		







	 Ominous and pretty clearly Islamophobic message received, Jon.

New York City pic.twitter.com/0QyTOyZJdd


	Elected on November 4 as Big Apple boss on a “mandate for change,” the Ugandan-born Mamdani easily defeated former Empire State governor and fellow Democrat Andrew Cuomo, who was running as a Trump-backed Independent. 

	











	Initially a long shot against the still powerful and establishment-supported Cuomo dynasty, the little known 35-year-old state Assemblyman and son of Oscar-nominated Mississippi Masala director Mira Nair ran an unconventional and social media-fueled campaign that delivered him a solid win in the June 24 Democratic primary, making him a certain shoe-in for the general election.


	Despite that democratic process and the larger-than-usual turnout among residents of the five boroughs, Gersh-repped Voight has appointed himself to sound the alarm that some would say has been ringing for a while already in certain high income and MAGA circles.


	“This mayor will destroy this city,” the Trump-anointed Special Ambassador to Hollywood goes on to say. 


	“We are obligated to demand our rights for our private sanctuary, our businesses, our property that we all have worked so hard for, and this 35-year-old mayor-to-be has no right dictating the rules of socialism for a city built on our highest principles with brick and stone by hard-working Americans,” Voight continues. “This must be stopped, and his mayoralty should be terminated immediately. You the people of the greatest city, New York, are in danger of losing your city to this communist fool.”


	Mamdani has not responded to Voight's obvious dog-whistling statements. What the Mayor-elect has been doing Friday is talking about one of his main campaign promises: addressing the high cost of living in NYC. A topic that may or may not be in Jon Voight's wheelhouse.

For too long, New Yorkers have expected only mediocrity from their leaders. It's time we write a new story. On January 1st, we'll usher in a City Hall that tackles the cost-of-living crisis—and we'll remind our city what excellence in public service looks like. pic.twitter.com/GSYM5esYU9


	As Deadline's Ted Johnson noted on Election Night after the Bernie Sanders- and AOC-backed Mayor-elect spoke to supporters: “In his speech, Mamdani pledged to deliver the ‘most ambitious' agenda focused on affordability since Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, with a program of rent stabilization, free bus service and universal child care.”


	Prior to Mamdani's victory, it was predicted the rich would be leaving NYC in droves if he were elected. Never one to miss an opportunity to step into a situation getting a lot of media attention and likely following what Fox News was saying, Trump stoked some of those fears of what those policies could mean for the city and whether the feds would send in troops or cut off funding.


	Now, with a month and a half before Mandami is sworn in, Voight has offered up his opinion. Now, while Oscar winner Voight starred in Midnight Cowboy, one of the most New York movies of all time, he seems to have spent most of the capital out of his friendship with Trump on movie tariffs and a national tax incentives plan for Tinseltown. While MAGA for a while, Voight appears to be stepping into new territory.


	While active today on his Truth Social and trying to move the media conversation away from his long association with now deceased pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, Trump hasn't taken Voight's bait, yet.

He keeps saying”We the people” yet he doesn't support the constitution he references nor the will of the people that voted for mamdani in NY

Who is he ???
How much money does he even need at his age ???
Others are starving and homeless.

Nothing like whining about made up problems that won't affect him

He really thinks someone can be removed as Mayor because of his stupid opinion, lol.

How does this irrelevant loser still get work?

Why do y'all even entertain this Old Ghoul?

Pillow fights and feathers, overdosin'. 

Britney Spears' song “Slumber Party” appeared to become her reality Friday night, as she was seen cozying up in bed with Kim and Khloé Kardashian, 41, in two selfies posted to Instagram.

The “Toxic” singer, who was joined by her longtime manager, Cade Hudson, appeared to be visiting the SKIMS founder's Hidden Hills home.

“Calabasas nights,” Kim, 45, wrote atop the first image in her Instagram Stories. She struck her signature pose as Spears, 43, stuck out her tongue in the cheeky snap.

The second photo, taken by Hudson, showed the four sitting next to each other in the bedroom, with a large, pink mood light behind them. 

Kim sported a black robe with her hair in a slicked-back bun. Khloé, on the other hand, opted for a pair of Christmas-themed pajamas and wore her tresses down in loose waves.

As for Spears, she wore a yellow-and-white ensemble.

Reps for Spears and the Kardashians didn't immediately respond to Page Six's requests for comment.

While the hangout may be unexpected, Kim and Spears have known each other for quite some time. The “Kardashians” star even spoke out with “empathy” after watching the documentary “Framing Britney Spears” in March 2021. 

“The way the media played a big role in her life the way it did can be very traumatizing,” she wrote on Instagram at the time.

“It can really break even the strongest person. No one deserves to be treated with such cruelty or judgment for entertainment.”

It was also previously reported that Kim wanted to help Spears break free from her 13-year conservatorship. 

“She reached out to Britney as soon as she read her [court] statement,” an insider told Closer magazine back in 2021.

“Kim knows she's going through hell and that her situation is like a jail sentence. She let her know she'd do whatever she could to help her win her battle,” the source added.

“Britney has given the green light to let Kim help in whatever capacity she can and asked her to email her lawyer, Samuel Ingham. She really appreciates her support.”

A judge ultimately terminated the guardianship in November 2021.

Kim and Spears, who are both friends with Paris Hilton, reportedly met in the early 2000s. The duo were last photographed together at a 2012 Grammy Awards party.

Jimmy Kimmel's former bandleader Cleto Escobedo's cause of death has been revealed.

The late saxophonist died of cardiogenic shock, according to TMZ.

The outlet notes that Escobedo's death certificate also listed vasodilatory shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation and alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver as underlying causes.

It additionally lists sepsis, graft versus host disease, immunosuppressed, chronic kidney disease and pneumonia as contributing conditions.

Cardiogenic shock is a life-threatening condition that “happens when the heart suddenly can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs,” per the Mayo Clinic.

As we previously reported, Escobedo died on Tuesday after complications stemming from a liver transplant. He was 59.

We were told that the bandleader was hospitalized last week, and Kimmel canceled his Nov. 6 taping at the last minute to be by his friend's side.

Due to Kimmel's loss, he canceled his late-night talk show Wednesday and Thursday.

Earlier this week, Kimmel emotionally honored the late bandleader on the Nov. 11 episode of the late-night talk show. The comedian broke down in tears as he remembered his lifelong friend.

“We've been on the air for almost 23 years and I've had to do some hard monologues along the way, but this one's the hardest because late last night, early this morning, we lost someone very special who was much too young to go,” the emotional comedian told his audience on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

“We had so many adventures. We would laugh so hard. We had our own language that, like, almost no one else understood,” Kimmel recalled of their childhood.

Escobedo was the leader of his band, Cleto and the Cletones, for nearly 23 years. His father played the tenor and alto saxophone alongside his son.

More than two weeks after having its channels go dark on the streaming TV service, Disney has resolved its big, expensive carriage fight with Google's YouTube TV. Driven by the only pressure that actually seems to get anything done in American life—the fear that a percentage of the population might be asked to go without college and Monday Night Football for a desperate handful of days—the two giants have come to an agreement on how much YouTube will pay to offer Disney's various channels to its ever-growing number of subscribers.

Among other things, the new deal will apparently lead to even further sports offerings for YouTube TV subscribers, as they'll now be offered the content from the Unlimited tier of ESPN's new standalone digital streaming service at no additional cost, to migrate over to YouTube TV by the end of 2026. Google's service will also be allowed to offer the Hulu/Disney+ bundle to subscribers as part of “select YouTube offerings,” in case you were currently living a life where not enough online entities were trying to sign you up for Disney+.

Notably, all ABC and ESPN content is expected to return for YouTube TV subscribers within the next day. (Including any content that users had saved in their virtual DVRs, which was unavailable for the duration of the fight.) The carriage battle was apparently the longest in Disney's history, stretching for 15 days—with much of the blowback landing on YouTube, which sent out $20 credits to subscribers earlier this week in an effort to mollify those saying they were planning to cancel their subscriptions. Both companies issued statements in the aftermath of reaching their new multi-year deal, although it feels worth noting that only the Disney one specifically mentioned college football, the great fulcrum upon which all multi-million TV arguments apparently must rest.

Actor and podcaster Dasha Nekrasova—best known, in many circles, for her supporting turn on HBO's Succession, as crisis PR operative/Cousin Greg love interest Comfrey—has reportedly been fired by her representation at Gersh. Specifically, Deadline reports that Nekrasova has been let go by the agency due to her controversial long-running political podcast Red Scare, and even more specifically due to her decision to conduct a 2.5-hour interview with far-right political figure Nick Fuentes.

Nekrasova has long blended her espoused political views—which have reportedly swung along the outer edges of a number of different portions of the spectrum over the last several years—with her more mainstream work, having gained early attention for touting pro-Bernie Sanders comments on Alex Jones' InfoWars. She started her own podcast, co-hosted by Anna Khachiyan, in 2018, occasionally raising eyebrows with the show's “dirtbag left”-adjacent political stances and statements, but never in a way that seemed to directly impact her more mainstream career. That appears to have changed with the interview with Fuentes, though, who's considered the leader of the far-right “groypers,” a loose-knit organization that describes itself as “Christian nationalist” and “America First,” and which tends to get described by everybody else as racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, and plenty more besides. The conversation between Fuentes, Nekrasova, and Khachiyan, which was originally broadcast in late October, but has circulated more widely in recent weeks, doesn't do much to disabuse listeners of those sentiments, either, including conversations that seem to reinforce negative stereotypes about immigrants and ethnic groups, with a special amount of focus put on Jewish people.

In any case, it pretty clearly crossed a line for Gersh, which cut ties with Nekrasova earlier on Friday. At the same time, Deadline reports that a film role that she'd previously booked, in Gabriel Basso's upcoming film Iconoclast, had also been pulled, before she'd actually signed contracts on the film.

Nekrasova most recently appeared in theaters with a supporting role in this year's Materialists.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Great Job, Internet!: Nobody's happy about AI puppets of Jesus or your dead relatives","https://www.avclub.com/gji-ai-promises-to-mimic-your-dead-relatives-or-jesus","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 01:28:00 GMT","

It's been a banner week for delusion on the internet—never not a growth market, as it happens—and specifically in the world of AI grifters. To wit: Which is more fundamentally undignified, an AI startup claiming that its product will let you talk to your dead mother? Or to your lord and savior Jesus Christ?

Let's take this scientifically. On the one hand, the former “product,” billed under the name 2wai, feels like it could do much more practical harm: Claiming—in a much-mocked online ad—that you can film a three-minute video of a loved one with the app, then use it to create an AI avatar of them that will continue to be able to talk to you for decades, the service has provoked a lot of accusations of being, well, outright evil, for the way it seems primed to take economic advantage of people lost in the throes of grief. (There's nothing like having to tell the kids that you've had to delete Gramma because of a rise in processing fees.) It also helps that it's the kind of thing that would feel heavy-handed popping up in a story about humanity letting AI excesses run amuck, to the extent that we literally have a Black Mirror episode about how this kind of thing is a terrible idea.  (And that's all before we get to the absurdities hanging around the edge of 2wai, like the fact that it was co-founded by actor Calum Worthy—a long-time Disney Channel alum who will always be “The kid who lies about getting a handjob in American Vandal” to us. Who else would you trust to sell you a shallow, repetitive facsimile of the most important missing people in your life, but the fourth-billed lead on Austin & Ally, right?)

On the other hand, we really don't know what to do with the following paragraph, from a recent Today article about an application called “Text With Jesus.” We're just going to reprint it in its entirety because, well, fuck:

Text With Jesus offers users an interactive experience with a religious deity. In other words, users can text questions to Jesus and get a response. (Premium users can also converse with Satan.)

Is it possible to even make fun of “(Premium users can also converse with Satan.)”? To imagine going over your monthly bills a year down the line, seeing a particular item, and remembering it's because you decided you needed a premium subscription to Talk With Jesus so you could pop a quick Q in Lucifer's digital inbox? (“Hey, big man. Hell is hot, but nobody ever specifies how many BTUs. Help a fella out?”) Say what you like about the electronic blasphemy of it all, it at least has a bit of chutzpah. (Among other things, the app's already produced the television spectacle of Today co-host Carson Daly trying, in real time, to process a day-time TV version of his actual feelings about a virtual Christ.) Personally, our big worry is just how much money that there probably, depressingly, is in giving people instant access to even auto-complete garbage answers to life's most fundamental questions. (A very quick perusal of various app stores shows that Text With Jesus, which supposedly has 150,000 users, is not alone in this fAIth-based space; we were especially drawn to the Catholicism-minded One Day Confession App, which promises, with a straight face, an “AI-driven confession experience.”)

Anyway: As we go to press, 2wai has posted a notice that, due to server load, “Avatar chats may not be loading, and user-generated avatar twins may not be processing to completion.” We'll just leave you to sit with that.

As BravoCon draws fans, cast members, and network executives into a weekend of panels and breaking news, Andy Cohen's filmed at-home visit with “Real Housewives of Potomac” star Karen Huger is emerging as one of the convention's biggest talking points. The moment, which appears in the season 10 midseason trailer unveiled during the event, signals the franchise's most direct engagement yet with Huger's legal troubles and her return to public life.

Bravo screened the trailer for attendees on Friday, revealing Cohen's unannounced arrival at Huger's Potomac home shortly after her release from a six-month stay in a Maryland detention center. The sit-down will anchor the season's finale, according to The Hollywood Reporter, which previewed the network's rollout.

Huger served about half of a two-year sentence after a DUI conviction stemming from a March 2024 crash, according to People. The outlet reported that she was released in September and immediately reunited with her family while Bravo cameras captured the moment.

The midseason trailer shows Cohen greeting Huger inside her home and telling her, “You are a free woman,” People reported. Huger responds by saying she is ready to speak openly about addiction, accountability, and the events leading up to her sentencing. The footage teases a raw conversation that positions Huger's personal challenges as a centerpiece of the remaining season.

The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that Bravo plans to feature the interview in the February finale and described the storyline as an emotional turning point for the show. Huger's reentry into the cast dynamic appears likely to drive the second half of the season, which BravoCon attendees reacted to with enthusiasm during the trailer screening.

Cohen's willingness to meet Huger in her home, rather than on a reunion set, marks a tonal shift in how the franchise addresses real-life crises. Deadline noted that scenes of Huger walking into her house after her release and embracing her family indicate Bravo's desire to ground her return in reality instead of the usual cast conflicts.

The visit also reframes Cohen's role. Instead of moderating disputes from the reunion couch, he engages Huger in a one-on-one conversation about recovery and consequences. The setting gives the interview an air of sincerity that distinguishes it from the show's standard rhythm.

As BravoCon continues, fans are speculating about Huger's long-term future on the series. Bravo has not confirmed whether she will hold a full-time position next season, but the network's decision to center her storyline in the trailer suggests she remains an important part of the franchise.

Producers appear to be leaning into an arc that blends vulnerability, rehabilitation, and the high-stakes interpersonal drama that defines the Housewives universe.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","VIDEO: Erika Jayne Smiles as She Dishes on Her New Boyfriend","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/video-erika-jayne-dishes-new-boyfriend/","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 16:40:40 GMT","

When Erika Jayne — one of the stars of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” — sat down for a chat at BravoCon 2025 on Friday, November 14, she was all smiles. Why is that? Well, she happened to be talking about her boyfriend, John McPhee. Or, Shrek as he was originally nicknamed.

During the Livin' In Beverly Hills panel moderated by Anthony Allen Ramos, the “RHOBH” personality was asked, “Erika, while I'm with you, can we talk about Shrek?”

Referring to the fact that John can be spotted in the Season 15 trailer, Anthony went on to say, “We see him on FaceTime.”

“What did you call him?” Erika responded while still smiling. Shen then added, “You can call him John.”

“So, I started dating someone in June, and we had a FaceTime call,” she continued. “And Kyle [Richards] was actually the first person that I shared this with.”

“It's slow,” she continued while talking about the status of her new-ish relationship. “And I think that's the right thing to do. Just slow.”

After Erika was first spotted out with John in Los Angeles while the two held hands, she opened up about the experience during the July 30 episode of her “Diamonds in the Rough” podcast.

“It was really nice,” she recalled. “Like, I feel comfortable holding this person's hand, and he's a nice man.”

“You know, I haven't been seen with anyone in five years,” she pointed out. “So this is a really nice person and I enjoy my time with him… He doesn't live here, so… Listen, listen, it's a friend. It's a nice thing.”

While Erika split up from Tom Girardi after more than 20 years of marriage, she's not the only one who's gone through a divorce. In fact, John — a retired U.S. Army special operations sergeant major, according to E! News — has gone through more than one divorce.

“That's tough on everybody,” he said while doing an interview for “The Megyn Kelly Show” in May.

After noting that he had been divorced “several times” because of his overseas military career, he added, “Only guys that had perfect relationships, their marriages survived the war. And I would say the bulk of guys end up divorced.”

Fortunately, it seems like things are going well for John relationship-wise now that he's retired and met Erika.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Beloved '80s Rocker Announces Retirement at 74: ‘It's Time'","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/david-coverdale-whitesnake-retir/","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 02:30:20 GMT","

Whitesnake founder David Coverdale shared a major career announcement on social media on Thursday, November 13: He's retiring!

Coverdale — who also led the band Deep Purple — shared the news with fans via Instagram. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, brothers and sisters of the Snake, a special announcement for you. After 50 years-plus of an incredible journey with you—with Deep Purple, with Whitesnake, Jimmy Page—the last few years it has been very evident to me that it's time really for me to hang up my rock ‘n' roll platform shoes and my skintight jeans,” Coverdale, 74, began in a heartfelt video on Thursday, November 13.

He continued, “And as you can see, we've taken care of the lion's wig. But it's time for me to call it a day.”

Coverdale went on to thank his fans for decades of love and support. 

“I love you dearly. I thank everyone who's assisted and supported me on this incredible journey: All the musicians, the crew, the fans, the family. It's amazing. But it really is time for me to just enjoy my retirement, and I hope you can appreciate that,” Coverdale added. “Once again, I love you with all my heart. Fare thee well.”

The retired rocker is best known for founding Whitesnake in 1978. The band gained worldwide popularity with hit songs such as “Here I Go Again,” “Is This Love,” “Still of the Night,” and “Crying in the Rain.”

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Deep Purple in 2016.

Shortly after he shared the sad news with fans, the comments section was flooded with love and support for his decision. 

“So proud of you, Baby!! You gave so much of yourself, so freely, and with so much love and care. Now you get to do whatever you want to!” his wife, Cindy Coverdale, commented. 

“Thank you for this incredible journey full of amazing songs, records, concerts, hits and I wish you the best possible things in life!” one fan wrote. 

“You've created a lot of fans and changed a lot of rock n roll lives with your music. I can't say much more. I'm devastated. I just would like to thank you, profoundly,” another added. 

Another follower simply wrote, “Thank you for the music.”

Love music..  the pic almost made me think it was arowsmith lead singer however after reading some of the article ive found out different but hat as off to him.

Your work has been a big part of my love life ,they remind me of the path, my life and thank you for all the years.
You left a great legacy ,an impact….a difference.  Great times ,…Bless you Sir …. Rock and roll will never die.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jen Affleck Bravely Defends Her Marriage Following ‘DWTS' Speculation","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/jen-affleck-zac-affleck-marriage-criticisms/","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 17:23:43 GMT","

“Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” star Jen Affleck is standing by her husband Zac Affleck after their relationship was subject to scrutiny during her run on “Dancing With The Stars.”

Jen was eliminated from the competition during the October 28 episode following her Halloween-themed contemporary routine to Taylor Swift's “Look What You Made Me Do.”

After her elimination, Zac had to shut down the suggestion that he was happy to see her time on the show come to an end.

Someone on TikTok reenacted Zac's reaction to Jen and partner Jan Ravnik's elimination, utilizing a popular trend on the app where a person pretends to look sad before smiling for a split second at the camera before looking sad again.

“Youre honestly disgusting,” Zac wrote in the comments, “Grow up.”

FREE HER!!!! SHE HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL #dwts #dancingwiththestars #momtok #halloween @Dancing with the Stars #DWTS 

In an exclusive interview with E! News that she did with her “Mormon Wives” castmate Jessi Ngatikaura, Jen expressed her frustration with all the speculation. “It can be tiring and draining, just because it gets old having to hear the same things,” Jen said. “For me, I'm like, ‘People will always talk and people will always have their opinions,' and I think it is frustrating for him when people don't see what's happening behind closed doors and how much work and effort he's putting in.”

Jen noted how her and Zac were both still learning to deal with all the attention.

“We're working on just tuning out the noise of the world—I think it still is hard for him.” She added, “It's hard to have to constantly open your phone and see negative comments and it's hard not to take that in,” she explained. “Even if you say you don't take it in, subconsciously we all care to a certain point. For me, I always have to remind myself, I post, I share my story, and then I take a step back. As long as I'm focusing on being the best version of myself, that's all that matters.”

“I feel like we've grown so much,” she reasoned. “Clearly, if we hadn't been part of Momtok or been part of this show, we wouldn't have gone through everything that we went through this last year. Even though that was so hard and almost broke us, it actually strengthened us in the long run.”

Despite the challenges they've faced in their marriage, in private or in the public eye, Jen admitted, “I feel like we've grown so much. Clearly, if we hadn't been part of MomTok or been part of this show, we wouldn't have gone through everything that we went through this last year. Even though that was so hard and almost broke us, it actually strengthened us in the long run.”

This isn't the first time that Jen has stood firmly by her marriage to Zac. 

In an Instagram post from October 7, Jen wrote her appreciation for her husband in the caption.

“Appreciation post for this guy,” she began. “He's the one who checks that l've actually eaten breakfast, who reminds me to sleep and makes sure I get real rest. What you don't see are all the quiet ways he keeps us going-cooking, cleaning, kid duty, and those late-night shifts with Penny. This journey truly wouldn't be possible without him, and for that, I am forever grateful.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","'Below Deck Down Under' Season 4 Exclusive Sneak Peek","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/below-deck-down-under-season-4-trailer-bravocon/","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 02:20:57 GMT","

Fans who attended Day 1 of BravoCon 2025 on Nov. 14 were in for a real treat when they got a first look at the trailer for Bravo's “Below Deck Down Under” season 4. Although viewers already met the crew during the epic crossover with “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” the exclusive preview hinted at major turbulence ahead for Captain Jason Chambers' heads of department.

Fans are in for a drama-filled BDDU as rising egos may prove to be the biggest storm this season.

During a panel at BravoCon 2025, fans got a first-hand look at what's to come for season 4 of “Below Deck Down Under.” The preview was unlike any other as it focused on Captain Jason Chambers meeting his department heads ahead of their charter season in Canouan.

Fans in the audience cheered as Chambers sat down with fan-favorites, chef Ben Robinson, second officer João Franco, and chief stew Daisy Kelliher, all of whom will be a part of the new season. 

“Yachting runs on leadership, teamwork, and respect. And that starts with the top,” Chambers shares. The clip then shows flashbacks to season 3, when Chambers' heads of department constantly clashed. “I can't have what happened last year with my heads of department at each other,” he adds.

Chambers makes it clear that he wants “professional” and experienced department heads this season because there is no “room for chaos,” but based on what's to come, he may have spoken just a little too soon.

We then get a look at Robinson, Franco, and Kelliher in their roles this season, as they're shown upholding the strong work ethic they're known for.

However, the preview quickly shifts to a clash between Robinson and Kelliher in the galley, as she snaps, “Absolutely [expletive] fine. Figure it out for yourself,” before walking away. Later, she is shown speaking to Franco in her cabin about Robinson's ego, noting how he prefers to sleep in the guest cabin and even uses it as a spot to “make out with girls.”

Additionally, the preview teases a romance between Kelliher and Franco. It is the first time they are meeting, and things promise to heat up between the two this season. 

“João has got an agenda with Daisy. That's a problem,” Robinson is heard stating. The clip then shows Franco and Kelliher holding hands, and the second officer lifting her and carrying her on a beach. 

Fans then gasped when the preview showed Franco and Kelliher sharing a kiss! 

However, their budding romance appears to get in the way of Franco's friendship with Robinson. As fans recalled, the two worked together on season 4 of “Below Deck Med” with Captain Sandy Yawn at the helm of the Sirocco.

The end of the preview shows their friendship fallout when Robinson yells at Franco to “[expletive] off,” among other harsh comments. Hopefully, this doesn't affect the crew's ability to have a successful charter season, and Chambers having to face another showdown between his heads of department.

“Below Deck Down Under” season 4 will premiere on Bravo on Monday, Feb. 2.

The opening of “Sirāt” has mad beats — both in terms of the quality of the music and its ability to drive you out of your head. For nearly 10 minutes, the film immerses the viewer inside the pulse of a rave; the camera seductively weaves through a crowd as a hypnotic beat wraps you in euphoric bliss. That intoxicating wave of sound is the creation of Kangding Ray – born David Letelier – a French musician whose album “Solens Arc” caught the attention of director Oliver Laxe.

“There were two tracks that Oliver liked a lot and were basically the reason why he contacted me to work on the film,” Ray told IndieWire. The album's raw, uncompromising, dirty, and emotional tone became the stepping stone for the unrelenting score; a remixed version of the track “Amber Decay” serves as the appetizer to a narrative that harmoniously blends image and sound like two parts of the same being.

Hooking viewers early required careful craft. “Oliver talked a lot about the textures, energy, and the visceral aspect he wanted to bring to the film, especially the rave scene. One key aspect was being true to the scene but also cinematic enough so it's palpable for a wider audience,” Ray said. “We're portraying a free party scene born out of this punk ethos of early U.K. rave, so we had to be cautious about turning it into a stereotype but also keep it strong enough so that it could hold a story behind it.” 

 










The emotive sequence posed an equally demanding challenge for post, which was mixed in Dolby Atmos and overseen by supervising sound editor and designer Laia Casanovas. “It was difficult to find the balance between the realism and the energy of the music. We wanted the music to feel like another character, as if you were there on the dance floor,” Casanovas said. To achieve this, they let the music carry the moment, adding layers of texture and atmosphere rather than punctuating it with sounds of the crowd to give a sensation that you are there.

The title, drawn from an Arabic word meaning “path” or “way,” frames an allegorical journey of self-discovery and transformation as a father (Sergi López) and son (Bruno Núñez Arjona) join a group of ravers venturing deep into the Moroccan desert to find his missing daughter, last seen at a festival. Music and effects deepen themes of life, death, and survival. As circumstances for characters darken, sound underscores the emotional weight. 

“There's a slow disintegration of the score towards something more ethereal, more ambient, and more spiritual. Because by the end, it's not a film about a rave, it's about things that are way bigger than that,” said Ray, who composed a 12-song soundtrack — all of which Laxe pushed the limits of creativity. “The great thing about working with someone like Oliver is he's not really one to compromise. Whenever we had an idea, we were never afraid of being too radical, or too rough, or too raw. We trusted the process and also trusted the audience,” the Berlin-based composer said.

 










Adding to the aural equation were the sonic elements beyond music. “The film's sound is more documentary and realistic but expressive without losing the reality,” Casanovas told IndieWire. Post collaborated early with production sound mixer Amanda Villavieja to shape the experience, asking her to record ambisonic stereo sounds of the desert. “We wanted to study and analyze how to be more expressive through the film and propose an emotional journey through sound,” Casanovas said about the technique that captures full-sphere 360-degree audio.

The emotionally driven approach allowed for subtle changes in sound design, especially for later scenes in the desert where loneliness and emptiness dominate. “Lots of the winds in the first half of the film are recorded in Morocco and the Sahara Desert. But in the final scenes, the wind recordings are from Iceland. They are more silent with low frequencies. We cut the high end and pitch it down so they become more weird and strange to match the emotional state that we wanted,” Casanovas said.

One notable scene shows the convoy of vehicles at a crowded gas station trying to top off before crossing the desert. Post recorded a number of local voices and phrases to give color to the existing production sound captured on set. The vehicles provided another opportunity for sonic life. Scarred with years of dust and sun, they trek across unmarked roads, growling with personality. “You hear more of the roar of the engines to explain that they are dangerous,” said Casanovas about their initial sounds. “Then from the middle of the film you hear more of the tires and the structure of the vehicles and not their engines because we wanted to emphasize the difficulty crossing the desert and the danger of the mountains.” 

 










Score, at times, emphasized the spirit of a road movie, providing energy to scenes as characters journey towards their destination. In mixing a climactic accident that happens in the mountains, sound leaned into the veracity of the moment. “We wanted the scene to be realistic and raw so it was more impactful,” Casanovas said. Music takes a back seat, allowing the character's emotions to play on screen.

Mirroring the opening of “Sirāt,” the final moments rely on score and sound to deliver a resonating conclusion – a sequence that begins with harmless drug use and spirals into chaos. “For this track, there was a requirement from Oliver that it had to grow and grow and grow, but there were different aspects to the scene,” Ray said. “There's this solidarity of this found family, the pain, and then the psychedelic aspect. All of these emotions had different sounds that I layered to express this feeling.”

Casanovas added, “At the beginning of the film, there are more elements of insects, wind, and grass. It's brighter than the last part of the film, where we wanted the emotional journey to be more about fear. The final scenes practically don't have any kind of wind. It's something more silent, and we used frequencies to make it more like a mental state.”

 










“In a way, it's linked to the different states of grief and mixed emotions,” said Ray. “The film is about how to see the light and pain and how suffering can be seen as a blessing sometimes.”

“Sirāt” will have a limited release run in New York and Los Angeles on November 13.

Quentin Tarantino once defined the “hangout” film as “movies that you hangout with the characters so much that they actually become your friends,” and he declared his friend Richard Linklater its master.

While a guest on this week's episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, we asked Linklater what he thought of the subgenre Tarantino had tagged his films with. “Maybe he got that from me,” chuckled Linklater. “I often describe my own films as ‘Hey, ‘I'm going drop a camera on 1976 or wherever I am, and just kind of hang out.” 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






He continued: “It's not inaccurate. That is the tone, I want the viewer to feel like they're transported to a place and that they are participating in some way, and that there is a relation with the character.”

Linklater, like many cinephiles, has long held a reverence for the French New Wave — that time when cinema felt young, new, and full of possibilities. And the idea of transporting back to what it felt like to be in that moment was something he found appealing. But to accomplish that, he had to throw his reverence for that moment in history, and the great filmmakers in it, out the window. According to Linklater, that's where most period films fail.

 










“I've always just rolled my eyes at most ‘important' historical films,” said Linklater. “They're stepping out of a painting or a sculpture or something. I just keep coming back to the word self-important. And I am like, ‘No, life's never been like that,' life is going on all around you. The greatest moments in history were preceded by someone just having a sandwich.”

The director wanted to invite the audience to just come “hang out while they were making ‘Breathless,” which was only possible if the attitude of his camera, like the characters, is oblivious to the fact it is witnessing the making of what would become a groundbreaking film that would change film history and launch Jean-Luc Godard's career.

In particular, Linklater needed to knock his Godard (Guillaume Marbeck) off his pedestal, instructing his ensemble that their characters were dismissive of the young director. “‘This guy is nobody. He's an obscure film writer. You can't even make your way through his writing for ‘Cahiers du Cinéma.'” And to those playing the “Breathless” crew he instructed, “‘He probably doesn't know what he's doing, and the film probably won't work. But you're her, and hey, you need a job, it's only 20 days, he has some charisma, and who knows, it might be good, Jean Seberg's in it, and she's known.'”

 










Linklater believes films about historical figures can suffer from their star power. He acknowledges and rattles off the great performances given by A-list stars in biopics but admits that for him, there's always something distracting about the layering of icon on icon.

“I always remember the feeling I got watching ‘Gandhi' 42 years ago now, and if you didn't know London theater, you didn't really know who Ben Kingsley was. I was a kid in Texas and I knew a lot about Gandhi at that time, and watching it just going, ‘Oh, that's Gandhi,' because I didn't know who the actor was,'” said Linklater. “ I heard Dustin Hoffman wanted to play Gandhi. And he probably would've been pretty good,  but I was transported.”

It was that feeling the director wanted for “Nouvelle Vague.” Linklater was very conscious of the cinephile audience who would be drawn to his film — people like himself who think of Godard, Jean-Paul Belmondo (Aubry Dullin), François Truffaut (Adrien Rouyard), and Claude Chabrol (Antoine Besson) as these iconic figures in cinema — which is why he believes his ensemble of fresh-faced French actors was the most important ingredient.

“There's the physical resemblance, but that's the obvious part. The much more important part is their personalities and who they are,” said Linklater. “Aubry, who plays Belmondo, he had this light, airy [quality], quick smile, happy — he struck me as Belmondo, like, ‘I don't care much. I'm here, but I'm floating through. I'm a boxer. I've got all these things,  ladies love me.'”

 










Linklater auditioned Belmondo's real-life grandson, who he said is a good actor and would have been fine, but Dullin embodied the spirit and just “felt right.” Linklater said it often came down to what the actors felt like in the room during auditions, and he could really tell he had caught lightning in a bottle when he got them in the room together.

“I remember sitting down with the actors who would play Godard, Truffaut, and Suzanne Schiffman (Jodie Ruth-Forest). Once I had the right actors, we were sitting there reading a scene, and I videotaped it and showed it to [my producer] and said, ‘See how special this is?' And they're like, ‘Oh my God, I see what you're talking about. It's them, it's them!' And I'm like, ‘Yeah, it's them. This is what we're going for.' [You] just feel like you're there with them.”

Todd Snider, a singer, songwriter, and raconteur who helped shape the alt-country and Americana music movements, died Friday. He was 59. Rolling Stone confirmed Snider's death. No cause of death was given, but Snider reportedly was diagnosed with pneumonia this week.


	“Aimless, Inc. Headquarters is heartbroken to share that our Founder, our Folk Hero, our Poet of the World, our Vice President of the Abrupt Change Dept., the Storyteller, our beloved Todd Daniel Snider has departed this world,” a message read on Snider's Facebook page.


	Born in Portland, Oregon, and relocating to northern California after high school, Snider rambled his way to Texas in the 1980s, where he met and was mentored by the songwriter Jerry Jeff Walker. In the Nineties, he migrated to Nashville, becoming a key figure in the rough-edged East Nashville scene. His 2004 album East Nashville Skyline is considered essential to the alt-country catalog.


	“I've always been into being a troubadour. I love the chaos, that life of adventure — that's what struck me. I had a predisposition for it,” Snider told Rolling Stone in 2023. “I was a hitchhiker and sofa circuit person. Jerry Jeff made me see that the difference between a free spirit and a freeloader is three chords on the guitar.”

	Along with Walker, Snider befriended and learned from songwriting greats like Billy Joe Shaver, John Prine, Jimmy Buffett, Guy Clark, and Kris Kristofferson. “Nobody's ever deserved there to be a heaven more than John Prine,” Snider told Rolling Stone in 2020 following the singer-songwriter's death. “And if there's not a heaven, they oughta get one together pretty quick, because John's coming.”The loss of each of those guiding lights for Snider (Walker died six months after Prine) shook the musician — “I sing about dead friends more than girls these days,” he said in the press materials for what would be his last album, 2025's High, Lonesome and Then Some. But they also left him as the flag-bearer for a certain type of songwriting, one informed by lived experiences, both good and bad, and plainspoken, honest lyricism. 

	











	“One thing I learned from John Prine is if you're not embarrassing yourself, then I don't know,” Snider told Rolling Stone in 2014. “You don't want to just be that guy, trying to present themselves as the perfect product. I'm not a product. You know, like Kathie Lee Gifford-type people. I just saw her on TV. And if she wrote a book, I bet you it would just be full of her not ever making mistakes.”

	Snider reveled in life's mistakes — whether he learned from them or not wasn't the point. “You're gonna mix my emotions and you're gonna tangle my net/You're gonna make me do somethin'/that I'm afraid I won't regret,” he sang in the bold-faced cheating song “Trouble,” off his 1994 debut, Songs for the Daily Planet. The fan favorite “Alright Guy,” off that same LP, found him admitting flaws like smoking too much weed and having a propensity for getting arrested. “But I think I'm an alright guy,” he countered in the lyrics. 


	In his 2014 memoir, I Never Met a Story I Didn't Like, Snider openly shared many of his missteps with the world, proving himself just as fearless an author as he was a songwriter. In one tale, he recalled an onstage meltdown during a show in L.A.; in another, he detailed an incident in which Jimmy Buffett, infuriated by Snider's refusal to play the song “Talkin' Seattle Grunge Rock Blues” in his opening set, pelted him with fruit.


	That mix of stubbornness and courageousness is what endeared Snider to fans and peers alike. While artists from Gary Allan and Mark Chesnutt to Loretta Lynn and Tom Jones all recorded his songs, and he released Songs for the Daily Planet (with Buffett's help) on the major label MCA, Snider never abandoned his DIY roots. He put out a strings of albums for Prine's indie label, Oh Boy Records, beginning with 2000's Happy to Be Here and culminating with the 2004 masterpiece East Nashville Skyline. The latter contained one of Snider's signatures, “Play a Train Song,” which Robert Earl Keen recorded in 2011.

	In 2008, Snider founded his own label, Aimless Records, and issued the EP Peace Queer, a collection of politically biting songs. In 2012, he paid tribute to Walker with an album of his songs, and then unflinchingly probed life in a haves-and-have-nots America with Agnostic Hymns and Stoner Fables, released that same year.

	











	Snider toured relentlessly, both solo and as part of his side project Hard Working Americans with Widespread Panic's Dave Schools and the late guitarist Neal Casal. On the road, he entertained crowds with his dry wit and wealth of stories. At one show, he found himself performing with his friend, the comedian Richard Lewis, who opened for Snider and then laughed at him from the balcony when the crowd filtered out ahead of the musician's set. Snider didn't mind. “If you can play and sing, you can go anywhere you want and you don't need any money,” Snider once told RS.


	But the rigors of the road took their toll and Snider developed debilitating back issues, which he medicated with pills. Various battles with drug addiction and stints in rehab pockmarked his career. Still, Snider soldiered on with music, playing livestreamed shows during the pandemic from his studio-slash-clubhouse, the Purple Building, in East Nashville, and releasing latter-day albums like 2021's First Agnostic Church of Hope and Wonder and 2023's Crank It, We're Doomed. In the fall of 2025, he released High, Lonesome and Then Some, an album of loping blues-like numbers with titles like  “Unforgivable (Worst Story Ever Told).”


	Despite his chronic pain, Snider, ever the road warrior, was determined to tour behind the album. “I at least want to do it one more time,” he said. Shortly after the tour commenced, however, it was canceled after Snider was involved in a murky incident in Salt Lake City, Utah, that landed him in jail.

	“It's all heartache,” Snider told Rolling Stone in October, offering a glimpse into the ongoing emotional and physical struggles he was facing. “I wouldn't say I'm better, and I don't think I'm going to get better, but the last decade was hard in my personal life,” he said. “In the last couple of years, it's gotten harder, and I felt like the title [High, Lonesome and Then Some]. I sat out here by myself and had, like, a dark night of the soul.”


	“How do we move forward without the one who gave us countless 90 minute distractions from our impending doom?,” a message announcing Snider's death read. “The one who always had 18 minutes to share a story. We'll do it by carrying his stories and songs that contain messages of love, compassion, and peace with us. Today, put on one of your favorite Todd Snider records and ‘play it loud enough to wake up all of your neighbors or at least loud enough to always wake yourself up.'”

	While the dangers of fentanyl have been dominating headlines for years, the death toll from another class of extremely potent synthetic opioids called “nitazenes” has been climbing steadily. For decades, knowledge of nitazenes — also called benzimidazole opioids — was limited to those researching opioid pharmacology, but that all changed in 2019, when the drugs emerged on the illicit street drug market — first in Europe, then in the United States. While it started out in eight countries, it had spread to 19 by 2022. According to the United Nation Office on Drugs and Crime's World Drug Report 2025, nitazenes' presence on the illegal drugs market have been increasing for the past five years, and represents a growing threat to public health. But it's unclear how nitazenes entered the world's drug supply to begin with, as there has never been public demand for the drugs. 


	The major concern is with nitazene overdose deaths. This is, in part, because isotonitazene — the most common nitazene, also known as “ISO” — is five to nine times stronger than fentanyl, which itself is generally 25 to 50 times stronger than heroin, which is about twice as strong as morphine. All that is to say that less than 2mg of ISO — the equivalent of the tip of a pencil or a few grains of sand — can kill you, says Brian Townsend, a retired supervisory special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and founder and president of Only 2mg Inc., a nonprofit addressing the use of fentanyl and other emerging illicit substances.

	At this point, there are limited data on the number of nitazene deaths in the United States. The closest thing we have are the findings of two studies, though neither could provide detailed estimates of the scope of nitazene deaths globally, and are likely undercounts of the extent of nitazene overdose in the Americas. The first found that nitazenes played a role in at least 200 overdose deaths in Europe and North America from 2020 to 2021. The second found 93 fatalities in 2022 from eight case reports primarily from the United States.

	Here's what to know about nitazenes, why they're taking off, and their implications on public health. 


	Nitazenes are a class of potent synthetic opioid created in the 1950s as an alternative to morphine, but never approved for medical use because of their potential for overdose, Townsend tells Rolling Stone. Fentanyl was created during the same period, he adds. 


	“They are unrelated to opioids derived from morphine or fentanyl, but function similarly by acting on opioid receptors to cause effects like analgesia, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, and even overdose and death,” says Ryan Marino, MD, a toxicologist and expert in addiction medicine at University Hospitals in Cleveland.


	Nitazenes come in many forms, including pills, powders, and sprays — both in “pure” form and mixed with other drugs like heroin, fentanyl, and benzodiazepines. Nitazenes can be ingested intravenously, intranasally, orally, sublingually, and by inhalation (vaping).


	Nitazenes work by binding to the opioid receptors to stop or reduce the intensity of pain, just like heroin, fentanyl, or other opioids, Townsend explains. “The problem is they are super strong, and they slow down the part of your brain that tells you to breathe,” he explains. “This is what causes respiratory depression. We sometimes refer to this as the ‘sleepy death.'”


	In the U.S., clonitazene and etonitazene — two types of nitazenes — were included in the original Controlled Substances Act of 1971 as Schedule 1 drugs, which have a high potential for abuse, and don't currently have an accepted medical use. In 2020, the DEA classified isotonitazene as a Schedule 1 substance, and since then, seven other nitazenes have been similarly scheduled.

	Despite being illegal, enforcing the law is difficult. “The chemicals that make up nitazenes are fairly inexpensive and also easy to access and inexpensive to make the drug, causing it to become more prevalent in communities worldwide,” says Jessica Steinman, chief clinical officer at No Matter What Recovery in Los Angeles. 


	It's also difficult to get accurate numbers demonstrating the scope of the problem because we can't reliably detect nitazenes. “Standard fentanyl test strips don't pick up nitazenes, and most hospital toxicology panels don't include them, which means overdoses get misidentified and deaths are underreported,” says Jason Bernstein, LMFT, detox/residential and dual diagnosis outpatient clinical director at Clear Behavioral Health. “For people managing addiction this is destabilizing, because harm reduction strategies fall apart when you can't test for the most dangerous thing in the supply.”

	











	According to Marino, it's unclear why nitazenes entered the drug supply in the first place, and people do not seek them out, nor has there been known demand for them. “They may be a response to efforts to reduce the supply of other opioids, and even other drugs like benzodiazepines,” he tells Rolling Stone. “In almost every case where nitazenes are found, they are added to other drugs, primarily fentanyl, and not advertised as containing nitazenes when sold.” Between 2019 and 2023, nitazenes have been identified in at least 4,300 law enforcement drug seizures in the United States. 


	Though we don't have a complete picture of nitazene deaths, we do know that they're taking place across the country. For example, a study conducted in 2022 and 2023 found nitazenes in wastewater samples from Washington and Illinois. The Ohio Department of Health reported seven nitazene-related overdose deaths in the state in 2020, followed by an average of 57 deaths in 2021 and 2022, and 77 in the first six months of 2023.


	While there weren't any nitazene-related deaths in Tennessee in 2019, there were 92 between 2020 and 2023. Most of the overdoses also involved fentanyl. Additionally, the Pennsylvania health department has reported at least 50 fatal overdoses associated with nitazenes since 2020, with a record 29 deaths in 2024.


	Similar to other opioids, naloxone can reverse a nitazene overdose. However, because of the potency of nitazenes, multiple doses of naloxone may be needed.


	According to Justin Gurland, a licensed master social worker specializing in addiction, there isn't a particular demographic that's intentionally seeking out nitazenes. “That's part of what makes them so dangerous,” he tells Rolling Stone. “Most people taking them don't even know they're taking them. Nitazenes are being mixed into heroin, counterfeit pain pills, and even non-opioid drugs, so they're reaching people who never set out to use an opioid in the first place.” 


	Nitazenes are becoming increasingly popular because they're inexpensive, strong, and addictive, Townsend says. “They're cheap, so drug traffickers ‘cut' their drug supply and make more money,” he explains. “They are powerful, enhancing or intensifying the drug high. I've had a lot of people who struggle with substance abuse tell me they seek this out [for] the stronger highs. Finally, they're addictive, which means repeat customers and more money for the drug traffickers adding these poisons to their supply.” And because of nitazenes' potency, “doses can be very small, which makes them easy to hide or transport from place to place,” Steinman tells Rolling Stone. 

	











	Many experts believe that nitazene analogues may have entered the recreational drug markets to replace fentanyl analogues after the enactment of class-wide fentanyl analogue bans in China and the United States, says Marthe M. Vandeputte, a researcher in the laboratory of toxicology at Ghent University in Belgium. 


	On July 1, 2025, China implemented a generic ban targeting nitazene analogues. “This means that, with one scheduling order, the large majority of nitazenes known to date has been made illegal in China, which is known to be the main production country,” Vandeputte tells Rolling Stone. “Given China's important role in the production of nitazenes, we expect that this may have a significant impact on the new synthetic opioid market in the upcoming year, as fewer new nitazene analogues may enter the markets.” But she says that we may see the appearance of other classes of synthetic opioids instead. 


	“In addition, the 2022 Taliban-imposed ban on opium poppy cultivation may impact the heroin supply in Europe and elsewhere, which may further fuel the rise of synthetic opioids such as nitazenes,” she says. 


	More than 20 different nitazene variants have emerged since 2019, and new ones keep appearing. “As soon as one compound gets scheduled, manufacturers tweak the molecule slightly and produce something that's technically not illegal yet,” Bernstein says. “What started in heroin has now spread to stimulants, depressants and counterfeit pharmaceuticals. If you're buying any street drug right now you're potentially at risk.”


	For Luke Archibald, MD, section chief of addiction psychiatry at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire, all the unknowns surrounding nitazenes are concerning — especially because they're made up of a group of chemicals with potentially different properties, like varying potencies and responses to naloxone. “It is worrisome to not know what may be contained in any given supply, and there are reports of nitazenes contained in counterfeit pills that may be marketed as other substances and ingested by opioid-naïve individuals,” he tells Rolling Stone.


	Nitazenes' potency is also troubling. “Even a trace amount — a dose small enough to fit on the tip of a pin — can slow or stop breathing,” Gurland says. “And the difference between a ‘dose' and a fatal overdose can be microscopic.”

	According to Gurland, the biggest concern is that most people using them don't know they're using them, because nitazenes are showing up in counterfeit pills and powders, mixed into what looks like oxycodone, heroin, or even non-opioid drugs. “For people already living with addiction, that unpredictability makes every use potentially lethal. It's not just about potency — it's about invisibility,” he explains. “They're hard to detect, and labs often don't test for them. That's why they're being called the next wave in the synthetic opioid crisis.”

	











	Like fentanyl, nitazenes are quickly becoming a public health issue. “That combination of strength and stealth is what makes them so dangerous,” Gurland says. “People don't know what they're taking, first responders don't always know what they're dealing with, and standard drug tests can even miss them. So you have this invisible risk spreading through communities that are already stretched thin by the opioid crisis.”

Kiss paid tribute to Ace Frehley before the band's first show since the death of their former guitarist in October.


	Speaking before the band's first KISS Kruise: Landlocked In Vegas on Friday, Paul Stanley addressed the crowd about the late Spaceman.


	“Obviously, before we get going — and we're going to have an awesome time — we just wanted to take a moment to think about about somebody who was at the foundation of this band. And we're talking about Ace,” Stanley said. 


	“We certainly had differences, but that's what family is about. Why don't we take a moment, little quiet, and think about him looking down on us – from [the planet] Jendell, probably – and let's have a moment for Ace.”


	Following a moment of silence, the crowd outside the Virgin Hotels broke into a chant of “Ace! Ace! Ace!” while Stanley encouraged them to hold plastic candles in the air to honor the guitarist.

	Frehley died Oct. 16 at the age of 74 from injuries he sustained in a fall. “Our hearts are broken. Ace has passed on. No one can touch Ace's legacy.” Simmons said in a statement at the time. “I know he loved the fans. He told me many times. Sadder still, Ace didn't live long enough to be honored at the Kennedy Ctr Honors event in Dec. Ace was the eternal rock soldier. Long may his legacy live on!”

Donald Trump is not known for sticking to the subject. Ask him about the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk, his young and influential political ally, and he'll pivot to talking about construction of a White House ballroom. Get him on stage for a campaign rally days before an election and you might hear him riff on the size of golfing legend Arnold Palmer's genitalia. And, of course, if he's addressing the issue of immigration, there's always the chance that “the late, great Hannibal Lecter” might come up.


	Lately, the president has seen fit to repeatedly digress on something that he has no grasp on and has never once been asked to explain: magnets. How he came to be so fixated yet misinformed on a phenomenon typically explored in seventh grade science class remains something of a puzzler, but it's clear that he has strong feelings on the matter. Trump's main takeaway seems to be that magnetism is fundamentally unexplainable and therefore unreliable as an element of human technology. Here, we take a look at his history of wrestling with the principle of physics that allows you to put up pictures on your refrigerator.     

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Believe it or not, Trump actually used to like magnets — at least for metaphorical purposes. In the years leading up to his 2016 presidential run, he was still playing the role of business guru, using his Twitter account to dispense nuggets of advice like this one: “Set the example, and you'll be a magnet for the right people. That's the best way to work with people you like.” 

	











	Trump tweeted some version of this quote — which comes from his 2009 book Think Like a Champion: An Informal Education In Business and Life — several times in 2014 and 2015, evidently liking the sound of it. But once he became a presidential candidate, he started talking about magnets in a negative (though still figurative) light. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to “turn off the jobs and benefits magnet” attracting immigrants to the United States. In 2018, when he argued that armed teachers would deter school shootings, he tweeted that a “‘gun free' school is a magnet for bad people.” And in a nonsensical passage of a 2019 speech to the Faith & Freedom Coalition, he accused Democrats of failing to address “the magnets of child smuggling.”

	Though Trump had yet to publicly reveal his ignorance of literal magnetism, a few of his detractors early on drew a connection between him and the 2010 Insane Clown Posse song “Miracles,” in which the rap duo famously ask: “Fucking magnets, how do they work?” Early in the 2016 election cycle, one Twitter user posted a meme of ICP's Shaggy 2 Dope delivering the magnets line, adding the caption “Trump doesn't know how Magnets work. #LittleKnownCandidateFacts.” It was a generic insult to Trump's intelligence that would later prove to be remarkably accurate. 


	Throughout his first term, Trump repeatedly criticized the design of the new Gerald R. Ford class of Navy aircraft carriers, and was reportedly fixated on one element in particular: the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), which launches planes with electric currents, replacing older steam-powered catapults. He claimed shortly after taking office in 2017 that he'd been informed that there were problems with the new system, saying that it “costs hundreds of millions of dollars more money and it's no good,” and that “ you have to be Albert Einstein to figure it out.”


	Trump again rambled about magnetic catapults in a 2018 meeting with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “They're using magnets instead of steam,” he griped. “It's frankly ridiculous.” He continued to insist that the upgraded launch system was running into technical problems and too expensive, telling the attendees at a National Republican Congressional Committee dinner in 2019 that “you have to go to MIT to figure out how this damn thing works.” He seemed to be under the mistaken impression that the EMALS didn't work at all. “We have an aircraft carrier, you can't send planes off the damn thing,” he said.

	Trump didn't have much cause to bring up magnets after he was voted out of office in 2020, but as he embarked on his 2024 comeback, his peculiar contempt for them came roaring back. During an Iowa rally during the Republican primaries, he blasted not only the “stupid electric catapults” on the Gerald R. Ford carriers but the installation of magnetic elevators for the planes rather than hydraulic ones. 


	This time around, he added a novel theory on the properties of magnets. “Think of it, magnets,” he said. “Now, all I know about magnets is this. Give me a glass of water. Let me drop it on the magnets. That's the end of the magnets.” Trump was apparently suggesting that magnets are generally unsuitable for an ocean-faring vessel, but as many commentators pointed out, getting a magnet wet does not destroy it or diminish its magnetic properties.


	In February 2025, reinstalled in the White House and taking questions from reporters at the swearing in of Tulsi Gabbard as Director of National Intelligence, Trump once more returned to the bugbear of magnetic elevators. Segueing from a tangent in which he explained his dissatisfaction over contract negotiations with Boeing on the price of new Air Force One jets, he began to complain about cost overruns on the Gerald R. Ford.


	“They have all magnetic elevators to lift up 25 planes at a time, 20 planes at a time,” he said. “And instead of using hydraulic, like on tractors, that can handle anything from hurricanes to lightning to anything, they used magnets. It's a new theory, magnets are going to lift the planes up, and it doesn't work.”


	Trump also tried out his routine during remarks on the Navy crew of the U.S.S. George Washington in Japan during a tour of East Asia last month, encouraging them to shout out their support for steam catapults instead of the electromagnetic system.


	“Let me ask you the second question,” he continued. “Hydraulic for your elevators, or magnets? You know, the new thing is magnets. So instead of using hydraulic that you can be hit by lightning and it's fine, you take a little glass of water and you drop it on magnets, I don't know what's gonna happen.” He then vowed to sign an executive order to ensure that all aircraft carriers are built with steam launch systems and hydraulic elevators rather than using magnets for either.  


	This week, Trump delivered his most confounding comments on magnets to date, confirming that he does not understand what they are in the slightest. 

	











	In an interview with Laura Ingraham of Fox News, Trump discussed his trade war with China, which eased somewhat after he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed last month to roll back certain retaliatory tariffs. As part of the temporary truce, China also agreed to suspend limits on exports of rare earth metals, some of which are used to make magnets. The nation is far and away the global leader in refining these elements to make parts for electronic devices.


	“President Xi was willing to do the rare earth thing, that's magnets,” Trump told Ingraham. “Now, nobody knows what a magnet is. If you don't have a magnet, you don't make a car. You don't make a computer. You don't make televisions and radios and all the other things — you don't make anything.” Trump went on to give an account of his discussions with Xi. “Because of tariffs, I called, I said, ‘Listen, here's the story. You're going to play the magnet. I'm going to play the tariff on you,'” he said.


	Trump didn't elaborate on why he believes magnets to be fundamentally mysterious, though that can hardly be considered slip of the tongue, because he made the same claim later that day.

	That evening, speaking from the Oval Office at the swearing in of businessman Sergio Gor as ambassador to India, Trump went off about China, tariffs, and, of course, magnets. “China was going to hit us with rare earth,” he said. “Now, everybody says, ‘What does that mean?' Magnets. If China refused to give magnets because they have a monopoly on magnets because they were allowed to — it happened over a 32-year period — there wouldn't be a car made in the entire world, there wouldn't be a radio, there wouldn't be a television, there wouldn't be internet, there wouldn't be anything because magnets are such a part — Now, nobody knows what magnets are, and not overly sophisticated, but to build a magnet system would take two years.”


	How long until we hear another of the president's philosophical musing on magnets? No matter the time, place, or matter at hand, he is drawn to the topic as if by an unseen force. And he seems to be increasingly convinced that they are some kind of plot to undermine American power and prosperity. Whatever he once heard about magnets being untrustworthy, it must have really stuck.

	The cause of death of Cleto Escobedo III, longtime bandleader of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, has been revealed.


	According to the musician's death certificate, obtained by TMZ, cardiogenic shock was listed as the immediate cause of death. Rolling Stone has also confirmed that Escobedo died at UCLA Medical Center following complications related to a liver transplant.


	Vasodilatory shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation and alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver were listed as underlying causes. Per the document, additional conditions that contributed to Escobedo's death include sepsis, graft versus host disease, immunosuppressed, chronic kidney disease, and pneumonia. 


	The Mayo Clinic states that cardiogenic shock is a “life-threatening condition” that occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. While it is often caused by a “large or severe heart attack,” not everyone who suffers from a heart attack has cardiogenic shock, per the site.

	Escobedo's childhood friend, Jimmy Kimmel, announced news of his death at age 59 earlier this week. During his Tuesday night monologue, Kimmel paid tribute to his pal. “It's just not fair,” Kimmel said, breaking into tears. “He was the nicest, most humble, kind, and always funny person.” The host added, of the their shared success, “He loved me. He loved seeing all of this happen. He loved being a part of it. He never took it for granted…. He was just a great older brother. No baggage, all love. There's no one in my life I felt more comfortable with.”

	











	Keyboardist-musical arranger Jeff Babko, who worked with Escobedo for more than 30 years at the late-night show, also honored his friend and spoke with Rolling Stone about the bandleader. “Musically, Cleto loved groove. He loved Stevie Wonder, Rufus, Donny Hathaway, Tower of Power, Sting. He loved the truth. His playing was soulful, genuine — no math, no patterns, no cerebral showing-off. Just purpose and soul. Every note meant something,” said Babko. “He fought until the bitter end to stay here for his family. Last night, his wife said, ‘I never wanted to do this alone.' And I said, ‘You couldn't be less alone.' He spent a lifetime building friendships — deep, wide, loyal friendships. A chosen brotherhood. And I'm just so lucky I got to be his friend.”

A pair of factory workers reckon they've inadvertently filmed a 'dish-shaped' UFO soaring through the sky. Alex Ramage and Andrei Volk were merely testing the zoom on their phone camera by filming an aeroplane when they spotted something that left them gobsmacked.

The footage, captured during their work break in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, US, on Tuesday 4 November, reveals a mysterious oval entity 'gliding' across the sky. The duo were dumbfounded upon reviewing the peculiar footage, with the UFO sighting convincing Alex, 33, that they'd stumbled upon proof of extraterrestrial life.

Both Alex and Andrei, 38, adamantly deny doctoring the video and are at a loss to explain what the unidentified object could be. Alex, hailing from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, expressed: ""We thought it was pretty wild and we were freaking out about it.

""We were filming the plane to check out the zoom on a Samsung's phone camera then we happened to replay the video and see the little dish-shaped thing.

""To me it looks like you can make out a dome shape in the middle of the disk, like a traditional UFO people imagine.

""It looked way different than the movement of a plane. It was gliding so I don't think it was anything like that.

""We were in shock and awe because I've always believed in UFOs but to experience it for myself is amazing.

""It was a speechless moment because we were just randomly filming something. What are the odds?""

The video, captured by factory workers at 12.13pm, left social media users scratching their heads, with some asserting it as proof of extraterrestrial life, while others remained sceptical.

One user remarked: ""Looks like it's rotating around. Wow.""

Another declared: ""They're here! Have been for a very long time.""

However, one individual simply dismissed it, stating: ""Not a UFO!""

It comes as evidence of UFOs visiting Earth may have been discovered in a study of a treasure trove of photos of the night sky from the 1950s.

Scientists have been examining images taken before the beginning of the Space Age and have discovered mysterious flashes of light that appear in one image and then vanish in the next. Studies suggest that some of those blips may be sunlight bouncing off flat, reflective objects high above Earth, years before Russia launched the first satellite, Sputnik.

DuBOIS — A quick stop at Junk Dealer's Daughter, a quaint antique shop in downtown DuBois, turned into a literary milestone for author Sherry A. Burton, whose hit paranormal mystery series has now anchored one of its latest chapters right here in central Pennsylvania.

Burton, the Michigan-based author of the Jerry McNeal series, never expected that a February getaway would inspire Book 16 of her growing franchise, or that she would write local shop owner Darius Clement into the story.

“As soon as I walked into The Junk Dealer's Daughter, I felt the history,” said Burton. “Darius started talking about the building, the old hidden staircase, the tunnels, and the story just came to me. I could see Jerry and his ghost dog solving a mystery right there.”

Now, Clement and his downtown DuBois antique store are featured in “Hidden Treasures,” Book 16 in the Jerry McNeal paranormal mystery series, a collection beloved by readers for its bite-sized thrillers, ghostly twists, and quirky canine sidekick.

Burton's path to authorship wasn't traditional. In fact, it wasn't even planned.

“I had a friend going through a rough time, and I told her I'd write her a happy ending,” she recalled. “I don't even know why. But I started writing, and the voices just showed up. That turned into my first book.”

That first novel, “Tears of Betrayal,” was published in 2011 and remains a steady seller. Originally traditionally published, Burton quickly realized she was doing most of the work without the reward.

“My editor at the time said, ‘You should go indie.' And I did,” she said. “Now I run everything. I have a team — an editor, a proofreader, beta readers, cover artists. And my books are available in bookstores, on Amazon, and Kindle Unlimited.”

Today, Burton juggles multiple genres, including romance, psychological suspense, and historical fiction.

The Dog That Stole the Series

The original Jerry McNeal book was only supposed to be a standalone.

“It was meant to be about Jerry, a Pennsylvania state trooper and veteran with psychic abilities,” said Burton. “But I added the ghost dog Gunter, and my mom read it and said, ‘The dog is the book.' I said, ‘He's only in this one,' and she said, ‘Nope. The dog stays.'”

Burton listened, and Gunter has since become the heart of the series. The dog now appears on every book cover, drawing in readers of all ages.

“People say they're ‘potato chip books,'” she laughed. “They pick one up and suddenly they're reading the whole series.”

Each book runs about 200 pages, making them quick, engaging reads that are appropriate for all ages.

“I had a friend who said big books intimidate him. He saw one of mine and said, ‘I could read this.' That stuck with me,” Burton said.

It was Gunter's ghostly sniffing and Jerry's investigative intuition that led Burton to imagine a DuBois-based mystery after walking through Clement's antique shop. She had barely stepped into the store before asking the owner if she could write him into her next book.

“I was flattered, and totally on board,” said Clement. “I grew up loving mysteries. To end up in one? That's something else.”

The store's historic quirks, including a now-hidden staircase and rumors of underground tunnels, became core elements of “Hidden Treasures.”

“It was like the building was begging to be written about,” said Burton.

DuBois readers now stop in to visit the “real” setting of their favorite chapters. Clement even keeps a copy of the book handy for fans.

“I call it a Jerry McNeal pilgrimage,” he joked. “People come in, buy antiques, and ask where the ghosts were hiding.”

In the latest books, Jerry and Gunter travel from DuBois to nearby Punxsutawney and then on to a cruise ship in Book 18. Burton writes as the story unfolds, rarely outlining, instead letting the characters lead.

“I'm working on Book 19 now,” she said. “We're planning a trip to Charleston, and I already know I'll set a story there. The books tell me where they want to go.”

She also recently met the voice behind her audiobook series, narrator Bethanne Reid, based in Doylestown.

“She's incredible,” Burton said. “Beth morphs into each character — Jerry, Bunny, everyone. She is the voice of the series. You can get it on Audible or directly from my site.”

The books are also available in eBook and Kindle Unlimited formats, and readers can use the Kindle app to access them on any device, including iPads.

In addition to her paranormal success, Burton is known for her Orphan Train Saga, a heavily researched historical fiction series inspired by the real-life relocation of more than 250,000 children from New York to the American Midwest between 1854 and 1929.

“It started with curiosity. I had never heard of the Orphan Trains,” she said. “Once I started digging, I knew I had to tell these stories.”

Her saga is endorsed by the National Orphan Train Complex as historically accurate and includes in-depth research and lectures.

“I'm now working on Book 8 of that series,” she said. “They're big books, with some over 100,000 words, and fully researched. One of the future orphans will definitely be placed in Pennsylvania.”

Burton's mother, who passed away after battling breast cancer, was her biggest cheerleader, and perhaps her most insightful editor.

“She'd hand out my business cards to nurses, tell people in waiting rooms, always promoting my work,” Burton remembered. “Now I like to say she's up there in heaven telling all the angels, ‘Have your people read my daughter's books.'”

The Jerry McNeal books are available in print, eBook, and audiobook. Readers can find them on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Kindle Unlimited, and directly through SherryABurton.com.

Mumbai— A resurfaced video of legendary filmmaker Satyajit Ray has renewed debate over long-standing allegations that his unmade screenplay The Alien was plagiarised and later emerged as the Hollywood blockbuster ‘E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'.

In the clip, Ray recounts how his science fiction script — developed years before Steven Spielberg's film — was nearly produced in the U.S. before the project collapsed under suspicious circumstances.

“Long before E.T., my science fiction screenplay was germinated from that story,” Ray says in the video. “I wrote a science fiction story called The Alien, full screenplay, which was supposed to be financed by Columbia. That is why I spent five weeks in Hollywood… It's only that I had a person who was working as a middleman, who behaved peculiarly, and the idea had to be dropped.”

Ray's screenplay featured a benevolent extraterrestrial befriending a rural boy — a premise many observers have argued bears striking similarities to the 1982 Hollywood classic.

A Visionary Whose Influence Reached Far Beyond India

Satyajit Ray, regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers in world cinema, left an indelible mark with works celebrated for their humanism, subtle emotional power, and visual precision. Born in Kolkata into a culturally prominent family, Ray's artistic formation was shaped by literature, music, and the teachings of Visva-Bharati University.

His breakthrough film, ‘Pather Panchali', made with limited resources and non-professional actors, won international acclaim, including at Cannes. It launched the landmark Apu Trilogy, which charted a boy's growth from rural Bengal to adulthood and established Ray as a global auteur.

Ray's filmography eventually grew to more than 30 films, including Charulata, Mahanagar, Jalsaghar, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, and Shatranj ke Khilari. Beyond directing, he was also an illustrator, writer, designer, and composer — often creating his own scores, typography, and poster art.

His lifetime achievements earned him numerous honors, including India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, and an Honorary Oscar in 1992.

A Debate That Still Resurfaces

While Ray never pursued legal action, his remarks about The Alien and its collapsed Hollywood deal have periodically rekindled discussion over the origins of E.T. The resurfaced video once again spotlights the unrealized project and the filmmaker's belief that his idea was appropriated.

Ray's legacy, however, remains defined not by controversy but by his pioneering contributions to world cinema — contributions that continue to inspire filmmakers decades after his passing.

Rumors and stories of special appearances made by Jesus Christ in the town of Dozulé, France, have been declared not true.

In the 1970s, a Catholic mother, Madeleine Aumont, reported seeing Jesus 49 times, sharing that the Lord told her to build an enormous cross in the French town.

The “Glorious Cross of Dozulé” was to be built to a height of over 2,000 feet; it also needed to be illuminated, according to claims.

There is a similar and smaller cross on display in the town. 

“The phenomenon of the alleged apparitions … is to be regarded, definitively, as not supernatural in origin, with all the consequences that flow from this determination,” text from the doctrinal office approved by Pope Leo XIV said.

“The Cross does not need 738 meters of steel or concrete to be recognized: It is raised every time a heart, moved by grace, opens itself to forgiveness.”

Dozulé is located in the middle of the Normandy region in northern France. 

The town had a population of 2,279 people in 2022, according to Ville-Data.

Father Patrick Mary Briscoe, a Dominican friar based in Rome, Italy, told Fox News Digital the Dozulé messages inspired curiosity in some circles.

“[The message was] never embraced by the wider Church,” he said. 

“Perhaps that is because the Church plainly teaches that the cross of Christ is the summit of revelation.

“The Church's decision is a reminder that our hope isn't in private revelations or sensational claims, but in the power of the sacraments and the truth of the Gospel.”

Father Briscoe said Pope Leo's approval of this declaration shows how seriously the church takes discernment in spiritual matters — “not to suppress faith, but to purify it” — and to ensure that faith is not anchored by emotion or speculation, but truth.

“It's clear that Pope Leo intends to speak directly to our scientific age,” Father Briscoe also said. 

“His recent comments on compulsive gambling and internet addiction, for example, show that he's thinking about pressing issues.”

He shared that doctrinal clarity helps protect Christian teaching from superstition and excess.

“The Vatican's discernment here safeguards authentic devotion. This is about protecting believers from confusion,” said Briscoe. “The Vatican isn't closing the door on devotion. Instead, Pope Leo is keeping the focus where it belongs — on Christ.”","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'New York Post'}","other"

Dark Horse has a new four-part miniseries from writer Kyle Starks and artist Piotr Kowalski. This one is called Devil on My Shoulder and follows the story of Tee, a character who faces unimaginable horrors from a group of five men. She survives the ordeal and vows to seek revenge, but what's unexpected is that her journey soon proves supernatural and otherworldly.

Issue #1 of Devil on My Shoulder is now available from Dark Horse, and recently Hollywood Soapbox exchanged emails with Starks to learn more about the character of Tee and what she encounters in this evil, evil world.

For the unbeknownst, Starks is the creative force behind the successful series Where Monsters Lie and Those Not Afraid. On this project, he's also joined by colorist Brad Simpson and letterer Josh Reed. Questions and answers have been slightly edited for style.

What inspired the creation of this story?

One of the things I love about horror as a genre is it's nearly unlimited list of sub-genres, and I often come up with these horror ideas watching some movie or reading some book and going, “Aw, man, I want to make one of those.” With Where Monsters Lie, it was a love letter to slashers. With Those Not Afraid, it was a love letter to serial killers and true crime, and with Devil on My Shoulder, I wanted to make a true bloody revenge like we haven't seen in awhile but to put a little Kyle Starks twist on it all.

The inspiration for the story itself was inspired by the truly awful, true story of the torture and death of Junko Furuta, which is a truly horrific tale, and honestly, I wanted to make a world where someone who suffered like that got their revenge on the group of monsters that did it to them. So it was a combination of the two.

Is the real world and what actually happens out there scarier than anything supernatural?

I think I sort of answer this with the last one! But what happened to Junko Furuta is worse and more terrifying than any demon or monster or boogeyman, in my opinion.

But you do bring the supernatural into the story, right?

Well, I don't want to spoil anything, but absolutely. This terrible event and its subsequent revenge definitely take place in a world with supernatural elements. The priest who finds our heroine, Tee, after her ordeal is an exorcist for the church. And if there's a world with exorcism, then there's a world of — you know, let's not say too much. Let's leave it at “yes.”

How would you describe the character of Tee?

Tee is your normal, average early 20s girl trying to figure out existing in the world when she's kidnapped, tortured for 40 days, left for dead and comes out the other side a murderous, single-minded, revenge-seeking killing machine. The Tee we see for the majority of the book is [on] a bloodthirsty engine of revenge who you don't want to be on the wrong side of. In a book full of nearly supernaturally bad and dangerous people, she's the most bad and dangerous.

What's it like working with Piotr Kowalski?

Piotr is the best! He's a great collaborator. He is extremely professional. He's always on time. Everything he sends in is always incredible. I think we work really well together — he seems to get my vision and is able to elevate the parts that need it without having to be given really any direction at all.

We had a blast working on the Where Monsters Lie franchise together, and my biggest takeaway was that Piotr is capable of drawing some really messed up stuff. And so he was a perfect partner for Devil on My Shoulder because it's full of messed up stuff. And he really stepped up his storytelling here, in my opinion. If you enjoyed his work on Where Monsters Lie — or any of the other numerous works he's contributed to — you'll love this. I feel like his work is very cinematic for this series.

Do you feel that the story has mileage to go beyond four issues?

I think it creates a world that there's more to be explored for sure, but when I approach these stories with the new status quo of four-issue series, I want to tell the best story for that moment. I'm not thinking past that. I think Tee has more stories we could tell, but I think Devil on My Shoulder is her best, most violent, most thrilling, most exciting one. For now, anyway.

Psychic Sally has shared her predictions on when she believes Kim Kardashian will pass the bar and finally qualify as a lawyer.

Kim, 45, confirmed she had failed the bar last Friday after originally taking the painstaking exam in July, two months after graduating from a four year California Law Office Study Program (LOSP).

The TV star, who also plays a divorce lawyer in new legal drama All's Fair, is keen to follow in her late father Robert Kardashian's footsteps by qualifying to practice law.

Kim recently admitted she was furious with her psychics for giving her false hope by incorrectly determining she would pass.

'I'm just letting you guys know that all of the f****** psychics we have met with, and that we're obsessed with, are all f****** full of s***', Kim said.

'They all collectively, maybe four them, told me I was gonna pass the bar, so they're all full pathological liars. Don't believe anything they say.'

Despite Kim's foul-mouthed phone tirade, medium Sally Morgan, 74, remains hopeful Kim will pass the bar, specifically in March 2026, and also predicted what the mother-of-four failed on.

Medium Sally Morgan remains hopeful Kim will pass the bar, specifically in March 2026, and also predicted what the mother-of-four failed on 

Kim confirmed she had failed the bar last Friday after originally taking the painstaking exam in July, two months after graduating from a four year California Law Office Study Program (LOSP) 

She told Daily Mail: 'I have so many feelings about this. I think it's going to come to light that there was a slight mistake on one of the papers that she had to sit. 

'I've got a feeling that she sat five papers and I think that the third section of her exam is what she failed on.'

'She very, very nearly passed', Sally insisted. 'She will sit again and I think by March 2026 she will have passed them.'

The medium added: 'They are not saying anything yet because she doesn't want to fall out with the law body or the university, who ever she is sitting the exams with.

'But I think they are already investigating it and she's furious because she had a special tutor as well. In my head I can see she will pass by March 2026.

'I think they were just waiting for her mother's 70th to be over before they start talking about it and she will actually say that she should have passed.'

Addressing Instagram followers last week, Kim confirmed she had failed the bar but remained fully focused on becoming a qualified lawyer.  

'Well...I'm not a lawyer yet, I just play a very well-dressed one on TV,' she began, referencing her portrayal of fiesty Allura Grant All's Fair.

'Six years into this law journey, and I'm still all in until I pass the bar. No shortcuts, no giving up - just more studying and even more determination.'

The disappointed star also praised those who have 'supported and encouraged me along the way so far.' 

She added: 'Falling short isn't failure - it's fuel. I was so close to passing the exam and that only motivates me even more. Let's Go!!!!!!!!!!'

A source close to Kim also told TMZ on the same day that the aspiring lawyer wanted to share how she fared on the bar exam for her fans.

Before the results were made public on Sunday, she reportedly wanted to announce it herself.

The insider explained that Kim wanted to continue being open about her journey to become a lawyer as she has done in the past. 

During a recent appearance on The Graham Norton Show, the reality star explained that she had taken the bar exam in July and that she was awaiting her results.

Her late father Robert Kardashian had been a lawyer and notably was the defense attorney for O.J. Simpson amid his 1995 murder trial; the pair seen above in 1995 in Los Angeles

Kim also expressed at the time that if the results showed that she passed, she had plans to be a lawyer in two weeks.

'I took the bar exam in July. I get the results a few days after our [All's Fair] premiere. So in two weeks. So everyone please pray for me. I worked really hard,' Kim said.

'Maybe in 10 years, I think I'll give up being Kim K and be a trial lawyer. That's what I really want.

From secret tunnels of lizard people to a cursed statue, Andrea Cavallier takes a look at the most bizarre conspiracy theories swirling around Denver International Airport

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Denver International Airport isn't just an airport – it's a secret underground bunker for the global elite; a Freemason headquarters; and possibly home to a colony of lizard people. That is, if you believe the slew of conspiracy theories that have circulated over the years. 

The bizarre stories started long before the first flight took off in 1995. 

Denver already had Stapleton International Airport, just ten miles from downtown. So when officials announced plans to build an even larger airport, residents were baffled. 

The official explanation was that Stapleton's runways were too close together, often forcing shutdowns during bad weather. But skeptics saw something else: a cover story for a much darker construction project.

When Denver International Airport finally opened, six years after breaking ground in 1989, it was enormous – twice the size of Manhattan – and $2 million over budget. 

To this day, the sprawling complex continues to be shrouded in secrecy and a magnet for conspiracy theories. And airport officials have leaned right in, plastering walls with signs for travelers: “Yes, the lizard people are real.”

For conspiracy theorists, the remote location, high costs and a slew of other unexplained claims could mean only one thing – something sinister was beneath the runways.

Here are some of the most bizarre conspiracy theories surrounding the airport.

One of the oldest and most persistent claims is that the airport's runways form the shape of a swastika. 

Aerial photos do show a pinwheel design, but aviation engineers have said that it's simply a practical layout that allows multiple planes to land in varying wind conditions.

But theorists insist the swastika-like shape is a nod to the Nazi-linked “New World Order” – the secret organization supposedly pulling the strings behind global governments.

There's also the airport's dedication capstone, a granite plaque near the main terminal that bears the Masonic square and compass symbol, and credits a group called the New World Airport Commission, according to VisitDenver.com. But the group doesn't exist which, of course, only fuels the fire.

Local historians say the “commission” was a short-lived committee formed to organize the airport's grand opening celebrations, named after Dvořák's New World Symphony. 

But to theorists, that's proof positive that the airport was funded by shadowy elites – either the Illuminati, the Freemasons, or both. The dedication date, March 19, 1994, doesn't help either: if you add up the numbers (1+9+1+9+9+4), you get 33, the highest level of Freemasonry. 

Even before stepping inside, the airport's most infamous resident greets you from the side of Peña Boulevard – a 32-foot-tall cobalt blue mustang with glowing red eyes. 

Officially named Mustang, locals call the fiberglass beast Blucifer.

Its fiery eyes, some say, are a reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Others believe they glow with the souls of the damned.

The real story is tragic enough. In 2006, a piece of the sculpture fell on 65-year-old artist Luis Jiménez during construction, severing an artery and killing him. 

His studio later completed the artwork and it was installed in 2008, more than 15 years after it was commissioned. 

While many believe the horse's glowing red eyes were portals to hell and evidence of Mustang's demonic nature, airport officials explain that the eyes are simply LED flood lights.

The red eyes are also a tribute to the artist's father, who owned a neon-sign shop in El Paso, Texas, where he apprenticed. Jiménez's wife Susan explained to Colorado Public Radio in 2019, that his death was a tragic accident and that the horse's eyes have no evil intent. 

She said she remembers an incident years ago where her husband heard a noise in their home and went to investigate. 

“He sees these two eyes,” she said. “And he said the hairs on the back of his neck stood up.”

But it turned out to be their horse Black Jack, the model for the Jiménez's final work, who had mysteriously broken into their living room. 

“And so [do the eyes] have anything to do with that incident and this kind of you're afraid of something but then it's OK [because you realize] it is familiar,” she said. “I don't know. But the eyes do not have any evil intent whatsoever.” 

A network of tunnels beneath the airport was built for a failed baggage system – but some say it's now home to reptilian humanoids, government bunkers, and alien research labs.

The airport's sprawling underground tunnels were built to service an ambitious, automated baggage system that never quite worked. 

So left behind was a labyrinth of unused tunnels and maintenance spaces, the perfect setting for decades of speculation.

Some believe these tunnels connect to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), 90 miles away in Colorado Springs. Others are convinced they house bunkers for the world's elite to wait out the apocalypse.

Airport officials say the tunnels are just what they look like – industrial corridors used for baggage transport and maintenance. Still, their scale and secrecy have ensured the myths live on.

Inside the terminals, artist Leo Tanguma's sprawling murals depicting war, destruction, and children in coffins have sparked endless debate over the years, and are, according to theorists, coded prophecies of the New World Order's plan for global domination. 

In one particularly infamous section, a soldier in a gas mask holds a sword over a dead dove as children cower nearby – a chilling image that theorists claimed symbolized a fascist future. 

Tanguma, however, insists the murals tell a story of hope, peace and environmental unity.

If the murals weren't bizarre enough, the airport once housed a 22-foot-tall statue of Anubis, the Egyptian god of death — installed briefly to promote a King Tut exhibit. 

Conspiracy theorists, of course, saw it as more proof of occult influence.

Nearby, two bronze gargoyles titled Notre Denver perch in open suitcases above the baggage claim. 

Artist Terry Allen said they were meant to protect travelers' luggage, but even they've joined the ranks of the airport's “suspect” decor. 

Today, new animatronic gargoyles talk to travelers, jokingly welcoming them to “Illuminati Headquarters … I mean, Denver International Airport.”

Rather than dismiss the wild claims, Denver International Airport has embraced its notoriety. 

The airport even launched a website, The DEN Files, a play on “The X-Files” TV show, documenting its favorite conspiracy theories.

During ongoing renovations, the airport has covered its construction walls with posters featuring aliens, pyramid eyes, and lizards in hard hats.

One reads: “What are we doing behind this wall? Adding new restaurants … or hiding the Illuminati?”

Another one shows one of the gargoyles in a TSA line and asks: “Streamlined security? Or more secrets?” 

But the truth, according to airport officials, is that the ads are part of a marketing series to promote the Great Hall Project, a large-scale renovation of the Jeppesen Terminal, slated to be finished in 2027. 

Or, is it just another secret?

The Dyatlov Pass Mystery — A True Story That Still Haunts Europe

Some mysteries are born from stories.

Some are born from superstition.

And then there are those rare, chilling enigmas that come from real events—events so frightening, so inexplicable, so painfully documented that even the most rational mind is forced to pause.



The Dyatlov Pass Incident is exactly that kind of mystery.

This is a case where all evidence exists, all people involved were real, and every photograph, autopsy report, and weather log is still preserved. Yet the conclusion of investigators—after months of searching—was a single phrase:



“A compelling natural force.”

A sentence as empty as the frozen mountains that swallowed nine young hikers one winter night in 1959.



A Journey That Should Have Been Ordinary



The story begins in the heart of Russia, in the cold expanse of the Ural Mountains. A group of nine university students, all trained hikers and physically fit, planned a challenging expedition as part of their certification.



Their leader was Igor Dyatlov, a passionate, disciplined traveler with a reputation for staying calm under pressure.

The group was joyful, well-prepared, and experienced enough to handle severe weather, snowfall, and mountainous terrain.



Their diary entries from the early days of the trip were cheerful—jokes about cold weather, photos of laughing faces, handwritten notes about warm food and tired feet.



Nothing suggested the horror that awaited them.



The Last Campsite—Frozen in Time



After days of traveling deeper into the wilderness, they reached a place called Kholat Syakhl, meaning “Mountain of the Dead” in the local Mansi language.



They set up their tent on the snowy slope.

It was the last normal moment any of them ever experienced.



When the search teams arrived weeks later, the first thing they found was the tent.

It wasn't blown over or ripped by wildlife.

It was still standing—but cut open from the inside, as if the hikers had slashed their way out in panic.



Inside the tent lay their boots, jackets, gloves, and supplies.

If trained hikers were fleeing into −30°C weather without essential gear, then whatever forced them out must have been far more terrifying than the freezing night.



Barefoot Footprints in the Snow



The snow around the campsite preserved everything like a photograph.



Searchers found barefoot footprints, along with prints of socks—and even one set that seemed to be a single bare heel dragging across the ice.



Imagine the level of fear required for experienced hikers to run barefoot into a mountain blizzard.



The tracks led downhill, toward a forest.

And that's where the bodies began to appear.



The First Bodies—A Scene of Desperation



At the edge of the woods, beneath a towering cedar tree, two hikers were found beside a small fire.

They were almost naked, their skin blue from cold, and their fingers blackened as though burned—like they had desperately tried to keep the flames alive until the last breath.



The cedar tree above them told its own story:



branches were broken nine feet high,

as if someone climbed in a frantic attempt to look back toward the campsite—

perhaps to see what had chased them.



Three More Victims, Frozen in Motion



Between the tree line and the tent, rescuers found three more bodies:



• one lying face upward

• one face downward

• and one in a crawling posture, as if frozen mid-movement while trying to return to safety.



Strangely, none had major injuries.

It looked as though they simply collapsed on their way back.



But the remaining four hikers told a story that defied all logic.



The Ravine of Terror



Months later, as the snow melted, another group of searchers stumbled upon a ravine.

There—buried under thirteen feet of snow—lay the last four hikers.



Their injuries were unlike anything the investigators expected:



• One had a crushed chest, with ribs broken inward.

• Another had massive skull fractures.

• A female hiker's tongue, eyes, and part of her lips were missing.

• Their clothing showed high levels of radiation, despite none of them working with radioactive materials.



Most disturbing of all:



Despite the internal injuries, there were no external wounds.

No claw marks, no weapon marks—nothing that matched the violent force inside their bodies.



A forensic doctor later compared their injuries to the impact of

“a car crash at high speed.”



What could exert that kind of force… in the middle of nowhere?



Strange Lights in the Sky



While the investigation continued, locals from the nearby Mansi community reported that on the night of the hikers' disappearance, they saw glowing orange orbs drifting silently across the sky.



Some rescuers also claimed they witnessed the same lights while searching.



Were these military weapons?

Meteors?

Something else entirely?



No one ever confirmed it.



Radioactive Clothing—A New Layer of Mystery



The radiation found on the hikers' clothes stunned everyone.



Autopsy teams checked twice.

Then three times.

Yet results were consistent:



Several garments had levels of radiation far above normal exposure.



The official explanation?

“Possibly contaminated by contact with military materials.”



Yet no military base nearby reported any incident.

And no secret test—at least publicly—took place there.



So why were the hikers irradiated?



The Government's Vague Conclusion



After months of interviews, autopsies, weather analysis, and scene reconstruction, Soviet investigators wrote their final line:



“The hikers died due to a compelling natural force.”



No details.

No theory.

No reasoning.



Just six words that answered nothing.



Then the files were sealed.

Access restricted.

Case closed.



It remained that way for decades.



Modern Theories—None Fully Explain the Nightmare



Countless theories arose after the Soviet collapse, when the files were finally opened:



• a military weapons test

• secret radiation experiments

• an avalanche (but the tent remained intact)

• infra-sound panic (a theory even scientists debate)

• animal attack (but no external wounds)

• a violent argument (they all fled together—unlikely)

• something supernatural



Some explanations solve pieces of the mystery…

but none solve all of it.



To this day, one fact stands unchallenged:



Nine trained hikers encountered something so terrifying

that they ran barefoot into a deadly blizzard—

and whatever happened afterward

was powerful enough to break bones from the inside.



The Mountain Still Waits



Today, the Dyatlov Pass is a tourist attraction.

Adventurers go there to recreate the famous route, take photos at the memorial, and feel the thrill of standing in the exact place where the world's most chilling outdoor mystery occurred.



But many who visit the site report something strange:



When the wind blows across the empty slope,

it carries a sound—

a low, human-like wail

that seems to echo from deep within the snow.



Is it just the wind?

Or is the mountain repeating the final night of nine lost souls?



No one can say for sure.



What remains is a mystery that refuses to die—

a puzzle of ice, fear, and silence

that has haunted Europe for more than six decades.

 The horrific mystery of the “Armchair Killer” is among a number of Coventry cold cases that have been highlighted by a new crime map revealing 1,000 unsolved murders. 

Every case has been the subject of a major police investigation, with some dating back to the pre-war era and others occurring in the last decade.

This exclusive list was compiled from Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to every police force in the country, supported by research through a wide variety of local newspaper archives.

 Read more: Coventry landlord fined for running unlicensed HMOs 

Cases include many seemingly random attacks, usually on women, carried out by strangers with no apparent motive.

The oldest Coventry cold case included in the files is the brutal murder of Penelope Mogano in January, 1954.

Penelope, aged 44, was found slumped in an armchair at her home. Her face had been mutilated with a carving knife, and she had been battered with, it was believed, a hammer.

In press reports from the time, the murderer was tagged as the “Armchair Killer”. Despite an exhaustive murder hunt, the killer has never been identified.

Other Coventry cases highlighted in the map include the mysterious disappearance of 18-year-old mum Nicola Payne, who vanished as she walked into fog on a wasteland known as Black Pad on the way to see her parents in 1991; and schoolboy Mark Billington, who was found dead in Meriden, two months after he vanished. It is thought he may have been a victim of child killer Brian Field, who died in prison last year, more than 20 years after he was jailed for the 1968 murder of 14-year-old Roy Tutill.

 You can search our interactive map to find out if there are any unsolved murders near you. 

 The online map has been produced to support the special publication Britain's 1,000 Unsolved Murders Vol II: Midnight Stalkers. It seeks to reexamine cold cases that have been held in the files of police forces nationwide, in some cases for decades. 

The publication includes a full timeline of 1,000 unsolved murders, dating from the pre-war period to the last decade, alongside more than 20 in-depth features.

Many of the cases are so famous that they remain locked in the national psyche, such as the Bible John murders that terrified Scotland during the 1960s.

Other mysteries - however shocking at the time - have been consigned to history, such as the Cardiff murders of Mabel Harper and Alice Pittman, who were both strangled during the wartime blackout.

Each remains an enigma, with families still seeking justice and answers - and in many cases, the murderer may still walk the streets.

We can't shift the chaos we're in until we name it. When we can recognize what's pushing us — in our personal lives and as a society — we already have a degree of freedom from it. Challenging information can paradoxically remind us of the greater good. It is the courage of the people and the love for the common good that brings these injustices to light—fueling open dialogue and constructive action.

Why the for-profit race into solar geoengineering is bad for science and public trust
November 4, 2025, MIT Technology Review
https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/11/04/1127532/why-the-for-profit...

As scientists who have worked on the science of solar geoengineering for decades, we have grown increasingly concerned about the emerging efforts to start and fund private companies to build and deploy technologies that could alter the climate of the planet. The basic idea behind solar geoengineering, or what we now prefer to call sunlight reflection methods (SRM), is that humans might reduce climate change by making the Earth a bit more reflective, partially counteracting the warming caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases. Many people already distrust the idea of engineering the atmosphere—at whichever scale—to address climate change, fearing negative side effects, inequitable impacts on different parts of the world, or the prospect that a world expecting such solutions will feel less pressure to address the root causes of climate change. Notably, Stardust says on its website that it has developed novel particles that can be injected into the atmosphere to reflect away more sunlight, asserting that they're “chemically inert in the stratosphere, and safe for humans and ecosystems.” But it's nonsense for the company to claim they can make particles that are inert in the stratosphere. Even diamonds, which are extraordinarily nonreactive, would alter stratospheric chemistry. Any particle may become coated by background sulfuric acid in the stratosphere. That could accelerate the loss of the protective ozone layer.

Note: Modifying the atmosphere to dim the sun involves catastrophic risks. Regenerative farming is far safer and more promising for stabilizing the climate. In our latest Substack, ""Geoengineering is a Weapon That's Been Rebranded as Climate Science. There's a Better Way To Heal the Earth,"" we present credible evidence and current information showing that weather modification technologies are not only real, but that they are being secretly propagated by multiple groups with differing agendas.

Dimming the sun ‘could make climate change worse'
November 5, 2025, Yahoo News
https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/dimming-sun-could-climate...

Deflecting the sun to fight climate change could trigger droughts and hurricanes, the Royal Society has warned. In a new report, experts argued solar radiation modification (SRM) could reduce global temperatures but “worsen rather than ease” climate change and make the sky look less blue. In May, the Government's Advanced Research and Invention Agency (Aria) announced £56.8m for 21 “climate cooling” projects, which include injecting aerosols into the sky to reflect sunlight away from Earth. However, the report found there were “major uncertainties” and argued the plan may have devastating knock-on effects, particularly if deployed by rogue groups. Prof Jim Haywood, of atmospheric science at the University of Exeter, said: “What you do in one place can cause climate change in a different place. “Stratospheric aerosol injection deployment in the northern hemisphere could impact the position of the tropical monsoon and lead to droughts in sub-Saharan Africa. “Everyone there relies on subsistence farming, so it quickly devastates if there is a drought there. “In the southern hemisphere, it could lead to an increase in North Atlantic hurricane frequency and intensity, it could lead to winter droughts over the Mediterranean and the Iberian Peninsula.” A “termination effect” whereby sun dimming technology was suddenly stopped, could also lead to rapid warming of up to 2C in decades, and cause devastating effects for ecosystems.

A climate scientist questioned his findings. It didn't go well.
June 10, 2024, Christian Science Monitor
https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2024/0606/climate-change...

Last year, a climate scientist named Patrick Brown, along with seven co-authors, published a study in the journal Nature about the connections between wildfires in California and global warming. Dr. Brown confessed in a Free Press article that he had framed his research not just to reflect the truth, but to fit within what he described as the climate alarmist storyline preferred by prestigious journals in the United States. He did this, he says, by intentionally focusing only on climate as a factor in wildfires, and not on the myriad other causes that contribute to the blazes consuming ever more land across the country. The formula for getting published, he wrote, “is more about shaping your research in specific ways to support pre-approved narratives than it is about generating useful knowledge for society.” And when it comes to climate science, he alleged, that preapproved narrative is that “climate change impacts are pervasive and catastrophic.” [Climate scientist] Dr. Pielke argues that many of the widely cited cost estimates connecting weather disasters to climate change are mistaken. (Climate advocates regularly assert that climate change is costing the U.S. billions of dollars every year.) His research, he says, shows that extreme weather appears costlier because properties are more valuable. In other words, wealth increase is the real story. He regularly takes issue with media portrayals of extreme weather. The reality is more complex, he says. If climate science doesn't make space for alternative viewpoints, it risks its foundational ideals of open inquiry and debate and rigorous, evidence-based critiques,

Top Scientists Deliberately Misrepresented Sea Level Rise For Years
October 24, 2025, Public on Substack
https://www.public.news/p/top-scientists-deliberately-misrepresented

For years, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, has claimed that human-caused climate change has accelerated sea level rise. But that claim is false. This does not mean that climate change isn't happening. It is. It simply means that it has not caused the sea level to rise. Top scientists know this fact and have deliberately misrepresented it for years, deceiving the public. In September, I reported on one of the first global studies  of sea level rise that used tide-gauge data, which is the only real-world data that goes back long enough, to the mid-19th Century, that would allow one to detect whether sea level rise had accelerated, decelerated, or remained steady. The only reliable long-term real-world data is tide gauge data, and they do not show acceleration. Since then, I exchanged over 50 emails with one of the world's leading sea level rise scientists, Robert Kopp from Rutgers University, and heard back from IPCC, NASA, and NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. What I learned shocked me. For years, the world's top scientists have known that they cannot prove there has been an acceleration of sea level rise, and yet they have told the public that they can. We've known since 2018 that 89% of the atoll islands that scientists and the media claimed would be destroyed by sea level rise had instead grown or stayed the same size. Sea level rise is not “observably accelerating” over time horizons that would show a trend. The only scientific basis for claiming it is accelerating is through modeling. The observable tide-gauge data do not show this.

An Obscure Military Program Helps Local Cops Buy Armored Cars and Spyware. It Might Balloon Under Trump.
October 30, 2025, The Intercept
https://theintercept.com/2025/10/30/military-gear-police-trump-1122/

Local cops have gotten tens of millions of dollars' worth of discounted military gear under a secretive federal program that is poised to grow under recent executive action. The 1122 program ... presents a danger to people facing off against militarized cops, according to Women for Weapons Trade Transparency. “All of these things combined serve as a threat to free speech, an intimidation tactic to protest,” said Lillian Mauldin, the co-founder of the nonprofit group, which produced the report released this week. The federal government's 1033 program ... has long sent surplus gear like mine-resistant vehicles and bayonets to local police. Since 1994, however, the even more obscure 1122 program has allowed local cops to purchase everything from uniforms to riot shields at federal government rates. The program turns the feds into purchasing agents for local police. Local cops have used the program to pick up 16 Lenco BearCats, fearsome-looking armored police vehicles. Those vehicles represented 4.8 percent of the total spending identified in the ... report. Surveillance gear and software represented another 6.4 percent, and weapons or riot gear represented 5 percent. One agency bought a $428,000 Star Safire thermal imaging system, the kind used in military helicopters. The Texas Department of Public Safety's intelligence and counterterrorism unit purchased a $1.5 million surveillance software license. Another agency bought an $89,000 covert camera system.

The Irony Of Trump's New 'War On Drugs': Recalling The History Of CIA Narco Trafficking
October 17, 2025, Zerohedge
https://www.zerohedge.com/political/irony-trumps-new-war-drugs...

Some 10,000 American troops are currently supporting the Trump-ordered counternarcotics operations in the Caribbean. At this point the military intervention has killed 27 people, including individuals who are likely not Venezuelan. President Trump's most recent explanation to reporters for this unprecedented Pentagon build-up off Venezuela's coast was surprisingly reminiscent of the failed ""war on drugs"" which hearkens all the way back to the days of Richard Nixon, when he famously declared it ""public enemy number one"". There was a time ... where the CIA itself was the biggest narco-trafficker in United States and perhaps the entire Western hemisphere. This was to fund regime change and covert operations in Latin America after a belated Congressional crackdown on taxpayer funding for black ops. In August 1996, the San Jose Mercury News [published a] series of articles linking the CIA's “contra” army to the crack cocaine epidemic in Los Angeles. During the 1980s the CIA helped finance its covert war against Nicaragua's leftist government through sales of cut-rate cocaine to South Central L.A. drug dealer, Ricky Ross. The CIA's drug network, wrote [journalist Gary] Webb, “opened the first pipeline between Colombia's cocaine cartels and the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles, a city now known as the ‘crack' capital of the world.” Black gangs used their profits to buy automatic weapons, sometimes from one of the CIA-linked drug dealers.

Note: Though President Richard Nixon launched the War on Drugs by declaring drugs “public enemy No. 1,” secretly he admitted in a 1973 Oval Office meeting that marijuana was “not particularly dangerous.” The War on Drugs is a trillion dollar failure that has been made worse by every presidential administration since Nixon.

The Top Secret Testimony of CIA's MKULTRA Chief, 50 Years Later
October 30, 2025, National Security Archive
https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/dnsa-intelligence/2025-10-30/top...

The CIA experienced “as many failures as successes” in exploring the intelligence applications of LSD and other drugs, according to the October 1975 U.S. Senate testimony of the Agency's former top chemist, Sidney Gottlieb, the man most closely associated with the notorious MKULTRA behavior control research projects. The long-secret transcripts of Gottlieb's testimony to the staff of the United States Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (“Church Committee”) were published today by the National Security Archive, 50 years after the historic intelligence oversight hearings, along with a selection of declassified CIA memos and other records concerning MKULTRA. The Church Committee transcripts are among the highlights of the Digital National Security Archive collection, CIA and the Behavioral Sciences: Mind Control, Drug Experiments and MKULTRA. Gottlieb was a key bureaucratic player who signed off on hundreds of MKULTRA subprojects and who developed clandestine relationships with universities, prisons, hospitals, private laboratories, and private foundations that made it difficult to trace the programs back to the Agency. The Church Committee faced considerable obstacles in reconstructing the story, especially since Gottlieb and CIA director Richard Helms destroyed most of the original project records in 1973.

Note: According to Gottlieb's testimony, the  CIA covertly dosed an unwitting individual with a massive amount of LSD to deliberately induce psychosis, causing him to experience violent paranoia and leading an unsuspecting psychiatrist to declare him mentally ill. This was done explicitly to discredit the man in the eyes of his colleagues—a tactic deemed as operationally useful for destroying a person's credibility without ever touching them.

Venezuela's Oil, US-led Regime Change, and America's Gangster Politics
November 4, 2025, Common Dreams
https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/us-regime-change-venezuela

The United States is dusting off its old regime-change playbook in Venezuela. Although the slogan has shifted from “restoring democracy” to “fighting narco-terrorists,” the objective remains the same, which is control of Venezuela's oil. The methods followed by the US are familiar: sanctions that strangle the economy, threats of force, and a $50 million bounty on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro as if this were the Wild West. In April 2002, a short-lived military coup briefly ousted then-President Hugo Chávez. The CIA knew the details of the coup in advance, and the US immediately recognized the new government. In the end, Chávez retook power. Yet the US did not end its support for regime change. In March 2015, Barack Obama codified a remarkable legal fiction. Obama signed Executive Order 13692, declaring Venezuela's internal political situation an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to US national security to trigger US economic sanctions. The White House has maintained that claim of a US “national emergency” ever since. Trump added increasingly draconian economic sanctions during his first term. The calls by the US government for escalation reflect a reckless disregard for Venezuela's sovereignty, international law, and human life. A war against Venezuela would be a war that Americans do not want, against a country that has not threatened or attacked the US, and on legal grounds that would fail a first-year law student.

Sweden's Secret to Well-Being? Tiny Urban Gardens.
July 8, 2025, New York Times
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/well/sweden-urban-gardens.html

In Stockholm, Stina Larsson, 98, stood among fragrant lilacs, lilies and lavender, inspecting the garden that she has tended for more than 40 years. Ms. Larsson's garden, situated on a postage stamp of land beside the Karlbergs Canal, is one of more than 7,000 garden allotments, known as koloniträdgårdar, in Stockholm. The gardens, established as part of a social movement around the turn of the 20th century, offer city dwellers access to green space and a reprieve from crowded urban life. Though most are modest in size — Ms. Larsson's garden is about 970 square feet — koloniträdgårdar are prized for providing a rare kind of urban sanctuary, a corner of the city where residents can trade pavement for soil, and the buzz of traffic for birdsong. The garden programs were specifically designed to improve the mental and physical health of city dwellers. The idea was that a working-class family would be able to spend the summer there and work together but also have some leisure and fun. Cecilia Stenfors ... at Stockholm University, said her research shows that those who frequently visit green spaces, whether a forest or a koloniträdgård, “have better health outcomes, in terms of fewer depressive symptoms, less anxiety, better sleep and fewer feelings of loneliness and social isolation.” These positive effects can be particularly pronounced in older people and can help combat symptoms of age-related mental and physical decline.

Quarter Century of Collecting Seeds From Around the World Safeguards Them From Extinction
October 24, 2025, Good News Network
https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/quarter-century-of-collecting-seeds...

A large chunk of the world's plant diversity lies safely tucked away underground for future generations. By the numbers, the Millennium Seed Bank holds over 2 billion seeds from over 40,000 species, collected by scientists and volunteers from 279 organizations spanning over 100 countries. It's likely the largest seed vault on Earth, with the other contender being located on the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard. Located at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew facility in Wakehurst, seeds from all over the world are carefully cleaned, dried, and stored in walk-in freezers at -20°C, or about -4°F. For 25 years, the work has been carried out by experts who have developed the skills not only to store the seeds, but also to wake them up again, often using bespoke protocols for seed germination. “Within species there is incredible genetic diversity, which protects against disease, climate change and other threats,” Dale Sanders, biologist and former director of the John Innes Centre in Norwich, told AP. “Maintaining that diversity is essential if we want to preserve the diversity of life itself.” For all the archiving and record keeping and preservation, the MSB is hardly just a storehouse. To the contrary, it's always growing something: funds for ecosystem restoration or botanical research, young scientists looking to begin a career in plant conservation, or plans to restore existing ecosystems by leveraging the vault's vast reserves.

Denver's Food Forests Provide Free Fruit While Greening the Environment
September 29, 2025, Civil Eats
https://civileats.com/2025/09/29/denvers-food-forests-provide-free...

The urban tree canopy in Denver is one of the sparsest in the country. In 2020, when Linda Appel Lipsius became executive director of the decades-old Denver Urban Gardens (DUG) network, which oversees more than 200 community vegetable gardens throughout six metro Denver counties, she wanted to continue increasing community access to fresh food—a longtime goal of the garden program. But she had another aim, too: increasing the city's tree coverage. Appel Lipsius decided to build a system of food forests throughout the Denver area. These dense, layered plantings incorporate fruit-bearing trees with other perennials to mimic natural forests. Now, DUG oversees 26 food forests, with 600 or so fruit and nut trees and 600 berry bushes. While urban trees are recognized for their multiple benefits, including cooling and carbon drawdown, “there are not a lot of players in Denver, or even in most cities around the country, who are focused on food trees,” Appel Lipsius said. “We were able to step into this space to help build and bolster the canopy while adding food-producing perennials.” Neighbors are welcome to enter and harvest a wide assortment of fruits, nuts, and berries. Beyond providing fresh food in neighborhoods that need it most, these agroforests reduce the urban heat island effect, create pollinator habitat, and combat pollution and climate change by absorbing and filtering harmful gases.

Business: The Cooper Companies is a global medical device company. It operates in two business units: CooperVision and CooperSurgical. The CooperVision segment is involved in the contact lens industry, while the CooperSurgical segment is involved in the fertility and women's health care market through its diversified portfolio of products and services, including fertility products and services, medical devices, cryostorage (such as cord blood and cord tissue storage) and contraception. CooperVision's products include MyDay daily disposable, MyDay daily disposable toric, MyDay Energys, MyDay multifocal, Biofinity & Biofinity XR, Biofinity Energys. CooperSurgical's portfolio includes INSORB, Lone Star, and the Doppler Blood Flow Monitor. It also offers a suite of single-use cordless surgical retractors with an integrated multi-light-emitting diode (LED) light source and dual smoke evacuation channels, and single-use surgical suction devices with an integrated, cordless radial LED light source.

Activist Commentary: Jana is a very experienced activist investor founded in 2001 by Barry Rosenstein. They made their name taking deeply researched activist positions with well-conceived plans for long term value. Rosenstein called his activist strategy ""V cubed."" The three ""Vs"" were: (i) Value: buying at the right price; (ii) Votes: knowing whether you have the votes before commencing a proxy fight; and (iii) Variety of ways to win: having more than one strategy to enhance value and exit an investment. Since 2008, they have gradually shifted that strategy to one which we characterize as the three ""Ss"": (i) Stock price – buying at the right price; (ii) Strategic activism – sale of company or spinoff of a business; and (iii) Star advisors/nominees – aligning with top industry executives to advise them and take board seats if necessary.

On Oct. 20, Jana announced that they took a position in Cooper Cos. and plan to push for strategic alternatives, including a potential transaction to combine its contact lens unit with peers such as Bausch + Lomb.

Cooper Cos. is a leading global medical device company operating through two segments: CooperVision and CooperSurgical. CooperVision (66% of revenue) is focused on the sale of contact lenses. CooperVision is the global leader by contact wearers and second in terms of market share (26%), competing against Johnson and Johnson (37%), Alcon (26%), and Bausch + Lomb (10%).

The global soft contact lens market is estimated to be worth about $11 billion and is growing at 4% to 6% annually. The segment has numerous tailwinds including a steady shift into silicone hydrogel 1-day lenses (about 40% of consumers are still using non-daily lenses), global growth in contact users, and high barriers to entry for competitors. As such, this is a great business that generates EBITDA margins in the mid-30s.

CooperSurgical (33% of revenue) is focused on women's health services, with 60% of its fiscal year 2024 revenue derived from office and surgical (Paragard IUDs, stem cell cryostorage, medical devices) and 40% from fertility (IVF consumables, equipment, genomic and donor services). Fertility treatment is a $2 billion global market, also expected to grow at a 4% to 6% pace annually.

For most of its history, Cooper was a pureplay vision business, until they added CooperSurgical in the 90s. Initially, this was a small – arguably tax-motivated – add-on. However, the company began heavily investing in this segment in 2017 – spending over $3 billion on the segment since.

The problem with this shift is pretty clear – Cooper is effectively siphoning off cash from a really good contact lens business and then reinvesting it in what most people would judge to be a less attractive business. This is evident in the company's declining returns on capital, with CooperSurgical now operating at lower margins than they did in 2017 despite these massive investments.

A key factor behind this operational shift may be management changes. The company's CEO Albert White, who previously led CooperSurgical, assumed leadership shortly after this expansion began. This raises a larger question about the company's strategic focus, leading many to question why the leader of this company would not have expertise in its core business.

These strategic missteps have been further compounded by near-term headwinds across both segments, some self-inflicted. For CooperVision, the company mismanaged market expectations for the rollout of its new daily lens product, MyDay Energys, which is now behind schedule.

For CooperSurgical, its highest quality business, IVF, has slowed meaningfully, likely attributable to comments from President Donald Trump suggesting potential reimbursements for IVF costs, causing patients to delay treatment in anticipation of this potential coverage. As a result, top-line organic growth fell meaningfully below expectations to 2%, down from 7% the prior quarter, forcing Cooper to significantly lower its full-year guidance at its third-quarter earnings call, sending the company's share price down 12.85% the following day. Now, Cooper is trading at a 12-month forward P/E of 16.4x — a steep discount to its 10-year average of 23.1x.

All of this has prompted Jana Partners to announce a top portfolio position in Cooper and plans to push for strategic alternatives, including a potential transaction to combine its contact lens unit with peers such as Bausch + Lomb. While a transaction of this nature would typically raise some antitrust concerns, this may actually be the opposite case here.

First, a merger would not result in a market leader, as the combined market share of 36% would be just below market leader J&J's share of 37% and not too far ahead of Alcon's 26% share.

Secondly, these businesses are highly complementary with minimal geographical and product overlap, suggesting a reduction in the likelihood of regulatory hurdles. Notably, Bausch + Lomb has not been shy about their potential interest and also sees no regulatory issues, as CEO Brent Saunders has publicly stated that a potential combination with Cooper would ""strengthen competition and create a more scaled company in the contact lens segment.""

But Bausch + Lomb is not the only potential acquirer. Companies like European eyewear manufacturer EssilorLuxottica could also have interest and with even less regulatory uncertainty.

As for CooperSurgical, there would certainly be private equity interest, as evidenced by Blackstone and TPG nearing a deal to acquire peer Hologic. However, Cooper shareholders may realize more value from the company cleaning up this portfolio internally – focusing more on the higher-multiple IVF business, shedding certain non-core assets, and potentially putting in new operators to execute a strong turnaround.

Overall, with short-term headwinds likely to ease, Cooper has multiple avenues to recover its discount and open itself up for a potential rerating. Jana's thesis is straightforward: these two businesses make no sense under the same roof and a strategic combination for the vision business could yield $300 million to 500 million synergies, which is a lot for a business with $850 million in EBITDA. But step one in their plan is convincing management that separating the two businesses is the right strategic move; and despite growing public attention, there is no guarantee that management, especially with this type of operating history, will agree.

Should management resist, this campaign changes dramatically from a strategic thesis to a leadership/governance thesis, likely centered on appointing a new CEO with a deep background in the contact lens industry to refocus the company on its core, while still positioning it for a separation down the line.

Jana is not outwardly calling for a management change and White may even be the best person to lead a standalone CooperSurgical business. But activism is about the power of the argument and Jana seems to make a persuasive one here. Let's hope for all involved that management sees it that way.

            US President Donald Trump says he intends to sue the BBC for between $1 billion and $5 billion “probably sometime next week” despite the broadcaster's apology to him over a documentary Trump's lawyers described as defamatory.
    


            “I think I have to do it,” Trump told reporters. “They've even admitted that they cheated … They cheated, they changed the words coming out of my mouth.”
    


            On Thursday, the BBC apologized to Trump over an editing blunder in an October 2024 documentary, titled “Trump: A Second Chance?,” saying that it “sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited.”
    


            However, the BBC has rejected the defamation claim and is refusing to pay compensation. The controversy has sparked a crisis in the BBC, triggering the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.
    


            Speaking to UK network GB News, Trump acknowledged the apology he received from the BBC, saying “they wrote me a nice letter.”
    


            “'We apologize,' but when you say it's unintentional, I guess if it's unintentional, you don't apologize,” he added.
    


            The president told GB News he is not looking to get into lawsuits but painted the move as essential to prevent similar mishaps in the future.
    


            “This was so egregious,” he said, “If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people… I'd like to find out why they did it.”
    


            In the BBC's edit, on an edition of the TV show Panorama, different parts of Trump's speech from the day of the January 6 storming of the US Capitol were spliced together, creating the impression Trump told the crowd he would walk with them to the Capitol and “fight like hell.”
    


            He told GB News: “I made a beautiful statement, and they made it into a not beautiful statement.”
    


            The president said Friday he plans to call UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the coming days to discuss the spat with the BBC, claiming the prime minister is “very embarrassed” about the situation.
    


            Should Trump proceed with his case and win it would impose enormous financial burdens on the BBC.
    


            The BBC is primarily license-fee funded, meaning anyone watching live television in the UK or who accesses BBC content online must pay a compulsory charge. The BBC's income is further supplemented by commercial subsidiaries.
    


            According to the BBC's most recent operational report, in the year ending March 2025 the BBC's total income was £5.9 billion (more than $7.5 billion.) The license fee raised £3.8 billion (around $5 billion) - 65% of the BBC's revenue in that year.
    


            Trump previously threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion unless it retracted the documentary and apologized for what his lawyers have described as “overwhelming financial and reputational harm” before a deadline of 5 p.m. ET Friday.
    


            While Trump said he wants the BBC to “appropriately compensate” him for the alleged harm caused, the UK's strict limitations on defamation cases mean the president cannot take legal action in the courts of England and Wales, as the purported wrongdoing happened more than 12 months ago.
    


            If he wishes to pursue his claim, Trump's only option is to do so in US courts. But this process will not be simple. In the US, the president will be expected to present a high standard of compelling evidence proving his reputation was materially damaged because of the BBC's edit.
    


            Rebuking Trump's demands for compensation, the broadcaster said that “while the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”
    


            A letter from the BBC's legal team summarizes the organization's grounds to reject Trump's defamation claim, including that the documentary was not distributed in the US, that the edit was not made to mislead viewers, rather to “shorten a long speech,” and that the 12-second clip was never meant to be considered in isolation.
    


            The documentary also did not cause Trump any harm, the letter argues, as he was re-elected as US President shortly after the clip aired in the UK.

Three other people were injured in the incident in Stockholm. The bus driver has been arrested.

At least three people were killed after double-decker bus crashed into a bus stop in Stockholm on Friday, police in the Swedish capital said. 

In a statement, police confirmed that three other people were injured, two of whom were brought to the hospital by ambulance for treatment. 

The bus driver has been arrested and detained following a decision by the prosecutor, police said. 

Police initially said they were investigating the incident as manslaughter.

An update later on Friday night said there was ""no indication that the incident was intentional"" and that the ""crime classification is causing death and causing bodily harm.""

Police have still not commented on the gender or age of the victims.

Police said officers were working with rescue and ambulance services at the crime scene, which has been cordoned off.

According to Reuters, a spokesperson for Stockholm's rescue services said there were no passengers on the bus when it crashed.

The incident occurred shortly after 3 p.m. local time (1400 UTC/GMT) on Valhallavagen street, near the University of Technology.

A spokesperson from the company Transdev confirmed that the bus was one of theirs.

""It's one of our buses that was involved and it's a double-decker,"" Lovisa Abom said. 

Mathias Haglund of the rescue service said that the bus was ""not supposed to be in service and that it was just the driver on board.""

In a post on X, Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his thoughts were with ""those affected and their families.""

""Police, ambulance, and rescue services now have a very difficult and important job to do. I urge everyone to show consideration and understanding for their tasks,"" Kristersson added.

FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) — Virginia Democrat Nicole Cole and her team spent much of their 2025 campaign for the state legislature standing in places like Weis Markets in Spotsylvania County, railing against prices that she said were too high: at least $3.79 for a dozen eggs, up to $7.99 for a pound of ground beef, $9.39 for coffee beans.

Her effort paid off when she ousted a 36-year Republican from his state House seat. She was one of 13 Virginia Democrats to flip competitive House seats and contribute to big election wins in her state and New Jersey, the only ones with governor's races this year.

“We would greet them at the point of purchase,” Cole said. “That's when it hurts most.”

The cost of living also may have led voters to signal that this is President Donald Trump's economy now. Some prices have stabilized or even declined, and costs tend to be higher in New Jersey than Virginia. But economic concerns, which helped Trump return to power in 2024, appeared to weigh Republicans down in the two contests for governor in the first major election after they took control of the White House and Congress, according to the AP Voter Poll.

Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, who won those races in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively, campaigned hard on economic issues and led a sweep for their party in both states.

The swings were especially dramatic in suburban and exurban areas like Spotsylvania and Morris County, New Jersey. Morris County is part of a traditionally Republican state legislative district where liberal Democrat Marisa Sweeney and one of two incumbent Republicans are so close in the vote count that The Associated Press considers the race, which will have two winners, too close to call.

“You go into the grocery store, you see what things cost, and it's just not working,” Sweeney said.







Over the past decade, places like Morris and Spotsylvania counties have become increasingly competitive — communities just beyond major metro areas where midterms are often won or lost. Morris County is about 30 miles west of New York City; Spotsylvania County is just south of Fredericksburg. Each is about two-thirds white, slightly wealthier than the national average, and at or above it in the share of residents with bachelor's degrees.

Heading into 2025, both looked like they would be close. Cole's district includes part of the Republican-leaning county, which Trump carried in 2020 and 2024, and GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin won it by more than 20 percentage points in between.

Still, Cole remained persuaded that she could flip her district, which includes part of Spotsylvania and Caroline counties.

“Early on in my campaign, when I brought in my staff, one of the main messages I talked to them about was that we need to stop saying this district is red, and that it leans red,” Cole said, adding: “We had to give some encouragement that this is possible to the people who aren't red.”

Cole, who was elected to the Spotsylvania County School Board in 2021, developed a playbook focused on the cost of living and education. Two weeks before the Nov. 4 election, she spoke at a town hall in Fredericksburg about tackling high energy bills from electric utilities.

“You know you have to have heat and air, and a utility bill that has to get paid,” she said. “So then something else is a sacrifice. The quality of food that you're able to buy for your kids is a sacrifice.”

As she greeted voters in November after the election, most people were tired of talking politics. But one voter, Kaitlyn Sapp, seemed interested in learning what Democrats would do for her.

“I did not vote this year,” Sapp said. “I have not been very political. But recently, I have been trying to learn more.” 

Cole smiled, not wasting a second before rattling off the issues her party aimed to tackle next year: health care costs, public education, utility bills and so on.

Morris County also swung dramatically to Democrats.

It was one of just four New Jersey counties to back both Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race and Republican Jack Ciattarelli in the governor's race the next year. Biden won Morris County by 4 percentage points, and Ciattarelli carried it by more than 11 percentage points. That 15.5 percentage point swing was the sixth-largest among the state's 21 counties. By 2024, Trump narrowly flipped Morris County, winning it by just under 3 percentage points.

This time around, Sherrill edged Ciattarelli there. 

Sherrill's victory is not all that surprising, and she is no stranger to the county. The governor-elect represented it while serving in Congress, and had a track record of working with state Republicans in the county.

“She has a lot of crossover appeal with Republican voters,” said Darcy Draeger, chairwoman of the Morris County Democrats. 

Voters seemed to pay attention to how the president's policies were affecting them, said Sweeney, whose district includes part of the county.

“People are watching the news and they're looking to see what goes on in Trump's administration, and they are seeing how it affects people locally, and with the whole government shutdown and people losing their SNAP benefits,” Sweeney said. “We're talking about people within our own communities.”

It's an outlook shared by some conservatives. The all-encompassing effect of Trump's second administration and his clash with congressional Democrats cost the party in New Jersey, Republicans said.

“We need to make sure that our constituents understand that we are here to serve and that we're listening to their voices,” said Republican state Sen. Anthony Bucco of Morris County. “I think the message was drowned out a little bit by Washington.”

Passaic, a northern New Jersey county not far from New York, is another area that shows a shift back to Democrats. The county, which has heavily Latino areas, went for Trump in 2024, the first time it went for a Republican in decades. This year, it swung back to Democrats by double digits.

John Currie, the longtime Democratic chairman in Passaic, chalked up the swing back to his party there to “hard work” by those running, along with a message about lowering costs. And by not talking about costs enough, Currie said Republicans paid the ultimate price.

“Affordability – it's that simple.”

The reckoning with the white-nationalist influencer's rise is only getting messier. 

On Wednesday, I texted Nick Fuentes about being the center of an existential crisis in American conservatism. Fuentes, a white-nationalist influencer, appeared on The Tucker Carlson Show in October, which has enraged a number of prominent figures on the right and set off a spiraling conversation about where to draw the line on whom the party welcomes into its mainstream. “I don't consider myself to be hateful or prejudiced,” he told me. “Just provocative and maybe tribalistic.”

Fuentes has repeatedly praised Hitler, likened “organized Jewry” to a “transnational gang,” said that women should be “subordinate” to their husband, and called Chicago “nigger hell.” In our text exchange, I reminded him of a clip from 2019 in which he said Jim Crow “was better for them; it's better for us.” “What that 10 seconds clip from 7 years ago that is clearly a joke?” he responded. “You think thats a fair characterization of my body of work?”

I told him that he was free to disavow his comments right then. He responded with only a “HAHA” iMessage tapback.

This is characteristically Fuentes. His winking, joking-until-he-isn't approach has helped him amass a loyal following—his fans call themselves “Groypers.” Carlson explained in his interview that he wanted to speak with the influencer because “I don't think Fuentes is going away,” and that despite attempts to unseat him, “he's bigger than ever.” Following the backlash, Carlson doubled down, telling Megyn Kelly last week that Fuentes is “the single most influential commentator among young men.”

The interview has become the defining subject of discourse on the right over the past month. A few prominent MAGA Republican voices, including Steve Bannon, have signaled support for Carlson. Many others, meanwhile, have been dealing with the fallout. Politicians including Ted Cruz, Mitch McConnell, and Lindsey Graham have spoken out against Fuentes's anti-Semitic views. Representative Randy Fine, a Florida Republican, told me that Fuentes is a “complete and total lunatic” and that everything he says is “completely wrong.” (Fine also isn't fond of Carlson: “I've concluded that he's an anti-Semite.” Carlson did not respond to a request for comment.)

“No to the Groypers,” the political commentator Ben Shapiro said on his podcast at the beginning of this month. “No to their publicists, like Tucker Carlson. No to those who champion them. No to demoralization. No to bigotry and antimeritocratic horseshit.” After Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, initially supported Carlson, he faced a staff revolt that has thrown the preeminent think tank into chaos. Roberts later backpedaled and called Fuentes an “evil person.”

Republicans are so at odds about how to handle Fuentes's encroachment into their ranks that many commentators have likened their infighting to a civil war and posed it as a battle for the soul of the conservative movement. The critics of the Groypers themselves tend to downplay the scale of the conflict. They have suggested that the deeply bigoted factions of the right are a vocal but tiny minority that can be excised. In my conversation with Fine, he described right-wing anti-Semites to me as a “small but growing” contingent that the right can still “nip in the bud.” The right-wing commentator Dinesh D'Souza posted on X that the rise of extreme racism on the right could be electorally ruinous “if this continues.”

This will continue. Fuentes is not the origin of prejudices metastasizing on the right, nor is he the end point. Today, many popular figures among young conservatives espouse some level of ethno-nationalist ideology. Consider the influencer Bronze Age Pervert, who has written that Black Africans are “so divergent from the rest of humanity,” they could be a separate subspecies. Charlie Kirk, who was heralded as a moderate against Fuentes, had drifted further rightward in the years leading up to his assassination. For instance, Kirk called Martin Luther King Jr. “awful” and once said that “we made a huge mistake when we passed the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s.”

“The Groyper thing is real,” Rod Dreher, a prominent right-wing writer who now lives in Hungary, wrote on Substack this week, after speaking with young conservatives during a trip to Washington. Even young Christians are “neck-deep in anti-Semitism,” he added. Recently leaked chats from Young Republican leaders suggest the same. In internal Heritage Foundation emails discussing the Fuentes controversy, published by the New York Post, one staffer for the think tank reportedly wrote: “Talking with some of the interns I think that there are a growing number of them who actually agree” with Fuentes.

In the rush to distance themselves from Fuentes, MAGA conservatives can easily downplay the extent to which Fuentes's racist, trollish ideology has already embedded itself in the movement. It's most apparent in younger groups, yet Groyper-speak also commonly seeps beyond those circles. Even Fuentes's loudest critics on the right sometimes say things that sound as though they were ripped out of one of Fuentes's notorious livestreams. Last summer, Senator Ted Cruz was among the many conservatives who amplified the claim that Haitian immigrants were eating cats—an unfounded notion that appears to have originated on a far-right social-media platform. At the Republican Jewish Coalition conference earlier this month, Fine called for New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani to be deported—“the only thing I want to see him running for is his gate at JFK on the deportation flight to Uganda,” he said—and claimed that Mamdani is leading a “modern-day Hitler Youth.” In July, Fine implied that Representative Ilhan Omar was a “Muslim terrorist.”

When I suggested to Fine that these comments sound Fuentes-esque, he rejected the comparison. Mamdani and Omar should be denaturalized, he said, because they engaged in immigration fraud to become citizens. (There is no evidence for this.)

Carlson offered Fuentes his largest audience yet, but the door has been cracking open for Fuentes for years. Now MAGA Republicans, along with everyone else, have to contend with him.

Airport chaos is leading people to ride the Amtrak. Will they stick with it?

You could almost mistake it for an ad. Last week, the far-right Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene was on the Amtrak Crescent traveling from the nation's capital to her home state, and she was enchanted. “The sweetest people run the train,” she posted on X, alongside a video of the autumnal landscape rushing by. “And the morning views of my north Georgia mountains made me smile and warmed my heart.”



As Greene said, she'd wound up on the train because of “flight delays and cancellations,” a result of the government shutdown. (Thousands of flights have been canceled over the past week, and delays have been common as unpaid air traffic controllers are overworked or walk off the job entirely.) Previously, Greene had been no particular fan of the train—in 2021, she voted against the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that earmarked $66 billion to rehabilitate the country's woefully out-of-date rail network—yet now she was embracing its charms.

Read: What really happens after the shutdown ends

Could it be that the chaos at American airports has created a small window of opportunity for the beleaguered rail system, which has so often been regarded as an embarrassing burden on the taxpayer? Is it possible that a form of transportation often associated with liberal wonks could, in the country's hour of desperation, come through with a pleasant surprise for everyone? Is it Amtrak's time to shine?



The shutdown is ending, but airports won't be back to normal right away. Many people are turning to the train instead: Jason Abrams, a spokesperson for Amtrak, told me via email that the railroad “predicts record breaking 2025 Thanksgiving travel, with double digit growth in early bookings relative to last year.” In ordinary times, the Amtrak might appear laughable—it might seem ridiculous, for instance, that its trains have not been able to run between Albany and Boston or Albany and the Berkshires for the past several months because of a sinkhole situation affecting the tracks in Rensselaer County, New York. But these are not ordinary times, and a sinkhole is nothing compared with Newark airport in recent days. (Anyway, the sinkhole is almost fixed.)

Read: There is no good way to travel anywhere in America

Not everyone will be able to take a train instead of flying, obviously. Last year, 1.2 million people traveled by train for Thanksgiving, a pitiable number relative to the roughly 18 million who flew. Still, Jim Mathews, president and CEO of the nonprofit Rail Passengers Association, told me that he is “optimistic” about Amtrak's potential to make a positive impression.



He suggested that an uptick in ridership this year could lead some to adopt Amtrak permanently and compared the post-shutdown moment, somewhat grimly, to the aftermath of September 11. Before 9/11, the most common way to travel between Washington, D.C., and New York City was via plane. Afterward, people were briefly afraid to fly, but flying also became inconvenient because of the added stress and time-sink of going through security. People tried the train and realized that it was easier and more comfortable; they could work the whole time, and they could go to a café car. In New York, they arrived in Midtown Manhattan instead of at an airport deep in Queens. And so they kept taking the train.



During the government shutdown, a lot of flight cancellations were on shorter routes. Even when that kind of flight isn't canceled outright, a delay of something like two hours can tilt the math and make taking a train more logical. The Amtrak ride between Detroit and Chicago takes five hours, and New Orleans to Mobile, Alabama, takes four—each perhaps more appealing than getting to the airport at least an hour ahead of your flight, which may well be delayed anyway. Then there are the other, much-touted perks of trains: no TSA; no middle seat; you can bring 100 pounds of luggage for free. Like Representative Greene, some will sit down on a train in the coming weeks for the first time in a long time, look out the window, and remember that our country, despite its current acute dysfunction, is remarkably beautiful, a pleasure to see from a new angle.



Robert Paaswell, a civil-engineering professor at the City College of New York and a very expressive train enthusiast, told me that if he were running Amtrak, he would have full-page ads in major newspapers right now. In every paper, these ads would explain to people how to find the train schedule, how to buy a ticket, how to get to the station. “That's a generational thing,” he said. People don't even think of the train anymore. They don't know where it is. (I'm not sure they know where to buy a newspaper either, though.)



Actually, Amtrak does market itself fairly successfully to young people as a more appealing and romantic alternative to driving and air travel, if not a more practical one. (Over the summer, for a social-media campaign, it made the interesting choice to depict an Amtrak locomotive smashing a mini bag of airplane pretzels, a tiny airplane window, an uncomfortable airplane seat, and an entire airplane as it flew over a city skyline.) Over the years, Amtrak has had several great marketing campaigns, including the “We've Been Working on the Railroad” ads from the 1970s, which Rick Harnish, executive director of the nonprofit High Speed Rail Alliance, referred to when we spoke this week. “They did a lot of advertising to get people to come back,” he said. “And then the service wasn't good enough to keep them.”

Read: A ‘death train' is haunting South Florida

To name a few issues, long-distance routes are prone to dramatic delays, and the cost of sleeper rooms is extreme; you can pay thousands of dollars to spend multiple days riding in a tight space that is not nearly as cool as anything you've seen in a classic movie. Amtrak train cars are in many cases decades old, and the railroad is currently short on equipment, which leads to cancellations—followed, sometimes, by seemingly random un-cancellations.



And service is sparse. Every year, I take the train home to Rochester, New York, for Thanksgiving, which is not an eccentric thing to do but is also not common. Only about 159,000 people got on or off a train in Rochester in all of 2024. So, logically, only four trains from New York City stop there every day (each carrying only a few hundred people). There's a vicious cycle: Amtrak is underfunded and thus under-used, which leads it to be further underfunded. (Why pay for a service that isn't popular because it's bad?) Now a significant percentage of travelers who check the Amtrak site out of curiosity will find that the train doesn't go where they need it to, doesn't go often enough, takes too long, or is too expensive.



When I looked this week at tickets for various routes, many of the trains for the days before Thanksgiving were sold out. Those that remain are a test of a person's mettle—would you pay $500 to sit in an upright position for more than 20 hours to get from New York to Chicago? Would you sign up for a 10-hour-and-40-minute layover in the middle of your multiday trip from Raleigh to Syracuse, which on an ordinary day is a less-than-four-hour flight?



I suppose you wouldn't, in regular times. This year, your choices are limited. The train may be slow, dingy, and stupid, but at least it stays on the ground.

The earlier you invest, the more time your money has to grow. But figuring out the exact accounts to use can feel overwhelming.

After setting aside money to cover daily expenses in a checking account and three to 12 months of expenses in a savings account, you should start looking into putting any additional income into three different investment ""buckets,"" says Jaime Bosse, a certified financial planner and senior advisor at CGN Advisors in Manhattan, Kansas.

""If you have too much in cash, you're actually losing money to inflation,"" Bosse says. ""Any extra dollars you have should be invested in growing for the future.""

With three investment accounts, you'll have more flexibility to tap your money when you need it and more control over your tax bill now and later because each ""bucket"" offers different benefits, Bosse says. 

How to best allocate your money across the different types of accounts will vary based on your income and situation, she says, but the bottom line is you should be using them to your advantage. Be sure to speak with a trusted financial professional for individualized advice.

Here are the three buckets she suggests and how they work.

Examples: Traditional IRA, 401(k), 403(b)

Tax-deferred accounts, like a traditional 401(k) or individual retirement account, let you contribute pre-tax money from your paycheck into an investment account. This lowers your taxable income for the year you contributed, and your investments grow tax-deferred until retirement.

Withdrawals are taxed as income and usually penalty-free starting at age 59½. Taking money out earlier may trigger taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty.

Examples: Roth IRA, Roth 401(k), Roth 403(b)

You contribute money you've already paid taxes on to Roth accounts. Your investments then grow tax-free, and once you reach 59½, qualified withdrawals aren't taxed or penalized. Roth IRAs, in particular, also add flexibility by allowing you to withdraw money you've contributed at any time without penalty.

These accounts are ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future or want tax-free income later on, Bosse says.

Example: brokerage accounts

Taxable brokerage accounts let you invest money after taxes and withdraw at any time without penalty. While you'll generally owe taxes on any realized gains, these accounts offer maximum flexibility for expenses outside of retirement, like a down payment on a house or a vacation, because you can access your money whenever you need it, Bosse says.

You don't have to open all three accounts at once, says Patrick Huey, certified financial planner and owner of Victory Independent Planning in Portland, Oregon.

Start by checking to see if your employer has a company match program where they will contribute an additional amount to your retirement accounts that matches your own contributions.

Early in your career, Huey suggests contributing to a Roth 401(k) or Roth 403(b) instead of a tax-deferred 401(k) because you'll likely earn a higher salary as you get older — making it smarter to pay taxes now when you're in a lower tax bracket.

However, even if it is through a tax-deferred account, ""if there's a match available, you should do what it takes to get it,"" because it's free money from your employer that boosts your retirement savings, Huey says.

Generally, experts recommend saving around 15% of your annual income before taxes for retirement, including any company match.

Bosse says the purpose of splitting your money into three accounts is to give yourself options, whether it's to make big purchases, lower your current tax bill or reduce what you'll owe in the future.

""I would think of it in terms of not investing for your retirement, but investing for your future flexibility,"" Bosse says. When you have money in your three buckets, ""You can be working because you want to, not because you need to. You can travel the world. You can do other things.""

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has descended further into a bear market. The digital token's price has seen a 22% drop from its peak in early October. The sell-off of Bitcoin intensified this week, with the cryptocurrency hitting a six-month low of $94,700 on Friday.

Three primary factors have contributed to this sell-off. First, Bitcoin has been impacted by a wider sell-off in risk assets, especially tech stocks, as investors express concerns over high valuations.

On Thursday, outflows from spot bitcoin ETFs reached $866.7 million, the highest since early August, according to CoinGlass data.

Second, over the past month, Bitcoin's liquidity has dwindled, leading to heightened price volatility. The market depth of Bitcoin, a metric that gauges price resistance to volatility from large trades, fell from roughly $766 million in early October to $535.2 million this week, as stated by crypto analytics firm Kaiko.

Finally, speculation that Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, had offloaded some of its Bitcoin holdings, spurred the sell-off.

However, Michael Saylor, Strategy's founder, refuted these rumors, asserting that the company was actually purchasing more Bitcoin.

Despite Saylor's assurances, the market continues to be wary, as Strategy's net asset value premium dipped below 1x this week, suggesting that its premium over the value of its Bitcoin holdings has been temporarily wiped out.

Why It Matters: The current state of Bitcoin is a reflection of the broader market sentiment towards risk assets. The fear of high valuations, coupled with decreased liquidity and market rumors, has led to an increased sell-off.

This situation underscores the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies and the influence of market sentiment on their value. As the market continues to monitor Strategy's moves closely, the future of Bitcoin remains uncertain.

Ethereum forms a textbook double top while 2.5M ETH bought near $3,150 and a $1.4B Aave whale defend key support.

Now Ethereum sits between a textbook double top and one of its heaviest on-chain support zones. Traders are asking whether the $3,150 cluster will absorb the selling or confirm a deeper breakdown from the recent peak.

Ethereum shows a clear double-top formation on the daily chart, with two failed attempts near the same resistance zone. The pattern appears at the 2021 peak and again in late 2025, where price stalled around the $4,500 area before turning lower. The symmetry between the two highlighted tops reinforces the technical significance of this region as heavy overhead supply.

As the pattern completes, ETH has already pulled back toward the $3,100 zone, where traders watch for confirmation of further downside. A double top often signals a shift in trend when price breaks below the midpoint support, and Ethereum is now testing that zone. The structure places attention on whether buyers can step in before the neckline gives way.

The formation also comes at a moment of broader market uncertainty, adding weight to its implications. If ETH fails to stabilize above current levels, the pattern suggests increased risk of continued selling pressure. However, any strong rebound from the neckline would signal that buyers still defend the range, keeping the longer-term trend intact.

At the same time, new on-chain metrics highlight a strong support zone forming near $3,150. Glassnode's cost-basis heatmap shows more than 2.5 million ETH acquired in this band, marking it as one of the cycle's densest accumulation clusters. The data reflects where a large share of holders entered the market, offering a clear gauge of sentiment as Ethereum pulls back from its recent highs.

In addition, a major whale continues to build an aggressive leveraged long position on Aave. Arkham reported that the address now holds $1.42 billion in ETH, backed by roughly $467 million in borrowed stablecoins. The position increased by about $200 million since the firm's previous update, underscoring how committed the buyer remains despite the broader market cooldown.

These combined flows strengthen the argument that Ethereum has a defined base at current levels. Heavy accumulation near $3,150, visible on the heatmap, aligns with the whale's repeated purchases and signals concentrated demand. As ETH trades inside this cluster, analysts watch whether the support holds and whether leveraged positioning stabilizes after weeks of rapid additions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","Singapore's Digital Finance Frontier: Tokenized Bills and Stablecoin Rules on the Horizon","https://www.webpronews.com/singapores-digital-finance-frontier-tokenized-bills-and-stablecoin-rules-on-the-horizon/","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 18:40:54 GMT","

Singapore is positioning itself as a global leader in tokenized finance, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announcing ambitious plans to trial tokenized government bills and introduce regulatory frameworks for stablecoins. This move comes as the city-state seeks to build a scalable and secure ecosystem for digital assets, blending traditional finance with blockchain technology. Speaking at a financial conference on November 13, 2025, MAS Managing Director Chia Der Jiun highlighted the progress and challenges in tokenization.

According to a report by Reuters, Chia noted that ‘tokenization has lifted off the ground. But have asset-backed tokens achieved escape velocity? Not yet.' The trials for tokenized MAS Bills are set to begin next year, settled using a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC). This initiative builds on Singapore's ongoing experiments with digital assets, aiming to enhance efficiency in financial markets.

The push for stablecoin regulation is equally significant. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies, have grown in popularity but face scrutiny over stability and misuse. MAS plans to introduce laws that will provide clarity and oversight, ensuring these digital assets can serve as reliable mediums of exchange without undermining financial stability.

From Experimentation to Real-World Application

Tokenization involves representing real-world assets like bonds or bills on a blockchain, enabling faster settlements and reduced costs. As detailed in a CoinDesk article, MAS views a wholesale CBDC as an ‘anchor' for a system where private settlement assets meet diverse market needs. The tokenized bills trial will test issuance and settlement processes, potentially revolutionizing how governments manage short-term debt instruments.

Industry insiders see this as a natural evolution. Singapore has been at the forefront of fintech innovation, with projects like Project Orchid exploring CBDC use cases. The upcoming trials follow successful pilots with major banks, including a 2025 collaboration involving DBS Bank, as mentioned in recent updates from TradingView News.

Chia emphasized the need for scalability. In his speech, he stated that while tokenization is now used in real-world applications, broader adoption requires robust infrastructure. This includes interoperability between different blockchain networks and traditional systems, a challenge MAS is addressing through regulatory sandboxes and international collaborations.

Stablecoin Regulations: Balancing Innovation and Risk

The introduction of stablecoin laws is poised to tighten oversight. According to Cryptopolitan, the framework will impose requirements such as holding reserves in low-risk, highly liquid assets, echoing earlier MAS guidelines from 2023. This aims to prevent collapses like those seen in other markets, ensuring stablecoins maintain their peg and user trust.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) reflect positive sentiment among crypto enthusiasts. Users have highlighted Singapore's proactive stance, with one post noting the country's framework as a bridge between fiat and digital ecosystems, crediting sources like Ripple and Circle for input on regulations. However, these social media discussions underscore the need for caution, as they often mix optimism with unverified claims.

MAS's approach draws from global precedents. For instance, the European Union's MiCA regulations have influenced stablecoin rules worldwide. In Singapore, the focus is on enabling stablecoins for cross-border payments while mitigating risks like money laundering. Chia Der Jiun remarked that the laws will foster a ‘credible digital medium of exchange,' as reported by BusinessWorld Online.

Implications for Global Finance

The tokenized bills initiative could set a benchmark for other central banks. By settling with wholesale CBDC, Singapore aims to reduce settlement times from days to seconds, enhancing liquidity in money markets. A The Block report notes that this moves beyond experimentation, integrating tokenization into core financial operations.

Industry experts predict ripple effects. Tokenized assets could attract more institutional investors, with firms like BlackRock already exploring similar technologies. In Singapore, this aligns with the nation's vision of becoming a digital asset hub, supported by licenses granted to companies like Ripple in 2024, as per X posts referencing government-backed media.

Challenges remain, including technological hurdles and regulatory harmonization. Cybersecurity risks in tokenized systems are a concern, with MAS emphasizing secure protocols. Moreover, ensuring equitable access to these innovations is crucial, as smaller players might struggle with adoption costs.

Economic and Strategic Context

Singapore's economy, heavily reliant on finance and trade, stands to benefit. The city-state processes trillions in transactions annually, and tokenization could streamline operations. According to Bitcoin Ethereum News, the 2026 pilot expands on 2025 trials, potentially including cross-border elements with partners in Asia and Europe.

Geopolitically, this positions Singapore amid U.S.-China tech tensions. By developing independent standards, MAS avoids over-reliance on any single system. Chia highlighted in his address that tokenization must achieve ‘escape velocity' through widespread use, not just pilots.

Looking ahead, the stablecoin laws could influence regional policies. Neighbors like India, with its own crypto frameworks as discussed in X posts about the COINS Act 2025, may observe Singapore's model. This could lead to harmonized regulations across ASEAN, boosting digital trade.

Industry Reactions and Future Outlook

Financial institutions are gearing up. DBS Bank, a key participant in MAS pilots, has expressed enthusiasm. In a statement covered by Coin Edition, experts note that regulated stablecoins will enhance confidence, driving adoption in payments and remittances.

On X, discussions amplify the buzz, with users praising Singapore's clarity compared to U.S. uncertainties. Posts reference the Stablecoin Act 2025 in other contexts, drawing parallels to Singapore's framework. However, sentiment varies, with some cautioning about over-regulation stifling innovation.

Ultimately, these developments underscore Singapore's strategy to lead in fintech. By combining tokenized assets with regulated stablecoins, MAS is crafting a blueprint for the future of finance, one that balances innovation with prudence.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Bitcoin ETFs: Why They Matter and What's Next?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/bitcoin-etf-outflows-reshaping-crypto-landscape","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 12:47:54 GMT","

Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment tools that let investors get a piece of the Bitcoin pie without actually buying the digital currency. Trading on conventional stock exchanges makes them easier for many investors, including big institutions. These ETFs are significant because they boost liquidity, help stabilize prices, and create a regulated arena for crypto investments. Come 2025, Bitcoin ETFs are ruling the crypto landscape, with titans like BlackRock and Fidelity at the helm.

Back in early November 2025, Bitcoin ETFs saw nearly half a billion dollars in outflows. This raised eyebrows about liquidity in the crypto market. Macro pressures and shifts in how institutions feel about crypto were the main culprits, triggering a risk-off attitude. As a result, Bitcoin dropped below $104,000, with Ethereum and DeFi assets also taking a hit. This situation lays bare how exposed the crypto market is to outside economic factors and how interconnected various crypto assets can be.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) can tweak their financial strategies in the wake of Bitcoin ETF outflows. Some effective tactics include:

DAOs can shield their treasury from market volatility by putting their funds into several crypto assets and stablecoins. This can soften the blow from Bitcoin's ups and downs.
Holding stablecoins can help DAOs keep their liquidity and protect against the fallout from Bitcoin ETF outflows.
Transparent governance can help build trust and allow for quick adjustments to changing market conditions.
If they bring in professionals or use decentralized treasury management platforms, DAOs can fine-tune their asset allocations and liquidity.
The use of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols can unlock better liquidity options and innovative financial products that help generate steady income even in turbulent times.

For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe looking to dive into crypto, the liquidity issues stemming from Bitcoin ETFs come with both setbacks and openings. They need to keep several points in mind:

The European regulatory scene isn't as open as that of the U.S. and is far more fragmented. Directives like UCITS require diversification, limiting access to Bitcoin ETFs for retail investors. This means SMEs must navigate a complex compliance web to successfully integrate crypto into their financial plans.
The volatility of Bitcoin's price can disrupt cash flow if payments or reserves are held in Bitcoin without efficient conversion methods. SMEs should have solid risk management tactics to counter these operational hazards.
Despite regulatory roadblocks, regulated Bitcoin ETPs (Exchange-Traded Products) are on the rise in Europe, adding liquidity and market access for SMEs. Using Bitcoin as a reserve asset can bolster the financial resilience of these companies.

Asian fintech startups can take advantage of Bitcoin ETF outflows to refine their crypto payroll offerings. The market instability presents an opportunity to pitch their solutions as reliable and efficient. They might consider:

Incorporating stablecoins into their payroll systems to sidestep the volatility linked with Bitcoin ETF outflows, guaranteeing employees stable pay.
Using blockchain technology to lower transaction fees, speed up payments, and improve transparency, making crypto payroll more appealing to a tech-savvy workforce.
Offering real-time or near real-time payment options to enhance worker liquidity and satisfaction, crucial during economic uncertainty.
Staying ahead of regulatory compliance will build trust and ensure that their payroll solutions align with evolving regulations in Asia.

Even after the recent outflows, Bitcoin ETFs are still a sound investment for institutions in 2025. The structural benefits they provide make them the go-to option for large capital allocators. Some key takeaways include:

Bitcoin ETFs have established themselves as the primary vehicle for institutional exposure to cryptocurrencies, with big players like BlackRock controlling a huge share of the market.
These ETFs offer straightforward operations and deep liquidity, eliminating many compliance hassles that often accompany direct cryptocurrency investments.
Institutional money can help stabilize Bitcoin markets, absorbing liquidity shocks and lessening extreme price fluctuations, making Bitcoin a better diversification option.
Institutions are advised to take a measured approach, gradually allocating a portion of their portfolios to digital assets while contemplating diversification into established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana.

In conclusion, Bitcoin ETF outflows pose challenges but also present opportunities for various players in the crypto ecosystem. DAOs, SMEs, and fintech startups can adjust their strategies to navigate this shifting landscape, while institutional investors can still see Bitcoin ETFs as a crucial part of their digital asset portfolios. Adapting and innovating are essential to thriving in this volatile market environment.

Technology appears to be the basis for decision-making in this changing world of finance. Applications of AI in crypto are new advancements that were very recently introduced. By merging the power of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, it changes how investors and traders connect over their digital assets. As cryptocurrency markets turn large, volatile, and complex, traders are moving towards AI-powered trading instruments that enable them to make faster, smarter, and more accurate decisions.

While it already remade a number of industries such as health care, marketing, and manufacturing, entering the crypto space means combining human intuition with machine precision in a way never seen before. AI in crypto is not some sort of future; it's actively changing how we perceive trends, evaluate risks, and do trades today.

Indeed, how to make a profit with the least possible risk is the keystone of any trading or investment decision. Traditional financial markets rely on years of historical data, economic indicators, and expert analyses in order to come up with predictions about market movements. The cryptocurrency markets are still very young, completely decentralized, and highly volatile; thus, they cannot be predicted by traditional means.

Traders and investors are always making decisions to buy, sell, or hold an asset, and usually in real time. There is so much to factor in: price patterns, news events, blockchain data, and investor sentiment. Speed and unpredictability within cryptocurrency markets mean that delays of just seconds will make all the difference between a good or bad financial outcome. That is where AI in crypto will prove to be a game-changer: it will help people and institutions process vast amounts of data to make quicker, more data-driven, and better decisions.

The introduction of AI in crypto opened a totally new world to its participants. AI algorithms analyze vast amounts of data from multiple sources, including price charts, order books, social media sentiment, and blockchain activity to identify trends and predict the movement of prices with incredible accuracy.

Perhaps one of the major strengths AI possesses is the detection of those patterns invisible to the human eye. For instance, machine learning models can process thousands of historic price points in order to identify repetitive signals that more often than not precede a market rally or crash. By doing so, AI will enable the trader to prepare for such opportunities or risks much in advance.

AI-powered trading bots execute trades automatically based on pre-set parameters. These bots can run 24/7 and are thus ideal for the crypto market, operating around the clock. The involvement of bots eliminates human emotions such as fear and greed-major causes for impulsive or poor decisions while trading. It ensures consistency and makes an investor stick with his strategy irrespective of the market sentiment.

AI in crypto empowers a smarter generation of the portfolio with regard to making long-term investment decisions. This assesses a wide array of information-from project fundamentals to tokenomics, developer activity, community engagement, to on-chain data-as a means of passing judgment on which of these assets might have long-term value.

AI-powered investment analysis tools apply predictive analytics to areas where such investment analysis would conventionally be based on a few subjective views or small datasets. These systems work out many scenarios and suggest optimal portfolio allocations, striking a balance between risk and reward. Other companies use the technology to provide ""robo-advisory"" services, offering personalized investment plans based on a customer's attitude toward risk and objectives.

AI-powered sentiment analysis sifts through millions of online posts, news articles, and tweets to find the market mood on any particular cryptocurrency. This real-time feedback helps investors avoid hype-driven bubbles and find genuinely promising projects.

AI in crypto has several advantages, beyond mere convenience: it brings objectivity, efficiency, and scalability into the process of trading and investment.

Since AI systems learn from continuous market data, they improve their accuracy over time, allowing users to adapt to the ever-changing dynamics of markets.

Other key benefits include predictive accuracy.

Machine learning algorithms let one go deep into changes in the fluctuation of prices, changes in market volume, and volatility with high precision.

Deep learning models, for example, can assess the sophisticated interaction of price movements in Bitcoin versus macroeconomic variables like inflation or global liquidity.

Second, AI democratizes access to sophisticated trading strategies.

What was available only to institutional investors with the help of complicated financial models is today also available to individual traders in the shape of AI-based tools and apps that help them compete on a more even playing field.

As much as crypto has tremendous potential in AI, there is equally a set of challenges involved.

First and foremost, there is the major issue of data reliability.

Crypto markets are still developing, whereby not all sources provide accurate or at least transparent data.

Improper data misleads AI models into flawed predictions.

Another limitation is over-dependence on automation.

While AI reduces emotional decision-making, it cannot account for the occurrence of some unexpected events, such as regulatory crackdowns or the hacking of exchanges.

In such instances, human judgment will always have a place.

Additionally, there are a number of ethical and security concerns.

AI models demand huge amounts of user data, which one needs to keep safe from misuses or even hacks.

It is tough to balance innovation with privacy and security in the crypto ecosystem.

The role of AI in crypto is going to get much stronger in the future. As algorithms further develop and improve in quality, traders and investors will increasingly be able to navigate sophisticated markets where the presence of AI is going to be important. Future applications could include AI-based autonomous decentralized funds, self-learning trading platforms, and AI-integrated blockchain networks allowing for speedier and far more effective governance and decision-making. Integrating quantum computing, predictive analytics, and decentralized intelligence into AI can fundamentally reboot the meaning of investment and trading. Further, in the near future, investors would make use of AI so as to shape and not follow a trend, thus opening an entirely new era in intelligent crypto finance.

The main role of AI involves market data analysis for price predictions, along with automated trading decisions, helping traders adapt rapidly to changes in the market while minimizing emotional biases in trading.

No, it is complementary to human decision-making rather than replacing it. While AI is significantly faster in processing information, human supervision plays a vital role in realizing the market context and unexpected risks that come along.

It could be profitable based on the quality of the algorithms, market conditions, and whether appropriate risk management has been followed. It is not a tool that guarantees success but more so enhances the quality of decision-making.

The risks include technical errors, inaccuracies in data, model overfitting, and over-reliance on automation. Markets may also respond in unpredictable ways to real-world events outside the purview of AI.

AI-driven trading platforms or robo-advisors have made things even more accessible for beginners by offering user-friendly interfaces and the ability to create your own custom strategies. Care will be needed in researching any platforms, and the initial investments should not be large.

This juncture-merging AI with blockchain-is one of the most thrilling areas in the realm of trading and investment decisions. AI in crypto transforms what was once a highly speculative market into a data-driven ecosystem that empowers novice and professional investors alike to make smarter, faster, and more strategic decisions. Of course, some challenges persist, such as data accuracy and security. However, the long-term potential is undeniably there. As technology continues to evolve, AI in crypto will continue to develop as a core component in making better financial decisions and shape intelligent, accurate, and innovative digital finance.

Can we fix it back?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Water has power. So much power, in fact, that pumping Earth's groundwater can change the planet's tilt and rotation. It can also impact sea-level rise and other consequences of climate change.

Pumping groundwater appears to have a greater consequence than ever previously thought. But now—thanks to a study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters—we can see that, in less than two decades, Earth has tilted 31.5 inches as a result of pumping groundwater. This equates to .24 inches of sea level rise. 

“Earth's rotational pole actually changes a lot,” Ki-Weon Seo, a geophysicist at Seoul National University and study lead, says in a statement. “Our study shows that among climate-related causes, the redistribution of groundwater actually has the largest impact on the drift of the rotational pole.”

With the Earth moving on a rotational pole, the distribution of water on the planet impacts distribution of mass. “Like adding a tiny bit of weight to a spinning top,” authors say, “the Earth spins a little differently as water is moved around.”

NASA research published in 2016 alerted us to the fact that the distribution of water can change the Earth's rotation. This study in Geophysical Research Letters attempts to add some hard figures to that realization. “I'm very glad to find the unexplained cause of the rotation pole drift,” Seo says. “On the other hand, as a resident of Earth and a father, I'm concerned and surprised to see that pumping groundwater is another source of sea-level rise.”

The study included data from 1993 through 2010, and showed that the pumping of as much as 2,150 gigatons of groundwater has caused a change in the Earth's tilt of roughly 31.5 inches. The pumping is largely for irrigation and human use, with the groundwater eventually relocating to the oceans.

In the study, researchers modeled observed changes in the drift of Earth's rotational pole and the movement of water. Across varying scenarios, the only model that matched the drift was one that included 2,150 gigatons of groundwater distribution.

Surendra Adhikari, a research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who was involved in the 2016 study, says the additional research is important. “They've quantified the role of groundwater pumping on polar motion,” he says in a news release, “and it's pretty significant.”

Where the water moves from—and to—matters. Redistributing water from the midlatitudes makes the biggest difference, so our intense water movement from both western North America and northwestern India have played a key role in the tilt changes.

Now that the impact of water movement is known for such a short—and relatively recent—time, digging through historical data may help show trends and provide greater depth to the understanding of groundwater movement effects.

“Observing changes in Earth's rotational pole is useful,” Seo says, “for understanding continent-scale water storage variations.”

This data may also help conservationists understand how to work toward staving off continued sea level rise and other climate issues. Hopefully, changes can be properly implemented over time.

The math doesn't add up.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In the history of studying the proliferation of humanity across the globe, there has long been one question that has stumped researchers: How did the islands of Southeast Asia (ISEA) become so well-inhabited so long ago? 

It probably required technological seafaring advancements beyond what was considered likely during the Paleolithic era. But those experts may have a surprising new answer thanks to research that shows the ancient people of the Philippines and ISEA may have mastered seafaring well before anyone else. 

The pivotal archaeological evidence comes in the form of stone tools excavated at sites in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste, showing strong evidence that as far back as 40,000 years ago, there was a technological sophistication from these ancient seafarers that rivals much later civilizations. In a study published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, researchers from Ateneo de Manila University challenge the accepted belief that Paleolithic technical progress was centered in Africa and Europe. 

Proving seafaring history represents a tricky endeavor, since organic wood and fiber that would have likely been used in constructing Paleolithic seacraft rarely survive in the archaeological record. These stone tools offer a new way in. The most recent discovery, according to the study, shows traces of plant processing that features the “extraction of fibers necessary for making ropes, nets, and bindings essential for boatbuilding and open-sea fishing.”

Add in the discovery of fishing hooks, gorges, net weights, and the remains of deep-ocean fish such as tuna and sharks, and these archeological sites are a rich exploration of what is obviously a robust seafaring culture. 

“The remains of large predatory pelagic fish at these sites indicate the capacity for advanced seafaring and knowledge of the seasonality and migration routes of those fish species,” the study authors wrote. The collection of fish and tool remains “indicates the need for strong and well-crafted cordage for ropes and fishing lines to catch the marine fauna.” 

As the archaeological finds point toward a sophisticated method of deep-ocean fishing, the study authors believe the ancient seafarers constructed boats from organic materials and held them together with plant-based ropes. That same rope technology was then adapted for the actual fishing. 

While widely accepted that the presence of fossils and artifacts across a range of islands provides evidence that early modern humans moved across the open sea, the study's authors fight against the prevailing theory that the prehistoric migrations were passive sea drifters on bamboo rafts. Rather, they posit that the movement came from highly skilled navigators equipped with the knowledge and technology to travel to remote locations over deep waters. 

“The identification of boat-building materials through direct or indirect evidence is vital in understanding movements across and within island environments,” the authors wrote in the study. 

“The presence of such advanced maritime technology in prehistoric ISEA highlights the ingenuity of early Philippine peoples and their neighbors,” the authors said in a statement from the university, “whose boat-building knowledge likely made the region a center for technological innovations tens of thousands of years ago and laid the foundations for the maritime traditions that still thrive in the region today.”

That's self contradictory. Their incentive is to sell more HW and at higher prices using whatever shady practices they can get away with, software or no software. There's nothing pure about that, it's just business. High end chips aren't commodity HW like lawnmowers, they can't function without the right SW.And this isn't the 90's anymore when Hercules or S3 would only make the silicon, and then system integrators would write the drivers for it which was basically MS-DOS calls to read/write to registers via the PCI bus, by the devs reading a 300 page manual, those days are long gone. Modern silicone is orders of magnitude more complex that nobody else besides the manufacturer could write the drivers for it to extract the most performance out of it.>I'm even willing to accept a 20% performance hit for this requirement, should someone bring that up.I'm also willing to accept arbitrary numbers I make up, as a tradeoff, but the market does not work like that.

The 300 page manual would be 3,000 or 30,000 pages long, if modern ARM ISR manuals are any indication. Independent developers could totally write performant drivers if they had the documents, but those manuals do not exist - or if they do, they're proprietary.

reply

Surely they could, but at that complexity level, they wouldn't put the necessary amount of effort in it without being payed, and at that point, it's better to hire them.> but those manuals do not exist - or if they do, they're proprietary.And there are market-related reasons for that, it's not done because of some arbitrary paranoia. Another important issue is that good documents are hard to write - with regard to driver coding, it's much easier to make a quick call or message the hardware people about some unclear aspect of chip's operation rather than go through the formal process of modifying the official documents. Waiting for external developers to reverse engineer that is slow and leads to serious competitive disadvantages and AMD is an example of it.

The assumption that no good software will be written without pay is outdated as FOSS disproved it many times over.



Let's not go too far here. Reverse engineering and independent development of usable drivers are not impossible, they're 'merely' extremely challenging. Alyssa Rosenzweig in particular had great success reverse engineering the Apple M1 GPU and writing drivers for it, and that was just a few years ago.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Rosenzweig#Careerhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45034537

I don't get why AMD doesn't solve their own software issues. Now they have a lot of money so not having money to pay for developers is not an excuse.And data centers GPUs are not the worst. Using GPU compute for things like running inference at home is a much, much better experience with Nvidia. My 5 years old RTX 3090 is better than any consumer GPU AMD released up to this date, at least for experimenting with ML and AI.

I must say it's been a completely positive experience. The mainline Fedora kernel just worked without any need to mess with the DKMS. I just forwarded /dev/dri/* devices to my containers, and everything worked fine with ROCm.I needed to grab a different image (-rocm instead of -cuda) for Ollama, change the type of whisper build for Storyteller. And that was it! On the host, nvtop works fine to visualize the GPU state, and VAAPI provides accelerated encoding for ffmpeg.Honestly, it's been an absolutely pleasant experience compared to getting NVidia CUDA to work.

NVidia is the exception to the rule when it comes to hardware companies paying competitive salaries for software engineers. I imagine AMD is still permeated by the attitude that software ""isn't real work"" and doesn't deserve more compensation, and that kind of inertia is very hard to overcome.

AMD should by all rights be a strong competitor to NVIDIA with a big chunk of the AI market. They have nearly nothing. The buck should stop at the top, but with AMD it doesn't.

reply

AMD's driver/software woes compared to nVidia make more sense when you realize they barely made it here at all.

reply

what OP is saying is that after a point it doesn't matter how good your HW is if your SW stack is bad.

reply

reply

reply

It should be obvious by now though that there's symbiosis between software and hardware, and that support timescales are longer. Another angle is that it's more than just AMD's own software developers, also the developers making products for their customers who in turn buy AMD's if everyone works together to make them run well and it's those second developers they need to engage with in a way their efforts will be welcomed.

The AppleTV series Pluribus stars Rhea Seahorn as Carol Sturka, a romantasy writer who doesn't care for her genre. As the show opens, she's released a new book, Bloodsong of Wycaro, and now you can read a little slice of it.

“I'm going to do something that is antithetical to capitalism: give my work away for free. A bit of it, anyway,” writes Carol in the letter for Bloodsong, which now has a free 11-page excerpt you can read on Apple Books. Like on the show, she's fed up with her audience fretting about the lack of Raban on the cover, so the excerpt—Chapter 16, “The Isle of Sanantes”—confirms Captain Lucasia's longtime lover Raban is alive and well after he was made to walk the plank in the previous book, Stormshadow. You may recall in the Pluribus pilot that Carol hinted as much to a fan.

As for the full Bloodsong book, Lucasia is tasked with saving her crew after they've been afflicted with a curse that's left them bedridden. With few able-bodied workers left, they brave a nasty storm to reach the isle and find Madam Asclepius, a banished healer who may be able to help.

Along with the chapter and letter, the excerpt includes Carol's author bio—her books have won “multiple honors,” including the Mars & Eros Reader's Choice Award—and an end page hyping up the show. This whole thing may remind some folks of what Apple did for Severance, whose self-help book The You You Are from Ricken Hale got a downloadable version back in January.

New episodes of Pluribus premiere Fridays on Apple TV. For those who read the Bloodsong of Wycaro excerpt and have a romantasy background, let us know in the comments below how it'd fare as a real book in the genre.

Former coach of Malmo FF and the Danish national team, the 72-year old Norwegian Age Hareide, is seriously ill according to the Norwegian media vg.no.

Hareide is currently in Milan, where Norway are due to face Italy in a decisive World Cup qualifier tomorrow. He was supposed to be present as an expert for the television station NRK in connection with the match, but he is not well enough.

Norwegian international team coach Stale Solbakken has just sent a touching greeting to Hareide at a Norwegian press conference in Italy.

""I send my regards to Åge Hareide, who is fighting a battle. He is one of the greatest players. Great coaching career. Victories in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. As one of the few Norwegians, he has World Cup experience as a coach. And he knows what it's all about"", said Solbakken at the press conference.

In his playing career, he played for Hodd and Molde in Norway as well as Manchester City and Norwich City in England. Hareide was capped 50 times playing for Norway.

Hareide has also had a distinguished career as a coach. His biggest achievements were qualifying Malmo FF for the Champions League on several occasions and taking Denmark to the round of the last 16 at the 2018 World Cup. Last year, he stepped down as coach of the Icelandic national team. ","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

 The latter stages of Kyle Edmund's career may have been hampered by injuries, but the former No. 14 in the PIF ATP Rankings is not ready to let the tough moments dominate as he reflects on his 13-year professional career. 

 The 30-year-old Briton announced his retirement in August after a series of physical issues that included one surgery a year in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Although his retirement decision is just three months old, Edmund already feels happy to focus on his experiences as an elite performer on the world stage. 

 “You definitely look back with more positivity [with time],” he told ATPTour.com in Turin, where he and seven other recently retired ATP Tour stars were honoured in a special ceremony on Friday night at the Nitto ATP Finals. “For me, when I was ending [my career], it was a bit of a negative because something is coming to an end that you are so passionate about and so invested in. But you can look back and enjoy those things.”

 Edmund turned pro in 2012, the year that Andy Murray ended Great Britain's 76-year wait for a men's singles major champion at the US Open. Within three years, Edmund was making more British tennis history alongside Murray in the Davis Cup: the 20-year-old made his debut for his country in the 2015 final against Belgium, just three months after he broke the Top 100 for the first time, as Great Britain won its first title for 79 years. 

 Renowned for his huge forehand, which combined raw power with vicious whipped topspin, Edmund went on to win two ATP 250 titles — in Antwerp in 2018 and New York in 2020 — while his standout moment at the majors came at the 2018 Australian Open. He defeated then-World No. 12 Kevin Anderson and No. 3 Grigor Dimitrov en route to the semi-finals in Melbourne, where he fell to Marin Cilic. 

 “In terms of achievements, definitely Davis Cup,” said Edmund, when asked what he considers to be his career highlights. “Also my first Tour title, at the end I was very emotional, because that was a goal I had, to win a Tour event. Then the run in Australia. Those are the ones that stick out for me. 

 “Then there are little ones like playing at Wimbledon as a British kid, playing for my country, and obviously the Olympics as well. Those are things that actually, looking back, are really special moments that you will always have. They don't go away. So it's been nice to reflect in that way.”

 Even in spite of his injury struggles, Edmund remained competitive right up until his retirement. In his final professional tournament, a grass-court ATP Challenger Tour event in Nottingham in July, he reached the final. Yet the foundations had already been laid for the Yorkshireman's decision to end a career in which he racked up 119 tour-level singles wins, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. 

 “There was no specific thing, but definitely various things that just sort of added up,” explained Edmund, when asked about the main reason for retiring when he did. “As a player you are always fighting in terms of trying to get through and you just have that fighting mentality. That's what I felt I was doing a lot with my injury and obviously physically there is a toll on your body with all the surgeries. 

 “Mentally as well you're always trying to push through the rehab, and once you get through the rehab you're trying to play again and win. I was coming back in terms of I'd been playing for a period of time, but every now and again I would get something else that came up that would just stop me for two or three months.”

 Deciding to retire is a difficult moment in any athlete's career, no matter their achievements or status, but Edmund is ready to use his experiences on the tennis circuit to inform the chapter of his life. 

 “You do realise and learn that it is a privilege to be a professional athlete at the highest level, when you don't have it,” said Edmund, who has enjoyed some time off and is now considering his next moves, with a preference to stay working in sport. “Looking back, I've always said that subconsciously maybe you don't realise, but at a professional level when you are on court and you are not in a team, you are sort of the leader of yourself. 

 “You're making decisions for yourself all the time, which are qualities that help you in life, that take you onto the next thing. As I finish, I realise that what I've been exposed to will help me. You've got to earn your way there, but when you are on the Tour playing these types of events, it is very rewarding. You can see that with the occasions you are playing in.”

MSNBC transformed into the newly named MS NOW on Saturday morning, as the network splits from parent company Comcast.


	“Don't adjust your settings,” Jonathan Capehart, co-host of The Weekend, told viewers shortly after 7 a.m. ET, from studios in Washington. “We are formerly MSNBC. As of this moment, we have a new name, MS NOW, which stands for My Source for News Opinion and the World. But other than that, and these snazzy new graphics, not much is changing. Bottom line: Same mission, new name.”


	Moments earlier, viewers saw Morning Joe Weekend host Willie Geist sign off for the final time under the MSNBC name, with a shot of the NBC Peacock logo.

	MS NOW has been preparing for this moment since last year, when Comcast announced that it would be spinning off MSNBC along with other cable networks into a new company, later named Versant. MS NOW has built up its own newsroom, as NBC News no longer is a sister network.




			Watch on Deadline		







	MS NOW will not stream episodes of its shows after they air on Peacock, the Comcast service, although past MSNBC shows like Morning Joe and Deadline White House with Nicolle Wallace were still available as of Saturday morning. MSNBC ended its original programming on Peacock several years ago, but some MSNBC shows were available the next day. MS NOW will be available to pay TV subscribers on its mobile app and Roku, tvOS, Fire TV, Android TV and Comcast Xumo connected apps.


	The website has changed as well, to MS.NOW, with MSNBC.com redirecting to that page.

	











	MSNBC was launched in 1996 as a partnership between NBC News and Microsoft. With an initial focus on internet connectivity, the network eventually transformed into a channel offering a mix of news and opinion, and Microsoft eventually sold its stake but the name remained.

How long before these Versant channels are sold off and it becomes another home for old sitcom marathons?

Comcast EPG still has MSNBC in the listings.  Over a year to get ready and they still cant flip a switch at the right time.

Capehart one of their weakest hosts

He's not the only one.  If you watch Morning Joe and that lineup following the show, you would not be impressed by any of them with the exception of Lawrence O'Donnell late night.

Before tearing it up at Bravocon, the 46-year-old mom and “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” stunner strutted her stuff on the beaches of St Barths in the Caribbean. She was joined by her husband, Joe Gorga, whose sister is “RHONJ” mainstay Teresa Giudice. Both Melissa and Joe looked fit, tan, and happy as they posed in the crystal waters for a photo, which she posted to her Instagram. 

Recently engaged costar and fan favorite, Dolores Catania, commented “Unreallll,” complete with a fire emoji. Fellow reality gals, Kristin Cavallari and Heather Dubrow, also liked it. 

Aside from a break from the chilly New Jersey weather, this beach vacay no doubt gives Melissa the chance to clear her mind from the ever-present questions pertaining to her possible reconciliation with Teresa, her sister-in-law. They feuded from Melissa's arrival on “RHONJ” in season 3, when Teresa was already a cast member, to the show itself being in limbo at the end of season 14.

While promoting her episode of “Wife Swap: The Real Housewives addition,” Melissa told Page Six's “Virtual Real-Tea” that she hopes for a private reunion that will serve their relationship and not the cameras.

On the future of the show itself, in September, she said at the Virtual Reali-Tea Awards, “The truth is, they're figuring it out. I know you don't want to hear this – none of us wants to hear this. I wish I had better answers for you, but they're figuring it out.”

Aside from “RHONJ,” Melissa is focusing on her cookie empire. Specifically, expanding her “Let's Sprinkle by MG” cookie and coffee line. In season 3 of “RHONJ,” fans surely remember when Melissa brought sprinkle cookies to Teresa's home and all hell broke loose because Teresa's favorite cookies are of the pignoli variety. It's nice to see that years later, Melissa decided to turn that moment of sister strife into a thriving business.

In addition to marketing cookies, cakes, and coffee, Melissa also runs three Envy boutiques (two in New Jersey and one on Long Island, NY). She also had a podcast, “On Display with Melissa Gorga,” but she took a step back from that in July of this year to focus on her other business ventures. And from the looks of her recent beach adventure, the future looks bright.

When Arnold Schwarzenegger played game show contestant Ben Richards in the 1987 version of Stephen King's dystopian novel “The Running Man,” his adventures took place in a relatively confined subterranean world. When “Baby Driver” and “Last Night in Soho” director Edgar Wright took on the challenge of reimagining King's novel for 2025, he decided to go back to the more ambitious scale of the original story — even though it meant taking on the biggest production of his career.

“In the original Stephen King [writing under the pseudonym Richard Bachman] book, the playing field of the game is the world,” Wright told IndieWire's Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “Ben Richards leaves the network studio, and he's got to exist in the world for 30 days. It's hide and seek on a national, even global scale — there's nothing in the rules to say you couldn't get out of the country. The Arnold Schwarzenegger version kept it all contained.”

With that in mind, Wright pitched his “Running Man,” in which Glen Powell plays the game show contestant running for his life, less as a remake than a new adaptation of the novel. “We wanted to do the book, and we wanted to have the same scale as the book,” Wright said, though he acknowledged that after completing the film, he understood why the makers of the 1987 movie went a different way. “Having now done the shoot and been totally exhausted by it, I understand it was a practical decision rather than an artistic one.”

 










“The Running Man,” which encompassed 165 different locations and sets across England, Scotland, and Bulgaria, may have exhausted Wright, but for the audience it's more energizing than tiring thanks to the movie's high style and carefully calibrated pacing. It's essentially a non-stop chase in the tradition of Sam Peckinpah's “The Getaway” (adapted by screenwriter Walter Hill from the Jim Thompson novel), and it not only shares that film's elegant sense of structure and visual dynamism but its approach to the hero.

“ Usually when I make a movie, we watch a good luck film before we start production,” Wright said. “The week before we started shooting, we got together and watched ‘The Getaway,' because Glen had actually never seen it. It's a great example of a great movie star performance. [Steve] McQueen had immense power and charisma, not saying very much at all, and you could point to a lot of his performances, but that's a really great one in terms of how to hold the screen.”

Powell's version of Richards has a tightly coiled rage reminiscent of McQueen in “The Getaway,” but what really makes the performance work is his vulnerability — the fight scenes are sometimes as clumsy as they are kinetic, giving the viewer the sense that Ben Richards could easily be defeated at any given point. “He's a tough character, but he's not John Wick,” Wright said. “He's not Jason Bourne. He doesn't have amazing action skills. He's fallible, and he makes mistakes.”

 










In addition to McQueen's Doc McCoy in “The Getaway,” Wright had two other reference points for the characters. “We talked about two performances a lot,” Wright said. “One was Harrison Ford in ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark,' because he's an adventurer, but he's not perfect. The key moment is when he says, ‘I don't know, I'm making this up as I go along.' Or I think of Ford getting punched in the face and falling like a sack of potatoes. He's not superhuman.”

The other influence was Bruce Willis' performance as John McClane in “Die Hard.” “In the first one at least, even though he's a cop, the exciting thing is that for large portions of the film, he's out of his depth, and you think there's no way that he can take on all of these guys and win. What we talked about [in ‘The Running Man'] was the idea that Ben Richards is on his heels the entire time, and there's something really fun and hopefully exciting about the fact that he's just trying to tough his way through it.”

Although the scale of “The Running Man” was more elaborate even than big-budget Wright films like “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,” the director said he had a safety net in the form of collaborators with whom he had worked many times before. What really made him nervous wasn't making the movie — it was getting script approval from the book's author, one of Wright's childhood heroes.

 










“[Stephen King]  is a producer on the film and had script approval and some cast approval as well,” Wright said. “I had been in contact with him on and off for years, and he'd always been really kind, but when I was working on [the script for ‘The Running Man'], I didn't talk to him about it until we were very close to it happening, because I didn't want to be the boy who cried wolf. The idea of getting in touch with him about the script and the film not happening would be heartbreaking to me.”

Once Wright was pretty sure the movie was on its way to a green light, he sent King the script he co-wrote with Michael Bacall and waited for the author's response. “Stephen King is probably the most famous English teacher in the world, and it was literally having to hand in your homework to Stephen King and over a very long weekend. At one point, he started reviewing it page by page, and my heart couldn't take it. I was like, ‘Please, just read the whole thing!'”

Luckily, King liked the script, but after some early conversations about casting, he stayed away until the movie was finished. When Wright showed King the film and finally met him in person on a visit to Bangor, Maine, where the author lives, he got the perfect response. 

“He said this thing that really stuck with me, and it's what I hope the audience will take away from it as well,” Wright said. “He said, ‘It's faithful enough to the original book to keep the fans happy, but different enough to keep me excited.' And I was thinking, ah, you can't say it better than that. I couldn't ask for anything more, really.”

Pierce Brosnan reunited with his estranged son this week, but now the bizarre truth behind their tragic feud has finally been unmasked.

Pierce Brosnan publicly reunited with his estranged troubled son earlier this week, but new details reveal just how difficult it must have been for the Bond actor to let bygones be bygones. 

While his son's former drug addiction struggles are much publicised and the reason why Pierce originally cut contact with Chris Brosnan, 56, major clues now point to it not having been the only cause of fracture between the father and son pair. 

Rewind back to 2020, Pierce shared a heartbreaking story with Parade Magazine where he revealed that he had lost two close friends during the pandemic. 

“I lost two friends to COVID-19,” he said, adding: “they were friends of 45 years, and I am godfather to [one's] son.”

“You have to keep pushing the rock uphill, and you have to keep involved in life. We are at war. People are dying.”

During this time, Pierce and his son were still very much estranged, at least publicly, which is no surprise considering what Chris shares on his public Facebook profile.

According to Daily Mail, the bizarre account is filled with hundreds of posts concerning his dark obsession with Covid conspiracy theories. 

According to just some of his posts, Chris believes both coronavirus and the subsequent lockdowns were part of a larger global conspiracy.

He went to a huge gathering of people protesting against Covid lockdowns in August 2020 in Trafalgar Square, London. 

Furthermore, he also claims that “chemtrails” visible in the sky show that we are being poisoned by metals by the government.

Chris also captioned a picture of numerous world leaders at the G7 summit in 2022: “Hell is empty, and all the devils are here.”

The G7 Summit is used for world leaders to discuss important issues such as climate change, something that's very dear to Pierce's heart as an environmentalist. 

It paints a picture of someone with vastly differing believes to Pierce, who has proudly previously labelled himself an environmentalist, left-wing and anti-Trump. 

“I love nature,” Pierce told Gentleman's Journal in 2021. “I grew up in the countryside. But it was because of Ted Danson and his oceans campaign that I began to support this work, as an environmentalist. He is a very passionate man. And, because of his concerns for the ocean, and living in Malibu, my interest was spawned there. Once you put your toe into those waters, there's no going back.

“Because we are in a pretty bad shape, you know?” the actor added. “With what we do to the oceans, and the dismantling of the old growth trees and deforestation. So that work is very close to my heart.”

A close friend of Pierce's told Daily Mail Chris is known to have some “wild” personal views on the world. 

“Chris is a nice guy. He's not a bad person at all, and he's not a Hollywood brat,” said the pal. 

“Some of his views are a bit wild but you can only speak as you find, and he's always seemed like one of the good people. He never traded on the whole ‘My dad was James Bond' thing.

“I saw him recently in London by chance. He didn't look so good but he's been through a lot. He had a baseball cap on and long hair. He seems to have smartened himself up and straightened out in recent months. His life has been so tragic that you can only wish him well.”

Chris battled a cocaine and heroin addiction, dating back to the 2000s.

In 2005, Pierce came to the decision to cut ties with his son, after his addiction had gotten so bad it saw him fall into a coma from an overdose.

Speaking to Playboy at the time about having hope for his son's recovery, Pierce shared: “Christopher is still very lost. Shockingly so. I know where he is, but he's having a hard life.

“I can only have strong faith and believe he will recover.

“He has tested everybody in this family but none more so than himself.

“He knows how to get out. He doesn't want to.”

Paris Jackson has revealed how her past drug abuse has “ruined her life” - zooming in on her permanent injury in a new video.

This Hollywood actor was spotted out and about with his estranged son for the first time in two decades.

The 19-year-old son of two very famous showbiz figures has made a rare appearance on his celebrity mum's social media.

From Texas and Iowa to Arkansas, faith leaders are wading into politics to counter the rise of Christian nationalism

He grew up on a farm in Indiana, the son of a factory worker and eldest of five children. He studied at Liberty, a Christian university founded by the conservative pastor and televangelist Jerry Falwell, and recalls wearing a T-shirt expressing opposition to Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry.

Two decades later, Justin Douglas is running for the US Congress – as a Democrat.

He is among around 30 Christian white clergy – pastors, seminary students and other faith leaders – known to be potential Democratic candidates in next year's midterm elections, including a dozen who are already in the race. While stressing the separation of church and state, many say that on a personal level their faith is calling them into the political arena.

The trend marks a break from a traditional racial divide. Whereas Black pastors who run for office are typically Democrats, their white counterparts are usually Republicans, reflecting the strength of the religious right and the party's dominance among evangelical voters.

Douglas, 41, based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, is among a new generation of the Christian left aiming to change that narrative by ensuring that the Democratic brand is not associated with only college-educated urbanites, but can also connect with white working class churchgoers.

“We've seen Democrats time and time again sell out working class people and we've seen Democrats time and time again look like liberal elitists who are looking down on people who think going to church on Sunday is a core part of their life,” said Douglas, who has been in ministry for more than 20 years. “Some people might feel judged for that.

“But I also think the stereotypes of Republicans being pro-faith are bullshit too. We're seeing a current administration bastardise faith almost every day. They used the Lord's Prayer in a propaganda video for what they're now calling the Department of War. That should have had every single evangelical's bells and whistles and alarms going off in their head: this is sacrilegious.

“But unfortunately sometimes when you're in it you can't see it and it takes somebody who has an ability to communicate to that audience, to help show that you're being manipulated.”

For decades, many white Christians were not partisan and often voted Democratic, especially in the south. But by the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Democratic party's identity was shifting toward civil rights, feminism and secular liberalism. Many white conservative Christians felt increasingly alienated from the party they had long inhabited.

The racial divide can in part be traced to the mid-1970s when the Internal Revenue Service began removing tax-exempt status from private schools that discriminated by race. Conservative Christian leaders such as Jerry Falwell saw this as federal overreach and seized on abortion as an issue that could be framed in religious and political terms.

Falwell's organisation The Moral Majority used abortion as a broader symbol of moral decline alongside feminism, sex education and gay rights. His followers then felt betrayed when Jimmy Carter, the first evangelical Christian to occupy the White House, failed to pursue their priorities.

They defected to Republican Ronald Reagan and, by the end of the 1980s, white evangelicals had become one of the most consistently Republican voting blocs, even as Black churchgoers remained loyal to Democrats. That has persisted over the past decade under Donald Trump, seen by critics as vulgar and unchristian but by supporters as a blunt instrument to defend a church under siege by a godless liberal culture.

Whereas Carter earned 60% of the white evangelical vote in 1976, fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton gained only a 16% share in 2016. It was a troubling realignment that caught the eye of Doug Pagitt, a pastor and executive director of the progressive Christian group Vote Common Good.

He said: “That's not natural. That's not just a policy change. There was something more significant going on. It's been a two sided effort. Republicans have oriented themselves primarily around religious voter identity and Democrats have set aside religious voter identity, including the fact that in 1992 Democrats removed from the voter access file the category of religious identity.”

Pagitt said Charlie Kirk's organisation Turning Point USA was vital in turning out young Christian voters for Trump last year. “The difference couldn't be more stark, which is why white clergy running for office is such a big deal when they're running as Democrats in Iowa, in Arkansas, in Pennsylvania, in California.”

Trump's first election was the trigger for a new wave of white clergy to overcome fears of being seen as partisan and run for elected office. Pagitt added: “After 2016 and 2018, a whole lot of people started thinking: ‘Hey, maybe running for office is something we should actually do.'

“Few people are surprised when Raphael Warnock says, ‘I'm a working pastor at Ebenezer Baptist church.' He comes from the Martin Luther King tradition, from that pulpit, and it made sense: people are like, ‘Yeah, of course a Black clergyman's going to run as a Democrat.' But when a white woman pastor in Iowa says, ‘I'm going to run as a Democrat,' it's a real statement. It's taken some of these people a little while to get comfortable with the fact that they are going to be partisan.”

Vote Common Good was founded in response to a schism created by the election of Trump, which left many religious people feeling “politically homeless”. The group operates as a “dating service”, connecting these voters with Democrats and non-Maga Republicans. The group will spend time in 50 congressional districts this year helping candidates meet faith voters and leaders in their districts.

Douglas is a county commissioner looking to unseat Republican Scott Perry in Pennsylvania's 10th district. But he was previously the lead pastor of a growing church that allowed LGBTQ+ individuals to participate fully in its community; over the course of a year this developed into a huge bone of contention and in 2019 Douglas eventually lost his licence. He had to find a new house and go from one job to three jobs including driving an Uber and CrossFit coaching. He started a new church that is still operating today.

Douglas recalls: “I paid the price for standing with the LGBTQ+ people. I would do it again. It taught me that doing what's right is often costly but always necessary, and everyone deserves to be safe, respected and fully included. That's not a religious belief. It's a human belief that I have.”

James Talarico, a Texas state representative and a 36-year-old part-time seminary student who has amassed a sizable social-media following – has become an unlikely standard-bearer in the Democrats' 2026 Senate primary.

In a series of social media posts, he deploys scripture to champion the poor and vulnerable while castigating Republicans for what he casts as their drift towards Christian nationalism and corporate interests. He asked in one: “Instead of posting the Ten Commandments in every classroom, why don't they post, ‘Money is the root of all evil' in every boardroom?”

In Iowa, state representative Sarah Trone Garriott, an Evangelical Lutheran pastor, is seeking her party's nod to challenge Republican incumbent Zach Nunn in what is already billed as one of the nation's marquee congressional races.

In Arkansas, Robb Ryerse, a Christian pastor and former Republican, is mounting a challenge to congressman Steve Womack, adopting the slogan “Faith, Family & Freedom” – rhetoric more commonly found in Republican campaign literature.

Ryerse, 50, from Springdale, Arkansas, said: “I joke sometimes that the two people who have changed my life more than any others are Jesus and Donald Trump, for very different reasons. Donald Trump is absolutely inconsistent with Christian principles of love and compassion, justice, looking out for the poor, meeting the needs of the marginalised.

“But Donald Trump has also used and been used by so many evangelical leaders who want political power. He has used them to validate him to their followers and they have used him to further their agenda, which has been a Christian nationalist culture war on the United States, which I think is bad for both the church and for the country.”

White clergy are deciding to run for office, Ryerse believes, in part as a response to the rise of Christian nationalism and the reality that, according to a Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) survey, Trump won 85% of the white evangelical vote in last year's presidential election.

Ryerse said: “We realise hey, our churches and the people in our churches have been duped by this guy and so rather than hope someone else will clean up the problem, what we've seen is a lot of pastors respond with, you know what, I'm going to jump in and I'm going to be a part of the solution.

“On a more positive note, there's also that notion we need to do something for the common good. There's so much alignment between what I believe personally is good for my neighbour, what it means to love my neighbour, and how that aligns with what public policy ought to be.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

After a two-week blackout, YouTube TV and Disney announced Friday that they have reached a deal.

In addition to bringing Disney networks like ABC, ESPN, and FX back to YouTube's streaming TV service, the deal will also see ESPN make its new direct-to-consumer service available on YouTube TV at no additional price. YouTube will also be able to sell select Disney networks and the Disney+/Hulu bundle as part of different packages.

In a statement, Disney Entertainment Co-Chairmen Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, described the deal as one that “recognizes the tremendous value of Disney's programming and provides YouTube TV subscribers with more flexibility and choice.”

“We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football,” the Disney executives added.

YouTube also released a statement Friday saying that subscribers would see the affected channels restored “throughout the course of the day.” The company also said, “We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers' patience as we negotiated on their behalf.”

YouTube TV is meant to be a cable TV alternative for cord cutters, but like most cable TV providers, the service has had its share of disputes with major content providers — usually over how much money to pay them and how much flexibility it has to offer their content in different bundles.

The last time YouTube and Disney renegotiated in 2022, there was a similar (if significantly briefer) blackout. This time around, YouTube offered customers a $20 credit that they can apply to their next bill.

One survey even suggested that due to the Disney blackout, 24% of the service's more than 10 million subscribers said they had already canceled their subscription or planned to do so soon. (A YouTube spokesperson said actual churn was “manageable and does not align with the findings of this survey.”)

Indeed, TechCrunch's Amanda Silberling said the blackout was ruining her life because she couldn't watch “Jeopardy!” Thankfully, her two-week nightmare is over.

Crystal Palace star Daniel Munoz admitted he would love to make a switch to Manchester United despite playing for their Premier League rivals. The 29-year-old has been nothing short of transformative since arriving at Selhurst Park from Genk in January 2024. His first full season in England saw him score six goals and provide eight assists in all competitions. It was a level of productivity that caught the attention of Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and several elite clubs across the continent.

Munoz's journey to the top of European football has been anything but conventional. Growing up in Medellín, a city once synonymous with cartel violence and some of Colombia's most dangerous neighbourhoods, he had little margin for error. 

""I come from a difficult neighbourhood,"" he told Belgian newspaper HLN. ""One of the toughest in Colombia. There are few options. I don't think you know that in Belgium. Young people don't have the chance to just become what they want to become.

“It was difficult for me and my family. There have been certain moments that have shaped me, such as the death of several friends. You see a lot of things: death, hooliganism, robbery… it is a different world, one where everything does not always end well. At one point, I had to make a choice. Which way do I want to go? Do I choose the path that ends as it ended with one of my friends? Or do I walk a different path and make the best of it? I chose the latter.""

Those experiences hardened him and shaped him into a player and person who understands adversity far better than most. Before he ever stepped onto a professional pitch, Munoz was part of the ultras at Atletico Nacional, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Los del Sur, as he sang and chanted for the club he adored. And at 16, he walked away from the terraces to pursue the game full-time.

Munoz's early professional years with Aguilas Doradas saw him play nearly 100 matches in Colombia's top flight before he fulfilled his childhood dream of joining Atletico Nacional in 2019. In less than two seasons, he became the captain of his team.

His performances drew the eye of European scouts, and Genk paid €4.5 million to bring him to Belgium. There, he blossomed into the Jupiler League's standout right-back, and Palace did not hesitate when the opportunity arrived, signing him on a four-year deal. Since then, Munoz has become an indispensable piece of Glasner's high-intensity system. He assisted the goal that helped the Eagles clinch the FA Cup last season and his consistent performances reportedly drew interest from Barcelona and Champions League winners PSG.

Munoz spoke candidly to Colombian outlet ASabout the long-standing rumours linking him to major European powers.

""First of all, I think there's a lot of talk about one club or another,"" Munoz said. ""If you ask me, it would be a dream come true to play for one of these clubs, whether it's Barcelona, PSG, Real Madrid, or Manchester United.""

Munoz did not disguise the ambition that has fuelled his rise: ""I think I'm working towards that; I strive every day to one day attract the attention of one of these clubs, because it's a dream of mine to get there.""

However, the defender quickly brushed aside those rumours and insisted that he remains focussed on his job at Palace. 

""Right now I'm focused on my club, on doing things well at Crystal Palace,"" he said. ""If you ask me, I don't have any concrete information that any of these clubs are interested in me. My focus is on Crystal Palace; we'll see when the winter transfer window gets closer. Right now, I'm fully focused on these two matches with the national team.""

For Palace supporters, his words might provoke mixed emotions. On the one hand, his desire to reach the highest level and play for the European heavyweights is very natural. On the other hand, his presence has been vital to their transformation under Glasner. However, he has a contract with the Eagles until 2028, and any suitor will have to fork out a significant transfer fee to whisk him away from the English capital. In the short term, Munoz will complete Colombia's upcoming internationals against New Zealand and Australia during the November break. After returning to London, he will shift focus to Palace's next Premier League fixture against Wolves on November 22.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'Sent my head to Mars'","https://www.goal.com/en-gb/lists/arsenal-fans-livid-gabriel-limps-off-groin-issue-brazil-international-friendly-senegal-emirates/blt217adb461a194df1","Sat, 15 Nov 2025 18:16:11 GMT","

Arsenal have been handed another blow in their pursuit of the Premier League crown after star defender Gabriel hobbled off with an apparent groin issue for Brazil. The centre-back was playing on home soil at the Emirates, in an international friendly against Senegal. In the second half, he went down in some discomfort and was subsequently taken off, looking furious.

The Gunners already have a lengthy injury list, with the likes of Martin Odegaard, Viktor Gyokeres and Gabriel Martinelli all missing in recent weeks. Riccardo Calafiori has reportedly returned to north London after picking up an injury while training with the Italian national team, he will miss their upcoming World Cup qualifier against Norway as a result. 

Gabriel looks to be the latest player heading for the treatment table, which is terrible news for the north London club ahead of three crucial games after the international break.

The sight of their most valuable defender exiting the pitch during an international friendly in their ground inevitably drew fiery reactions from the Arsenal faithful son social media. 

One non-plussed fan, Jadinho97, wrote on X: ""Gabriel getting injured on international duty at the Emirates has sent my head to Mars.""

Edduizy posted: ""Gabriel off injured for Brazil in yet another useless friendly."" 

Another X user, @sakamvent asked: ""What is the point of international breaks?  Calafiori and Gabriel are now injured, just when we thought we would catch a bit of break with injuries they start to pile up again."" 

LongJeff called the incident, ""horrific horrible news."" 

BiancaKG had a more selfish reaction when she posted: ""Gabriel getting injured doesn't bode well for my FPL Team.""

The handwringing of angry Arsenal fans is understandable. Gabriel has played every minute of the Gunners' Premier League campaign so far this season, and has appeared in all four of their Champions League fixtures too. When Gabriel has featured this term, Arsenal have conceded just five times, while the Brazilian has also chipped in two goals of his own going forward.  

The suspected injury could not come at a worse time for Mikel Arteta's side. First up after the international break, the Gunners take on their north London rivals Tottenham on November 23. That hellacious affair is quickly followed by a marquee matchup against Harry Kane's Bayern Munich. The Bavarian giants are undefeated this term, winning sixteen straight games to kick off their 2025/26 term. A massive week for the title hopeful's season concludes with another London derby, this time against third-placed Chelsea away at Stamford Bridge. 

With a lengthening injury list, no player will be more crucial to these tricky fixtures than the totemic Brazilian. Arsenal fans will be hoping against hope that Gabriel was taken off as a precaution, and that he can feature in this upcoming gauntlet of games.

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

Adventurous athleisure, the cool cowboy, and striking sunglasses – 31 years on from securing his maiden World Championship title, here's how Michael Schumacher's fashion transformed throughout his illustrious F1 career.

There aren't many Formula 1 drivers quite like Michael Schumacher. His ruthlessness, meticulous attention to detail, and pure speed was the perfect recipe for not just success, but total domination.

The German won a staggering seven Drivers' Championships, including five in a row with Ferrari, and claimed his first ever title 31 years ago this week. Across 308 Grands Prix, Schumacher achieved an unbelievable 91 wins, 155 podiums, and 68 pole positions – but his legacy goes far beyond the numbers.__

Schumacher once said, “Just being a mediocre driver has never been my ambition. That's not my style.” Michael carried that ethos into his fashion – which was certainly not mediocre. Whether it was his early days at Benetton, his glory days at Ferrari or his shock comeback with Mercedes, here's how Schumacher's style ebbed and flowed with each era.

Schumacher exploded onto the scene at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix with Jordan, immediately impressing with a fearless P7 in his debut Qualifying session at the daunting Spa-Francorchamps circuit. This session alone was enough to secure a seat with Benetton for the rest of the season.

This era was all about raw and aggressive driving, and Schumacher made plenty of waves in the Formula 1 paddock. But as Michael was finding his feet in the cockpit, his fashionable reputation also began to take shape.

Athleisure dominated the 1990s, and Schumacher leaned into this trend. Hard. Tracksuit trousers tucked into white socks, tight bicycle shorts, and quarter zips were Schumacher's favourite off-duty uniform. His fashion sense was functional and unpretentious, much like his driving style.

Joining Ferrari was a risk for Schumacher. The team hadn't won the Drivers' Championship since Jody Scheckter's 1979 triumph. Could he help turn the team around? His driving style had to become more refined as the car wouldn't allow him to drive in his signature style. So, the early Ferrari years were all about testing. He spent hundreds of hours at Fiorano refining the car, where he mastered his control of oversteer, allowing him to place the car exactly where he wanted.

While he was tuning his car, Schumacher kept his style profile to a minimum, often opting for jeans, Ferrari shirts and caps. Despite playing it safe in the early days, the German was still creating a name for himself in fashion.

In 1996, Schumacher teamed up with Nike, famous for their collaboration with Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan, to create a signature racing shoe. The Ferrari red shoe is now a rare collectors' item, proving that even as he focused on perfecting his racing, Michael was still cementing his status as a style icon.

As his confidence grew, so did his style in the paddock, and the latter half of his Ferrari era was all about dressing to impress. Schumacher was winning races and dominating headlines. He became known for pairing cowboy boots with floral shirts to make a statement – an unexpected look for a driver of a heritage team like Ferrari. However, these kinds of looks were not entirely leftfield for Schumacher, who enjoyed riding horses and owns several horse ranches.

At this point, Schumacher was experimenting with fashion more than ever before. He would pair leather jackets with graphic tees and large cowboy belts. Schumacher wasn't afraid to play with proportions, choosing figure-hugging t-shirts and oversized jackets.

In 2008, Schumacher attended a film premiere with his wife, Corrina, wearing leather trousers and a fur-trimmed leather coat. An incredibly bold look that showcased his love of fashion risk-taking.

When Schumacher returned to the track after retirement, a lot had changed. There were new tyres, new technology, and new teams, as Michael became part of Mercedes' brand-new line-up.

For Schumacher, having achieved all that there was in the sport, this era was all about progressing the fledgling team, so his personal style took a back seat. A more subdued, corporate look replaced his previously bold, expressive style. Leather jackets and bright shirts were replaced with team kits and trainers – very much in line with the style of early 2010s.

You couldn't separate Schumacher from his impressive collection of sunglasses. They were a staple around the paddock, but they weren't just fashion accessories. They were functional performance gear that he often wore on podiums and in public. They became so synonymous with him as a driver that he created his own range, The Michael Schumacher Collection.

His shades perfectly reflected Schumacher's approach to fashion: functional, performance-oriented, but unquestionably stylish. The wraparound style he often wore was both practical for all the time he spent around the circuit in bright sunlight and on-brand for his high-octane lifestyle.

Whether they were golden, black or silver, the shades were always chic. Swipe to see more images

Fans of the sport know that there would be no paddock fashion now without the likes of Schumacher or Ayrton Senna leading the way. While today's paddock resembles a runway, bold and unique looks can be few and far between.

Drivers like Lewis Hamilton, Lando Norris, Yuki Tsunoda, Daniel Ricciardo, and Fernando Alonso have used fashion to express themselves, often drawing inspiration from past drivers. Hamilton has worn several outfits that commemorate Senna, for example. And if you look at any '90s and Y2K-inspired mood board, there will be at least one reference to Michael Schumacher.

Schumacher's fashion choices continue to inspire the next generation long after he left the sport. He made bold decisions on the track, and even bolder ones with his paddock style.

Schumacher once said, “If you do things to the limit, and don't purposely go over that limit, then I think it's fine to do whatever you want. So long as you enjoy it – that's what's important.” You can see that in how he expressed himself. Michael did what he wanted, explored his limits, and enjoyed every second.

	Hot on the heels of Contenders Film: London, Deadline is back home in Los Angeles where it all began — the birthplace of our Contenders and the original beloved city of Hollywood moviemaking. Contenders Film: Los Angeles gets underway today at 9:30 a.m. PT, with the daylong, in-person-only event for awards voters showcasing the stars and creatives behind 13 films on the awards-season hot lists.


	Here on our stage, we will have some of the most talked-about films of the season, and a level of talent that truly stands the test of time. Here's looking at you, June Squibb! While she will be beaming in virtually to our stage to chat with Eleanor the Great screenwriter and executive producer Tory Kamen, the 95-year-old Squibb has a pretty decent excuse for not being here in person: she's busy preparing to tread the boards every night on Broadway right now.

	











	Speaking of the theater, we'll have a nod to Ibsen on hand with the team from Hedda, Nia DaCosta's innovative screen adaptation of the play Hedda Gabler. DaCosta will be joined by star Tessa Thompson and production designer Cara Brower.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In another period story, we're going back to WWII with Nuremberg — writer-director James Vanderbilt's close-up on a psychiatrist, played by Rami Malek, assigned to watch over the Nazis approaching the Nuremberg trials. Vanderbilt and Malek will be with us to talk about the film, which also stars Russell Crowe in the role of Hermann Göring.


	Going further back still, we're in 1930s Mississippi for some vampire magic with Sinners, starring Michael B. Jordan, not once, but twice. Writer-director-producer Ryan Coogler will be on stage to discuss.

	











	And it's back to school with Luca Guadagnino's After the Hunt, the college-set drama written by Nora Garrett and starring Julia Roberts, Ayo Edebiri and Andrew Garfield.


	That's not all. We return to the '90s with Christy, a true-life story of a champion boxer fighting her way to freedom from an oppressive marriage. Sydney Sweeney will be here to talk about taking on this very punchy role as an actor and producer, alongside producer Kerry Kohansky-Roberts.


	All the way from South Korea, we have the satirical black comedy No Other Choice from filmmaker Park Chan-wook, who'll have his lead actor Lee Byung-hun with him on our stage to talk about this film that takes unemployment issues to a whole new level.


	And from Norway, we'll have the team behind Sentimental Value, led by filmmaker Joachim Trier, with his The Worst Person in the World collaborator Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsgård, Elle Fanning and newcomer Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas joining him fo a discussion.


	The makers of Homebound, the Oscar submission for India, will take to our stage too, with director Neeraj Ghaywan and actors Ishan Khatter and Vishal Jethwa. We'll also have some stunning animation on board, with Japanese fantasy feature Dragon Heart: Adventures Beyond this World, from director Isamu Imkake.


	You'll also want to strap in for the ride with F1, the film that puts us in the hot seat with both Brad Pitt and Damson Idris as they race their way to Formula 1 stardom. Director-producer Joseph Kosinski will be at Contenders with supervising sound editor Al Nelson, to talk about capturing the roar of the racetrack, among other things.


	If you need a little soothing music after all that, we've got you covered with not one, but two biopics for you. We'll have the team from Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere, including writer-director-producer Scott Cooper, and Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater will be here with their Blue Moon, Linklater's film about songwriter Lorenz Hart.


	Last but definitely not least, we've giving a shout-out to those brave, unsung heroes of the screen: stuntpeople. They will have their own panel, along with those other all-too-hidden gems: casting directors.


	Check out our lineup below and stay with Deadline all day for panel coverage both on the site and on social via #DeadlineContenders, followed Monday by the launch of the event's streaming site featuring all the panel videos.
