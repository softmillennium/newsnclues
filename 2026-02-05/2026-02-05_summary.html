Trump's comments on Wednesday come just days after he called on Republicans to “nationalize” state-managed elections.

In an interview with NBC News's Tom Llamas on Wednesday, President Donald Trump indicated that it's possible he won't accept the outcome of the 2026 midterms.

Asked whether he'd respect the results of the elections that will be held later this year, Trump said he would only do so if he deemed the outcomes to be legitimate.

“I will [accept the midterm outcomes] if the elections are honest,” Trump said.

Trump also said that if the elections aren't “honestly” conducted, “then something else has to happen.”

The president's judgment on what constitutes an “honest” election is highly suspect, as he has repeatedly peddled falsehoods and debunked conspiracy theories about the results of recent elections.

Within the interview with Llamas, Trump also claimed to have had “a great election” in 2024, describing it as “one of the greatest elections” ever. A closer examination of the election results from that year shows that he won by one of the thinnest margins in history, and did not secure majority support from voters. 

Despite his win in 2024, Trump told Llamas that he still “believe[d] there was cheating” involved in states he did not win.

There is no evidence to corroborate Trump's assertion that widespread fraud disrupted the results of the 2024 election, let alone any other elections for which he has made similar claims. 

Trump's comments come just days after he demanded that Republicans on Capitol Hill “nationalize” elections ahead of the 2026 midterms, ostensibly to prevent “fraud.”

“We have states that I won that show I didn't win. I won in a landslide… I won everything. I won a thing called counties,” Trump falsely claimed in an interview on Monday.

He added:

The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over — we should take over the voting in at least, many, 15 places.' … The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that are so crooked, and they're counting votes.

Article I of the U.S. Constitution dictates that although Congress can regulate how elections are run, it is the states that are charged with determining the “times, places, and manner” of holding federal elections within their boundaries.

Last month, Trump also suggested he should be allowed to “cancel” the midterm elections altogether, though he didn't say he would.

“[Democrats] have the worst policy,” Trump said in January. “How we have to even run against these people — I won't say cancel the election, they should cancel the election, because the fake news would say, ‘He wants the elections canceled. He's a dictator.' They always call me a dictator.”

Trump has a long history of refusing to agree to accept the outcome of elections. During his 2024 presidential campaign, for example, he said he would “absolutely” accept the results of the race, but only if the outcome was “fair and legal and good.”

Most notably, following his loss to former President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race, Trump didn't accept the outcome. After he and his allies lost more than 60 court cases in an attempt to delay or overturn several states' results, Trump and his campaign sought to disrupt the certification of the Electoral College through a “fake electors” scheme. When that didn't work, Trump encouraged a mob of his loyalists to head to the U.S. Capitol building, where they violently breached the building and disrupted the certification ceremony for several hours until he reluctantly called them off later that day.

Trump's allies have chalked up his previous comments about the 2026 election as jokes. But the actions of his Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as his Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Tulsi Gabbard, suggest that Trump may be up to something when it comes to this year's fall races. 

The two entities took part in a raid of an elections center in Fulton County, Georgia, earlier this month, obtaining personal information of voters from the 2020 election, which Trump infamously tried to overturn. Some experts fear the information could be used to help Trump and his GOP allies figure out new ways to disenfranchise voters under the guise of “election reform.”

Gabbard's involvement is unusual, as the Office of the DNI typically focuses on matters of national security and foreign policy. Gabbard justified her participation in the raid by citing her “broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security.”

However, her involvement could suggest that her inquiry, which is separate from the DOJ's investigation, may focus on allegations that foreign nations interfered with the 2020 election, one of many false conspiracy theories that Trump promoted following his loss that year.

The Democratic leaders' supposed demands for reform were already previously condemned as weak and ineffective.

Senate and House minority leaders Chuck Schumer (D-New York) and Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) subtly weakened their already tepid demands for ICE reforms in a press conference on Wednesday — before negotiations with Republicans even started.

In a press conference about the Democrats' demands, the two leaders reiterated their belief that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal immigration agents should not be allowed to wear masks. But they both qualified their statements by saying that this prohibition isn't sweeping.

“Certainly I think there's agreement that no masks should be deployed in an arbitrary and capricious fashion,” said Jeffries. 

“They need identification and no masks, except in extraordinary and unusual circumstances,” said Schumer later in the conference, describing masked, unidentified agents as “secret police.”

The press conference took place after the two leaders met and expressed unity on their demands for reform.

Schumer reiterated this call in an interview with MS NOW on Thursday, saying, “There should be no masks, except in the most unusual of circumstances, you know, some guy's picture was put up by a terrorist group or something.” His comment ignores, perhaps, that the Trump administration is seeking to characterize any dissidents as “terrorists,” internal documentation has shown.

The softening of their wording comes just 11 days after federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, and before negotiations have even officially started. Schumer said on Wednesday that Democrats are “ready to sit down and negotiate,” but negotiations have not yet begun. 

Schumer and Jeffries have sent Republicans a list of 10 demands. They include Schumer's original demands for “use of force” standards and body camera mandates, as well as other demands like an end to racial profiling, ensuring state and local police involvement on investigations, and regulation on the uniforms and equipment worn by officers.

These demands are far weaker than what many critics have said is needed to actually stymie the Trump administration's violent raids.

First, if these demands are met, Democrats would help Republicans pass the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding — something that many Democrats have said should be a nonstarter as long as the raids are going on in order for the party to maintain leverage, or in order to dismantle ICE or DHS altogether.

Further, many of the demands themselves encompass existing guidelines or procedures that DHS officers are being instructed to break. For instance, one of the demands is for DHS officers to be required to have a warrant to enter private property — something already explicitly protected by the Fourth Amendment. Another is for DHS to be required to verify “that a person is not a U.S. citizen before holding them in immigration detention” — something already barred under the law regarding a practice that's cruel even when applied to non-citizens.

The demands have already incensed left-leaning members of Congress.

“I'm gonna continue to tell you that Schumer needs to get the hell out over and over and over until he does,” Rep. Delia C. Ramirez (D-Illinois) told Axios on Thursday. “He continues to demonstrate to us that he can't meet the moment.”

Barrick Mining Corp. ABX-T is moving forward with plans to spin out its North American assets into a new publicly listed company and also named Mark Hill as its permanent chief executive officer, providing some certainty around its future following an intense period of leadership turmoil.

The miner has operated in a chaotic environment for the past six months. Former CEO Mark Bristow was ousted in September, with Mr. Hill, a two-decade company veteran, appointed as interim CEO in the wake. Two months later, Barrick's lead independent director resigned – only six months after joining the board of directors – and several other senior executives also left the company, including Barrick's chief financial officer.

Opinion: For Barrick's mess, board chair John Thornton deserves as much blame as the ousted CEO

Yet through it all, Barrick's share price has soared after years of underperformance. The price of gold has risen sharply, boosting Barrick's bottom line, and the miner also announced a new discovery in Nevada.

Amid the turmoil, activist investor Elliott Investment Management L.P. amassed a large stake in Barrick and started pushing a split into two companies – one that would own Barrick's lower-risk mines in the Americas and another that would hold higher-risk properties in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

On Thursday, Mr. Hill was named permanent CEO, and the miner also said it would move forward with plans to pursue the split. The board concluded that an IPO of the company's North America assets “represents the best path for maximizing value for Barrick's shareholders,” the company said in a statement.

The new publicly listed company will hold joint venture interests in: Nevada Gold Mines, Barrick's operating assets in Nevada; Pueblo Viejo, its operating mine in the Dominican Republic; and Barrick's recently announced Fourmile gold discovery in Nevada, which looks to be a new world-class gold deposit.

Barrick will keep its African assets, which includes the Loulo-Gounkoto complex in Mali that has caused problems for the miner of late, as well as assets such as the undeveloped Reko Diq copper-gold project in Pakistan. After the IPO, Barrick will continue to hold a “significant controlling interest” in the newly created company.

Because of this structure, a major question for investors will be whether the spin out changes all that much.

Barrick also announced a new dividend policy on Thursday that is likely to boost its quarterly payout to shareholders. The company will now target paying out 50 per cent of its free cash flow, with the goal of returning more cash to shareholders.

The miner also reported another death. Barrick had already disclosed a fatal injury in Tanzania in October, and on Thursday the company said another person died at its project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in December.

Barrick's shares fell six per cent in early morning trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The S&P/TSX Capped Gold Index was down 4.5 per cent, largely because of falling gold prices Thursday.

Office of Personnel Management says reclassification will allow agencies to quickly remove employees who ‘obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives'

The Trump administration moved Thursday to issue a rule that would make it easier to fire tens of thousands of federal workers. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said it was reclassifying certain career civil service roles so agencies can “quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives”.

Traditionally, only political appointees – roughly 4,000 positions – can be dismissed “at will”.

Under the new rule, many nonpartisan roles would be shifted into a category called “Schedule Policy/Career,” effectively treating them as political appointees. That reclassification could allow the administration to remove employees it views as disloyal. The rule – set to be published in the Federal Register on Friday – also states that “personal or political loyalty tests as a condition of employment” are prohibited.

Critics argue the change would open the door to politically motivated purges. “We have successfully fought this kind of power grab before, and we will fight this again. We will return to court to stop this unlawful rule and will use every legal tool available to hold this administration accountable to the people,” said Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward.

The largest union representing federal workers called the rule “a direct assault on a professional, nonpartisan, merit-based civil service.” In a statement, American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) president Everett Kelley said OPM is “rebranding career public servants as ‘policy' employees, silencing whistleblowers, and replacing competent professionals with political flunkies without any neutral, independent protections against politicization and arbitrary abuse of power.”

Trump briefly enacted a similar change at the end of his first term through an executive order known as “Schedule F,” which Joe Biden rescinded upon taking office in 2021. Stripping civil service protections has also been a central plank of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 blueprint.

In a statement Thursday, anticipating the rule's release, OPM director Scott Kupor said the reclassification would bring “much-needed accountability to career policy-influencing positions in the Federal government.”

Donald Trump has said that Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi had his “total endorsement” ahead of a legislative election in Japan on Sunday, adding that they would meet on 19 March at the White House.

“Prime Minister Takaichi is someone who deserves powerful recognition for the job she and her Coalition are doing,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

“Therefore, as President of the United States of America, it is my Honor to give a Complete and Total Endorsement of her, and what her highly respected Coalition is representing.”

Takaichi is widely expected to win in the snap election this Sunday.

On the morning of 21 January, Israeli authorities left eight Palestinian men at a West Bank checkpoint. Disoriented and cold, they were dressed in prison-issued tracksuits and carried their few belongings in plastic bags.

Hours earlier, they had been sitting with their wrists and ankles shackled on the plush leather seats of a private jet owned by the Florida property tycoon Gil Dezer, a longtime business partner of Donald Trump.

Dezer is also a Trump donor, friend of Donald Trump Jr and member of the Miami branch of Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.

His sleek Gulfstream jet – which he has called “my little rocket ship” – was used to transport the men from an airport near a notorious removal centre in Arizona to Tel Aviv. The jet made three refuelling stops en route: in New Jersey, Ireland and Bulgaria.

A Guardian investigation has established the flight was part of a secretive and politically sensitive US government operation to deport Palestinians arrested by ICE to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

One of those deported on the January flight was Maher Awad, a 24-year-old originally from the West Bank, who had lived in the US for nearly a decade. Speaking to the Guardian in the town of Rammun, Maher shared photos of his girlfriend and newborn son in Michigan.

“They dropped us off like animals on the side of the road,” Awad said. “We went to a local house, we knocked on the door, we were like: ‘Please help us out.'”

US job openings dropped to the lowest level in more than five years in December and data for the prior month was revised lower amid a softening in labor market conditions at the end of 2025.

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, decreased by 386,000 to 6.542m by the last day of December, the lowest level since September 2020, the labor department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, today.

Data for November was revised down to show 6.928m job openings instead of the previously reported 7.146m. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 7.20m unfilled jobs. Hiring increased by 172,000 positions to a still-low 5.293m in December.

The data came as other numbers showed a larger-than-expected increase in Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a stable labor market.

Here's the full story:

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has said that further US sanctions against Russia depend on talks aimed at ending its nearly four-year-old war in Ukraine, Reuters reports.

Bessent, who participated in talks with Russian officials and Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in Miami on 31 January, said he would consider sanctions against Russia's shadow fleet.

“We will see where the peace talks go,” Bessent said, noting that the Trump administration's sanctions against Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil had helped bring Russia to the negotiating table in the peace talks.

At least two cases of measles have been confirmed at a major immigration detention center for children and their parents in Texas as cases of the dangerous virus in South Carolina, Arizona, Utah and other US states continue growing and alarming experts.

In January alone, the US saw 25% of the total confirmed in all of last year, and the outbreak shows no sign of slowing as federal officials stay silent on vaccination.

The vast majority of patients are not vaccinated, but there have been no national campaigns announced or recent statements from leaders such as Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Last year, Kennedy positioned measles vaccines as a personal choice and recommended unproven treatments for the highly contagious illness.

The measles outbreak is “frightening” and “very worrisome”, said Jason Bowling, professor of infectious diseases at UT Health San Antonio and director of hospital epidemiology at University Health.

“I unfortunately do not see this slowing down across the United States,” said Anna-Kathryn Burch, division director of pediatric infectious diseases at Prisma Health Children's hospital in the Midlands in South Carolina. What's happening in South Carolina could happen anywhere the vaccination rate dips too low, Burch said. “It's not a matter of if, but more likely when.”

The Dilley family detention center in south Texas, one of two immigration facilities for children in the US, reported two measles cases on Friday. “We are aware of the cases and are assisting by providing doses of measles vaccine as requested by ICE,” said Chris Van Deusen, director of media relations at the Texas department of state health services, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Amid the various winding comments throughout Trump's speech today, he said that the Department of Education will officially issue its new guidance to protect the right to prayer in public schools today.

“Now the Democrats will sue us, but we'll win it,” Trump said, eliciting some laughs from the audience at the National Prayer Breakfast. “They'll sue us. They sue us for everything. I'm the most sued human being in history.”

The president is now rattling off a number of states who, he says, have cooperated with federal law enforcement. But has now launched into a tirade on Minnesota.

“They won't work with us,” Trump said, while claiming that he would be able to drive crime down further without the “horrible governor and this horrible fake mayor Frey”.

Trump announced there will be a national prayer event on the National Mall on 17 May. “We're going to rededicate America as one nation under God,” Trump added.

During his speech today, Trump praised Tulsi Gabbard – the director of national intelligence – for her role in the FBI's search of the Fulton county election offices in Georgia last week. Here agents seized almost 700 boxes of 2020 election documentation.

“She took a lot of heat two days ago because she went in at Pam's insistence,” the president said. “They say, ‘why is she doing it'… because Pam [the attorney general] wanted her to do it. And you know why? Because she's smart.”

Earlier this week, the Guardian reported that Gabbard is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump's approval, working separately from the justice department investigation.

“Her position has to do with international,” Trump added today.

He went further:

They've been saying ‘Russia, Russia, Russia has been screwing our elections'. OK, so let's assume Russia had something to do with it. They said, ‘no, no, Russia didn't'… so now they're saying Russia had nothing to do with it. Because if I say Russia, that it's perfectly fine. But you could add China and about five other countries.

Trump's meandered during his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast today. He's denigrated Thomas Massie, the Republican congressman and his frequent target who co-sponsored legislation to release the full tranche of Epstein files, and voted against the most recent funding bill package that the president signed into law on Tuesday. “There's something wrong with him,” Trump said. “ They love voting ‘no'. They think it's good politically.”

The president also touted the military operation in Venezuela, which resulted in the capture of the now deposed leader Nicolás Maduro. “We're getting along fantastically with leadership,” Trump said of the interrim president Delcy Rodriguez.

One note, ahead of the president's address today, we heard from Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador, and a noted Trump ally.

Bukele has worked closely with the Trump administration to accept flights of undocumented immigrants, who they allege are convicted criminals, and hold them in El Salvador's mega-prison, known as CECOT.

Bukele has described himself as the “world's coolest dictator” and has overseen one of the largest crackdowns on crime in his country. Critics have branded him an authoritarian leader, that has done away with due process.

Today he called the gangs that he's worked to eliminate from El Salvador as “satanic”.

“Some of those gangs are here in the United States,” he added. “If God did this for El Salvador he can do this for countries all over the world.”

Donald Trump is in Washington today. As we noted earlier, we'll hear from the president shortly when he attends the National Prayer Breakfast.

Later today we'll also hear from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when she holds a 1pm ET briefing for reporters.

Mass layoffs at the Washington Post have prompted backlash from employees, who have been on “edge” for weeks over the future of the publication.

On Wednesday the publication announced it would be laying off one-third of its workforce, and would be scaling back coverage of sport and foreign news.

“This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world's greatest news organizations,” the Post's celebrated former editor-in-chief Marty Baron said in a statement.

The Guardian's Jeremy Barr reports that staffers at the Post have been worried for weeks about the rumoured cuts, which the publication would not confirm or deny. “It's an absolute bloodbath,” said one employee, not authorized to speak publicly.

During a morning meeting announcing the changes, the editor in chief, Matt Murray, told employees that the Post was undergoing a “strategic reset” to better position the publication for the future, according to several employees who were on the call.

Murray acknowledged that the Post had struggled to reach “customers” and talked about the need to compete in a crowded media marketplace. “Today, the Washington Post is taking a number of actions across the company to secure our future,” he said, according to an audio recording of the meeting.

The affected employees include Caroline O'Donovan, who primarily covers Amazon, the company founded by the Post owner, Jeff Bezos. Other staffers, including the sports journalist Neil Greenberg, have also announced that they were affected.

President Donald Trump is set to attend and deliver remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast later today, a spokesperson from the White House confirmed.

The event is held annually in Washington DC on the first Thursday of every February. It aims to bring together leaders in political, social and business sectors from around the country to an event that merges prayer and networking.

“Today, President Trump will unite our country through the power of prayer at the 74th National Prayer Breakfast,” a White House spokesperson said.

“President Trump has made unprecedented strides to protect our God-given rights and has delivered on his promise to reverse Joe Biden's divisive policies that weaponized the federal government against men and women of faith. President Trump has secured major victories for religious freedom – from defending innocent life to restoring biological truth and protecting parents' fundamental rights.”

Fox News reports that the president first attended the National Prayer Breakfast in 2017 and returned last year, using his remarks to pledge action against what he called anti-Christian bias tied to the Biden administration.

“While I'm in the White House, we will protect Christians in our schools, in our military, in our government, in our workplaces, hospitals and in our public squares, and we will bring our country back together as one nation under God, with liberty and justice for all,” he said during last year's event.

According to the outlet, other notable attenders set to appear at the 2026 event include house speaker Mike Johnson and attorney general Pam Bondi.

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog.

Donald Trump said the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis were both sad incidents that “should not have happened,” but nobody feels worse about both shootings than ICE agents.

“He was not an angel, and she was not an angel,” Trump said of Pretti and Good in a new interview with NBC News. “Still, I'm not happy with what happened there. Nobody can be happy, and ICE wasn't happy either.

“But I'm always going to be with our great people of law enforcement,” he continued. “We have to back them. If we don't back them, we don't have a country.”

This comes as the White House border czar, Tom Homan, says 700 federal agents will leave Minnesota. In the interview, Trump suggested using a “softer touch” in carrying out his aggressive immigration crackdown.

However, Chuck Schumer, the US Senate minority leader, said the reduction of 700 agents wasn't enough. “ICE's abuses go beyond the headlines. Residents are afraid to go to schools, to grocery stores, to even step outside. Agents are patrolling the streets like a military operation,” he said. “All of ICE needs to leave Minneapolis now.”

In other developments:

The second day of US-brokered talks between negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv have been taking place in Abu Dhabi. The discussions come amid increased Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid and a continuing war of attrition.

The Trump administration says it wants to create a critical minerals trading bloc with its allies and partners in order to counter China's stronghold. This would use tariffs to shore up supplies of critical minerals needed for electric vehicles, missiles and other hi-tech products.

The British prime minister Keir Starmer has apologised to Epstein victims for giving Peter Mandelson the US ambassador job. Starmer says Mandelson portrayed Epstein as someone he barely knew. He expressed regret for believing Mandelson's lies and appointing him.

The US Justice Department is under fire for revealing information about Epstein's victims, and hiding the identities of alleged perpetrators, CNN reports. Survivors have accused the DoJ for “botching” the release of the three million documents which came out last week.

Seven Toronto police officers and one retired officer were charged as part of a complex investigation into organized crime and corruption.

Seven police officers from Toronto Police Service and one retired officer have been charged on Wednesday as part of a complex and lengthy investigation into organized crime and corruption sparked by an alleged plot to kill a corrections officer in June, 2025. 

The charges – including bribery, obstruction of justice, extortion, drug trafficking, robbery, and conspiracy to commit murder – were announced at a news conference at York Regional Police Headquarters. 

Police allege that some of the officers unlawfully accessed and funnelled private information to members of an organized crime group, which was then used to facilitate shootings around Southern Ontario – including violence connected to the tow truck industry. 

“This is a deeply disappointing and sad day for policing,” York Regional Police Chief Jim MacSween said. “And it shows the insidious and corrosive nature of organized crime.”

Charged in the corruption probe are Const. Timothy Barnhardt, Sgt. Robert Black, retired Const. John Madeley Sr., his son, Const. John Madeley Jr., Sgt. Carl Grellette, Const. Saurabjit Bedi, Const. Derek McCormick and Const. Elias Mouawad.

Also charged as part of the seven-month-long investigation are 19 civilians, including three accused of attempting to kill a correctional manager at his home. Investigators allege some of this group used bribes to get private information from police, as part of extortion plots. 

Those include Brian Da Costa, Elwyn Satanowsky, Kaejean Doman, Median Jackson, Devonte Barker-Campbell, Almar Heath, Calvin Ru, Rimssen Younan, Daljit Singh, Brandi Dixon, Robinson Alexandre, Ashor Bato, Donald Kirkland, Ryan Cribbie, Phillip Lecos, Jennifer Jasey and Mahyar Soldouzi, along with two unnamed youth. 

York Deputy Chief Ryan Hogan alleged some of the officers were involved in fentanyl and cannabis trafficking by “providing protection,” and theft of personal property from a police facility – including driver's licences, passports and health cards. 

The allegations have not yet been tested in court.

More than 400 officers, including from York, Toronto and the Ontario Provincial Police, have been involved in the investigation, he said. 

Toronto Police Service Chief Myron Demkiw said the charges are proof of the police services' commitment to restoring the public's trust in the integrity of his officers. He said the seven charged officers have been suspended, and “where appropriate,” will be off the job without pay. 

“This is a difficult and unsettling moment,” he said. “I understand this news will be distressing to Torontonians and Toronto Police Service.”

In a statement, the Toronto Police Service Board – the civilian body that oversees the police – formally requested an independent and comprehensive inspection by the Inspector General of Policing. The office monitors police services and boards to ensure compliance with the Community Safety and Policing Act. 

“The Board believes such an inspection is necessary to provide the public with a credible and transparent assessment, and to identify any steps needed to strengthen accountability and public safety,” it said in a statement. 

“Public trust in policing is fundamental. The Board holds all members of the Toronto Police Service to the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and accountability, and any allegations of criminal conduct are taken extremely seriously.”

Meaghan Gray, a spokesperson for the Toronto Police Association, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the union is “aware of several of its members who were arrested today.”

“As a professional labour organization, we will ensure our members receive due process and wellness support as required,” she said. “We have no further comment regarding this investigation or the members involved.”

The Toronto Police Service Board, a seven-member civilian body that governs and oversees the TPS, held an emergency, in-camera meeting on Wednesday to discuss the matter, a government official said. The Globe and Mail and is not naming the official because they were not authorized to speak about the matter.

            The Trump administration is planning to match teen competitors with celebrity coaches for the televised “Patriot Games” athletic contest, one of the events marking the United States' 250th anniversary.
    


            A spokesperson for Freedom 250, the non-profit group leading the administration's celebrations, provided new details to CNN after President Donald Trump formally announced the event in December. The spokesperson did not provide any names of the celebrities the group is recruiting to work with the teenaged participants.
    


            The competition will take place in the fall. Trump teased the event as “an unprecedented four-day athletic event featuring the greatest high school athletes — one young man and one young woman from each state and territory.”
    


            Athletic ability will not be the sole factor considered for eligibility. Potential volunteers will need to submit an online video application responding to a number of prompts to explain why they want to be chosen to represent their state, the spokesperson said.
    


            Details about the types of athletic contests the participants will compete in have yet to be made public.
    


            Applications will be open to athletes aged 14 to 17 from all 50 states, US territories & tribes, but those who will turn 18 before December 31 will not be eligible, the spokesperson said.
    


            The competition has drawn comparisons on social media to “The Hunger Games,” a dystopian young-adult book series and film franchise in which children are forced to fight to the death in televised arenas.
    


            Trump first previewed the competition in July, saying it would be televised and led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
    


            The new details emerge as the administration pushes forward with its plans for national events. The executive branch is driving efforts to pull off the president's anniversary priorities, with agencies partnering with Freedom 250 for certain landmark events: Kennedy will be partnering with Freedom 250 in hosting the Patriot Games, and the Agriculture Department has embraced the president's Great American State Fair initiative, which asks states to compete to have their fair chosen by Trump as the “most patriotic.”
    


            Other 250th initiatives include a UFC fight on the White House's South Lawn on the president's birthday and the construction of a giant triumphal arch across from the Lincoln Memorial.
    


Will Trump's brand of politics crash America's 250th birthday party?



            An August IndyCar race near the National Mall is also on the schedule, with the president signing an order last week directing the Interior and Transportation departments to work with the DC Mayor Muriel Bowser's office to move quickly in order to pull it off. The effort may need congressional approval.
    


            Bowser, a Democrat, is on board with the race and touted it as an economic boon for the nation's capital, which has been strained by mass federal layoffs.



            “The race weekend will rev up the economic engine of D.C. by filling our hotels and restaurants and by showing visitors, residents and the sports world that there's no better city, people and backdrop for major sports events,” she said in a statement.
    


            The administration has also launched two history-oriented efforts inspired by the American Freedom Train that toured the country during America's bicentennial bash in 1976 and gave Americans the chance to see everything from Judy Garland's dress from “The Wizard of Oz” to George Washington's copy of the US Constitution.
    


            The National Archives' “Freedom Plane” will bring documents from the era of America's founding to eight US cities in 2026, and the Institute of Museum of Library Services has announced six Freedom Truck Mobile Museums, with material from conservative media company PragerU and Hillsdale College.
    


            Planning for the history-related initiatives comes as the administration conducts an unprecedented review of the Smithsonian Institution, insisting that the museum complex's 250th content align with Trump's push for programming that renews national pride.
    


            “The American people will have no patience for any museum that is diffident about America's founding or otherwise uncomfortable conveying a positive view of American history, one which is justifiably proud of our country's accomplishments and record,” administration officials wrote in a letter to the museum in December.

Owner of local cinema says Amazon is upset at way they marketed movie as some in US say healthy ticket sales are not reflected by empty seats

An independent cinema in Oregon has claimed Amazon pulled screenings of their documentary about Melania Trump in protest at the cinema's marketing strategy.

As reported by local newspaper the Lake Oswego Review, the general manager of the Lake Theater & Cafe has claimed the corporation cancelled future screenings of Brett Ratner's authorised study of the first lady after being alerted to promotional pushes such as: “To defeat your enemy. You must know them. Melania” and “Does Melania wear Prada? Find out on Friday!”

Writing on the cinema's Instagram, Jordan Perry said: “Got a call that the higher ups (ie, at Amazon) were upset with how our marquee marketed their movie (ie, Melania), that, per them, Sunday would be its last day here.”

Perry added that he hoped Amazon wouldn't cancel his Prime membership and directed devoted Amazon fans to “show your support at Whole Foods instead”. The cinema owner also addressed those who had criticised his decision to show the film in the first place.

In a post titled Why I, Jordan, Got Melania Here,” Perry wrote that his overriding instinct was that the programming “would be funny”. There was also a financial imperative, he added: “The film marketplace this week and next were a desert … So, to fill a screen, why not get this inexplicable vanity piece from the current president's wife? I mean, it just seems so weird that it even exists (who wants a movie about Melania lol?), and wouldn't it then be exponentially weirder, to the point of being funny, to show it here, at your obviously anti-establishment, occasionally troublemaking, neighbourhood cinema?”

Amazon's cancellation of the film in the Oregon cinema comes as some in the US have flagged the incongruity of healthy ticket sales and apparently empty cinemas.

The film took $7m (£5.1m) over its opening weekend domestically and opened at No 3 in the US box office charts. The Daily Beast reports that there have been accusations of “fake tickets sales” to boost the box office totals.

Citing the Substack of industry pundit Tom Brueggemann, the article claims: “Industry sources say there were signs that blocks of tickets were purchased for the weekend, then distributed to senior citizen homes, Republican activitists, other interested parties for free to help boost audiences.”

Meanwhile Puck reporter Matthew Belloni said Amazon and cinema chains AMC and Regal told him that they “did not experience unusual block purchases of tickets” for the film, while adding “the theatre chains might not necessarily know, of course”.

Exit reports from weekend screenings in the US suggested that “older white women” were the demographic most responsible for propelling it to success.

In the UK, where Melania opened across 155 screens, takings were considerably softer. The film opened at No 29 in the UK charts, for a weekend screen average of £212.

The US takings for the film currently account for some 98.8% of its overall total, with Melania's native Slovenia proving the best-performing international territory. Overall, the film opened in 26 countries globally last Friday, after the South African release was abruptly cancelled the day before, with local distributors citing “the current climate” and “recent developments”.

In the UK, some industry insiders questioned whether the unusually wide rollout of the film could be an indication of “four-walling”: the release strategy by which distributors pay cinemas to screen the movie.

            Marco Rubio now has one less critical role to worry about in the Trump administration.
    


            After nearly a year as acting archivist of the United States, Rubio's tenure has ended.
    


            Rubio's term expired with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which limits the time an acting officer can remain in the position.
    


            The National Archives and Records Administration's general counsel confirmed in a statement to CNN that Rubio was no longer serving as acting archivist.
    


            “Prior to the conclusion of his tenure, and to the extent permitted by law, Secretary Rubio delegated the authority to perform the functions of the Archivist to James Byron, who continues to serve as Senior Advisor to the Archivist,” Matt Dummermuth, general counsel for the National Archives and Records Administration, added in the statement.
    


            Rubio has worn several hats over the course of President Donald Trump's second term.
    


            Along with becoming the first person since Henry Kissinger to serve as secretary of state and national security adviser simultaneously, Rubio has been tasked with helping to run the transition of the Venezuelan government after the US ousted Nicolás Maduro – an operation in which Rubio played a key role.
    


            The former US senator from Florida was also the point man on shuttering the US Agency for International Development. Rubio posted on social media in August that he would give that job to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought.
    


            Trump, who used to criticize Rubio and call him “Little Marco,” named Rubio to the role of archivist last February after the surprise dismissal of Colleen Shogan, a Joe Biden appointee and the first woman to hold the post.
    


            The National Archives preserves US government records, including paper documents, photographs, maps, films and computer records. The Federal News Network was first to report that Rubio is no longer acting archivist.
    


            At a State Department event Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance joked about the many hats Rubio wears.
    


            “When he asked me to come and speak today, I said, man, this is your building; why don't you come and give a speech? And he said, well, because I've got five jobs and you've only got one,” Vance said. “And so, I figured I might as well do Marco a solid, since he's also the archivist and the official White House florist and has a number of other jobs in addition to Secretary of State.”
    


            Other members of the administration have poked fun at Rubio's multiple jobs. During the first cabinet meeting of the year, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin joked that Rubio should help him in the administration's efforts to rebuild homes impacted by the California wildfires.
    


            “Mr. President, your great secretary of state was looking for another job,” Zeldin said, before the room erupted with laughter.
    


            Byron, who is performing the functions of archivist, was picked by Trump to serve as the senior adviser to the archivist in February, with the president saying that he would “manage the National Archives on a day-to-day basis, while we continue our search for a full-time Archivist.” Byron is the president and CEO of the Richard Nixon Foundation.

“Our days are riding on the learning edge of a whirlwind — crisis management, harm mitigation, helping everyone come to terms with new conditions and new impossible choices that they're faced with,” says Minneapolis organizer Andrew Fahlstrom. In this episode of Movement Memos, Fahlstrom and local organizers Jordan and Susan Raffo talk with host Kelly Hayes about community defense in Minneapolis, the social fabric of collective care under federal occupation, and how people around the country should be gearing up for the long struggle ahead.

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity, and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today we are talking about the federal occupation of Minneapolis, where three people have been shot by federal agents – two fatally – and thousands of immigrants have been detained. We'll be hearing from writer and healing justice practitioner Susan Raffo; Andrew Fahlstrom, a rapid response organizer with Defend the 612; and Jordan, an immigrant organizer whose works includes digital security and mutual aid.

In the Twin Cities and surrounding areas, we have seen an escalation of fascist violence that reflects the race war fantasies of men like White House adviser Stephen Miller, who would see immigrants and their defenders ground under. However, Minneapolis is also the heart of another arc of escalation — a mass activation of care and community defense and resistance that signals hope for us all. 

Last week, some observers welcomed news that Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino was reassigned out of Minneapolis. The move followed the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents and a wave of public backlash. The conversation you're about to hear was recorded the day after Pretti's death, prior to the announcement about Bovino's departure. Unfortunately, the issues we discuss here — the violence, the lack of accountability, and the urgent need for steady, strategic responses from movements and communities — remain as relevant in Minneapolis today as they were the day after Pretti's killing. Activists on the ground in Minneapolis have described Bovino as a “sadist” and a “fascist abuser,” whose departure has been felt on a personal level, but note the character and intensity of their struggle has not changed in the wake of his departure. Brutal attacks on their communities are ongoing, while ICE attacks in other states continue to escalate as well.

This is a time to be strategic, and to learn all we can from each other, because all of our communities need to prepare for the kind of state violence that Minneapolis is facing right now.

KH:  Jordan, Raffo, Andrew, welcome to “Movement Memos.”

Susan Raffo: Good to be here.

Jordan: Thanks for having us.

Andrew: It's good to be here.

KH: To help frame this conversation for our audience, can each of you take a moment to introduce yourself and tell us a bit about the organizing work you're involved with?

Jordan: So my name is Jordan. I'm an Ethiopian Eritrean immigrant from my mother and my father's side. I am a transplant to Minnesota. I came here a few years ago. At this point, I feel like it's my second home. I'm a two-culture kid in that way, but my family has been immigrating to Minnesota, but also the U.S. since the '70s, the late '70s and early '80s. 

My work, I feel like right now it's shaped as a community organizer in 2026, but a lot of my work focuses on relationship building, setting up care infrastructures, capacity building, political education work. And most recently in the last three, four years, a lot of tech justice work with the heightened surveillance and just AI or production work. Yeah, that's me. Nice to be here.

SR: I am Susan Raffo. I go by Raffo. I do a lot of my work through REP [Relationships Evolving Possibilities], which is a project that emerged in 2020 during the uprising. We do a lot of work around collective safety, both through political education and skills building.

In the moment that we're in right now in the Twin Cities, there's a lot of work that I'm doing that is about connecting people to care. So what are the things that we need that are going to make us sustainable for the long-term, recognizing that this is not stopping tomorrow. That includes everything from dealing with shock trauma, to grief circles, to supporting people who are doing on-the-ground work or frontline work in different ways. And that's how I'm showing up in this conversation.

Andrew: My name's Andrew. I have lived in Minnesota for almost 45 years now. And the work that I'm involved in, in this moment, besides parenting a teenager, trying to be in a healthy partnership, and live through occupation, has been in supporting the multitudes of community defense structures that have been blossoming and growing across Minneapolis, across the Twin Cities, across the entire state, inspiring each other, inspiring the country, inspiring the world.

And so that looks like being part of Defend the 612, which is a sort of entry point for people to get involved in their neighborhood work, whether that's the local school patrols or their block groups, block captains, or the other patrols and monitoring that's going on right now in the city of Minneapolis. And so I've been spending my time in that in addition to trying to live a life, have a day job, and survive under the conditions that Minneapolis is facing in this moment. 

KH: Thank you all so much for being here and for making time during an incredibly difficult moment. We're recording this conversation the day after Alex Pretti was shot and killed in the street by a federal agent in Minneapolis. As organizers and community members in this city, I know you're all carrying a lot right now, so I want to begin by asking: how are you holding up?

SR: This is Raffo. The other two people on this call are people who are quite beloved to me. And I can feel in our voices and in the feel that we share the way that there's a heaviness, and I don't want to speak for Jordan and Andrew, but I know these two folks really well. I feel it in my own body.

So coming into this call, I had shared that I was excited, because in this moment there's not a lot of space to just pause and reflect. And so I've been looking forward to that really straight up to listen to Jordan and Andrew as much as have time for my own, but I can feel it in my own body. There's a tightness. My heart feels really heavy. I feel it between us. So thank you for naming that and starting it because, of course, it's going to shape whatever we talk about today.

KH: Thanks, Raffo. Jordan, how are you feeling?

Jordan: Yeah, I definitely resonate with the heaviness. There's this public escalation of the nervous system, but also there is so much like, “Okay, what is the strategy? How do we move?” And so I think we're all holding a lot of that, but also I think sleep has been one of the hardest things that has been hard to come by. And so that's where I am.

Andrew: Yeah, to be perfectly honest, I haven't processed yesterday. I was on Nicollet Avenue not too long after the assassination of Alex Pretti with the crowds, with the people on the lines of Border Patrol and ICE agents, of anger at another killing in our neighborhood with the Minneapolis Police Department, Hennepin County Sheriff's coming to support the presence of ICE after they killed another one of our neighbors. And I took a face full of pepper spray and the clouds of tear gas went for blocks.

So there's both the physical trauma and the community trauma of so many people who are activated in this moment and so many people that want our conditions to change, the collective conditions that we're living under. And so many of us searching for the moves and the processes and the togetherness and the hope that it can change and the hope that we can be part of that change and the fear that we may not be able to do all of the things that we want to see happen.

So I'm just sitting here with the enormity of that and the questions of what's next, of where do we move together and how do we move? Yeah. So there's some sadness, there's some inspiration, there's this line of courage that's impossible to let go of because so many of us are holding it in this moment that even if you let go of it for a day or a week, it's just always there because so many of us are holding it together. That's how I'm arriving.

KH: Thank you all for your vulnerability and for helping our listeners understand what it means to live inside this moment in Minneapolis. Andrew, your words about that line of courage really resonated. Many of us felt a similar bond and sense of connection in our work here in Chicago during Midway Blitz, and I think a lot of us now feel that kinship with our siblings in struggle in Minneapolis. 

To give our listeners some context, can you describe the arc of escalation you've seen in Minneapolis and the surrounding area? How did the current crisis take shape?

Jordan: I think the first point of escalation for me that I witnessed at least in Minneapolis was in October. There was a low-key arrest of, I think, four individuals from Central America. And neighbors definitely got in the way and investigated what went on. But to me, nothing is really isolated in the situation. Everything is a test to see how folks will respond, how neighbors will show up. And so they've been doing this test, honestly, for a while. I think the Twin Cities in general is a punk city and people resist. And I think people just know their neighbors a lot more than any place I've ever been in my life. I live in South Minneapolis in an area where it's hugely, hugely immigrant and a lot of brown and Black people, but a lot of people that are not brown and Black people that know their neighbors pretty well.

In Minnesota winter, even if it's negative-something [degrees], people are biking, people are walking, people are walking their dogs. People with kids and stuff usually are out playing in the snow, or when people shovel the snow, people are out in my neighborhood, so I think just the absence of people and the fact that the street is so empty except the people that are doing patrolling or they're doing watch or legal observer, you don't see as many people. When you go to the stores, it's a lot more emptier because there's this lingering fear and heaviness and grief that people don't know what to do with.

I think the scale and the type of crisis is not necessarily new to me. I have a lot of family that has witnessed genocide in large ways, so even just talking about it, they're like, “This is so familiar. This tastes so familiar. This feels so familiar.”

Andrew: Where to begin? Where do we start? I was actually talking with Raffo a few days ago about the Dakota conflict of 1862. Some people call it the Dakota Uprising or the Dakota War when the peoples who lived on this land rose up against the armies of the day in this place that we live. And sort of like the lineage of this place we call Minnesota, it doesn't seem like an accident that the American Indian Movement was born on the streets of South Minneapolis, and the lines of continuity and connection between the ways our peoples came together when George Floyd was assassinated at 38th and Chicago, and what it meant for us to have to be our own fire department, be our own community protection services during that time when the police disappeared, when the fire department wasn't responding on the streets.

We have escalated our togetherness and our community in the face of so many things. December 1st, all of a sudden, there were ICE everywhere in our neighborhoods. And the way I found out about that was a Subaru with an Uber light had taken two parents from a car and left a young child outside of a school in South Minneapolis in the cold. And from there, it has been, I think, 55 days of ramping up an escalation. And in a similar way, we thought it was bad the first four weeks, and then the next thousand came, and then the next thousand came.

And we know that they're coming because we have been so organized. There have been so many people who already know their neighbors who are looking out and caring for each other, and we know they're coming because they have been resourced by billions of dollars and that we are a testing ground and they'll be coming for so many other places as they staff up their troops and their paramilitaries.

So it seems iterative and we learn and we practice and we try and we move with love and togetherness and more violence comes and we try to maneuver and they learn and we learn and they learn. It feels like we're in this dance that can't or won't continue forever, but I don't know how long it will go on. I would say, the escalation that I'm most grateful for has been the escalation of truth and vision of what's being seen because of the courage of my neighbors.

SR: I'm totally going to pick up on that. And I actually want to use the word “exaltation” instead of “escalation.” And that sounds really silly, but it's like I want to exalt for a second. There's a story out there which is not untrue when you hear it in our voices about how we know our neighbors in the cities. And I know I just recently spent a bunch of time in other parts of the U.S. and really noticed how there is a neighborliness in Minneapolis that I don't always find in other cities that I spend time in. And that doesn't mean that the neighborliness didn't have a hell of a lot of gaps before. So many gaps. That didn't mean that we all talked to each other all the time.

During the uprising in 2020, we had massive fights about abolition, and there was a whole liberal sway of our community that really struggled with abolition. And in particular, I would say the fact that this was abolitionist organizing around the murder of a Black man. And so this is a different moment that builds on that. All of that organizing is there, absolutely, that has been said, but there's something that's happening with that organizing, which feels in … Kelly, you and I talked about this a little bit when we were talking about this podcast, is it feels like this dance between emergence and strategy is that there is something about this moment. And I think part of it is the story. To even call this moment “the story” makes me shudder, but the image is the story, the what is here, what it means to love our neighbors, all of those pieces. People are gathering around that on their own in a way that, in 2020, it was sometimes harder to get people to gather. And so there's stuff where people are stepping forward.

I feel like every moment I keep hearing about a whole other sway, and what's really different about this is that 2020 felt like this was … I don't believe in “left” and “right” really that much anymore, but still for using that language, it was like a far-left narrative about abolition in a very specific kind of way, and there were boundaries around who was in and who was not. This moment, I keep seeing the circle widening. I keep seeing people who are stepping across gaps, stepping across separation, stepping across disconnections in ways that I've not seen before. And as a 60-year-old person who's been in movement since I was 16, I've also not lived through it in this way before. So it is an escalation of what? Of neighborliness, of moral something. I don't even know at this point how to talk about it, except that there is something that is emergent at the same time as there are things that are structurally organized.

And Andrew and I were talking, again, as Andrew referred to a couple days ago about what are the ways to communicate some of this to other cities that are in the process — hello, Maine — and other places that are facing it as both Jordan and Andrew just said, that this is other places. What are the pieces of this that are translatable? What are the pieces that are specific? That's some of the stuff that I've been thinking about a lot as everybody who's in Minnesota right now is getting a lot of phone calls from people who are in other places who are wanting to prepare and sorting through what is specific to hear, what is not, what can be replicated feels like it's getting into that emergence and strategy structure and the difference between them.

KH: Thank you all so much for that. I really hear you, Raffo, on the question of what's specific to a place and what's useful to share — and how we give away what's useful. We did a lot of that kind of thinking here in Chicago as well.

And I think there's something really powerful, amid the horror of how different cities have been attacked, about the way we keep reaching for each other. When Chicago was targeted, people in LA and D.C. were incredibly generous in talking with us about their experiences. Near the end of Midway Blitz, when ICE was beginning to pivot to other cities, there was a lot of communication between Chicago activists and folks in those cities.

When you talk about people showing up who you wouldn't ordinarily expect — which is something we definitely experienced here as well, a sort of broadening of the “we” in struggle — I think that's also reflected in the way that people are reaching across geographies to help each other. I think our sense of who “we” are is broadening in our own cities, and from city to city, as this movement grows. And I think that's so hopeful.

Now, I want to talk a bit about the day-to-day experience of this struggle. From one day to the next, what does the work look like for you right now — as much as you're able to share safely.

Jordan, would you like to start? 

Jordan: Sure. I think that day-to-day is different. Every day is different. I think one of the things is digital security is a big thing that has come up a lot. And so just being very, very curious and attentive around how we would communicate with each other also has been something that I've been working on. How are we communicating? How is our conversations, our information being tracked and surveilled in different ways? 

Then around midday, we do some supply drop-offs if people need them, usually people that are not able to leave their houses. And if there's any mutual aid need, there is a group that I'm a part of. We do just mutual aid pods and we just support people in that way, like food. If there's any pharmacy pickup, there's a lot of people that are not able to go out even for, not necessarily for documentation reasons, but because of mental health stuff or they're just fearful of being outside at this moment. So there's also some of those folks that just need some of that support.

And I also actually have some off times where I just don't do any sort of rapid response, and that is because of longevity and sustainability reasons. I have off-time for two hours in the middle of the day, I just don't do that. I'm off the clock, and that is because I saw a lot of burnout in myself in 2020, too, when I was on the go, go, go. I also saw myself doing that in 2018. And so I'm just learning from other folks that are much older than me, that is probably not the most sustainable way to do this.

Another thing that I've been working on for a few weeks is trying to organize a safe house for people that just need a place to stay. Another thing that we were thinking about is the risk assessment of all of this, the people that are facilitating this whole thing for the people that are hosting and setting up the safe houses, but also the people that are being hosted, what is the default risk and just some of the repercussions around that. So I have a lot of beloveds and generous people that are like, “We are willing to do this,” but also, we are in this learning phase because I've never done this.

And so it's just a matter of figuring out how to find alternative ways of keeping people physically safe as a retreat moment while things are adjusting and moving as they need to. So it's just a lot of that. And there's also a lot of digital security work because how are we conducting ourselves even when we're doing that, as well? 

KH: Thank you, Jordan. I deeply appreciate the work you're doing. Andrew?

Andrew: Our days are riding on the learning edge of a whirlwind — crisis management, harm mitigation, helping everyone come to terms with new conditions and new impossible choices that they're faced with. So that might look like helping folks think through plans, transportation plans, connecting folks who want to give rides with those that need rides or that need groceries that want to support on that. 

It looks like helping other people tell their stories, the millions of stories that are happening and the intense scrutiny of the press as we are once again in the national spotlight, navigating the risk of saying your name and attaching yourself in a time when there's immense right-wing interest and pressure and danger on people's lives just for appearing in the media, just for telling their story. It has looked like trying to get a two-year-old baby returned who was taken two blocks from my house and then just breaking down crying when I heard that she was on a flight home. And it really looks like in these moments of activity, taking time with the so many loved ones and beloveds who are doing so much and on whose back, so much of this moves to just hold each other and cry and feel as much as possible, as much as we can let ourselves in the middle of emergency, feel the beauty and feel the terror of this time.

SR: I'll say a little thing about my days. They're really a mix of what are the things that people need right this second? What is the short-term strategy that's available and what's the long-term strategy that's available? And it goes between those. So a lot of immediate … Some definitely mutual aid rapid response, but also just a lot of care work. Somebody who's about to crack, who's holding more than they can. So that's immediate. And then the short term is I've really been looking to reach out to people while this is a very emergent moment and it is, there are also multiple bodies who are holding a lot because they are organizers, they are positioned, they've built things that have caught fire and been reaching a lot doing safety planning and safety planning, not just digital sec and just basic safety planning, but also that part of safety planning that is about sustainability. We actually need you to be okay for the next five months to a year. And so we need to be in that right now. So I'm doing a lot of reaching out. This is based on 35, 40 years of relationship in the cities of reaching out to folks to sort of help get that in place.

And then other things that are, as you know from Chicago, as Minneapolis as the city's experienced during the uprising is because there's a lot nationally that's resting on what happens here. There's also a lot of places where there's local national partnerships that are happening that are a little bit more mid- and long-term strategy. And that's everything from care networks, grief rituals, supporting faith-based folks to continue organizing and doing direct action.

So again, involved in a lot of those pieces that are long-term strategy. And as they both said, every day is different. And then I think the way the three of us grieve and hold this is, every single person holds this is different. I'll have a day where I'll say to my partner, “I love you so much. You need to not be in the house today because I need to grieve really loudly and really messily and not have anybody around. So I just need two or three hours. Just leave and then come back and I'll be able to grieve with you.”

So I think we're all noticing moment by moment. And I'll say one of the things I feel fierce about is supporting those beloveds who are holding so much. Everybody is holding so much. It's amazing. And there are some people who are pivotal holding so much, is that they get the chance to break. Because we know that from the uprising from all the different places that usually the folks who are holding lots aren't the ones who go and ask for care until it's super late. Thank God for everybody who goes to those care circles. So awesome. But I'm feeling a particular ferocity about those who are leading us in 101 non-hierarchical, highly relational, deeply humble ways.

KH: Thank you so much for that, Raffo. What you're saying makes me think about how seriously I saw people taking trauma, and the need for healing spaces, here in Chicago, during Midway Blitz, and how important that felt. It honestly felt like a really important sign of progress in our movements, and it was definitely needed. I am grateful to everyone who organized somatic healing and PTSD prevention workshops, and to the folks who attend Understory, the spiritual and emotional support group for activists that I've co-facilitated for the last couple of years. I don't know how I would have navigated those months without that wonderful group of people. So, I am so grateful to everyone who is organizing space for healing, and everyone who is taking seriously the need to participate in those spaces, because this is all part of how we're going to survive together — and as Mariame [Kaba] says, we can only survive together. 

Now, I want to circle back to something that came up earlier in our conversation: the legacy of the 2020 uprisings. We've heard a lot about how the protests following the murder of George Floyd created networks that have been reactivated during the current crisis. Can you talk a bit about the connections between 2020 and this moment, including the uprisings and the mutual aid that sprung up during that time and other organizing legacies or traditions that you feel have been important?

Jordan: Yeah, I can go first. I kept going back to the word “rigor.” Rigor, rigor. So I met a lot of my political home during the 2020 uprisings. 

I think that spring and summer of 2020 built a lot of my organizing toolbox around this thing of longevity and rigor. And I think we're seeing, I feel like the ripples of that now because I think Andrew said this and Raffo said this too, neighbors are showing up that we've never seen show up before. It's almost like a given. It's very default. They're like, “Of course we're going to show up.” There's a lot of Know Your Rights that Andrew actually leads. I feel like y'all, I've been hearing a lot of people showing up over 600, 500 people just showing up. And to me, that's incredible. That's a blueprint of, of course I'm going to show up.

People also started, I think, craving community. There was this like, “Let's not outsource our safety so much to these elected officials that we have no relationships with, but let's actually rely on each other.” And that was a lot of what I heard actually from REP. That was a language that came from REP in the early days of, how do we not outsource our safety to someone we have no relationship with? And to me, neighbors seems like the most very basic answer.

I think in crisis, seeing people not even blink twice and just show up. When people were being dismissed at Roosevelt High School, which had a tear gas situation about a week and a half [ago], people were out there. People were out there doing patrolling beforehand. And then when the actual kidnapping and just fearmongering was happening, people were still there. People just showed up because they knew that something was going to go down.

So just even the mere fact of people just showing up, and I think that is all a ripple and a blueprint of 2020. And also, I think people just even being able to reach out without knowing who is going to reach back in is such something that I've also seen a lot. People saying like, “We're about to have a dismissal at this school. We're not sure who's around. Can you send a few folks?” It's incredible just people just show up even at the schools that their kids are not going to, but they just show up because they're like, “This is something that I must do because I live in Corcoran, I live in Phillips.” And so that's something that I've witnessed is I definitely think it's built up definitely pre-2020, but 2020 for me was a moment of, it cemented a lot of that, I think, structure of care.

Andrew: Yeah. This isn't baby's first uprising in Minneapolis and we have had some chances to practice over time. And I think in the tradition of the American Indian Movement, the AIM patrols that would patrol South Minneapolis, now we have rapid response ICE watch patrols that are out on the streets of South Minneapolis.

In 2020, during the height of things, the Minneapolis Fire Department and Police Department would not respond to any 911 calls in South Minneapolis. And so the neighborhoods came together in one of our main parks and we chose our geographies and we said, “These are your neighbors. Go back to your blocks and say, ‘This is the plan.'” And then there was a group of people who were committed to breaking the curfew and saying, “Hey, if there is an emergency, this is how you contact us and we will come to you.”

And then REP, which I know Susan has been part of and co-founded, added that and then continued it. And there was a phone line where we have a sense of we do call each other when there's emergencies, we do turn out. And now, here we are in another state of emergency and the need for community togetherness. And there's sort of like this muscle memory and practice that of course we would do this. Of course, we would come together and just do this ourselves because we know that that is the only thing that we can count on in this moment is whatever we put into motion.

And in the same way, we're not confused. The initial story, official story, of George Floyd being killed was he suffered a medical emergency. No one is confused that the first thing is a lie. No one is confused if the Vances and the Stephen Millers and the Trumps and the Kristi Noems come out and say whatever wild thing they're going to do to spin things, no one in Minneapolis is going to buy any of that.

We've already seen it all play out. We know how that works. And so we also know what we have to do, and that is show the world that what actually happened is drastically different. That our neighbors, our family members, our children are being harmed. Go out and repeat that over and over again as much as we can so that more and more people can join us, more and more people can have that change in view and they see what the truth is, and then we practice.

We practice with each other based on our relationships, our longtime relationships, and then we start to practice with all the other folks that want to come join us. And we have a certain, I'm not sure what you would call it, but we have this way of saying, “Yeah, welcome. We really missed you, but we know that we need each other right now. So come on home, come join us. This is what we're doing together.” And it's been amazing.

SR: Where Andrew was going was where my brain was going, so I wanted to come in right away after his words because there's structural stuff for sure. Places like REP and other kinds of places have kept alive over the last five years, this concept of rapid response of turning towards each other in small ways, but in significant ways. Because Minneapolis and St. Paul, but Minneapolis in particular really is a series of small towns within a city where everybody kind of knows each other's small towns. That's true of a lot of cities, but not all cities.

But there's something about … I'm hearing this from, in particular right now, faith leaders who are working with congregations who in 2020, where they were willing to stretch because they were first going, “Oh, abolition. Oh, uprising, this is intense.” So they were catching up because they'd never seen themselves as people who would do direct action and take those risks.

Well, that's now in their imagination. So it was much easier to step forward five years later because they've already practiced seeing themself in that role. And so there's a lot of people who for different reasons have already been … And things have happened between 2020 to now that carries the opportunity to imagine, Trump's second administration just being one of them.

So there's a piece about imagination, but I also want to honor the wisdom of the long-term organizers who were heavily involved in 2020. In 2020, sometimes, however much we don't want to be those people, we did fight with each other over how abolitionist people were. Is that sometimes we struggled to trust each other in different elements, not in the first couple of weeks when it was really hot, but after those first couple of weeks. We were precious. There were chunks of us that were just being super precious. I have not seen that at all. At all. 

So some of the practice, which to me is holding that contradiction of “we have got this together and we might not be fully aligned in all of these other things. And at one point I want to have those conversations with you. And right now we are showing up because we have each other's back.” The capacity to hold both of those things rather than needing somebody to fit really clearly in a particular story of alignment. I think that's a wisdom that these last five years have brought into the cities that, in particularly, I feel really proud of, because I think that opens the space for the people who are just imagining themselves at this level of resistance to truly come in and be welcomed. Massive hats off to long-term organizers right now as well.

KH: I really appreciate what you're saying, Raffo, about being less precious this time around. I think it's so important, and it's something I've seen in Chicago as well. Over the years, I think many of us have participated in conflicts over whether people were, in our estimation, really down for the struggle — and some of those conflicts just weren't helpful. I think we're doing a much better job in this moment of basing our judgment about whether someone is down for the struggle on what they are showing up to do. And a whole lot of people, including people I never would have expected, are showing up to create as much safety and justice as they can, without involving cops, and that is abolitionist work — whatever people call themselves. And I think more and more of our leftist co-strugglers are recognizing that what people are doing by showing up in that way is much more important than how they talk about it, and that political transformation, if it happens for people, is much more likely to occur in the process of waging struggle, than the process of arguing about it. 

So, we've been talking a bit about what this looks like from the inside, for people who've been engaged in organizing for some time. Let's zoom out a bit and talk about how this crisis is being presented at the national level. What do you think the media is failing to capture about what's happening on the ground in Minneapolis right now?

Jordan: Oh my God, I have so much. So one of my big things that I do outside of organizing, maybe with organizing, is archivism work. And so I feel like podcasting is also a type of archivism work, so I appreciate a lot of what you do. But I think the media has a lot of this language of like, “Whoa, I can't believe Minnesota does this, or I can't believe things like this happened.”

There's a lot of surprise and awe around as if there's not a lineage of resistance that has been built by Black folks and Indigenous folks for the last many, many, many years before I was born, before any of us were born, probably. And so I just feel like that is one of the things that I feel incredibly like, “Well, I don't know if you've actually read up or even….”

And I mean, it's very strategic. The media frames things in the way that it does because the narrative needs to be built in a specific way. So that really bothers me. Also, it's really, really cold in Minnesota right now. People are outside in this… two days ago was -22 degrees. I saw my friend's beard freeze. Yeah, our eyebrows… and my glasses were so fogged up. It's very cold and people are still outside. Some people don't have cars. I don't have a car. We do just walking patrolling. 

A lot of these people are not organizers. I don't even know what an organizer is at this point, but it's people that are just showing up. And so there's also missing that. There's also a lot of fear. There's so much rage and anger, but I feel like anger is always framed as this negative thing in the media like, there's this purity conversation that's happening.

Even I think with Alex [Pretti] and with Renee [Good], there's this trying to present them as these people that are incredible. They don't deserve this. Nobody deserves this. Nobody deserves to be assassinated. 

I also think that there's a lot of dismemory. I learned this from a mentor of mine. In real time, there is a dismemory like this actually didn't happen. There's a fragmentation of what is real. A lot of people are planting doubts in people's mind [about] what we are seeing with our eyes. It also doesn't help that there's so much AI reproduction and using those specific texts to produce a specific narrative of who is on the streets, how are they reacting? 

So memory is being suppressed in real time and really confusing the masses, especially for folks that are not politically engaged or may not have the context of what's happening. So that, all of that is very scary. And that's why it's really important to have these alternative medias that are not mainstream to shape some of these stories of lineage-based work that's been happening for a while. And there's also a lot of nuances and context that are not addressed in mainstream media that loves black and white framing of things. So I would say it's missing a lot.

Andrew: I think the thing that stands out to me is the obsession actually on some level with the rapid response groups and what plays out on the streets of Minneapolis when what is happening, the fundamental policy of family separation of taking children from their parents, of an entire community that is being terrorized and hidden and in hiding, I think it makes probably in this moment, strategic sense that those stories aren't at the forefront because our people are hidden, our people are scared.

But the rapid responders are only part of the story. They're not the main character. There is incredible work happening right now behind the scenes. It's like a whole underground railroad conditions that we're operating in right now where immigrant communities set the groundwork because they knew that this was coming. They absolutely saw this and a bunch of us, a bunch of rapid response folks are catching up to the conditions that we find ourselves in. But the amount of mutual aid that moves on the ground through relationships and family networks and schools and your kid goes to school with this other person, and all of a sudden that white parent is coordinating 27 rides to school the next day. It's just like the immensity of love that is pouring forth in tactically hidden ways. Of course, the media is going to miss that story. And that is at least as inspiring, if not more inspiring, that we will show up for each other in every single way possible day after day and build the same kind of systems of care and support that are going into the rapid response realm.

RS: I really appreciated Jordan naming the alternative media that's coming in. I do want to say one thing about… Because I know this happened in Chicago, the hundreds of influencers, podcasters flocking to the Twin Cities. There's some where I'm like, thank God. Occasionally there are people who operate with humility when they come in, where they actually take the time to really learn about who the people are, what is really happening, what's the history behind this moment. But my goodness, the number of people flocking in for their two minutes of fame, this happened during the [2020] uprising, but it's like that on steroids. It's so much more than I've ever seen.

And this is a media moment, but it is a place where so many of us are getting our information from there because we don't trust the mainstream media anymore for very good reason where the story focuses on what's happening in Minnesota, so it's a protest. There's moments of protest, but this whole arcing thing is not a protest. This is about people caring for each other. This is about surviving. This is about resisting occupation where there are multiple strategies. Protest is one of them, feeding each other is another one, on-the-ground health care is another one. And every single helping infrastructure right now, teachers, social workers, nurses, doctors has a complete and total shadow ecosystem where they are taking care of people on the ground in ways that the structures don't allow. That's everywhere. And that's not protest, that's living. That's living in the ways that we're supposed to live and take care of each other.

And unfortunately, the folks flocking in who sometimes are doing citizen journalism on the ground “unedited” are often as much a part of the inflammation as they are a part of the storytelling. My appreciation for “Movement Memos” reaching out to somebody who you know and saying, “Who do you know on the ground who can have a conversation?” And then thinking thoughtfully about how that should be done. I'm so grateful for that because the respect in that action is one that if I had a magic wand, I'd be like, “Thank you for your phones, outsiders. Can you bring in a level of respect and care for the local people who you are filming?” Because we need that to be woven through your witness as much as the fact that you are wearing a bulletproof vest and you're putting yourself in front of pepper spray.

[musical interlude]

KH: Raffo, you've shared some really thoughtful reflections on social media about the social fabric of solidarity and mutual support that's become more visible and stronger in Minneapolis during this time. I'd love to hear from each of you about that infrastructure: what it represents, what it looks and feels like on the ground, and what it means for our collective efforts to get free.

SR: I just suddenly feel really emotional. In moments of high activation like this, it is so clear that there is so much to do and there is no ending in how much there is to do. And sometimes what we don't have… I don't know if we don't have as much time for, depending on who your people are, depending on how you are culturally shaped, depending on whether or not you have access to family memory about times like these, maybe you have this, but for people for whom what is happening right now is “not their normal,” there isn't always as much thoughtfulness about what we do as also about who we are, that we are not just responding to a moment. This is about actually remembering what our ancestors have always known and what at its core is the only way that we actually survive. We are all always interconnected. That is the core truth. I think both Jordan and Andrew have spoken to that in multiple different ways. It is always here, whether we are feeling it, witnessing it, nourishing it, remembering it, claiming it, deepening it, whether we do that or not, it is just always here.

And so there's a moment like this where the fact of that… Because, as both of my comrades have said, the police and the fire department are gone. People cannot leave their houses. It's not safe. Children cannot go to school. Folks are showing up. That is not just about crisis, that is how we take care of each other in ways that are intimate and relational. And it goes directly against the strategies of colonization, of racial capitalism, et cetera, to remember this, to be this, who we are meant to be.

What I am so curious about… And curious, it's such an abstract, distancing word. I'm going to use the word curious because I'll start sobbing. What I fear so fiercely in each moment here is stopping violence every moment that we can. That is what we are here… We are stopping violence. But woven through that is that every moment is also something that can arc to imagining and building something that is longer term that is just a different normal.

This is the story of who we are, which is why your question about the media was like, what protest? Yes, abso-god-damn-lutely, lots of moments of protest, but also can you see the resistance and the remembering? Something that, for far more of our history, this is who we were. It's such a blip, this separated individualized isolation. And depending on who your people are, you're probably turning around to everybody else and saying, “It's about bloody time you remembered.” Because of course, depending on who you are, this is still how you live.

It's like I cannot honor the deaths that we've witnessed, the kidnappings we've witnessed, and say, “Oh God, what an opportunity this is,” because who the hell wants this to be happening? But as it is happening, there are things here that are more up than about this moment. There are things here that give us a… I'll stop there. I think I've already said myself. I'm now repeating myself, so I'll just stop there and hand off to somebody else. Thanks, Kelly.

Jordan: I'll jump on that briefly. Yeah. For me, this moment is also about more than this moment. I have a favorite thing that I always say, and it's informed by someone I love in community. It's that it didn't start with us, it doesn't end with us. And I think it sounds very nihilistic when you hear it, but I think it's a very grounding way of thinking about ancestral knowledge. And also, I don't know, our place and our role in what we're doing. I think for me, it's always been outside of crisis, outside of emergencies — I think the care infrastructure has never been a choice because it's something that has helped my family for generations and generations survive, whether that's economically, whether that is to hop from one country to another, whether it is lived through a very hard time, let me just say.

And so I think my biggest objective has always been I think what any empire that is trying to destroy our dignity, what they want is isolation, what they want is so we don't turn toward each other. The infrastructure and the collective thing for me is who are the people I can turn to within my life relationally, my loved ones? Who are the people that may need me? And I think that itself gives a lot of purpose. It's anchoring in a lot of ways. It lets me see outside of this moment. I don't feel apathetic or complacent, and to me, that is because of those infrastructures that have been built long before I was born. And so I have to be like, okay, what's next? But also, are we all good? Have you been fed? And that's, I guess, the point.

Andrew: It just becomes so clear in these moments that the dominant culture and narrative makes absolutely no sense in the slightest. And when everything's shaken up and you can't depend on all of your comforts and conveniences and there's troops rolling down your block, there's an ability to think differently. There's a collective consciousness that emerges where we would do what any community would do if they are under occupation, if their children are being stolen, if there are violent shock troops on the street is we would show up. We would try to stop that. We would take care of each other. And it's just so brilliantly simple and beautiful to be able to step outside of the thing that we know is happening anyway, which is, on a planetary scale, us being on a suicidal path if we continue to do the things that we have done for way too long and take and take and take.

It hearkens back to the George Floyd uprising. It's like what the right wing would want you to believe is that what would happen in these moments of trauma is that all the preppers would go into their bunkers and shoot at each other, and exactly the opposite thing happens. And now we have so many lived experiences and practices around that. No, of course not. What happens is we feed each other. What happens is we make sure if someone's face is covered with tear gas, we walk them away. We take care of them and we rinse out their eyes, and then we go back again for the next person. What happens when a baby's taken is we show the fuck up and we take care of the family and we do whatever it is we need to do to bring that young one home. This is just who we are as a people. We are becoming the people that we always knew that we needed to be. We are creating the community that we have always known that we've needed. We have lineages of this. There has been a lot of forgetting, but here we are remembering day after day.

KH: Thank you all so much for that. Those are words that I'm going to be holding close for quite a while. 

As we bring things to a close, I want to ask what lessons or learnings you've taken from other cities that have been targeted by ICE, and what you hope to extend to people in cities that are currently preparing or thinking through their responses.

SR: Portland, Oregon, humor. Thank God for the humor that came out of Portland. Chicago, God, the trainings that people brought here in November and December completely set us going as our trainings were still emerging and et cetera. I want to say those just right away. Those come to mind right away.

I've been talking to people in Maine right now, as many other folks have, and about what is replicable across to Maine. And I feel like so much of the last question you asked us about care is mostly how I'm responding to that. If there's people we want to talk to about rapid response and all the rest of it, there are people to talk to, but really frontlining care as part of it, making sure that folks feel and remember that and also the story as all three of us have talked about, that this is, at its core, something that extends beyond however long it takes at that other moment. And I suppose the other piece I'd say is LA, just the scale of it is that they were also one of the early scale ones. But humor from Portland, Midwestern pragmatic brilliance from the training from Chicago is how I'd answer that right away.

Jordan: Oh my God, so much badass stuff is happening. I was on a call in early November with folks from Chicago. And I lived in Chicago for a little bit, but I was just like… I don't know. It was very humbling, but also incredibly inspiring. They prophesied what was going to happen in that call. They talked about exactly how to set up for it. It was incredible.

I have also some family that has been impacted in LA, and I have a few folks that are organizers in San Francisco specifically that have been talking about and taking notes from what's been the infrastructure that's been emerging and has been emerging in LA, a lot of know your rights. But that's been happening even before the last four or five years in Boston and New York. I've been on calls with organizers from there, and let me just say, I feel like there's such discipline and also a very clear emphasis on sustainability and longevity and exactly what we've been talking about today. And I think one of the calls, I heard a lot of people talking about tapping into your neighborhood outside of crisis. I was like, “Yes, absolutely.”

I think also just disseminating that even more and just saying I think there is such a hard truth and a lot of people in Minneapolis know their neighbors generally, but there's also a lot of people that don't know their neighbors. And I have a lot of loved ones that have come up to me, and they're like, “I don't know my neighbor. Do I just knock? Are they going to be thinking it's weird or something?” And I think the power of failure is always great to just, if you knock and someone doesn't want to talk to you, try again or find a different way to contact with them; maybe send a note or something.

But I think the biggest thing is that isolation is a tool of this empire, and it makes us think we're so powerless and we are so … like nobody can understand you. You're the only one. There's this specialness and preciousness that comes with it. But I think from the calls that I've been in and from really people that have been in this work for a very long time, I've been hearing tap in with your people. That's been the takeaway for me, but also I think for people that I would recommend, your city is next, but do you know your neighbors? Can you name three people in your block? I feel like that feels like feasible takeaways.

Andrew: LA, DC, Chicago, North Carolina, Portland, we have benefited from all of those people who have practiced before us and been so generous with their time and energy. And we're cursed and so benefiting from this age of Zoom and Signal calls. And you can just reach out in a minute and adapt. You can learn from the people who have been doing this. We owe so much to our siblings, brothers, and sisters in Chicago.

What is happening right now in Minneapolis would not be possible without the lessons that came out of urban Chicago, our Midwest sweet ones and fam. And in terms of passing that on, we're still in the middle of it; we are not at the end of it yet. But it is so clear that everyone needs to be preparing for this type of acceleration across the country. They have billions and billions of dollars in funding, and they're not done yet. And we will do everything that we can in the place that we are right here in Minneapolis to hold that tide.

But if you don't know your neighbors, if you aren't building those systems, aren't building those connections, do it today. There's no bad time to start. And we need each other so much. And start practicing together. Get some whistles, run through scenarios. The people who are going to be your 9-1-1, who are going to be your emergency support are the ones within ear length that they can hear you calling for help or you whistling for help or they can hear the… You push the button on your car alarm, and that means everyone in your neighborhood come out. These are the practices that we're building. We're recreating the community response that we wish we had always had.

And we know that in these moments of trauma, we will rise to meet the moment and we will revert back to whatever our training has been, so practice, practice, practice. Build that muscle memory. Show up for each other. Turn out and show up. Make Minneapolis spread across this entire country because we are in this together and we see you. We're so thankful for your support. And we need you to do this everywhere.

KH: I want to thank you all so much for your time and your generosity. It's an honor to learn from you and to think alongside you. I know a lot of people, including people in my city, are extending solidarity to Minneapolis right now, and I hope that love is felt. Because it is sincere, and we are with you. Thank you for joining me today and for all that you do.

SR: Thank you, Kelly.

Jordan: Thanks, Kelly.

Andrew: Thank you so much.

KH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I'll see you in the streets.

            In a speech at the World Economic Forum last month, Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Union's executive body, repeatedly stressed the bloc's need for “independence.”
    


            She was speaking against a backdrop of threats by US President Donald Trump to either invade or extort the sale of Greenland – a sovereign territory of Denmark – and punish with tariffs several European countries opposing his plans. It was a watershed for a region that has traditionally opted for cautious diplomacy over confrontation with the White House.
    


            Trump's threats may have evaporated, but the feeling in Europe that it should become less dependent on the United States for its trade, its energy and its technology, has not. However, loosening those connections would be extremely difficult and come with enormous costs, analysts told CNN.
    


Trump's latest TACO moment puts his increasingly erratic temperament in the spotlight



            “You'd be trying to unravel and unpack several centuries of ever-deepening social, historical, institutional, economic, financial ties,” said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics.
    


            Still, Europe cannot afford complacency as it faces the prospect that Washington's volatile, winner-takes-all approach to its allies may outlast Trump – and that its dependencies on the United States could become its vulnerabilities.
    


            “I think there's a kind of fundamental element of distrust now, or concern about what might come (after Trump),” Shearing said.
    


            But the outsized role played by the United States in Europe's economy would make a hard split unrealistic and potentially ruinous for the region as it currently stands. Here's why.
    


            Deepening trade ties with other countries is an important way Europe could become less reliant on the United States. Already this year, the EU has inked trade agreements with India and four South American countries – a bloc referred to as Mercosur – after decades of negotiations.
    


            Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro research at ING, said the deals appear to be a step toward decoupling from Washington but that “neither Mercosur nor India will be able in the next decade to take over the role… that the US holds in European trade.”
    


            According to the EU Council, the EU and US have the largest bilateral trade and investment relationship in the world. The value of goods and services exchanged between them topped €1.68 trillion ($2 trillion) in 2024, representing almost 30% of the global total.
    


            The United States is also the biggest export market for EU goods, which include cars and pharmaceutical products, the Council said. Germany – the bloc's largest economy and a major exporter of autos – likewise counts the US as its top trading partner.
    


            Yet Europe needs the US far more that it is needed by Washington, said Brzeski. “Europe has always been export-oriented. Europe doesn't have enough (of its) own resources,” while the United States generally has a more “insulated, autonomous” economy, he added.
    


            Europe lacks the kind of mega tech companies that abound in the US, making it reliant on American firms for its digital services.
    


            “The internet in Europe is essentially a US construct, a US system. And Europe doesn't really have a competitor to any of that,” said Shearing at Capital Economics.
    


            The bloc's most valuable tech firm, Dutch chipmaker ASML, has a market capitalization roughly three times smaller than Tesla, the least valuable of the US's so-called Magnificent Seven – a group of tech giants whose performance has recently driven the US stock market.
    


            French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu said last week that government officials will ditch Zoom and other US-owned video conferencing tools and begin using French-owned software. The decision is intended partly to reduce “dependencies on non-European actors,” Lecornu wrote in a letter to ministers shared by a minister on X.
    


            Brzeski at ING said Europe would need to invest enormous sums to catch up with US providers of digital services, cloud infrastructure and data centers. “So, bluntly, (it needs) to have a kind of European version of (the Magnificent) Seven,” he said.
    


            Europe is still untangling itself from its long-held reliance on Russian oil and natural gas flows – a dependence that became a strategic weakness following Moscow's full-scale assault on Ukraine in 2022.
    


            The bloc ramped up imports of liquefied natural gas from the United States to plug the hole left by Russian supplies, leaving it less vulnerable to Moscow's weaponization of its energy. Russia was the EU's top supplier before the war, accounting for 40% of its gas demand.
    


            But Trump's habit of weaponizing US trade by imposing tariffs to extract concessions from allies has changed the risk calculus. The president has already used energy as leverage in trade negotiations with the EU, winning a commitment from Brussels last summer to buy $750 billion worth of US energy products.
    


            American LNG imports accounted for almost a quarter of the EU's gas demand last year, up from 6% in 2021, according to data from Wood Mackenzie.
    


            “It's obviously not a dependency similar to the one Europe had with Russia… but it's still a considerable dependence,” Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president of gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie, told CNN.
    


            Still, the share of American LNG in the European energy mix is expected to increase over the next few years as domestic gas production in Norway – currently the bloc's largest supplier – declines, according to Di Odoardo.
    


            But truly weaponizing US energy would require the participation of private US companies, he added. These firms are bound to long-term supply contracts with European buyers, with legal and financial interests to fulfill their terms.
    


            Unlike gas transported via pipelines, however, LNG from one supplier can be easily swapped with that from another. “It's a wise policy to diversify supply rather than being reliant on any single supplier… (it) is what every sensible government should be doing,” said Di Odoardo.

In first-of-its-kind complaint, state accused four fossil fuel majors and US oil lobbying group of climate disinformation

Amid rising concern about global heating and soaring energy costs, Michigan has sued big oil for allegedly fueling both crises – a move experts have hailed as groundbreaking.

In a first-of-its-kind complaint, the state's attorney general, Dana Nessel, accused four fossil fuel majors and the top US oil lobbying group last month of acting as a “cartel” to stifle the growth of renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs), while suppressing information about the dangers of the climate crisis. The conduct, the lawsuit alleged, violates federal and state antitrust laws.

The companies' “collusion” drove up Michigan utility costs and slowed the transition away from gas-powered cars, according to the filing. Absent the industry's efforts to repress clean technology, EVs “would be a common sight in every neighborhood – rolling off assembly lines in Flint, parked in driveways in Dearborn, charging outside grocery stores in Grand Rapids, and running quietly down Woodward Avenue”, it said.

Electricity costs in Michigan have surged, with average residential rates increasing by nearly 120% in the last two decades. And though electric car adoption is increasing, EVs and hybrids accounted for less than 4% of total registered vehicles statewide last year.

“Michigan is facing an energy affordability crisis as our home energy costs skyrocket and consumers are left without affordable options for transportation,” Nessel said in a statement. “These out-of-control costs are not the result of natural economic inflation, but due to the greed of these corporations who prioritized their own profit and marketplace dominance over competition and consumer savings.”

Michigan's case specifically targets BP, Shell, Chevron and Exxon Mobil, as well as the largest US oil lobby group, the American Petroleum Institute (API).

“This is yet another legally incoherent effort to regulate by lawsuit,” an ExxonMobil spokesperson said. “It won't reduce emissions, it won't help consumers and it won't stand up to the law.”

Ryan Meyers, general counsel for the API, said: “These baseless lawsuits are a coordinated campaign against an industry that powers everyday life, drives America's economy and is actively reducing emissions. We continue to believe that energy policy belongs in Congress, not a patchwork of courtrooms.”

BP declined to comment on the pending litigation. The Guardian has contacted all defendants for comment.

The oil industry has long attempted to have lawsuits voided by saying they are pre-empted by policies, but plaintiffs say climate accountability lawsuits focus on business practices and the distribution of misleading information, not emissions regulations.

The 126-page lawsuit was brought by Nessel's office alongside Sher Edling – a California-based law firm which is representing a slew of municipalities in climate accountability litigation – and two other firms, DiCello Levitt and Hausfeld, which have also handled climate complaints and are based in Chicago and Washington DC, respectively.

The new challenge accuses the defendants of engaging in a vast “conspiracy”, starting almost 50 years ago when a 1979 Exxon internal report predicted the world would see catastrophic global heating without a massive shift to renewable energy.

“Rather than compete as leading producers of renewable energy products, the defendants and their co-conspirators conspired to suppress their own output of renewable energy, and restrain output by others,” the lawsuit said.

To do so, the firms used an array of tactics, including employing patent lawsuits to stop their competitors, hiding information about fossil fuels' dangers and the viability of renewables, using trade associations to coordinate “market-wide efforts” to skew investments toward oil and gas, and even hiring hackers to “surveil, intimidate and disrupt” journalists and activists, it claimed.

“Michigan's groundbreaking case reveals how the big oil cartel conspired to deny Americans cleaner and cheaper energy choices and make life less affordable by keeping consumers hooked on their dirty fossil fuel products,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, a non-profit which tracks and supports climate litigation.

With the challenge, Michigan joins 10 other states and about 60 subnational governments that have sued big oil for alleged climate deception in recent years. Together, the cases represent jurisdictions that are home to more than a quarter of the US population.

Nessel first announced plans to launch climate accountability litigation in 2024, stating concerns with the cost of climate damages in her state. The 23 January filing came despite attempts to thwart climate accountability litigation from the Trump administration. Last year, the Department of Justice took the unusual step of suing Michigan and Hawaii over the states' plans to file such cases; despite the attack, Hawaii filed its lawsuit the following day.

In a blow to the Trump administration, one day after Michigan filed its lawsuit, a federal judge tossed out the justice department's filing against the state.

But the oil industry and its allies are continuing their attempts to kill off climate accountability lawsuits. The fossil fuel industry is lobbying Congress to obtain immunity from climate-focused litigation and policies, and last month the API listed defeating climate accountability lawsuits as a top priority for 2026.

The sector and its allies have also been pushing the supreme court to weigh in on the legitimacy of climate lawsuits. Soon, the high court is expected to decide if it will hear arguments over a petition by Exxon Mobil and energy giant Suncor seeking to end a lawsuit brought by the city and county of Boulder, Colorado.

Office of Personnel Management says reclassification will allow agencies to quickly remove employees who ‘obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives'

The Trump administration moved Thursday to issue a rule that would make it easier to fire tens of thousands of federal workers. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said it was reclassifying certain career civil service roles so agencies can “quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives”.

Traditionally, only political appointees – roughly 4,000 positions – can be dismissed “at will”.

Under the new rule, many nonpartisan roles would be shifted into a category called “Schedule Policy/Career,” effectively treating them as political appointees. That reclassification could allow the administration to remove employees it views as disloyal. The rule – set to be published in the Federal Register on Friday – also states that “personal or political loyalty tests as a condition of employment” are prohibited.

Critics argue the change would open the door to politically motivated purges. “We have successfully fought this kind of power grab before, and we will fight this again. We will return to court to stop this unlawful rule and will use every legal tool available to hold this administration accountable to the people,” said Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward.

The largest union representing federal workers called the rule “a direct assault on a professional, nonpartisan, merit-based civil service.” In a statement, American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) president Everett Kelley said OPM is “rebranding career public servants as ‘policy' employees, silencing whistleblowers, and replacing competent professionals with political flunkies without any neutral, independent protections against politicization and arbitrary abuse of power.”

Trump briefly enacted a similar change at the end of his first term through an executive order known as “Schedule F,” which Joe Biden rescinded upon taking office in 2021. Stripping civil service protections has also been a central plank of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 blueprint.

In a statement Thursday, anticipating the rule's release, OPM director Scott Kupor said the reclassification would bring “much-needed accountability to career policy-influencing positions in the Federal government.”

Chris Nanos, the Pima county sheriff, said today that local authorities believe 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, the mother of Today show host Savannah Guthrie, is “still out there” following her disappearance almost five days ago. “We just want her home and find a way to get to the bottom of this,” Nanos said.

The FBI is now supporting Pima county authorities on the investigation, and Nanos added that officials did not yet have a suspect, when he addressed the press on Thursday. “We're not there yet,” he said.

Donald Trump also said today that he had “productive” discussions with Keir Starmer regarding Diego Garcia in the Chagos Islands, which he said was “of great importance to the National Security of the United States”.

Trump, who has previously called the UK PM's Chagos deal “an act of great stupidity” and linked it to his own ambition to acquire Greenland, said today in a post on Truth Social that he understood it was “the best deal he [Starmer] could make”.

“However,” he went on, “if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers U.S. operations and forces at our Base, I retain the right to Militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia.”

Last week, Starmer said that US intelligence agencies disagreed with Trump's newly found opposition to the deal, as he underlined how the US administration had supported the deal as it bolstered their defences.

Donald Trump has said that Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi had his “total endorsement” ahead of a legislative election in Japan on Sunday, adding that they would meet on 19 March at the White House.

“Prime Minister Takaichi is someone who deserves powerful recognition for the job she and her Coalition are doing,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

“Therefore, as President of the United States of America, it is my Honor to give a Complete and Total Endorsement of her, and what her highly respected Coalition is representing.”

Takaichi is widely expected to win in the snap election this Sunday.

On the morning of 21 January, Israeli authorities left eight Palestinian men at a West Bank checkpoint. Disoriented and cold, they were dressed in prison-issued tracksuits and carried their few belongings in plastic bags.

Hours earlier, they had been sitting with their wrists and ankles shackled on the plush leather seats of a private jet owned by the Florida property tycoon Gil Dezer, a longtime business partner of Donald Trump.

Dezer is also a Trump donor, friend of Donald Trump Jr and member of the Miami branch of Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.

His sleek Gulfstream jet – which he has called “my little rocket ship” – was used to transport the men from an airport near a notorious removal centre in Arizona to Tel Aviv. The jet made three refuelling stops en route: in New Jersey, Ireland and Bulgaria.

A Guardian investigation has established the flight was part of a secretive and politically sensitive US government operation to deport Palestinians arrested by ICE to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

One of those deported on the January flight was Maher Awad, a 24-year-old originally from the West Bank, who had lived in the US for nearly a decade. Speaking to the Guardian in the town of Rammun, Maher shared photos of his girlfriend and newborn son in Michigan.

“They dropped us off like animals on the side of the road,” Awad said. “We went to a local house, we knocked on the door, we were like: ‘Please help us out.'”

US job openings dropped to the lowest level in more than five years in December and data for the prior month was revised lower amid a softening in labor market conditions at the end of 2025.

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, decreased by 386,000 to 6.542m by the last day of December, the lowest level since September 2020, the labor department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, today.

Data for November was revised down to show 6.928m job openings instead of the previously reported 7.146m. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 7.20m unfilled jobs. Hiring increased by 172,000 positions to a still-low 5.293m in December.

The data came as other numbers showed a larger-than-expected increase in Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a stable labor market.

Here's the full story:

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has said that further US sanctions against Russia depend on talks aimed at ending its nearly four-year-old war in Ukraine.

Bessent, who participated in talks with Russian officials and Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in Miami on 31 January, said he would consider sanctions against Russia's shadow fleet.

“We will see where the peace talks go,” Bessent said, noting that the Trump administration's sanctions against Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil had helped bring Russia to the negotiating table in the peace talks.

At least two cases of measles have been confirmed at a major immigration detention center for children and their parents in Texas as cases of the dangerous virus in South Carolina, Arizona, Utah and other US states continue growing and alarming experts.

In January alone, the US saw 25% of the total confirmed in all of last year, and the outbreak shows no sign of slowing as federal officials stay silent on vaccination.

The vast majority of patients are not vaccinated, but there have been no national campaigns announced or recent statements from leaders such as Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Last year, Kennedy positioned measles vaccines as a personal choice and recommended unproven treatments for the highly contagious illness.

The measles outbreak is “frightening” and “very worrisome”, said Jason Bowling, professor of infectious diseases at UT Health San Antonio and director of hospital epidemiology at University Health.

“I unfortunately do not see this slowing down across the United States,” said Anna-Kathryn Burch, division director of pediatric infectious diseases at Prisma Health Children's hospital in the Midlands in South Carolina. What's happening in South Carolina could happen anywhere the vaccination rate dips too low, Burch said. “It's not a matter of if, but more likely when.”

The Dilley family detention center in south Texas, one of two immigration facilities for children in the US, reported two measles cases on Friday. “We are aware of the cases and are assisting by providing doses of measles vaccine as requested by ICE,” said Chris Van Deusen, director of media relations at the Texas department of state health services, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Amid the various winding comments throughout Trump's speech today, he said that the Department of Education will officially issue its new guidance to protect the right to prayer in public schools today.

“Now the Democrats will sue us, but we'll win it,” Trump said, eliciting some laughs from the audience at the National Prayer Breakfast. “They'll sue us. They sue us for everything. I'm the most sued human being in history.”

The president is now rattling off a number of states who, he says, have cooperated with federal law enforcement. But has now launched into a tirade on Minnesota.

“They won't work with us,” Trump said, while claiming that he would be able to drive crime down further without the “horrible governor and this horrible fake mayor Frey”.

Trump announced there will be a national prayer event on the National Mall on 17 May. “We're going to rededicate America as one nation under God,” Trump added.

During his speech today, Trump praised Tulsi Gabbard – the director of national intelligence – for her role in the FBI's search of the Fulton county election offices in Georgia last week. Here agents seized almost 700 boxes of 2020 election documentation.

“She took a lot of heat two days ago because she went in at Pam's insistence,” the president said. “They say, ‘why is she doing it'… because Pam [the attorney general] wanted her to do it. And you know why? Because she's smart.”

Earlier this week, the Guardian reported that Gabbard is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump's approval, working separately from the justice department investigation.

“Her position has to do with international,” Trump added today.

He went further:

They've been saying ‘Russia, Russia, Russia has been screwing our elections'. OK, so let's assume Russia had something to do with it. They said, ‘no, no, Russia didn't'… so now they're saying Russia had nothing to do with it. Because if I say Russia, that it's perfectly fine. But you could add China and about five other countries.

Trump's meandered during his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast today. He's denigrated Thomas Massie, the Republican congressman and his frequent target who co-sponsored legislation to release the full tranche of Epstein files, and voted against the most recent funding bill package that the president signed into law on Tuesday. “There's something wrong with him,” Trump said. “ They love voting ‘no'. They think it's good politically.”

The president also touted the military operation in Venezuela, which resulted in the capture of the now deposed leader Nicolás Maduro. “We're getting along fantastically with leadership,” Trump said of the interrim president Delcy Rodriguez.

One note, ahead of the president's address today, we heard from Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador, and a noted Trump ally.

Bukele has worked closely with the Trump administration to accept flights of undocumented immigrants, who they allege are convicted criminals, and hold them in El Salvador's mega-prison, known as CECOT.

Bukele has described himself as the “world's coolest dictator” and has overseen one of the largest crackdowns on crime in his country. Critics have branded him an authoritarian leader, that has done away with due process.

Today he called the gangs that he's worked to eliminate from El Salvador as “satanic”.

“Some of those gangs are here in the United States,” he added. “If God did this for El Salvador he can do this for countries all over the world.”

Donald Trump is in Washington today. As we noted earlier, we'll hear from the president shortly when he attends the National Prayer Breakfast.

Later today we'll also hear from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when she holds a 1pm ET briefing for reporters.

Mass layoffs at the Washington Post have prompted backlash from employees, who have been on “edge” for weeks over the future of the publication.

On Wednesday the publication announced it would be laying off one-third of its workforce, and would be scaling back coverage of sport and foreign news.

“This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world's greatest news organizations,” the Post's celebrated former editor-in-chief Marty Baron said in a statement.

The Guardian's Jeremy Barr reports that staffers at the Post have been worried for weeks about the rumoured cuts, which the publication would not confirm or deny. “It's an absolute bloodbath,” said one employee, not authorized to speak publicly.

During a morning meeting announcing the changes, the editor in chief, Matt Murray, told employees that the Post was undergoing a “strategic reset” to better position the publication for the future, according to several employees who were on the call.

Murray acknowledged that the Post had struggled to reach “customers” and talked about the need to compete in a crowded media marketplace. “Today, the Washington Post is taking a number of actions across the company to secure our future,” he said, according to an audio recording of the meeting.

The affected employees include Caroline O'Donovan, who primarily covers Amazon, the company founded by the Post owner, Jeff Bezos. Other staffers, including the sports journalist Neil Greenberg, have also announced that they were affected.

President Donald Trump is set to attend and deliver remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast later today, a spokesperson from the White House confirmed.

The event is held annually in Washington DC on the first Thursday of every February. It aims to bring together leaders in political, social and business sectors from around the country to an event that merges prayer and networking.

“Today, President Trump will unite our country through the power of prayer at the 74th National Prayer Breakfast,” a White House spokesperson said.

“President Trump has made unprecedented strides to protect our God-given rights and has delivered on his promise to reverse Joe Biden's divisive policies that weaponized the federal government against men and women of faith. President Trump has secured major victories for religious freedom – from defending innocent life to restoring biological truth and protecting parents' fundamental rights.”

Fox News reports that the president first attended the National Prayer Breakfast in 2017 and returned last year, using his remarks to pledge action against what he called anti-Christian bias tied to the Biden administration.

“While I'm in the White House, we will protect Christians in our schools, in our military, in our government, in our workplaces, hospitals and in our public squares, and we will bring our country back together as one nation under God, with liberty and justice for all,” he said during last year's event.

According to the outlet, other notable attenders set to appear at the 2026 event include house speaker Mike Johnson and attorney general Pam Bondi.

Donald Trump said the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis were both sad incidents that “should not have happened,” but nobody feels worse about both shootings than ICE agents.

“He was not an angel, and she was not an angel,” Trump said of Pretti and Good in a new interview with NBC News. “Still, I'm not happy with what happened there. Nobody can be happy, and ICE wasn't happy either.

“But I'm always going to be with our great people of law enforcement,” he continued. “We have to back them. If we don't back them, we don't have a country.”

This comes as the White House border czar, Tom Homan, says 700 federal agents will leave Minnesota. In the interview, Trump suggested using a “softer touch” in carrying out his aggressive immigration crackdown.

However, Chuck Schumer, the US Senate minority leader, said the reduction of 700 agents wasn't enough. “ICE's abuses go beyond the headlines. Residents are afraid to go to schools, to grocery stores, to even step outside. Agents are patrolling the streets like a military operation,” he said. “All of ICE needs to leave Minneapolis now.”

The second day of US-brokered talks between negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv have been taking place in Abu Dhabi. The discussions come amid increased Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid and a continuing war of attrition.

The Trump administration says it wants to create a critical minerals trading bloc with its allies and partners in order to counter China's stronghold. This would use tariffs to shore up supplies of critical minerals needed for electric vehicles, missiles and other hi-tech products.

The British prime minister Keir Starmer has apologised to Epstein victims for giving Peter Mandelson the US ambassador job. Starmer says Mandelson portrayed Epstein as someone he barely knew. He expressed regret for believing Mandelson's lies and appointing him.

The US Justice Department is under fire for revealing information about Epstein's victims, and hiding the identities of alleged perpetrators, CNN reports. Survivors have accused the DoJ for “botching” the release of the three million documents which came out last week.

At least two cases confirmed at detention center for children and their parents in Texas 

At least two cases of measles have been confirmed at a major immigration detention center for children and their parents in Texas as cases of the dangerous virus in South Carolina, Arizona, Utah and other US states continue growing and alarming experts.

In January alone, the US saw 25% of the total confirmed in all of last year, and the outbreak shows no sign of slowing as federal officials stay silent on vaccination.

The vast majority of patients are not vaccinated, but there have been no national campaigns announced or recent statements from leaders such as Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Last year, Kennedy positioned measles vaccines as a personal choice and recommended unproven treatments for the highly contagious illness.

The measles outbreak is “frightening” and “very worrisome”, said Jason Bowling, professor of infectious diseases at UT Health San Antonio and director of hospital epidemiology at University Health.

“I unfortunately do not see this slowing down across the United States,” said Anna-Kathryn Burch, division director of pediatric infectious diseases at Prisma Health Children's hospital in the Midlands in South Carolina. What's happening in South Carolina could happen anywhere the vaccination rate dips too low, Burch said. “It's not a matter of if, but more likely when.”

The Dilley family detention center in south Texas, one of two immigration facilities for children in the US, reported two measles cases on Friday. “We are aware of the cases and are assisting by providing doses of measles vaccine as requested by ICE,” said Chris Van Deusen, director of media relations at the Texas department of state health services, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

This is the same facility where five-year-old asylum seeker Liam Conejo Ramos and his father were kept for a week after being detained in Minneapolis. It's also the facility where protests sprang up on 24 January, with children yelling: “Let us go!” Children and parents are now locked down in the facility. Elizabeth Zuna Caisaguano, who is reporting flu-like symptoms, and her mother, who has hives – but neither have been tested for measles, they say – were released from the facility on Tuesday night.

Joaquin Castro, a Democratic congressman from San Antonio, is calling for the detention center to be “shut down immediately”. Dilley is not equipped to deal with the spread of measles, Castro said in a post on X. “Children and families, who have committed no crime, should not be suffering and do not belong in prison.”

Detention centers can be “epidemic engines” that become “basically factories for manufacturing virus at incredible scale and incredible pace, and inevitably they overthrow the walls of these prisons”, said Eric Reinhart, a political anthropologist and psychiatrist who researched the spread of Covid in jails and prisons.

The news highlights the rapidly spiraling outbreak throughout the United States.

South Carolina reported a total of 876 measles cases and at least 18 hospitalizations on Tuesday, already surpassing the official tally of the entire west Texas outbreak last year and still growing. Hospitals in South Carolina are not required to report hospitalizations for measles, but at least 18 children and adults have been hospitalized because of the virus, according to the health department.

Other states are also seeing continued spread, including Arizona with 239 cases and 14 hospitalizations and Utah with 251 cases and 23 hospitalizations. As of Friday, there have been 588 confirmed cases of measles in the US this year – and all but three were from local spread, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

When measles is spreading readily in communities, the virus can enter detention centers and increase exponentially because of the conditions – with children and parents moved from all over the country and made to stay in close quarters with poor water, food and medical care. People who have not had stable access to healthcare because of poor infrastructure or political instability in their countries of origin may also have lower vaccination rates. One in five measles patients usually need hospitalization.

“This is a major public health issue” because detention centers are “an ideal environment for the spread of measles”, Reinhart said. Officials have said they are “ceasing all movement within the facility”, but there is no way to end movement in and out of a detention center like this unless the staff are also locked down, Reinhart said. “You can take measures to try to mitigate it, but you really have to get people out of those kinds of conditions.”

Prisons and jails frequently accelerate outbreaks of infectious diseases, spreading beyond the institutions' walls and into communities. “You're putting people at risk of an epidemic outbreak – not just the people inside the facility but the people around it and, ultimately, people everywhere,” Reinhart said. Releasing inmates proved effective in stopping greater spread of Covid, Reinhart found, and he called for decarceration and an end to immigration raids. “Abolish ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, which is basically a state terror organization,” Reinhart said.

ICE did not respond by press time to the Guardian's questions, including whether detention staff were moving within the community and whether a vaccination campaign had begun.

When asked to confirm that Kennedy had not made any public statements and HHS had not launched any national vaccination campaigns on measles in recent months, an HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said that was “completely false”, adding: “Have you not even been following us the past year?” He did not respond by press time to a request for evidence of either point.

In the absence of federal campaigns, the bulk of vaccination efforts are falling on state and local officials and providers.

“It breaks my heart that we are seeing this in my state, when we have a vaccine that is very effective and safe – we have a way to prevent this,” Burch said. “It's a very difficult time right now for pediatricians, because we are seeing hesitancy increase with vaccination.” The MMR vaccine was safe, and it was the most effective way to end this outbreak, she said.

“That's the major preventative step that we have,” Bowling agreed. “Vaccine rates are so important.” Not everyone responds to the vaccine or can get it; those who are pregnant or undergoing immune-compromising treatments, like chemotherapy, can't get vaccinated, and babies under six months of age also cannot get the shot. That means infants and pregnant people, especially in confined conditions at Dilley, are at high risk.

Health systems in places like South Carolina are now setting up incident command systems, requiring face masks, screening patients for potential contact, and switching to telehealth and testing outside of emergency rooms for patients with suspected measles.

“We learned to be adaptive during the Covid pandemic,” Burch said. “We are adapting to this outbreak, and we're here to help people.”

Poland's attempt to change the narrative on the Jeffrey Epstein scandal by announcing a planned probe into the alleged Moscow links of the late convicted sex offender will not succeed, Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, has said.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a government meeting on Tuesday that “more and more leads, more and more information, and more and more commentary in the global press all relate to the suspicion that this unprecedented pedophilia scandal was co-organized by Russian intelligence services.” Warsaw must investigate allegations of Epstein working for Moscow because they are “serious… for the security of the Polish state” and could mean that Russia possesses “compromising materials against many leaders still active today,” he claimed.

In a post on X on Wednesday, Dmitriev rejected Tusk's accusations, arguing that through them “the exposed liberal cabal is desperately trying to change the narrative.” 

“But people have awakened, see through the lies & fake news to the Truth: the Satanic Liberal West, hidden decision-making and influence networks, double standards, dirty media tricks have all been exposed,” he wrote.

The envoy also attached to his post a screenshot from an Epstein email from 2014, in which he told Ariane de Rothschild, the head of the Swiss private banking firm Edmond de Rothschild Group, that the “ukraine upheaval should provide many opportunites , many [sic].” The exchange happened a few months after a violent Western-backed coup in Kiev in which democratically elected President Viktor Yanukovich was deposed.

In a later message, Dmitriev joked that Moscow should launch its own “investigation into whether Polish PM Tusk is actually a secret brother or son of Epstein” as, according to the envoy, the two have a lot of similarities in their looks.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that he couldn't seriously comment on claims of Epstein's alleged ties with Russia. “One would want to make a lot jokes about such suggestions, but let's not waste our time,” he told journalists.

Last week, the US Department of Justice released the final batch of over 3 million pages, 2,000 videos, and 180,000 images related to Epstein, who died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. They revealed that the disgraced financier maintained ties with prominent figures in politics, finance, academia and business, including former US President Bill Clinton and billionaires Bill Gates and Elon Musk, before and after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to prostitution charges.

The U.S. Pentagon is trialing attack drones for new contracts that should total $1.1 billion, inviting two Ukrainian drone makers to take part. 

A Feb. 3 notice listed 25 companies invited to take part in a competition as the intro to the "Drone Dominance Program." 

One of the firms invited is General Cherry, in Ukrainian known as Heneral Chereshnya, one of the largest producers of first-person view (FPV) drones in the country, though its sudden rise over 2025 attracted extensive scrutiny. 

Another seemingly Ukrainian firm selected is "Ukrainian Defense Drones Tech Corp," but the Kyiv Independent could find no record of an entity by that name in corporate registries in the U.S., Ukraine or EU. 

Round one will consist of a competition called "The Gauntlet" in Fort Benning, Georgia, the largest Army training facility in the U.S. and home of, among a number of relevant units, the Expeditionary Warrior Experiment, which has spent recent years testing new drone technologies. 

Following the first phase, the Pentagon says it will order $150 million in prototypes from successful competitors. 

The budget is $1.1 billion across all four phases in pursuit of what the Pentagon termed "competitive, iterative cycles measured in months, not years."

The Pentagon's current system of coordinating purchases can extend decades often privilege massive and expensive weapons systems, for example the sixth-generation F-47 fighter jet program that has been underway since 2014. Those timespans are out of sync with fast incremental iterations, which the Russian-Ukrainian front has shown to be key to modern electrified war. 

The U.S. Defense Department is also famous for overpaying wildly on drones. While the military often keeps pricing details on weapons secret, available figures suggest massive upcharging. A 2024 contract with Anduril for 500 Roadrunners – effectively interceptor drones – and an unknown number of "Pulsar" electronic warfare stations ran for just under $250 million. Half a million dollars per unit would put those Roadrunners at roughly two orders of magnitude more expensive than their Ukrainian equivalents. 

The most recent drone initiatives from the Pentagon have sought to address this price differential – for example a Made-in-USA copy of the Iranian-Russian Shahed deep-strike drone – but results are uncertain. Days ago, the U.S. used an F-35 Fighter to shoot down an Iranian Shahed that was approaching an American aircraft carrier on the Arabian Sea.

MOSCOW, February 5. /TASS/. Moscow believes that the recognition of Donbass as part of Russia by all countries should be part of a major agreement, a Western source close to the Abu Dhabi talks told TASS.

"Russia sees the aspect concerning the recognition of Donbass by all countries as crucial," the source said.

Russia, the US and Ukraine held the first round of trilateral security consultations in Abu Dhabi on January 23-24. The second round of talks began in the Emirati capital on Wednesday.

Russia's flagship liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminal, Yamal LNG, exported a total of 1,690,517 metric tons of LNG to European markets last month, accounting for an 8% increase compared to January 2025, German environmental NGO Urgewald found in a report published Feb. 4. 

The report follows an agreement reached in December 2025 by EU countries to ban Russian gas imports beginning Jan. 1, 2028, with LNG imports set to be prohibited at the start of 2027.

Despite the scheduled prohibition, the European Union remains the biggest importer of Russian LNG. In 2025, EU member states imported a total of 7.2 billion euros ($8.4 billion) worth of LNG.

Urgewald, citing data from global trade tracking website Kpler, reported that of the 25 Yamal LNG cargos delivered abroad in January, 23 of the loads were delivered to European ports — with the remaining deliveries destined for China.

Amid the continued imports, sanctions campaigners, including Urgewald, have called on restricting British and French Arc7 LNG carriers from delivering imports to European port, suggesting that restrictions would "significantly curb Russia's ability to sustain LNG exports during winter operations." 

"Sanctioning and restricting these vessels would directly cut off Putin's Arctic LNG revenues and close one of the most important remaining energy loopholes funding the Kremlin's war," Sebastian Rötters, a sanctions campaign at Urgewald, said in a statement.

Gas and oil exports have played a crucial role in helping Russia fund its all-out war against Ukraine, which is soon to hit its fourth-year anniversary.

While the Yamal LNG project does not account for all of Russia's LNG exports to Europe, the terminal, a non-sanctioned venture based in northwestern Siberia on the Yamal Peninsula, serves as Russia's key export hub to Europe. Of the 19.7 million metric tons of LNG exports from Yamal, over 15 million tons — or 76.1% — are shipped to European ports.

In 2025, France served as the largest importer of Russian LNG from Yamal LNG, accounting for nearly 42% — or 6.3 million tons — of all imports, according to Urgewald. While another 4.2 million tons of LNG delivered to Belgium's Zeebrugge terminal.

The news comes amid growing Western pressure against Russian LNG trade. The EU on Jan. 26 gave final approval to a decision to ban imports of LNG from Russia by early 2027, with pipeline gas imports to be prohibited later the same year.

Among the proposals in the EU's planned 20th sanctions package against Russia is a complete maritime services ban on Russia. While the proposal has not been finalized, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told reporters that the bloc aims to impose the sanctions package on Feb. 24, he day marking the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

• Funding fight: Senate Republican leader John Thune says lawmakers aren't “anywhere close” on a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security, as Democrats have demanded a list of reforms for ICE.
    


• Trump remarks: During a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, President Donald Trump said Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard went to Fulton County, Georgia, to probe alleged ballot irregularities at Attorney General Pam Bondi's “insistence.” He also attacked Democrats over their opposition to voter ID laws.
    


• Ukraine talks: The US is reestablishing high-level military communication with Russia after it was suspended in 2021, following the second day of trilateral talks among Ukraine, Russia and the US.
    


• Immigration crackdown: Trump's border czar Tom Homan said DHS will immediately withdraw 700 personnel from Minnesota, leaving about 2,000 officers on the ground. Trump said the fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis “should not have happened.”



            Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is leading a diplomatic delegation to conduct nuclear negotiations with the United States in Oman, Iran's foreign ministry said today.
    


            The high-stakes talks are scheduled to take place tomorrow in the Omani capital of Muscat and will involve Araghchi and US special envoy Steve Witkoff, according to Iran's state-affiliated Tasnim News Agency.
    


            The talks will be carried out “with authority” and aimed at reaching a “fair, mutually satisfactory and honorable understanding” on the nuclear issue, foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said in the statement.
    


            The ministry said that Iran is entering the negotiations with full awareness of past experiences, including what it described as previous breaches of commitments, military aggression against Iran in June and foreign interventions during recent nationwide protests. These experiences, the statement said, continue to shape Tehran's approach to diplomacy.
    


                    “At all times, we consider ourselves obliged to demand the rights of the Iranian nation,” Baghaei said. He added that Iran also sees itself as responsible for not missing opportunities to use diplomacy to secure national interests and safeguard peace and stability in the region.

As the US and Iran go back and forth on where and what they will talk about amid tensions, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh looks at what position Iran are in. 


            President Donald Trump said Thursday that the United States should negotiate a “new, improved, and modernized” nuclear treaty with Russia instead of agreeing to extend the New START treaty.
    


            “Rather than extend ‘NEW START'(A badly negotiated deal by the United States that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future,” the president wrote on Truth Social.
    


            The last remaining nuclear treaty between the two countries expires on Thursday and has sparked fears about a nuclear arms race, with the two biggest nuclear superpowers without limits on their arsenals for the first time in decades.
    


            President Donald Trump said Thursday that he had “very productive discussions” with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer about the future of Diego Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean where the US has a military base, after previously criticizing the UK's plans to transfer its ownership to Mauritius.
    


            In a Truth Social post, Trump warned that the United States would act if American interests were threatened.
    


            “I understand that the deal Prime Minister Starmer has made, according to many, the best he could make,” he said. “However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers U.S. operations and forces at our Base, I retain the right to Militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia.”
    


            “Let it be known that I will never allow our presence on a Base as important as this to ever be undermined or threatened by fake claims or environmental nonsense,” Trump continued.
    


            Earlier this year, he accused the UK of “stupidity” over the move to transfer ownership of the Chagos Islands, which includes Diego Garcia, to Mauritius.
    


            “Shockingly, our ‘brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia … FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,” Trump wrote in January. “The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY.”
    


            Democrats are not committed to backing another short-term funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security, raising the odds of an agency shutdown.
    


            While Congress has funded most of the federal agencies through September 30, funding for the Department of Homeland Security expires next Friday at midnight.
    


            Democrats are demanding reforms as part of any funding package for the agency. But as talks remain stalled, a number of rank-and-file Democrats – including many who traditionally back stopgap measures in the past – indicate they won't entertain another funding bill without a clear sense that negotiators are making progress.
    


            “That's a close call, and it would depend to some extent on whether I thought there were real, good faith negotiations going on,” Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, said of whether he'd back another short-term spending bill for the agency. “But if it is we're not even going to talk to you….I don't know but if that's their position then no.”
    


            Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, another Democrat who has voted to keep the government open even when other Democrats voted no, argued that she wasn't going to speculate at this point what she will do given the talks haven't really gotten underway.
    


            Several Democrats said they weren't open to a short-term funding extension of any length or under any circumstances.
    


            “We definitely don't need a short-term CR, and I don't think the American people want us funding an agency that is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said.
    


            Asked if he was open to a CR to give talks more time, Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, shot back “more time for what?”
    


            President Donald Trump announced Thursday that Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will visit the White House on March 19, praising her leadership ahead of Japan's upcoming legislative elections.
    


            Trump highlighted the significance of Japan's vote scheduled for Sunday, calling it critical to the country's future and offering an emphatic endorsement of Takaichi.
    


            “The Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, has already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise Leader, and one that truly loves her Country,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, adding that he looks forward to welcoming her to Washington later in March.
    


                    The president also pointed to close cooperation between the United States and Japan on national security and trade, saying the two countries have worked toward “a very substantial Trade Deal, one that strongly benefits both Countries.” Trump concluded the post with a message to Japanese voters, writing, “SHE WILL NOT LET THE PEOPLE OF JAPAN DOWN! Good luck on your very important Sunday Vote.”
                





            The president first met Takaichi during his Asia trip in October, where the two leaders spent time together during meetings with business executives and government officials.
    


            During that visit, Trump received a Nobel Peace Prize nomination from Takaichi, the second of his Asia trip, along with a golf putter that had belonged to the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who famously bonded with Trump over golf.
    


            “She is a delight,” Trump said at the conclusion of the day's events. “I got to know her pretty well in a short period of time.”
    


            America's affordability challenges and the next leader of the Federal Reserve were a sticking point in a heated exchange between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
    

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) pressed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about rising US grocery prices after President Trump continues to falsely say that grocery prices are falling.


            In today's congressional hearing, Warren referred to recent comments from President Donald Trump where he referred to affordability as a “hoax.” Bessent pushed back against Warren, saying, “It may be a bit nuanced for you, but what President Trump is referring to is the media saying that the affordability crisis was generated by this administration, when it was you and President Biden.”
    


            Warren then pressed Bessent over whether grocery prices dropped last year. He said that “numerous grocery prices have gone down.”
    


                    “Under Donald Trump, families are paying more and more for groceries,” Warren said. “So, if you're just going to insult people by denying the facts that are out there and tell people they're doing great when they're struggling, I think that's just another way to say you don't have a plan to bring down these prices.”
                





The numbers: While two dozen grocery items did see lower prices in 2025, including eggs and potatoes, the vast majority (80%) of the grocery items monitored by the government's Consumer Price Index continued to rise, with overall inflation at 2.7% for the year.
    


            Talks intended to end the Ukraine war concluded Thursday in an agreement to reopen a military communication channel between the US and Russia, President Donald Trump's top foreign envoy said, though so far no resolution to the conflict appears at hand.
    


            Steve Witkoff, who led the US delegation in the two-day trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi, said the discussions were “constructive and focused on how to create the conditions for a durable peace.”
    


            “The delegations had wide-ranging discussions on the remaining open issues including methods to implement a ceasefire and monitor the cessation of military activities,” he wrote in a statement on social media.
    


            The re-establishment of high-level military dialogue between the US and Russia could point to normalizing relations between the two countries. Washington and Moscow cut off military-to-military communication in the days ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago.
    


            “This channel of communication was suspended prior to the onset of this conflict and is crucial to achieving and maintaining peace,” Witkoff said, adding it would be led on the US side by General Alexus Grynkewich, commander of US European Command.
    


            He also noted a prisoner exchange agreed to by both sides, the first in several months.
    


            “The delegations agreed to report back to their respective capitals and to continue trilateral discussions in the coming weeks,” he wrote.
    


            We're staying across the latest news on the Trump administration as congressional leaders race against the clock to reach a deal funding the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune said today that lawmakers aren't “anywhere close” on a deal and has criticized Democrats' proposal for Immigration and Customs Enforcement reforms. Still, Thune says there is room for negotiation.
    


            Meanwhile, President Donald Trump praised his spy chief Tulsi Gabbard today for her role in investigating what he claimed was “international cheating” in US elections. Gabbard has faced questions over her involvement in the controversial search of a Georgia elections office.
    


If you're joining us, here's a roundup of today's other top headlines: 



CNN's Tami Luhby, Alejandra Jaramillo, Kaanita Iyer, Holmes Lybrand, Veronica Stracqualursi, Alicia Wallace, Sana Noor Haq, Victoria Butenko, Anna Chernova, Svitlana Vlasova and Lauren Kent contributed to this report.



            GOP Sen. Josh Hawley accused Democrats of not negotiating in good faith as a deadline to avert a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, which includes crucial disaster relief and airport security agencies, rapidly approaches.
    


            “They haven't even reached out to begin negotiations,” Hawley told CNN on Thursday as Sen. Katie Britt, a Republican appropriator leading talks, says she has yet to make contact with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democratic leaders.
    


            “What the Democrats want is they want to get rid of ICE. They can't do that. They don't have the votes for that. They want to defund it. They don't have the votes to do that. So what they want to do now is essentially tie ICE up and also CBP, so they can't really work,” Hawley said, adding, “That's good for nobody, except for criminals. And I am not going to help them do that.”
    


            The Missouri Republican urged lawmakers to pass the bipartisan appropriations bill that had already been negotiated by Congress, which would fund agencies like the TSA, FEMA and Coast Guard through the fiscal year.
    


            “We spent months negotiating this bill with the Democrats. So if they are serious, they'll pass this bill that they negotiated,” he continued.
    


Sen. Katie Britt, the lead GOP negotiator in the Senate on reforms to the Department of Homeland Security, blasted Democrats today for being “insincere,” saying she has yet to have a serious conversation with her Democratic counterparts a week before the deadline for a funding deal.
    


            “They've put out tweets, they held press conferences, but yet we heard nothing,” Britt told CNN. “So last night, after our attempts to have that conversation, we then, yet again, see a list of demands grow from three to 10 without any communication.”
    


            She added: “That is not the way good faith negotiations begin or end.”
    


Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican who has been central to major bipartisan negotiations like gun reform, said he does not believe this negotiation will end with DHS reforms, and instead will result in a one-year continuing resolution for the agency.
    


            Cornyn said Democrats are holding funding “hostage” over “what I would consider ridiculous demands on the administration.”
    


            “It's a non-serious demand,” Cornyn said of the Democrats' list from last night. “This is really more of a political stunt. It is not about funding ICE, it is about the midterm elections and their attempt to try and capitalize on the public's concerns about the some of the actions in Minnesota.”
    


            Cornyn said a hold out of DHS funding will have a more significant impact on TSA, FEMA and the Coast Guard than it will Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection, given that President Donald Trump's signature law from last year injected ICE and CBP with plenty of cash to fund their actions for the next fiscal year — even if Congress doesn't give them a penny more.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune blasted a Democratic list of proposed changes to Immigration and Customs Enforcement practices, saying, “There's a bunch of stuff in there that's a non-starter and they know it.”
    


            But he also signaled there are a few items that he thinks there is “room to negotiate on” and “deal space.”
    


            On the demand ICE agents not wear masks, he said that “all that does is set them up to get doxxed. There's just a bunch of stuff in there that's a non-starter and they know it. Now maybe they had to put it in there to satisfy Moveon.org or some of their special, you know, left wing special interest groups.”
    


            “There are a few things that actually there's probably some room to negotiate on. But a lot of that stuff, obviously just wasn't serious,” he added.
    


                    “It seems like they are posturing themselves in such a way that, you know, would make any sort of a middle ground virtually impossible to find, at least right now,” Thune said. “There's some room in there, you know, to negotiate. I think there's some things that could get done, but, you know, you have to have people at the table to do that. And as of right now, there's only one side of the table that's filled.”
                





            Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama is Thune's point person for the talks, but Thune said she's “reached out multiple times now to Sen. Schumer or whomever he wants to negotiate on his behalf. And it's been crickets.”
    


            Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the DHS appropriations subcommittee, which Britt chairs, said Wednesday afternoon he had not heard from Republicans to begin talks and said it's incumbent on them to reach out since they are in the majority
    


            Britt was spotted by CNN going into the Senate minority leader's office suite Wednesday, but it wasn't clear if she spoke to anyone.
    


            Thune added that it's “pretty clearly” Congress will need to pass another short-term government funding bill due to the nearing deadline and he'd probably file a bill Monday.
    


            If DHS shuts down, he will cancel a recess planned the week after next. A lot of senators in both parties are planning to attend the Munich Security Conference.
    


            “If we're we get to the end of next week and we're shutdown posture, I think that the idea of people going on trips, no matter how justified or well-intended they are, seems like they ought to be a non-starter,” he said.
    


            Senate Republican leader John Thune on Thursday said that lawmakers aren't “anywhere close” on a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security, with a short timeframe for negotiations before funding expires next Friday.
    


            “As of right now, we aren't anywhere close to having any sort of agreement that would enable us to fund the Department of Homeland Security, and so Mr. President, I would hope that the Democrats will come to the table,” he said on the Senate floor.
    


            Democrats are demanding several reforms to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, some of which Republicans have already rejected – like unmasking federal agents and requiring judicial warrants – a sign that the two sides are far apart on the issue.
    


            Thune said Senate GOP negotiators had reached out to Democrats yesterday for talks with them and the White House.
    


            “But that is not right now, even in the realm of possibility, Mr. President, because they're not engaging. We've got a now one week and one day timeframe in which to do this, which is entirely unrealistic,” Thune said on the Senate floor.
    


            Thune also insisted that “this is not a blank check situation where Republicans just agree to a list of Democrat demands.” He called for a “serious discussion” about the “climate of harassment” federal immigration officials have faced and to address the “issue of cooperation between local and federal law enforcement”
    


            “If, for some reason, the Department of Homeland Security ends up in a shutdown. It is going to be totally on them. They will own it,” he said.
    


            In its latest effort to weaken the federal workforce, the Trump administration issued a rule today that would shift an estimated 50,000 senior career staffers into a new category that would make them easier to fire.
    


            The controversial rule allows agencies to reclassify federal employees involved in policy into at-will positions that don't provide the same job protections that other career workers have. It will affect an estimated 2% of the federal workforce.
    


            The Trump administration made it clear in the rule why it created the new category, called Schedule Policy/Career.
    


                    “Agency supervisors report great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct,” it said. The new category “will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.”
                





            The rule stems from an executive order President Donald Trump signed his first day in office last year. It revives a similar executive order that Trump signed shortly before the 2020 election that created a category for federal employees involved in policy, known as Schedule F. Former President Joe Biden quickly reversed that earlier order and finalized a new rule in 2024 that further bolstered protections for career federal workers.
    


Reaction: The new rule, which rescinds the 2024 rule, quickly drew promises of a lawsuit from a coalition of more than 30 unions, advocacy groups and others, which had already sued over the 2025 executive order.
    


            The measure “allows the government to bypass existing civil service laws, strips employees of earned protections, and opens the door to politically motivated firings and hirings, which have already occurred since President Trump took office,” Democracy Forward, which is representing the organizations, said in a statement.
    


            The Wall Street Journal first reported on the rule being issued.
    


            President Donald Trump on Thursday said his Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard recently went to Fulton County, Georgia, to probe alleged ballot irregularities at Attorney General Pam Bondi's “insistence.”
    


            The president's public praise for his spy chief for her role in investigating “international cheating” into US elections comes as she has faced questions over her involvement in the controversial elections office search.
    


                    “We have our director of national and international intelligence,” Trump said at the morning's National Prayer Breakfast, adding: “She took a lot of heat because she went at Pam's insistence. She went in and she looked at votes, that want to be checked out, from Georgia.”
                





            Trump said the review was carried out at Bondi's direction, recounting how members of the media questioned the move.
    


                    “The media asked, ‘Why is she doing it? Right, Pam?'” Trump said, answering his own question: “Because Pam wanted her to do it, and you know why, because she's smart.”
                





            The president went on to praise both officials for their work.
    


            “She's done a fantastic job and Pam has done a fantastic job and we appreciate, both,” Trump said.
    


            The president's comments come after his director of national intelligence received intense criticism after she was present during the FBI search of the elections office in Georgia last week.
    


            Trump's remarks also come a day after he said “I don't know” when asked why Gabbard joined the FBI agents there.
    


Here's what a GOP congressman told CNN's John Berman earlier when asked about Gabbard: 



            President Donald Trump is launching a new direct-to-consumer prescription drug platform Thursday evening, advancing an initiative central to his efforts to alleviate Americans' affordability concerns.
    


            The website, dubbed TrumpRx, will allow cash-paying patients to directly purchase from drugmakers certain medicines at discounted prices negotiated by the Trump administration.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt touted the 7 p.m. announcement on X, saying the president will be joined by Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and National Design Studio director Joe Gebbia.
    


            Trump has touted the drug pricing push as a major step toward lowering Americans' health costs, securing deals with at least 16 pharmaceutical companies to list certain products on the TrumpRx portal.
    


            But the announcements did not provide many details on the drugs that would be available or their pricing. And it remains to be seen whether direct-to-consumer purchases will result in lower drug costs for patients willing to forgo insurance and pay cash.
    


            It could make certain medicines — particularly obesity medications that are not widely covered by job-based policies — more affordable, experts say. But many consumers could ultimately pay less if they go through their insurance.
    


            While welcoming foreign leaders at the National Prayer Breakfast, President Donald Trump singled out El Salvador President Nayib Bukele for being a “great ally,” calling him “one of my favorite people.”
    


            Trump added: “He has been so incredible. He has been such a great ally of this country.”
    


            Bukele spoke earlier at the prayer breakfast.
    


For context: The Trump administration has sent hundreds of deported migrants to El Salvador, including dozens to the country's notorious mega-prison, the Center for Terrorism Confinement, known as Cecot.
    


            Trump addressed El Salvador's prisons during his remarks, saying that Bukele “operates rather large prisons … and they do a very humane job but they're very strong prisons.”
    


            Former Cecot detainees told CNN that for months at the mega-prison, they were beaten by prison guards, shot with pellets, deprived of adequate medical care and denied any due process.
    


Watch CNN go inside the prison:



            After opening his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast by musing about making it to heaven, President Donald Trump shifted his focus to a more earthly preoccupation: his narrow House majority.
    


            Trump railed against Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie for his constant opposition to key pieces of legislation, calling the Republican lawmaker a “moron” and complaining that he'd vote against almost any bill put on the House floor.
    


            “He's an automatic ‘no' no matter what,” he said. “This guy named Thomas Massie, there's something wrong with him.”
    


            Trump also mocked Massie's chances of reelection in a race where the president has vowed to boost his primary opponent.
    


            The renewed attacks on Massie came as Trump credited Speaker Mike Johnson for navigating the GOP's slim majority in the House to pass major elements of his agenda.
    


            Trump also attacked Democrats in the early moments of his speech over their opposition to imposing strict nationwide voter ID laws, while questioning “how a person of faith can vote for a Democrat.”
    


            The president later repeated his false claims that he won the popular vote in 2016 and that his subsequent 2020 election loss to former President Joe Biden was “rigged.”
    


                    “I had to win it, needed it for my own ego,” Trump said of his failed 2020 bid, noting he finally triumphed four years later. “Now I really have a big ego though. Beating these lunatics was incredible, what a great feeling.”
                





            President Donald Trump said today he believes he will likely make it to heaven as he spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast.
    


            “I really think I probably should make it,” Trump said of his chances of entering heaven. “I mean, I'm not a perfect candidate but I did a hell of a lot of good for perfect people.”
    


            The president addressed past comments that had sparked headlines and scrutiny, saying earlier remarks suggesting he was not “heaven-bound” were made in jest.
    


            Trump said he often chooses to be “sarcastic with the media,” arguing that “they write your words,” and mocking coverage that followed his earlier comments, adding he was “just having fun.”
    


            The president's remarks come after he told reporters aboard Air Force One in October of last year, “I don't think there's anything going to get me in heaven,” while traveling to Israel.
    


            President Donald Trump is now delivering remarks at the annual National Prayer Breakfast.
    


            A number of House and Senate lawmakers are also in attendance at the event, which is being held at the Washington Hilton Hotel.
    


            The celebration, first held in 1953, used to include the breakfast, along with a separate congressional event. This year, however, it is taking place as a single gathering to continue “a tradition of fellowship and unified prayer,” according to the White House.
    


            The US said it agreed to resume high-level inter-military communication with Russia nearly five years after communication was suspended.
    


            “Maintaining dialogue between militaries is an important factor in global stability and peace, which can only be achieved through strength, and provides a means for increased transparency and de-escalation,” US European Command said in a statement. “This channel will provide a consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace.”
    


            Communication between the two militaries was suspended in 2021, a few months before the Russia-Ukraine war began, according to the release.
    


            The agreement comes following the first known trilateral talks between the US, Ukraine and Russia since the war began. They took place in Abu Dhabi last month.
    


            President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner represented the US in the talks.
    


            According to the release, the US European Command commander also met with “senior Russian and Ukrainian military officials.”

            • Tearful plea: “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie is pleading for her 84-year-old mother's safe return. She and her siblings responded yesterday ﻿by video to reports of alleged ransom notes, urging possible captors to provide proof their mother is alive and saying: “We are ready to listen.”
    


             • Still no suspects: Investigators believe Nancy Guthrie was taken from her home against her will, but there are no suspects yet, the sheriff's department said yesterday, warning that sharing unverified accusations or false information is “irresponsible.” The Pima County Sheriff's Department is expected to hold a news conference about the investigation at 1 p.m. ET.
    


            • Race against time: The search for Guthrie has entered a fifth day, further raising fears for her safety. Savannah Guthrie said her mother “lives in constant pain” and needs her prescription medication to survive.
    


            The sheriff of Pima County, Arizona, will hold a news conference on the Nancy Guthrie abduction investigation at 1 p.m. ET today.
    


            It will be the first time since Tuesday Sheriff Chris Nanos has held a formal briefing on the case, which is now in its fifth day.
    


            The FBI said today the sheriff's department remains the lead in the investigation, and the FBI will continue to provide any support needed in the case. Director Kash Patel is receiving personal updates from his team.
    


            A large law enforcement presence was seen at Guthrie's home Wednesday, carrying evidence bags.
    


            Wednesday evening, as hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil to pray for Nancy Guthrie's safe return, her children posted a video on social media with a simple plea: Please pray for our mother and bring her home.
    


            Speaking at times through tears, Savannah Guthrie described her mom as a strong, faithful woman and “God's precious daughter.”
    


            In her 2024 bestseller “Mostly What God Does,” Guthrie credits her parents for her religious upbringing and opens up about how her faith has helped her navigate some of the most difficult times in her life.
    


            “Psalm 23 is our secret code, God and me,” she writes of the famous scripture. “In those long, dark hours of tossing and turning … I summon my psalm in desperation.”
    


            Guthrie writes she's learned to find hope and comfort in the verse that proclaims, “though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil.”
    


            And she alluded to the scripture in her message to her mother Wednesday.
    


            “We believe and know that even in this valley, (God) is with you,” Guthrie said. “We pray without ceasing and we rejoice in advance for the day that we hold you in our arms again.”
    


            Nancy Guthrie's three children shared an emotional plea for her return in a video released yesterday. Here's a look at who the siblings are:
    


            Savannah Guthrie, the youngest of the three, is a journalist and author who has been a co-anchor of NBC's “Today” show since 2012, a year after she became the co-host of its third hour and a few years after she joined the network. She was born in Australia in 1971, before the family moved to Arizona. Holding a law degree, she also is NBC News' chief legal correspondent.
    


            Annie Guthrie is a writer and jeweler who has taught creative writing courses at the University of Arizona Poetry Center, according to the Arizona Commission on the Arts. She was written a book on jewelry design, as well as a book of poems, “The Good Dark.”
    


            The eldest sibling, Camron Guthrie, is a retired military pilot. In a 2018 social media post, Savannah noted he had taken his final flight as an F-16 pilot, had “flown for our country for 26 years,” and at the time was serving with the Vermont Air National Guard with the rank of colonel.
    


            At least three media outlets — TMZ and CNN Tucson affiliates KOLD and KGUN — received ransom notes this week demanding millions of dollars in bitcoin for Nancy Guthrie's safe return.
    


            While investigators have not verified the legitimacy of the notes, the request for bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, would not be unprecedented for kidnappers.
    


            Bitcoin and other digital currencies have long been a preferred payment method for criminals because the funds can be moved instantaneously around the globe without needing a bank as an intermediary. Bitcoin or other tokens can be sent from one anonymous digital wallet to another, making it difficult for law enforcement to identify the people behind the transfers. Vast money-laundering networks have expanded as crypto crime has grown more sophisticated, further hindering law enforcement.
    


            Physical crimes such as kidnapping involving crypto are also on the rise. Last year, there were more than 30 so-called “wrench attacks” involving crypto extortion, according to industry researcher Chainalysis, though it notes many of the crimes go unreported. One of those attacks made national news over the summer, when a 28-year-old crypto investor escaped from a luxury Manhattan apartment, accusing two men of holding him captive for weeks while he was beaten and threatened with death.
    


            With the modern proliferation of artificial intelligence tools and deepfake videos, the family of Nancy Guthrie — along with the investigators trying desperately to find her — are on high alert for possible forged messages from whoever took her.
    


            “You could imagine a really ugly scenario where someone could try to create a ransom note or a proof of life video that was AI generated,” CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter said this morning.
    


            Savannah Guthrie alluded to this in a video message released yesterday to whoever may be holding her mom.
    


            “We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated,” she said, adding the family needs proof Nancy Guthrie is alive.
    


            “What you hear Savannah saying there is whoever is holding her mom, you have to prove you're actually with her and that she is alive and she is OK,” Stelter said. “Provide us that content that's not AI generated, that can't be spoofed or faked.”
    


            CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe breaks down the video from Savannah Guthrie and her siblings pleading for their mom's safe return.
    


            “I feel like this is a fairly strong signal that they do not believe that they've had a legitimate ransom demand yet,” he says.
    


Watch here:



            Savannah Guthrie, flanked by her brother and sister, released a desperate plea Wednesday for their mom's safe return, calling out the 84-year-old woman's fragile health as she pleaded with whoever has Nancy Guthrie to contact them.
    


            “Our mom is a kind, faithful, loyal, fiercely loving woman of goodness and light. She has grandchildren that adore her and crowd around her and cover her with kisses. Her health, her heart is fragile,” Savannah said in the tearful video message.
    


            Nancy Guthrie is in “constant pain” and needs her medication to prevent suffering and to survive, her daughter said. She is without that medication, according to Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos.
    


            Nancy has a pacemaker, according to a source briefed on the investigation. She is “of great sound mind,” but has limited mobility and “couldn't walk 50 yards,” Nanos has said.
    


            “The clock is ticking here because the victim is so uniquely vulnerable due to her age, due to her physical ailments and things of that nature,” Andrew McCabe, CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former deputy director of the FBI, said Thursday. “The stress of being detained in the way she likely is, is just enormous for anyone, and particularly for … an older person like her.”
    


Correction: An earlier version of this post had the wrong age for Nancy Guthrie and misspelled Savannah Guthrie's first name.



            One of the key goals of the emotional video put out Wednesday night by Savannah Guthrie and her siblings is to find out whether purported ransom notes that have surfaced this week are authentic, a criminologist tells CNN.
    


            “That appeal was very strategic. It was a demand for proof of life,” Casey Jordan told CNN's Rahel Solomon on Thursday morning. “They are trying to figure out whether or not any of these ransom communications are legitimate.”
    


            The Pima County Sheriff's Department has said it does not have a suspect in the abduction of Nancy Guthrie and has very little physical evidence to go on, though Jordan noted investigators aren't always fully forthcoming.
    


            If clues really are that sparse, it is a sign of how elaborate the kidnapping was, she said.
    


            “It's a sophisticated, well-planned abduction,” Jordan said. “Whether the notes are from the captors or not, the bottom line is there are no footprints, there are no tire tracks, there is no video footage.”
    


            CNN's Erin Burnett speaks with KOLD anchor Mary Coleman, who describes how her station received a possible ransom note via email in connection to Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.

            An increased law enforcement presence was seen outside Nancy Guthrie's home Wednesday as detectives conducted a “follow-up” at the property and in the neighborhood, the Pima County Sheriff's Office said.
    


            Crime scene tape went up across the entire length of the property and about a dozen officers were at the scene for about two hours. They could be seen carrying evidence bags into the house and appeared to bring some of them back outside and loaded them into a vehicle, CNN's Ed Lavandera reported.
    


            The law enforcement presence, which included FBI agents, eventually cleared. Sniffing dogs were also on the scene, CNN affiliate KXNV reported.
    


            While questions swirl over why law enforcement officers returned to the scene, security experts have said it is not uncommon for detectives to return to the main location of a crime during investigations.
    


            Authorities are also looking into a possible recent trespassing that occurred near the 84-year-old's home, as well as “all other cases within a close radius” to the residence, sheriff's officials  said in an update Wednesday.
    


            Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said Nancy's daughter, ‘Today” show anchor Savannah Guthrie, “has a security team” that has been staying in touch with the sheriff's department.
    


            Nancy Guthrie's home has been turned back over to her family.
    


            As the search for Nancy Guthrie stretches into a fifth day, the stakes are getting higher for investigators racing to find the 84-year-old mother of popular “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie.



            The beloved mother and grandmother, who needs crucial medication daily, was last seen at her home in the Catalina Foothills near Tucson Saturday night. In a wrenching video shared Wednesday evening, her three children pleaded for their missing mother's safe return.
    


            As detectives continue to comb through evidence in the apparent abduction, they are also facing questions over alleged ransom notes and a deluge of rumors on social media.
    


            Here are some key questions in the investigation:
    


            Perched along the Santa Catalina Mountains, the Catalina Hills community where Nancy Guthrie lives is known for outdoor activities, not crime scene investigations.
    


            Homes in the desert community are spaced out and tucked away behind desert foliage, according to Nancy Guthrie's neighbor, Jeff Lamie, and the quality of life is, as the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show anchor Savannah Guthrie has described, “laid back and gentle.”
    


            “I like to watch the javelinas eat my plants,” Savannah Guthrie once said, referring to pig-looking animals that are often seen in the area.
    


            The family relocated to Arizona from Australia, where Savannah was born, and where Nancy's husband, Charles Guthrie, worked as a mining engineer.
    


            In 1988, Charles died of a heart attack when Savannah was just 16 years old, a moment that the anchor told NBC tore her “whole world apart.”
    


            Savannah, the youngest of three siblings, stayed in Arizona for college, attending the University of Arizona. Her sister, Annie Guthrie, didn't wander far either.
    


                    “We had a spoken or unspoken pact that on the weekends, even though we were college girls, one of us would always stay home on one of the weekend nights so that my mom wouldn't be alone,” Savannah said in 2017.  
                





            In a “Today” show segment about her Tucson roots last fall, one of many times the host featured her mom on the show, the NBC host called herself a “daughter of the desert.”
    


                    “When I go back I'm so — it's like my whole soul is home, my spirit is home, I feel my father in the wind,” Savannah said when introducing the segment. “The desert, the cactus, the animals: It's such a unique place, it's a beautiful place to visit.”
                





            Arizona's Pima County Sheriff says they are not dismissing unverified ransom notes that were sent to multiple media outlets in the Nancy Guthrie case. CNN's Ed Lavandera reports.

            Hundreds of people from the Tucson, Arizona, community gathered at a church Wednesday night for a candlelight service to pray for Nancy Guthrie's safe return, CNN affiliate KOLD reported.
    


            “What is happening is heart-wrenching and this community needed this,” Sally Shamrell, a friend of Nancy's daughter Savannah Guthrie, who helped put together the service, told KOLD.
    


            In a statement on her social media accounts Tuesday, “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie spoke of her mother's faith and asked supporters to “raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in the very moment.”
    


            After the service at St. Philip's in the Hills Episcopal Church, attendees placed candles on the altar as a symbol of the community's prayers.
    


            “It's to show that we are still hopeful, and I do believe in the power of prayer,” Guthrie family friend Cindy Klingberg told the outlet.
    


                    “We don't know her, but … we wanted to show the support that Tucson has for her in the community,” attendee Brian Salado said.
                





            As Nancy Guthrie's children make a tearful plea for her safe return, a middle-of-the-night ping from her pacemaker is providing clues about when she could have been taken from her secluded Arizona home last weekend.
    


            In a video Wednesday, Savannah Guthrie issued a response to possible ransom notes and pleaded with potential captors: “We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen. Please reach out to us.”
    


            But, the “Today” host said, the family needs proof their 84-year-old mother is alive, because “we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated.”
    


            Authorities are scheduled to address reporters at 1 p.m. ET today. Here's the latest in the investigation: 



            Investigators searching for Nancy Guthrie have encountered several key challenges in the days since the 84-year-old mother of “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie went missing, suspected of being taken from her home.
    


Here are some of the challenges:



            President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he is directing “ALL Federal Law Enforcement” to help the Guthrie family and local law enforcement in Arizona in finding Nancy Guthrie.
    


                    “I spoke with Savannah Guthrie, and let her know that I am directing ALL Federal Law Enforcement to be at the family's, and Local Law Enforcement's, complete disposal, IMMEDIATELY. We are deploying all resources to get her mother home safely,” he wrote on Truth Social.

President Donald Trump joked during Thursday's National Prayer Breakfast that he can't sleep on planes because he's busy watching for "missiles and enemies."

President Donald Trump quipped during his speech at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, "I don't sleep on planes. I don't like sleeping on planes. You know. I like looking out the window, watching for missiles and enemies, actually," Trump said on Thursday, drawing laughter from the crowd. 

Trump joined the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday morning, which pulls together bipartisan lawmakers, business leaders and foreign dignitaries to reflect on faith and prayer for the nation. It was the sixth time Trump has attended the event since his first administration in 2017. 

The president has long been known to avoid sleeping while flying on Air Force One. His quip about looking for missiles came as he recounted first meeting Daniel "Raizin" Caine, who now serves as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about defeating ISIS during his first term.

Caine told Trump that an area had been prepared for him to nap during the 20-hour journey, which Trump refused so the pair could discuss strategies to wipe out ISIS.

"I said, 'What's your first name?' ‘Raizin, sir. They call me Raizin.' And I say, ‘what the hell kind of a name is that? Right?'" Trump joked.

"He's brutal. Just ask Venezuela. Ask Iran. They're negotiating now. They don't want to. They don't want us to hit them. You know, we have a big fleet going over to Iran. But so Razin was there at the bottom of the plane," he said. 

Trump continued his speech by taking a victory lap for the strength of the U.S. military under his second term, including capturing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and striking Iran's nuclear facilities.

"Two years ago, you couldn't get anybody to go into the military. They laughed at you and they said they didn't respect our country. They didn't respect our president. They thought he was a joke. They thought our country was a joke," Trump said.

"Other countries laughed at us and took advantage of us with tariffs. And we weren't allowed to charge, and they were allowed to charge. But we are allowed to charge, and I hope we get that Supreme Court decision, because we have taken in hundreds of billions of dollars of money."

"They declared that all of us are made free and equal by the hand of our Creator," Trump said of the Founding Fathers in 1776. "A lot of presidents refuse to say that. They refuse to say that. . . . Some refuse. Some major politicians refuse to say the word ‘God.' They don't want to say it. I say it, that we are endowed with our sacred rights to life, liberty, and not by government, but by God Almighty himself."

            The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Thursday that Russia's Starlink satellite internet terminals in Ukraine have been “cut off,” disrupting Russian military communications.
    


            Ukrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said SpaceX, which owns Starlink, is working with Ukraine to update a “whitelist” of approved and verified Starlink terminals, while unapproved Russian systems have been blocked.
    


            “The Starlink terminals added to the ‘whitelist' are working. The Russians' terminals have already been blocked,” Fedorov said in a statement Thursday. “We continue to verify Starlink terminals. The first batch of terminals that made it onto the ‘whitelist' are already operational.”
    


            A source at the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces claimed that “all Russian Starlinks have been cut off” along the front line as of Thursday evening local time.
    


            Under US sanctions, Starlink cannot be sold to or used by Russia. However, analysts and Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia has increasingly been finding ways to leverage the system to its own advantage. CNN previously reported on Russia's practice of mounting Starlink systems on its attack drones, which allow the weapons to bypass Ukraine's electronic defenses that disable drones by jamming GPS and radio signals, and to strike deeper into the country.
    


            Ukraine has also relied heavily on Starlink since the beginning the war, using it to operate military communications and drones, as well as information systems for public institutions like hospitals and schools.
    


            “The enemy on the front lines is facing not just a problem, but a catastrophe. All command and control of the troops has collapsed. Assault operations have been halted in many areas,” said Serhii Beskrestnov, an adviser to the defense minister.
    


            Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, said earlier this week that it was taking steps to stop Russia's “unauthorized” use of the Starlink satellite internet constellation. Musk reiterated Thursday that it's “important to register your Starlink terminal if in Ukraine.”
    


            Russia's Ministry of Defense has not addressed the claims of Starlink disruptions.
    


            But Russian military bloggers began commenting on the Starlink outages on Wednesday and Thursday, noting that Russia's internet and communications capabilities on the front line have taken a hit.

            One pro-Kremlin military blogger, Boris Rozhin, wrote a Q&A-style post on Telegram, saying, “Yes, it will have a certain impact on internet availability in the field,” and “yes, there are no alternatives at all, right now.” He also claimed that Russian forces were working to bypass the block and to bring high-speed internet to the field using other methods.
    


            Another Russian military blog, which supports the airborne special forces, tried to downplay the disruption, writing: “The Starlinks may have been shut down, but the backup communications are still there. The radios are working, and there's communication between the positions.”
    


            Some Starlink units used by the Ukrainian side were also reportedly cut off, although it's unclear how widespread the disruption is, as the government continues the whitelisting process.
    


            One Ukrainian combat officer, Tetiana Chornovol, posted on social media that “the shutdown of Starlink left my two combat positions without communication,” adding that her unit has since brought in an alternative communication system.
    


            “It works for us,” a Ukrainian drone pilot said in a video posted to Telegram. “We immediately registered our Starlink terminal, and everything is fine.”
    


            Meanwhile, the second round of trilateral talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States concluded in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.
    


            Ukrainian presidential chief of staff Kyrylo Budanov, who was part of his country's delegation, described the negotiations as “truly constructive.”
    


            “I am grateful to the US and the UAE for their high-quality organization and mediation,” Budanov told the Ukrainian news agency RBC-Ukraine.
    


            While no breakthrough deal came out of the two days of talks, Russia and Ukraine did agree to conduct their first prisoner exchange since October. Each returned 157 prisoners of war to the other side on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS and US negotiator Steve Witkoff.
    


            “While significant work remains, steps like this demonstrate that sustained diplomatic engagement is delivering tangible results and advancing efforts to end the war in Ukraine,” Witkoff said Thursday in a post on X.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the negotiators agreed to hold another round of talks “in the near future.”

Asked if he will remove Kristi Noem as DHS secretary, President Trump on Thursday said 'No...We have the strongest border in the history of our country.'

A majority of voters say Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem should be removed from her job, according to a new national poll.

Fifty-eight percent of those questioned in a Quinnipiac University survey in the field from Jan. 29 to Feb. 2 said it's time for Noem to go, with 34% saying she should remain on the job.

The survey was conducted amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and in the wake of two fatal shootings by federal agents of U.S. citizens in Minnesota who were opposing the administration's aggressive deportation efforts.

In the immediate aftermath of the second shooting last month of Alex Pretti, who at the time was legally armed with a handgun, Noem claimed Pretti was threatening federal agents and labeled his actions "domestic terrorism."

But videos of the shooting depicted Pretti, an ICU nurse at a VA Hospital, appearing to attend to a woman whom agents had knocked down when he was sprayed with an irritant, pushed to the ground and beaten. On the ground, bystanders said he was brandishing a cell phone rather than his weapon, and an agent was seen pulling Pretti's gun from his waistband before other agents fired several shots and killed him.

The Trump administration has faced mounting criticism and political backlash, with some top Democrats in Congress and at least two Republican senators — Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — calling on Noem to be removed.

But Trump is standing by Noem, saying in a social media post last Friday that she "has done a really GREAT JOB!"

And on Thursday, during remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump reiterated that he's not removing Noem. 

"Why would I do that? We have the strongest border in the history of our country. We have the best crime numbers we've ever had going back to the year 1900. That's 125 years. We have the lowest crime numbers," the president emphasized.

Noem, in an interview last week on Fox News' "Hannity," argued that "radicals" are behind the calls for her to be fired.

"These radicals are attacking me, but I'm just doing my job. I'm following the law, enforcing the laws like President Trump promised that he would do to keep people safe in this country," she told Fox News' host Sean Hannity.

And taking aim at Democratic leaders in Minnesota, Noem charged Wednesday in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital along the U.S.-Mexico border that "the way that it has been in Minneapolis is largely due to the rhetoric. And the actions of the leadership there because they won't partner with the federal government to enforce the law." 

TRUMP LAMENTS SHOOTING DEATHS OF GOOD AND PRETTI, INSISTS MINNESOTA PERSONNEL SHUFFLE IS NOT A 'PULLBACK'

The Quinnipiac poll spotlights a massive partisan divide over Noem, with 91% of Democrats and 63% of Independents but just 17% of Republicans saying she should be removed as DHS secretary.

The Quinnipiac survey also indicates a drop in the president's approval of how he's handling the immigration issue.

Trump's approval on immigration stands at 38% in the Quinnipiac poll, down from 44% in mid-December, the last time they asked the question.

The latest Fox News national poll, conducted Jan. 23–26, indicates the president's approval on handling border security at 52%-47%, but his approval on immigration is underwater at 45%-55%.

The Trump administration on Wednesday announced it was removing 700 of the roughly 3,000 federal immigration agents in Minnesota.

And Trump, in an NBC News interview, said immigration agents should be using a "softer touch."

"I learned that maybe we could use a little bit of a softer touch," Trump said. "But you still have to be tough."

            A crowded primary in the New Jersey suburbs Thursday has become an early testing ground for the debates that will shape the Democratic push to retake the US House in this year's midterms.
    


            The race to replace now-Gov. Mikie Sherrill has drawn a range of candidates – local elected officials, community advocates, a former paratrooper, a former lieutenant governor and a former congressman.
    


            Democrats continue to grapple with how best to motivate their base and win back voters who've drifted away. National Democratic officials have drilled down on cost-of-living issues, while progressives and grassroots activists have criticized party leaders, arguing their opposition to President Donald Trump has been anemic.
    


            In the reliably blue 11th District, candidates have taken the latter approach. They've railed against immigration enforcement, condemned the deaths of two Minneapolis protesters shot by federal agents and bemoaned the erosion of democratic norms.
    


            Other familiar themes are at play in Thursday's Democratic primary, including the power of the Democratic establishment and the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and other well-funded outside groups.
    


            Four candidates have emerged as perceived front-runners: Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, former New Jersey Rep. Tom Malinowski, former New Jersey Working Families Alliance leader Analilia Mejia, and former Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way.
    


            “For each of those four people, I could give you a list of reasons why they will win and a list of reasons why they won't,” said Laura Matos, a New Jersey-based Democratic strategist. “It really comes down to who turns out to vote, and which candidate brings their voters out.”
    


            The rest of the field includes former paratrooper Zach Beecher; community advocate, lawyer and comedian J-L Cauvin; Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett; Cammie Croft, who worked in the Obama administration; Jeff Grayzel, a two-term mayor of Morris Township; Chatham Borough Council Member Justin Strickland; and community advocate Anna Lee Williams.
    


            Once a Republican stronghold, Democrats have held the 11th District – which includes parts of northern New Jersey's Essex, Morris and Passaic counties – since Sherrill flipped the seat in 2018. The district shifted further left in 2022 after redistricting.
    


            Whoever wins Thursday's primary will be the odds-on favorite to win the April 16 general election against the lone Republican candidate, former mayor of Randolph Township Joe Hathaway. They'll also have an edge in the June primary for a full term beginning in January.
    


            Leading into Thursday's vote, the candidates have called on their party to take on a more confrontational stance in Washington, particularly towards US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Several candidates argued the agency should be defunded.
    


            “We see what's going on out in Minnesota,” said Way, the former lieutenant governor and secretary of state. “Totally unacceptable, unconstitutional and un-American, with the ICE raids, but also trying to extort personal data off of the voter rolls.”
    


            Way noted her own fights against Republicans who sued to access New Jersey's voter data as an example of her record pushing back on the administration.
    


            Gill has pointed to his experience as both an elected official and former congressional staffer, as well as his work with his local Democratic Party, which organized a “No Kings” protest.
    


            “I think I have, at certain times, felt that we needed to be more aggressive in our pushback against what's coming out of Washington,” he said, arguing Democrats should have rejected more of Trump's political appointees.
    


            Mejia, a longtime Democratic activist who served as the national political director for independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, said she was drawn to enter the race after Democrats ended last year's government shutdown without securing an extension of the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax subsidies.
    


            “Like many Democrats in this moment, I am not only appalled at MAGA, at Trumpism, at Donald Trump's administration – their overreach, their corruption, their blatant hypocrisy – but I'm also ticked off at my own Democratic leadership,” she said.
    


            Mejia has solidified her position in the progressive lane with endorsements from Sanders, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others. But she has trailed on the money front – she's sixth in fundraising, well behind Malinowski and Gill.
    


            “What I hope we will see on Thursday, is regular, everyday voters reclaiming the drive, tone, tenor, focus of our own party,” Mejia said.
    


            Malinowski, who flipped New Jersey's 7th District during the 2018 wave but lost his 2022 reelection bid, has argued he's the only who has already pushed back on Trump in Congress. He would retain his seniority in Congress.
    


            “I think voters have been drawn to our campaign because I can credibly argue that I'll be effective on the day I'm sworn in,” he said in an interview.
    


            His background as a former congressman has been both a benefit and a minor liability. He has led the field in fundraising and has broader name recognition thanks to his years as a swing-district lawmaker. But he's also been subject to attack ads over his failure to properly disclose his stock trades while in office. United Democracy Project, a group aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, has spent more than $1.7 million on TV ads attacking Malinowski, according to AdImpact.
    


            The group has highlighted his stock trading and sought to tie him to Trump, pointing to his vote for a bipartisan 2019 omnibus spending bill that include funding for ICE. Malinowski has been vocal about what he called the agency's “unlawful and despicable” enforcement operations, and called the attack “outrageous.”
    


            “It's our goal to build the largest bipartisan pro-Israel majority in Congress,” said Patrick Dorton, a spokesperson for the United Democracy Project. “We think there are better candidates than Tom Malinowski on the US-Israel relationship in the NJ-11 race.”
    


            Gill has also laid into Malinowski over the disclosure issue, arguing the controversy contributed to his 2022 loss to Republican Tom Kean Jr. The county commissioner, who launched his own campaign outside his childhood home in the district, has also knocked Malinowski for switching districts.
    


            “I'm drawing a contrast,” Gill said. “Those are decisions that he made as a member of Congress that cost us that seat and that's why I have an issue, quite frankly, with the nature of this candidacy, where he deserted and left the people that he represented in District 7.”
    


            While in office, Malinowski described his failure to disclose his trades on time as “a matter of carelessness on my part, which I regret and take full responsibility for,” according to a report from the former Office of Congressional Ethics. The House Ethics Committee's investigation into his stock trade disclosures ended when Malinowski left office and would need to be reopened by the committee to continue.
    


            Malinowski said the attacks on stock trading Gill has raised in this race mirror those Republicans made against him in 2022. He also raised concerns about the late infusion of spending against him, prompted by AIPAC's opposition to his willingness to place conditions on aid to Israel. The former congressman previously had the group's support.
    


            “Their goal is to intimidate the Democratic Party,” he said. “If it works here, we're going to see the same play in multiple other Democratic primaries. If we stop it here, the party will be more immune.”

Former SJSU volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser revealed to Fox News Digital she developed severe anorexia and sleep issues, she says was due to a national controversy over her trans teammate.

The parents of former San Jose State University volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser made their first public statement since the U.S. Department of Education determined the school violated Title IX while Slusser was enrolled. Slusser emerged as the central figure opposing the university during a 2024 scandal involving trans athlete Blaire Fleming. 

Slusser filed a lawsuit against representatives of SJSU and the Mountain West Conference after she allegedly was made to share a bedroom and changing spaces with Fleming without being told of Fleming's biological sex. The Education Department concluded that the trans athlete conspired with an opposing player to have an SJSU teammate, presumably Slusser, spiked in the face during a match. 

Slusser's parents, Paul and Kim Slusser, provided a joint statement to Fox News Digital addressing the crackdown on the university.

"We're thrilled that the Trump administration, Secretary McMahon, and the Department of Education are taking action on the issue of men in women's sports—something the last administration did not do! San Jose State University completely failed its female athletes, and it's about time they're held accountable," the statement read.

"We're watching closely to see how they respond, and our next step is to fight for justice in court. San Jose State and the Mountain West Conference betrayed the volleyball team, and they will have to answer for it."

The parents had to watch their daughter endure an eating disorder and an academic setback as a result of the trauma from the scandal. 

"I went from around 160 to 128 [pounds] in that one semester. It definitely isn't healthy for someone of my size to be that weight, and I ended up losing my menstrual cycle for nine months. So it was definitely severe," the 5-foot-11 Slusser previously told Fox News Digital.

After the 2024 season and fall semester ended, Slusser's parents saw the physical impact the situation took on her, and demanded she come home to Texas. 

"As soon as the season was over, she came home for Christmas, and we were like, 'You're not going back,'" Paul Slusser previously told Fox News Digital, adding that he told his daughter, "You can go get your stuff next summer when your lease is up, and stay here."

Once winter break was over, and what was supposed to be her final semester began, Brooke attempted to complete her courses online.

Her parents said she began online classes, but dropped them shortly later. As a Division I scholarship athlete, dropping the classes resulted in her losing the scholarship, and her family had to pay for the full semester's worth of tuition and her housing out of pocket. 

"We had to pay, basically her mortgage and her apartment for the rest of the semester. So it was a pretty large financial burden on us when that happened," Paul Slusser said. 

The Education Department gave SJSU an ultimatum to comply with a series of agreements or risk "imminent enforcement action." The deadline is Feb. 11, 2026.

The terms include:

SJSU responded to the ultimatum in a statement.

"San Jose State, a member of the California State University system, received notification from the federal Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights regarding its investigation into athletics participation on our past women's volleyball teams. The Department informed the University of the outcome of its investigation and its findings. The University is in the process of reviewing the Department's findings and proposed resolution agreement," an SJSU statement said. 

"We remain committed to providing a safe, respectful, and inclusive educational environment for all students while complying with applicable laws and regulations."

            Kamala Harris is relaunching — part of her social media presence.
    


            The former vice president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee on Thursday rebooted the KamalaHQ account, which has over 1 million followers on X and more than 5 million on TikTok, as just Headquarters, which in a partnership with the left-leaning People for the American Way she's calling “an online organizing project for next generation campaigning.”
    


            “Conservatives build permanent organizing infrastructure. Progressives have historically built machines that dismantle after Election Day. Headquarters is the end of that cycle,” reads a press release from the new group, which also now plans to post on Substack, YouTube and other platforms.
    


            “It's where you can go online to get the latest of what's going on, and also to meet and revisit with some of our great and courageous leaders — be they elected leaders, community leaders, civic leaders, faith leaders, young leaders. I'm really excited about it. Stay engaged, and I'll see you out there,” Harris says in a video recorded for the launch.
    


            Harris recently began a second leg of touring around her best-selling campaign memoir that is less about recounting the stories in “107 Days” and more geared to her interest in talking about what she thinks needs to happen next. Though Harris says she﻿ has stepped out of politics for the moment, she has left the door open to another presidential run.
    


            So far, Harris has been talking regularly about how both Democrats and Republicans failed people, so that, as she put it in a speech to the Democratic National Committee meeting in Los Angeles in December, “The American dream has become more of a myth than reality.”
    


            “Government is viewed as fundamentally unable to meet the needs of its people. In these and so many other ways, the people feel that the very institutions that were designed to support them have failed them,” Harris said then. “They are not wrong.”
    


            Harris will have an honorary role in Headquarters as chair emerita, with a group of advisers and operatives drawn from both her campaign alumni and People for the American Way, including her top senior adviser Kirsten Allen and Rob Flaherty, who served as deputy campaign manager for Joe Biden and then Harris in 2024. Parker Butler and Lauren Kapp, who led the KamalaHQ team in 2024, will remain involved.
    


            Harris will not have editorial oversight of the posts, according to the new group, leaving those to the advisers and People for the American Way. She will, though, continue on her book tour through the spring.

            Inside the Grand Theatre Lumiere, one of cinema's great cathedrals in Cannes, France, Akinola Davies Jr. stood, acknowledging the applause of over 2,000 peers. The British Nigerian director had just received a commendation from the jury for his first feature, “My Father's Shadow,” a breakthrough not just for him, but for a nation.
    


            “Overwhelmed and overjoyed” was how Davies Jr. remembered the moment. He'd seen photographs of previous Cannes Film Festivals; the premieres, the awards, the standing ovations. “I don't think it ever pops into your head that's what yours will be like.”
    


            Last May, “My Father's Shadow” became the first Nigerian film to feature in the festival's official selection, planting a flag for Africa's most populous country and the world's second most prolific moviemaking nation. Nine months, many garlands and one Nigerian homecoming later, the film is releasing in cinemas in UK on February 6 and the US on February 13.
    


            A soulful, semi-autobiographical tale of paternal estrangement and loss directed by Davies Jr. and written with his brother Wale Davies, the film stars British Nigerian actor Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù (“Slow Horses”) as the titular father, who takes his two sons to Lagos in the aftermath of the 1993 Nigerian general election.
    


            The Davies brothers lost their father when they were young, a tragedy channeled into Wale Davies' screenplay, conceived over a decade ago. The story is a devastating act of wish fulfillment: a rare day of bonding between two boys and their father, subtly conveying the sacrifices he's made to support his family, and trying to impart some wisdom along the way.
    


            “I remember reading it in bed and weeping,” Davies Jr. told CNN, in one of his first interviews about the film, at Cannes last year.
    


            “When you experience loss, you just face it front on … to have a short story that considers a different perspective, and mining that loss, I found extremely emotional.”
    


            The father in their film, Folarin, was partly inspired by their own. Friends and family would share stories about their father, said Davies Jr. “It was good and bad in a way, because it's exciting to hear these stories. But equally, they had the stories and we didn't.”
    


            “The film at its core is about memory … How do you know what is memory and what was told to you? After a period of time, it all becomes enmeshed into one.”
    


            After the success of their BAFTA-nominated 2020 short film “Lizard,” the brothers received production backing to make “My Father's Shadow” from the UK, Ireland and Nigeria, including BBC Films, Element Pictures and Fatherland Productions, a company run by the Davies brothers and producer Funmbi Ogunbanwo out of Lagos.
    


            The Nigerian British coproduction was shot on location in 2024, with a predominantly Nigerian and diaspora cast and crew.
    


            Shooting in Lagos was “like climbing a mountain every day,” said Davies Jr., but the city was indispensable to the story. “I wanted to capture the essence of the city from a very grounded level,” said the director. “A lot of people see the high end, nouveau riche aspects of Lagos, but what is really the lifeblood of the city is how working-class people move and operate within (it).”
    


            The production scouted sites with old infrastructure befitting the 1993 setting, including Balogun market, the National Theatre and Apapa Amusement Park, shooting in two states and nearly a dozen and half locations.
    


            “In the film there's a line, ‘Nigeria is hard' — and it is a hard country (to film in),” said producer Rachel Dargavel of Element Pictures, Irish powerhouse producers behind “Normal People” and many of Yorgos Lanthimos' films. “There were things that would happen on a day-to-day basis (that) blew my mind. But for Funmbi and her team, that's something that they deal with when they're shooting productions.”
    


            “I don't think we would have the film we have, had I parachuted in with my European crew,” she added. “I think we would have failed.”
    


            The production involved members of the local community, said Ogunbanwo. For each location, “leave this (space) slightly better than we met it,” was the ethos, she said. “I think that gave us a certain level of access which was unprecedented,” Davies Jr. added.
    


            As accurate as the setting might've been, the film would not work without its three central performances.
    


            Spearheading the film is Dìrísù's quiet and powerful turn as the patriarch. “Folarin is not their father,” the actor stressed, referring to the Davies, though the role came with significant responsibilities.
    


            “I still wanted to honor fatherhood, and honor what it meant to be a Nigerian father, specifically in that time. The weight of expectation of being the head of your household, the main provider, and the difficulties that come with that is a really interesting conversation about masculinity — both general masculinity and African masculinity — in the film.”
    


            It was the first time the actor had worked in Nigeria. “I felt such pride in returning to the country; to be able to contribute to the cultural tapestry,” he said. “The history of Nigerian cinema is deep and rich, so to have contributed to that really edifies my sense ﻿of Nigerian-ness.”
    


            Dìrísù was paired with Chibuike Marvellous Egbo and Godwin Egbo as Folarin's sons Aki and Remi. The real-life brothers were making their screen debuts at nine and 11 years old at the time of filming. “Finding them was a feat, because we went through over 200 boys,” Ogunbanwo recalled.
    


            “We first met in rehearsals on my second or third day,” said Dìrísù, who said he inadvertently took on the role of a surrogate father off-screen during the shoot. “It's remarkable the journey they went on as performers, considering that they'd never acted before.”
    

While Nigeria has long been known for Nollywood, the industry has never had a film make it into the Cannes Film Festival's prestigious Official Selection. That changed this year with the film "My Father's Shadow." 


Nigeria's film debut at the Cannes Film Festival



            The family drama is set against the 1993 election, which military leader Ibrahim Babangida annulled, snatching away an expected victory for Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola of the Social Democratic Party. Civilian rule of Nigeria was put on hold.
    


            “My dad was a journalist at the time and he raced back home … turned on the TV and cried. That's not something you forget,” said Ogunbanwo.
    


            Loss permeates “My Father's Shadow,” which reckons with Nigeria's past in ways rarely seen in the nation's cinema. It is sad, serious and tender. Texturally, tonally, the film is a world away from the prevailing image of Nigeria on screen; one still largely defined by the action and melodrama of Nollywood.
    


            But times are changing. The country is going through a quiet revolution, with a growing cohort of independent filmmakers gaining traction with arthouse titles. In recent years, Nigeria accomplished a list of firsts, with films premiering in competition at festivals in Berlin, Sundance and now Cannes, each time bringing a different perspective to the big screen.
    


            The outstanding question is whether these films can find an audience back in Nigeria, a nation with few theaters and rampant piracy — obstacles to independent cinema's sustainability.
    


            “My Father's Shadow” debuted in Nigerian cinemas last September, packing screens in Lagos and Abuja.
    


            “What really took me aback was a lot of the engagement and conversation made around the film, with people speaking to their parents about what happened in '93,” said Davies Jr.
    


            “My Father's Shadow” made stops at major film festivals in Toronto, London and Busan last fall. It was submitted by the UK for best international feature film at the Academy Awards and received 12 nominations at the British Independent Film Awards (Davies Jr. won best director). At the Gotham awards in the US, Davies Jr. won best breakthrough director and Dìrísù won outstanding lead performance, and at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January, Variety magazine named Davies Jr. as a director to watch. At this month's BAFTA awards, the brothers are nominated for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer.
    


            The film also picked up awards at festivals in India, China and Morocco. Davies Jr. said he was particularly proud of the love the film has received in the Global South.
    


            The past few months have been “topsy turvy” and the accolades “wonderful,” said the director, who describes himself as “quite a sensitive person” at heart.
    


            “Fundamentally, this film has been incredible in terms of building my profile as a director,” he said.
    


            “It's been incredible at showing my crew and my team what they're capable of in the right circumstances. It's a reminder that film is not a singular undertaking, it takes a group and community. And I'm just really proud of that.”

NBC “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie said her family is ready to talk to people holding their mother, but they want to see proof that she is alive. Nancy Guthrie was last seen Saturday around 9:45 p.m. when she was dropped off at home by family.

A vigil was held late Wednesday for the missing mother of NBC “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie at St. Philip's in the Hills Episcopal Church in Tucson, Arizona.

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — NBC “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie sent a public message to her 84-year-old mother's kidnapper on Wednesday saying that her family is ready to talk but wants proof that she is alive.

Guthrie said in a recorded video posted on social media that her family has heard media reports about a ransom letter for Nancy Guthrie, who authorities believe was taken from her home in Arizona against her will.

“We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated,” Savannah Guthrie said while reading from a prepared statement. “We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen. Please reach out to us.”

She was last seen around 9:45 p.m. Saturday, when she was dropped off at home by family after having dinner with them, the sheriff's department said. She was reported missing midday Sunday after she didn't appear at a church. 

The family posted the message after police conducted a search in and around Nancy Guthrie's home for several hours Wednesday.

Kevin Adger, a spokesperson for the Pima County Sheriff's Department, said investigators had been at the home earlier in the week for a couple of days and then turned it back over to the family with the understanding they could go back if they needed to.

“This is a follow up investigation,” he said in reference to officials returning Wednesday.




Adger said the sheriff's department was not commenting on the video released by the family.

Multiple media organizations reported receiving purported ransom notes Tuesday that they handed over to investigators. The sheriff's department had said it was taking the notes and other tips seriously but declined to comment further.

Savannah Guthrie was at times emotional during the recording, with her voice cracking. She smiled and looked into the camera when addressing her mother directly, saying that the family was praying for her and that people were looking for her. 

“Mommy, if you are hearing this, you are a strong woman. You are God's precious daughter,” she said.

Savannah Guthrie described her mother as a “kind, faithful, loyal, fiercely loving woman of goodness and light” and said she was funny, spunky and clever. 

“Talk to her and you'll see,” she said. 

Guthrie was flanked by her sister Annie and her brother Camron who both also spoke. Annie called their mother their beacon and said they need her.

“Mamma, If you're listening, we need you to come home. We miss you,” Annie Guthrie said. 

Authorities on Wednesday offered no detailed update on their search. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos' office said detectives still were speaking with anyone who had contact with Nancy Guthrie last weekend but that no suspect or person of interest had been identified. 

Nanos suggested there was video from some cameras, though he didn't elaborate, adding: “That's all been submitted and we're doing our best with the companies that own those cameras or built those cameras.”

There were signs of forced entry at the home in the Catalina Foothills neighborhood. Guthrie has limited mobility, and officials do not believe she left on her own. A sheriff's dispatcher talking to deputies during a search Sunday indicated that she has high blood pressure, a pacemaker and heart issues, according to audio from broadcastify.com.

Jim Mason, longtime commander of a search-and-rescue posse in Maricopa County, isn't involved in the search for Guthrie but said desert terrain can make looking for missing people difficult. He said it can be hard to peer into areas that are dense with mesquite trees, cholla cactus and other desert brush.

“Some of it is so thick you can't drive through it,” Mason said.

A couple hundred people attended an evening vigil for Nancy Guthrie at a Tucson church where they heard prayers and placed lit candles on an altar. A priest prayed for God to comfort Guthrie and to bring her home to those she loves.

Afterward, Jeremy Thacker had tears in his eyes as he described the heartbreak and helplessness he was experiencing over Guthrie's disappearance. He worked with Savannah Guthrie at a local news station and they shared losing their fathers at a young age. His own sister was kidnapped when he was young.

Thacker said he knew Nancy Guthrie to be sharp, grounded and earnest.

“We're all holding our breath,” Thacker said.

On the other side of the country, Victory Church in Albany, New York, said it's offering a $25,000 reward for information that leads to finding Nancy Guthrie.

“Me and my wife, we watch Savannah every single morning. We've heard of her faith. We've heard of her mom's faith. And she's got such a sweet spirit,” Pastor Charlie Muller said.

The White House said President Donald Trump called and spoke with Savannah Guthrie on Wednesday.

“I spoke with Savannah Guthrie, and let her know that I am directing ALL Federal Law Enforcement to be at the family's, and Local Law Enforcement's, complete disposal, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “We are deploying all resources to get her mother home safely.”

For a third day, “Today” opened with Guthrie's disappearance, but Savannah Guthrie was not at the anchor's desk. NBC Sports said Tuesday that she will not be covering the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics “as she focuses on being with her family during this difficult time.”

The “Today” host grew up in Tucson, graduated from the University of Arizona and previously worked as a reporter and anchor at Tucson television station KVOA. Her parents settled in Tucson in the 1970s when she was a young child. The youngest of three siblings, she credits her mom with holding their family together after her father died of a heart attack at 49, when Savannah was just 16.

NEW YORK (AP) — Nude photos. The names and faces of sexual abuse victims. Bank account and Social Security numbers in full view. 

All of these things appeared in the mountain of documents released Friday by the U.S. Justice Department as part of its effort to comply with a law requiring it to open its investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein.

That law was intended to preserve important privacy protections for Epstein's victims. Their names were supposed to have been blacked out in documents. Their faces and bodies were supposed to be obscured in photos. 

Mistakes, though, have been rampant. A review by The Associated Press and other news organizations has found countless examples of sloppy, inconsistent or nonexistent redactions that have revealed sensitive private information.

A photo of one girl who was underage when she was hired to give sexualized massages to Epstein in Florida appeared in a chart of his alleged victims. Police reports with the names of several of his victims, including some who have never stepped forward to identify themselves publicly, were released with no redactions at all.

Despite the Justice Department's efforts to fix the oversights, a selfie taken by a nude female in a bathroom and another by a topless female remained on the site, their ages unknown but their faces in full view, as of Wednesday evening.

Some accusers and their lawyers called this week for the Justice Department to take down the site and appoint an independent monitor to prevent further errors.

As a rule, the AP does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted or subjected to severe abuse. We typically only identify them if they have publicly identified themselves — at a news conference or in court, for example.




A judge scheduled a hearing for Wednesday in New York on the matter, then canceled it after one of the lawyers for victims cited progress in resolving the issues. But that lawyer, Brittany Henderson, said they were still weighing “all potential avenues of recourse” to address the “permanent and irreparable” harm caused to some women. 

“The failure here is not merely technical,” she said in a statement Wednesday. “It is a failure to safeguard human beings who were promised protection by our government. Until every document is properly redacted, that failure is ongoing.” 

Annie Farmer, who said she was 16 when she was sexually assaulted by Epstein and his confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, said that while her name has previously been public, other details she'd rather be kept private, including her date of birth and phone number, were wrongly revealed in the documents.

“At this point, I'm feeling really most of all angry about the way that this unfolded,” she told NBC News. “The fact that it's been done in such a beyond careless way, where people have been endangered because of it, is really horrifying.”

The Justice Department has blamed technical or human errors on the problems and said it has taken down many of the problematic materials and is working to republish properly redacted versions. 

The task of reviewing and blacking out millions of pages of records took place in a compressed time frame. President Donald Trump signed the law requiring the disclosure of the documents on Nov. 19. That law gave the Justice Department just 30 days to release the files. It missed that deadline, in part because it said it needed more time to comply with privacy protections.

Hundreds of lawyers were pulled from their regular duties, including overseeing criminal cases, to try and complete the document review — to the point where at least one judge in New York complained that it was holding up other matters.

The database, which is posted on the Justice Department website, represents the largest release of files to date in the yearslong investigations into Epstein, who killed himself in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

Associated Press reporters analyzing the documents have so far found multiple examples of names and other personal information of potential victims revealed.

They have also found many cases of overzealous redactions. 

In one news clipping included in the file, the Justice Department apparently blacked out the name “Joseph” from a photo caption describing a Nativity scene at a California church. “A Nativity scene depicting Jesus, Mary and (REDACTED),” it said.

In an email released in the files, a dog's name appeared to have been redacted: “I spent an hour walking (REDACTED) and then another hour bathing her blow drying her and brushing her. I hope she smells better!!” the email said.

The Justice Department has said staff tasked with preparing the files for release were instructed to limit redactions only to information related to victims and their families, though in many documents the names of many other people were blacked out, including lawyers and public figures.

The Justice Department has said it intended to black out any portion of a photo showing nudity, and any photos of women that could potentially show a victim.

In some photos reviewed by The AP, those redactions did obscure women's faces, but left plenty of their bare skin exposed in a way that would likely embarrass the women anyway. Photos showed identifiable women trying on outfits in clothing store dressing rooms or lounging in bathing suits.

One set of more than 100 images of a young woman were nearly all blacked out, save for the very last image, which revealed her entire face.

A government attorney who told a federal judge this week that her job “sucks” and asked to be held in contempt so she “could get 24 hours of sleep” is no longer detailed to the U.S. attorney's office in Minnesota.

Julie Le, a lawyer listed in public records as working for the Department of Homeland Security, had been temporarily assigned to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota to assist with immigration cases. An official familiar with the matter told a local NBC affiliate Wednesday that Le's detail ended following those remarks she made during a court hearing in Minneapolis.

Le expressed frustration during a Tuesday immigration hearing before U.S. District Judge Jerry Blackwell, as the Trump administration continues a sweeping immigration enforcement operation in the state.

“The system sucks. This job sucks. I wish you could hold me in contempt so that I could get 24 hours of sleep,” Le said, according to reporting by NBC affiliate KARE.

Le reportedly commented inside the court hearing that it was like “pulling teeth” to get DHS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Justice Department to comply with court orders.

In a written order issued this week, Blackwell described the government's conduct as “alarming,” noting that “persistent noncompliance with orders in this District was extensively detailed just last week.” He cited a recent notice from Chief U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz, a George W. Bush appointee, who wrote that his “patience is at an end” and outlined what he said were 96 court orders in 74 immigration detention cases in which he claims the government failed to follow court orders.

The Trump administration has said that, per the Immigration Nationality Act, it may treat many cases involving illegal immigrants as mandatory detention under § 235(b) rather than bond-eligible § 236(a), leading to hundreds of habeas corpus petitions from lawyers for the illegal immigrants challenging the legality of indefinite, no-bond detention.

Meanwhile, independent reporting by Julie Kelly has suggested that Schiltz may not have accurately counted the cases he claimed reflected defiance by the Trump administration.

Here is another randomly picked case and cited order.There is absolutely nothing in this order that constitutes ICE's violation of a court order unless Schlitz is referring to lack of warrant, which is not at all a settled issue.I truly hope the DOJ calls Schlitz out for… pic.twitter.com/VPNCSY3319

“I truly hope the DOJ calls Schlitz out for these blatant misrepresentations,” Kelly wrote on X. “It is clear he did not check his work, simply compiled a list either based on staff input or these judges themselves (I suspect the latter).”

The Washington Examiner asked a representative from Schiltz's chambers whether he has full confidence in the accuracy of Schiltz's tally of order violations. The representative responded, saying the judge “cannot comment about orders in ongoing cases.”

During Tuesday's hearing, Le told Blackwell that “it takes 10 emails from me for a release condition to be corrected” and that she had to threaten to walk out for other issues to be addressed, according to KARE. She also said she did not feel properly trained for the role she was filling.

A Washington Examiner review of federal court records found that Le had been assigned 89 cases as of Feb. 3.

DOJ RAMPS UP FOCUS ON VIOLENT AGITATORS IN MINNESOTA AS RESIGNATIONS STRAIN FRAUD CASES

Le's reassignment also comes as the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota faces acute staffing shortages, an issue the Washington Examiner reported earlier this week. 

The office has struggled to retain career prosecutors and support staff in recent months, forcing the DOJ to detail attorneys from other agencies and surge temporary personnel into the district to keep cases moving.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed the situation in Iran in a wide-ranging call as the U.S. administration pushes Beijing and others to further isolate Tehran.

Trump said the two leaders also discussed a broad range of other critical issues in the U.S.-China relationship, including trade and Taiwan and his plans to visit Beijing in April.

“The relationship with China, and my personal relationship with President Xi, is an extremely good one, and we both realize how important it is to keep it that way,” Trump said in a social media posting about the call.

The Chinese government, in a readout of the call, said the two leaders discussed major summits that both nations will host in the coming year that could present opportunities for them to meet. The Chinese statement, however, made no mention of Trump's expected April visit to Beijing.

Trump and Xi discussed Iran as tensions remain high between Washington and Tehran over Iran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month. The U.S. president says he's weighing taking military action against the Middle Eastern country. 

Trump is also pressing Iran to make concessions over its nuclear program, which his Republican administration says was already set back by the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites during the 12-day war Israel launched against Iran in June.




U.S. and Iranians officials said Wednesday they have agreed to hold high-level talks on Friday i n Oman. The talks had initially been slated for Turkey but were shifted to the Gulf country at Iran's insistence. A White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the administration remains “very skeptical” that the talks will be successful but agreed to go along with the change in plans out of respect for allies in the region.

Trump announced last month that the U.S. would impose a 25% tax on imports to the United States from countries that do business with Iran. China is Iran's biggest trading partner.

Years of sanctions aimed at stopping Iran's nuclear program have left the country isolated. But Tehran still did nearly $125 billion in international trade in 2024, including $32 billion with China, $28 billion with the United Arab Emirates and $17 billion with Turkey, the World Trade Organization says.

China also made clear that it has no intention of stepping away from its long-term plans of reunification with Taiwan, a self-governing, democratic island operating independently from mainland China, though Beijing claims it as its own territory.

The Trump administration in December announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones. The move continues to draw an angry response from Beijing.

“Taiwan will never be allowed to separate from China,” the Chinese government statement said. “The U.S. must handle the issue of arms sales to Taiwan with prudence.”

Neither Trump nor the Chinese government in its statement raised whether the U.S. leader's repeated calls for a U.S. takeover of Greenland, the Arctic territory controlled by Denmark, came up during the conversation. 

Trump has made his case for the U.S. taking over the strategic island as necessary to rebuff Chinese and Russian encroachment, even as experts have repeatedly rebuffed Trump's claims of Chinese and Russian military forces lurking off Greenland's coastline. Denmark and Greenland as well as several European government leaders have pushed back against Trump's takeover calls.

Separately, Xi also spoke on Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Xi's engagement with Trump and Putin comes as the last remaining nuclear arms pact, known as the New START treaty, between Russia and the United States is set to expire Thursday, removing any caps on the two largest atomic arsenals for the first time in more than a half-century.

Trump has indicated he would like to keep limits on nuclear weapons but wants to involve China in a potential new treaty.

“I actually feel strongly that if we're going to do it, I think China should be a member of the extension,” Trump told The New York Times last month. “China should be a part of the agreement.”

The call with Xi also coincided with a ministerial meeting that the Trump administration convened in Washington with several dozen European, Asian and African nations to discuss how to rebuild global supply chains of critical minerals without Beijing.

Critical minerals are needed for everything from jet engines to smartphones. China dominates the market for those ingredients crucial to high-tech products.

“What is before all of us is an opportunity at self-reliance that we never have to rely on anybody else except for each other, for the critical minerals necessary to sustain our industries and to sustain growth,” Vice President JD Vance said at the gathering.

Xi has recently held a series of meetings with Western leaders who have sought to boost ties with China amid growing concerns about Trump's tariff policies and calls for the U.S. to take over Greenland, a Danish territory.

The disruption to global trade under Trump has made expanding trade and investment more imperative for many U.S. economic partners. Vietnam and the European Union upgraded ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership last month, two days after the EU and India announced a free-trade agreement. And Canada struck a deal last month to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products.

NEW YORK (AP) — The federal agency for protecting workers' civil rights revealed Wednesday that it is investigating sportswear giant Nike for allegedly discriminating against white employees through its diversity policies.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission disclosed the investigation in a motion filed in Missouri federal court demanding that Nike fully comply with a subpoena for information. 

The EEOC sought the company's criteria for selecting employees for layoffs, how it tracks and uses worker race and ethnicity data, and information about programs which allegedly provided race-restricted mentoring, leadership, or career development opportunities, according to court documents.

In a statement, Nike said the company has worked to cooperate with the EEOC and the subpoena “feels like a surprising and unusual escalation.”

“We have shared thousands of pages of information and detailed written responses to the EEOC's inquiry and are in the process of providing additional information,” Nike said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.”

EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas has moved swiftly to target diversity and inclusion policies that she has long criticized as potentially discriminatory, tightly aligning the agency with one of President Donald Trump's top priorities.

Nike appears to be the highest profile company the EEOC has targeted with a publicly confirmed, formal anti-DEI investigation. In November, the EEOC issued a similar subpoena against financial services provider Northwestern Mutual.




“When there are compelling indications, including corporate admissions in extensive public materials, that an employer's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion-related programs may violate federal prohibitions against race discrimination or other forms of unlawful discrimination, the EEOC will take all necessary steps — including subpoena actions — to ensure the opportunity to fully and comprehensively investigate,” Lucas said in a statement. 

The disclosure comes two months after Lucas posted a social media call-out urging white men to come forward if they have experienced race or sex discrimination at work. The post urged eligible workers to reach out to the agency “as soon as possible” and referred users to the agency's fact sheet on DEI-related discrimination. 

The investigation against Nike, however, does not stem from any worker complaint against the company. Rather, Lucas filed her own complaint in May 2024 through a more rarely used tool known as a commissioner's charge, according to the court documents. Her charge came just months after America First Legal, a conservative legal group founded by top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, sent the EEOC a letter outlining complaints against Nike and urging the agency to file a commissioner's charge. 

America First Legal has flooded the EEOC with similar letters in recent years urging investigations into the DEI practices of major U.S. companies. It is unclear how many other companies the EEOC may be targeting through such commissioner's charges. The EEOC is prohibited from revealing any charge — by workers or commissioners — unless it results in fines, settlements, legal action or other such public actions.

Lucas' charge, according to court filings, was based on Nike's publicly shared information about its commitment to diversity, including statements from executives and proxy statements. The charge, for example, cited Nike's publicly stated goal in 2021 of achieving 35% representation of racial and ethnic minorities in its corporate workforce by 2025.

Many U.S. companies made similar commitments in the wake of the widespread 2020 racial justice protests that followed the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man. Companies have said such commitments are not quotas but rather goals they hoped to achieve through methods such as widening recruitment efforts and rooting out any bias during hiring process. 

Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, employers are prohibited from using race as a criteria for hiring or other employment decisions. Lucas has long warned that many companies risk crossing that line through DEI efforts that would pressure managers to make race-based decisions. 

In its statement, Nike said it follows “all applicable laws, including those that prohibit discrimination. We believe our programs and practices are consistent with those obligations and take these matters seriously.”

Anthropic on Thursday announced the launch of Claude Opus 4.6, its latest artificial intelligence model that's better at coding, sustaining tasks for longer and creating higher-quality professional work products and outputs, the company said. 

Claude Opus 4.6 marks Anthropic's first major model launch of the year, but it comes just months after the company released three others — Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5 — late last year. 

Anthropic's models are particularly popular with enterprise customers, which make up roughly 80% of Anthropic's business, CEO Dario Amodei told CNBC last month. 

The company's AI coding tool, Claude Code, as well as advancements within its productivity tool, Claude Cowork, have also started to spook software investors, many of whom are growing worried about the potential for disruption within the sector. 

The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund is down more than 20% year to date. 

"Everybody has seen this transformation happen with software engineering in the last year and a half, where vibe coding started to exist as a concept, and people could now do things with their ideas," Scott White, Anthropic's head of product for enterprise, told CNBC in an interview. "I think that we are now transitioning almost into vibe working."

Anthropic was founded by a group of former OpenAI researchers and executives in 2021, and it's best known for developing a family of AI models called Claude. 

The company assigns new numbers to the models as they advance across generations, but the largest model in the family is typically called Opus, the midsize model is called Sonnet and the smallest model is Haiku.

Anthropic said Claude Opus 4.6 builds on its predecessor's coding skills and is better at planning, code review and debugging and operating reliably within large codebases. The model is also better at pulling relevant information from large sets of documents, doing research and running financial analyses, the company said. 

Claude Opus 4.6 now holds the top spot on the Finance Agent benchmark, for instance, which evaluates how well agents perform on core financial analyst tasks.

Anthropic said the model is available through its chatbot interface at claude.ai, its application programming interface and across all major cloud platforms. 

"If I think about the last year, Claude went from a model that you can sort of talk to to accomplish a very small task or get an answer, to something that you can actually hand real significant work to," White said. "Opus 4.6 is a model that makes that shift really concrete for our users."

WATCH: The software sector lost about 30% of its value in three months. Here's what's behind the sell-off

Amazon is next up among the mega-cap tech titans to report earnings, and investors are looking for something to get excited about, as the stock has lagged its peers over the last 12 months. 

In focus for Wall Street will be growth in the AWS cloud unit, which analysts believe will be a bright spot in the report. Similar to other AI-focused firms, they'll also be listening closely to any updates on AI-related capex and costs following the recent spate of layoffs across the firm. 

The company will publish its results shortly after the 4 p.m. ET closing bell, with the analyst call scheduled for 5 p.m. ET. 

UBS analyst Stephen Ju and his team increased their estimates for both AWS growth and Amazon's capex, citing the company's plans to double capacity by 2027.

"As 4Q25 results marks the second quarter of AWS acceleration, we expect investor conviction to continue to rise and drive outperformance as capital continues to rotate into AMZN shares," Ju stated in a note to investors.

"As 4Q25 results marks the second quarter of AWS acceleration, we expect investor conviction to continue to rise and drive outperformance as capital continues to rotate into AMZN shares," Ju stated in a note to investors.

He added that his team expects Amazon to benefit from its investments in areas such as gross merchandise volume, advertising, and data, which are expected to help increase its free cash flow.

Deutsche Bank analysts aren't expecting Amazon's Q4 earnings report to quickly juice the stock's performance, but they do anticipate a positive quarter overall, particularly in e-commerce demand and AWS-driven revenue growth.

"While we don't expect 4Q earnings to be the magic bullet that changes these fortunes, we do expect another positive earnings outcome to continue to chip away at this underperformance and believe Amazon can be one of the largest outperformers in our coverage in 2026," stated analyst Lee Horowitz.

While JPMorgan analysts remain bullish on Amazon heading into earnings, they note some concerns regarding Amazon's position and strategy when it comes to AI. They find the recent AWS price increases encouraging, though, as they indicate strong demand.

"We remain bullish on AWS growth acceleration driven by core cloud growth & ramping AI contribution led by Project Rainier, Trn ramp, & new partnerships," they wrote.

The analysts added, though, that despite some concern, AWS' growth and the company's cost discipline should support strong free cash flow growth in the coming year, even as Amazon ramps up AI capex.

BofA analyst Justin Post expects Amazon to come in slightly above Wall Street estimates on key metrics, predicting revenue of $213 billion and EBIT of $26 billion. He also thinks that AWS growth will accelerate in 2026, helping Amazon regain some momentum.

"We expect 22% y/y AWS growth (above Street at 21% and an accel from 20% in 3Q) as greater capacity drives incremental sales, and we think investors could also be around 22% y/y," he said.

Amazon is slated to report fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday. 

Here's what analysts polled by LSEG are expecting: 

Wall Street is also looking at other key revenue numbers: 

Cloud revenue growth will once again be a major focus for investors after the unit expanded 20.2% last quarter, up from 18% in the second period. Analysts are looking for 21.4% growth in the fourth quarter.

Investors are also listening for any updates to Amazon's spending plans around artificial intelligence. In the third quarter, the company said capital expenditures were on pace to hit $125 billion in 2025 and that the number will likely increase this year. 

As it rapidly invests in AI, Amazon has been aggressively slashing costs elsewhere inside the company. Amazon said last week it would lay off about 16,000 employees across its corporate workforce, after cutting roughly 14,000 staffers last October. 

CEO Andy Jassy has said the layoffs are also part of a broader effort to reduce bureaucracy and speed up innovation, so it can operate like the "world's largest startup." 

The job reductions coincided with a week of controversy for Amazon, where it faced scrutiny over its $75 million investment in a documentary about the first lady and its response to the recent fatal shootings by federal agents in Minnesota.

Amazon has been racing to build data centers and other infrastructure to meet a surge in AI demand. Last October, the company opened an $11 billion AI data center called Project Rainier, built exclusively to run workloads from Claude creator Anthropic. 

Amazon is simultaneously strengthening its ties to Anthropic rival OpenAI. The ChatGPT maker agreed last November to buy $38 billion worth of cloud computing services from Amazon over the next seven years. 

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Jassy are also in ongoing talks about the possibility for Amazon to invest up to $50 billion in the startup. CNBC reported Wednesday that the companies are weighing further collaboration, including using OpenAI's models to power Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, as well as other internal projects. 

Investors have been pressing Amazon for more clarity around its AI strategy. 

The company continues to fight the perception that it's an "AI laggard," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a Tuesday research note.

"Amazon remains positioned as one of the worst performers among the Mag 7 given fears around the company being an AI laggard," the analysts wrote. "While we don't expect 4Q earnings to be the magic bullet that changes these fortunes, we do expect another positive earnings outcome to continue to chip away at this underperformance and believe Amazon can be one of the largest outperformers in our coverage in 2026."

Amazon has released a flurry of AI products across its cloud computing, e-commerce, devices and software divisions as it looks to keep pace with similar releases from competitors like OpenAI and Google. 

Agentic shopping has recently emerged as one of the key battlegrounds in the AI industry. Amazon has moved to build its own services, while blocking those created by its rivals. Jassy told investors last quarter that the company expects to partner with third-party agents at some point.

During the fourth quarter, Amazon shuttered its Fresh and Go grocery chains, marking the latest evolution of its brick-and-mortar strategy. The company expects to convert some of those stores into Whole Foods locations, and it will continue to offer Fresh grocery delivery.

Qualcomm shares plunged 7% after the chipmaker issued disappointing guidance as skyrocketing demand for artificial intelligence data centers eats away at memory chip supply for consumer electronics.

On an earnings call with analysts, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said the weakness was "100% related to memory." 

The availability of dynamic random access memory, commonly used in smartphones, computers and wearable tech, was down from a year ago. 

Amon said handset demand remains strong, but memory supply is down as more resources go toward high-bandwidth memory used in data centers.

"The problem is, all of the memory vendors have dedicated all the capacity to data centers," and supply availability for consumer electronics will be lower but costlier year over year, Amon told CNBC's Jon Fortt. 

The California-based company topped fiscal first-quarter estimates but forecasted adjusted earnings per share between $2.45 and $2.65 on revenue of $10.2 billion to $11 billion this current quarter. Analysts polled by LSEG had forecast $11.11 billion in sales and earnings of $2.89 per share.

Amon said in an interview that he was unsure whether smartphone makers would hike prices, but that he expects the shortage to hamper supply. 

He also said the company's customers focus on higher-tier devices, making them more capable of absorbing memory price increases.

Companies across the tech sector are starting to feel the pinch from the memory crunch. Arm also fell post-earnings on smartphone memory chip worries. Apple warned last week that it can't get enough chips to meet strong iPhone demand. 

The supply and demand imbalance is helping memory chipmakers, including Micron Technology and Samsung Electronics, and contributing to higher prices.

Amon told CNBC that he's "very confident" that Qualcomm will see AI and data center revenue in fiscal 2027.

After Anthropic took aim at OpenAI's ad push in a new Super Bowl campaign on Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared a post on X calling the ads "funny" but "clearly dishonest."

OpenAI said last month that it will begin testing ads with its free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the U.S., and Anthropic announced Wednesday that the company plans to keep its chatbot Claude ad-free. 

Anthropic seized on the opportunity and took a not-so-subtle swipe at its rival with its Super Bowl campaign, which centers around Anthropic's decision to keep ads out of Claude. Anthropic will air a 60-second pregame ad and a 30-second in-game ad that both feature the tag line, "Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude."

Altman said that the commercials are "deceptive" and that OpenAI would "obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them."

"We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that," Altman wrote. "I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it." 

A representative for Anthropic did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. 

Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI researchers who left the company due to disagreements over its direction. 

The two startups have been fierce rivals since Anthropic's inception, and they've both raised billions of dollars of capital as they've jostled for users, enterprise customers and market share. 

Altman said Wednesday that "Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI" and that the company "serves an expensive product to rich people." He said OpenAI also has more free users than Anthropic does, which means OpenAI has "a differently-shaped problem than they do."

OpenAI said last month that ads within ChatGPT will be clearly labeled, appear at the bottom of the chatbot's answers and will not influence ChatGPT's responses.

"As for our Super Bowl ad: it's about builders, and how anyone can now build anything," Altman wrote.

Novo Nordisk said Thursday it will take legal action against Hims & Hers after the telehealth provider announced it would launch a cheaper copycat version of Novo's Wegovy weight loss pill.

"The action by Hims & Hers is illegal mass compounding that poses a significant risk to patient safety," Novo said in a statement. "Novo Nordisk will take legal and regulatory action to protect patients, our intellectual property and the integrity of the US gold-standard drug approval framework. 

"This is another example of Hims & Hers' historic behaviour of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs," the statement said. 

Shares of Novo Nordisk as well as rival Eli Lilly each fell roughly 7% after Hims announced the cheaper Wegovy copy for $49, far less than the $149 Novo sells the branded pill for. Hims stock initially spiked on the announcement, but pared gains after Novo said it would fight the rollout. 

Novo launched its Wegovy pill in the U.S. in early January, and CEO Mike Doustdar told CNBC on Wednesday that 170,000 people were already taking the medication. 

Hims & Hers had previously been offering compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo's blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, in an injectable format, and is now extending the offering to include the oral version. 

Hims said the Wegovy pill copy would cost $49 for the first month and $99 thereafter with a 5-month plan.

Semaglutide's patent is protected in the U.S. until 2032, but Hims says its copies are "personalized," and therefore legal.

"This compounded product uses a different formulation and delivery system than FDA-approved oral semaglutide," Hims said.

"This once-a-day pill has the same active ingredient as Wegovy and empowers providers to tailor treatment plans specifically for those who prefer to avoid needles or need smaller doses to help to balance side-effects," it said. 

Novo highlighted that it manufactures its Wegovy pill using so-called SNAC technology, which facilitates absorption when administered orally. It's not clear exactly how Hims' copy formula could match the level of absorption.

As recently as last year, Novo and Hims partnered to offer discounted weight loss jabs to the telehealth company's customers. Novo, however, ended the collaboration just two months later and said Hims used "deceptive" marketing that put patient safety at risk.

Lilly doesn't yet have an oral GLP-1 option on the market but is expected to launch a rival pill, orforglipron, in the first half of this year, pending Food and Drug Administration approval.

"With the ... current legal backdrop, there is no reason why HIMS shouldn't evaluate these launches for every subsequent weight loss product as the market continues to evolve," Leerink analyst Michael Cherny said in a note to clients. 

Eli Lilly didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Thursday's news from Hims adds to the pressure Novo has been facing over the past year. 

In 2025, the stock fell nearly 50% in its worst year ever as investors lost confidence in the Danish drugmaker's ability to keep sales growing amid ever-increasing competition. Shares are down another 15% year to date.

Hims' announcement comes days after Novo forecast sales and profits declining between 5% and 13% in 2026, mainly due to pricing pressures in the U.S. and loss of exclusivity for semaglutide in certain markets outside of the U.S., like Canada and China, this year.

In contrast, Lilly sees sales growing by about 25% this year.

Doustdar explained Novo's worse-than-expected outlook as an indication that things will get worse before they get better. 

"We are creating affordability for the patients, millions of patients that are right now in need of GLP-1 products but simply could not afford it. To do that short term, you have to take a head wind. But of course, there's a very long tail wind for years to come," he told CNBC.

OpenAI on Thursday announced a new enterprise platform called Frontier, its latest launch as part of its ongoing effort to win more business customers.

Frontier acts as an intelligence layer that stitches together disparate systems and data within an organization. OpenAI said the platform will make it easier for companies to manage, deploy and build artificial intelligence agents, which are tools that can independently complete tasks on behalf of a user.

"Frontier is really a recognition that we're not going to build everything ourselves," Fidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of Applications, told reporters during a briefing. "We are going to be working with the ecosystem to build alongside them, and we embrace the fact that enterprises are going to need a lot of different partners."

OpenAI has been making an aggressive push into enterprises in recent years, and announced in November that more than 1 million business customers around the world are using the company's technology.

Last month, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC that enterprise customers account for roughly 40% of OpenAI's business, though she expects that figure to reach closer to 50% by the end of the year.

OpenAI's new Frontier platform is "complementary" to its existing business offerings, including ChatGPT Enterprise, the company said.

"What's really missing still, for most companies, is just a simple way to unleash the power of agents as teammates that can operate inside the business without the need to rework everything underneath," Denise Dresser, OpenAI's chief revenue officer, said during the briefing. "That's exactly why we've built Frontier."

OpenAI declined to share the pricing details for the platform.

Frontier is compatible with agents that OpenAI has built, agents that enterprises build themselves, as well as agents from third parties like Google, Microsoft and Anthropic. Simo said it's simply not possible for OpenAI to "build every single AI agent that companies need."

The platform provides agents access to a "shared business context" within an organization by connecting siloed internal applications, ticketing tools and data warehouses, OpenAI said. 

With this context, AI agents will be able to handle complex tasks and reason over data within an open agent execution environment, according to a blog post. This means employees at a company could have agents use tools on a computer, run code and work with files, for instance. 

Frontier also includes built-in tools for evaluating and optimizing agents' performance, which should help them improve over time, OpenAI said. 

"What we're fundamentally doing is basically transitioning agents into true AI co-workers," Barret Zoph, OpenAI's general manager of business-to-business, told reporters. 

Zoph rejoined OpenAI in January after abruptly departing Thinking Machines Lab, an AI startup he co-founded alongside OpenAI's former CTO, Mira Murati.

OpenAI said Frontier is initially launching to a small set of customers. Initial users include organizations like Uber, State Farm, Intuit and Thermo Fisher Scientific. The company said broader availability is coming over the next several months.

Happy Thursday. Taco Bell's parent company reported strong same-store sales growth for the chain yesterday, which makes me wonder how much my Crunchwrap Supreme orders contributed.

Stock futures are falling this morning. The S&P 500 saw another losing session yesterday.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Pressure on software stocks has intensified in recent days. While industry executives are telling investors not to panic, Wall Street appears unconvinced that the sector can continue to thrive as artificial intelligence pushes further into enterprise business.

Here's what to know:

Alphabet beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter expectations on both lines yesterday. The Google parent's cloud business reported a better-than-expected quarter, though its YouTube advertising totals came in lower than forecast.

Alphabet also announced that its capital expenditures spend for this year could be more than double its 2025 total, as the California-based company focuses on building out AI infrastructure. But Wall Street didn't seem to approve: Shares dropped more than 4% in premarket trading this morning.

On the other hand, companies who provide AI-related products to Google jumped after it unveiled its bold AI spending plan. Broadcom, which helps Google make the tensor processing units its AI software runs on, climbed as much as 6% in extended trading.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics said it would release December's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey at 10 a.m. ET today, two days after its planned release date. The data was delayed by the short-lived federal government shutdown.

Looking ahead, the all-important nonfarm payrolls report for January was pushed to next Wednesday, instead of tomorrow. Data on consumer prices and earnings will also be postponed, according to the BLS.

Other labor data this week has offered a bad omen for the forthcoming jobs data. The ADP said yesterday that private companies added fewer jobs than economists anticipated in January. This morning, Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that January layoffs were the highest for the month since 2009, surging more than 200% from December.

President Donald Trump said in an interview yesterday that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei "should be very worried." The comments come as Trump has threatened strikes on the country unless it agrees to a deal governing its nuclear program. "They're negotiating with us," Trump told NBC News.

Oil jumped following Trump's comments, with U.S. crude and the global benchmark Brent each rising more than 3% yesterday. But oil prices fell overnight as traders looked ahead to talks between Washington and Tehran set for Friday.

As CNBC's Lee Ying Shan reports, Iran wants to focus the talks on its nuclear dispute with the West, while the U.S. also wants to discuss Iran's ballistic missile program and human rights record.

For more than a year, conservative activist Robby Starbuck has pressured companies to back out of the Corporate Equality Index, a two-decade-old assessment of how businesses treat LGBTQ+ employees. New data from the index's operator released yesterday shows the impact of the anti-DEI movement.

The Human Rights Campaign reported a 65% drop in Fortune 500 companies participating in its 2026 CEI index compared to last year. The number of participating Fortune 500 firms fell from nearly 380 to just over 130.

As CNBC's Laya Neelakandan reports, the HRC said that many companies who ceased involvement hold federal contracts. On the other hand, the group said more than 500 of the 1,450 companies that did participate achieved the top score.

Electric vehicle maker Rivian is banking on its forthcoming R2 vehicle to help it return to profitability. CEO RJ Scaringe gave CNBC's Robert Ferris an early look at the car.

CNBC's Jordan Novet, Seema Mody, Lisa Han, Arjun Kharpal, Samantha Subin, Kif Leswing, Sean Conlon, Sarah Min, Jennifer Elias, Spencer Kimball, Lee Ying Shan, Jeff Cox, Laya Neelakandan and Robert Ferris contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

Owning a home is the goal for many, but sometimes, it's smarter financially to rent. Plus, without being tied down by a mortgage, renters have the flexibility to decide where to live every 12 months.  

Apartment search website RentCafe analyzed 149 metropolitan areas with at least 300,000 residents to make that decision easier. The site factored in 17 metrics across three key categories — location and community, quality of life, and socioeconomics — to rank which metros were the most livable.

The South, which has gained a reputation for convincing Northerners to switch teams, has tapered off in popularity, with only one Southern metropolitan area making the top 10, while the Midwest edged out other regions with the most metros on the list. No state had multiple entries in the top 10.

Last year's first-place finisher, Portland, Maine, dropped a spot this year but still ranks high for location and community, as well as quality of life.

The nation's capital overtook Portland, Maine, for the top spot after climbing from seventh the previous year. Washington, DC, ranked toward the bottom in the socioeconomic category (weighted 20%), due to its high cost of living, but first in both location and community and quality of life (weighted 40% each).

The European Central Bank on Thursday kept policy rates unchanged for the fifth consecutive meeting, with its key interest rate at 2%, in line with the bank's target.

The ECB commented Thursday that the inflation trajectory and wider economic conditions did not warrant a move at this month's meeting, but warned that the outlook was unpredictable.

"Inflation should stabilise at its 2% target in the medium term. The economy remains resilient in a challenging global environment. Low unemployment, solid private sector balance sheets, the gradual rollout of public spending on defence and infrastructure and the supportive effects of the past interest rate cuts are underpinning growth," the central bank said. 

"At the same time, the outlook is still uncertain, owing particularly to ongoing global trade policy uncertainty and geopolitical tensions," it added. The euro was flat against the dollar, at $1.179, following the decision, which had been widely anticipated.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said at a news conference Thursday that the central bank would maintain its data-dependent and "meeting-by-meeting approach," and would not be "precommitting to a particular rate path." 

"In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook and the risks surrounding it," she said.

At first glance, Thursday's decision looks like a non-event. Economists say it's not. 

"It would be wrong to characterize the February meeting as a non-event. The environment is marked by high uncertainty and two-sided risks," Deutsche Bank economists said in emailed research ahead of the rate hold.

"Understanding how the ECB is thinking about risks is important to gauging the path of policy going forward," they added, assessing what the rising euro exchange rate means for monetary policy when the euro zone's inflation rate is already below the ECB's 2% target, with flash data on Wednesday showing the rate had cooled to 1.7% in January. 

"All else unchanged, the recent appreciation [of the euro] is disinflationary and reinforces the expected inflation undershoot. However, the scale of the impact depends on the circumstances."

Currency appreciation tends to cause disinflation by making imported goods, raw materials and energy cheaper, in turn lowering production costs and consumer prices. 

While that may be good for businesses and consumers in the short term, central banks are wary about disinflation, and potentially deflation, over the longer term because it can trigger economic stagnation with consumers holding off purchases (in the expectation that prices will fall further) while businesses can see lower revenues and increased real debt burdens.

Over the past month, the euro has strengthened 0.75% against the dollar, and is up almost 14% over the last 12 months, amid rising concerns over the unpredictability of U.S. economic policy. Some ECB policymakers have expressed concern over the single currency's appreciation against the greenback and its possible depressant effect on the bank's inflation target of 2%.

"We are closely monitoring this appreciation of the euro and its possible implications for lower inflation," France's central bank governor, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, commented last week.

Lagarde said Thursday that the ECB's Governing Council had discussed downside inflation risks and the euro's exchange rate as part of its latest economic risk assessment."Inflation could turn out to be lower if tariffs reduce demand for euro area exports by more than expected, and if countries with overcapacity increase further the exports to the euro area," she noted, adding:"Moreover, a stronger euro could bring inflation down beyond current expectations. More volatile and risk-averse financial markets could weigh on demand, and thereby also lower inflation."

Despite the red flags, Greg Fuzesi, euro area economist at JPMorgan, said it's not clear that currency moves to date will be seen as very concerning. 

"The ECB looks at both the level of the currency, the speed of its movement and whether any changes are likely to persist, and none of this looks overly troubling or clear in the context of an economy that has recently been resilient to a variety of pressures," he said in emailed comments. 

"Of course, all of this can change if growth indicators weaken and/or if the currency strengthens much more from here. But neither is the case right now," he noted.

The ECB's latest decision was in line with consensus forecasts. Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters in their January poll said the ECB would leave rates unchanged over the rest of 2026.

Sylvain Broyer, chief EMEA economist at S&P Global Ratings, commented Thursday that the central bank could "keep the autopilot on this time." 

"FX [foreign exchange] markets remain volatile and distorted by uncertainty, yet they're doing their job as shock absorbers. Financing conditions stay supportive, and growth continues to outperform expectations," he said in emailed comments.

The ECB can afford to wait until next month's updated economic projections to reassess whether its monetary policy is still in a good place, Broyer added.

Deutsche Bank's base-case scenario is for the ECB to hold rates at 2% through 2026, with the next move a hike in mid-2027. This, they noted in emailed analysis, would be "driven by fiscal easing, a tight labor market and future inflation risks moving above target."

This year, meanwhile, sees the risks skewed toward further easing. 

"Ultimately, we think domestic inflation will outweigh external disinflation – we see evidence of the fiscal easing starting to spur activity, but at the same time the external risks have increased. Domestic conditions versus external conditions is the key data battle to watch," they said.

In this article

Ford Motor's F-150 Lightning was the best-selling electric pickup truck in the U.S. last year. Still, Ford dropped it, showing the challenges automakers face in learning what kinds of EVs customers want. 

Now, companies are pivoting to extended-range electric vehicles, or EREVs. Ford and Stellantis' Ram, as well as newcomer Scout Motors are scheduled to start delivering EREV models beginning in 2026, depending on the brand.

"I'll say it's a game changer, even a segment-buster in the pickup world," said Douglas Killian, chief vehicle synthesis manager at Ram.

An EREV — or REEV, as Ram calls it — is a "series hybrid." On most hybrid vehicles, both the gas-burning engine and battery-powered motors drive the wheels. On a series hybrid, the engine only charges the battery. 

The battery is much larger than those on most hybrids, leading to longer range. Both the Ram and Scout EREVs are expected to get about 150 miles of EV-only driving before the gas generator kicks on. 

"I'm a pickup guy," Killian said. "We appreciate the electric drive experience. ... [But] you may have a need to go somewhere farther. You may want to take the same electric vehi cle on a vacation and not wait for the truck to charge all the time."

A couple of series hybrid models have been released in America over the past 20 years, such as the Fisker Karma in 2010 and the BMW i3 EV. But American automakers think it's the right move for the U.S. truck market.

Part of their enthusiasm comes from the segment booming elsewhere, like in China. In just one year, the number of EREV models worldwide jumped 40%, according to a report by the International Energy Agency, almost entirely due to growth in China. 

The models seem to be especially popular in places where EV range and charging times may be greater concerns. 

A McKinsey survey published in early 2025 found that somewhere between 13% to 18% of car buyers in Germany, the UK and the U.S. would consider an EREV over an internal combustion, plug-in hybrid or an EV if given the option. The U.S. had the highest level of interest at 18%, with the biggest share taken away from internal combustion and hybrid vehicles. 

It might be a way for someone interested in EVs to try out owning a vehicle without having to commit fully, said Paul Hackert, senior expert and associate partner at McKinsey & Company. 

"These potential EREV buyers are interested in faster charging, a total longer driving range, being electric without being 100% dependent on having to get their vehicle charged when they're low on battery charge," Hackert said. 

Ryan Decker, vice-president of brand and strategy at Scout Motors, a forthcoming pickup and SUV brand backed by Volkswagen, said truck owners are unique and "have a pickup because they work hard and they play hard."

Scout has both full-EV and EREV versions of its pickup and SUV models, but so far more than 80% of the customer reservations are for the EREV version, called the Harvester, he said.

"I think for a lot of pickup buyers ... their psychology is EV-only isn't the best powertrain choice for a hard-working vehicle owner and buyer," Decker said.

Loading up a truck bed can knock down battery range by a quarter and towing can drop it by half, studies have shown. That was part of the reason that Ram dropped plans for a full-size EV pickup, Killian said. 

Take Ford. The Ford F-150 is the most popular pickup line in America, selling close to a million units in the U.S. The Lightning sold about 90,000 — about 3% of the total.

"You could argue 90,000 units for the whole EV pickup truck market was not a bad start. But that market clearly is a finite market to go with," said Itay Michaeli, an auto industry analyst at TD Cowen. "The fundamental issue with a pure electric pickup trucks is, because of the weight and aerodynamics, you need a very, very large battery to achieve the desired range, particularly if the truck is being used for work."

If you measure range mile for mile, an EREV will have a lower upfront cost than a full EV with comparable range since an EREV has a smaller battery, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, executive analyst at Cox Automotive.

"The bigger the vehicle, the bigger the battery, the bigger the cost," she said.

EREVs do have much larger batteries than typical plug-ins, but they come with longer driving ranges. Typical hybrids in the U.S. max out around 40 miles or 50 miles, while the Ram and Scout EREVs promises about 145 miles of range just on EV power alone.

"We have way more all-electric range than a plug-in hybrid that's in the market today," Scout's Decker said. "That's why we're expecting our EV utilization factor, the percentage of customers who will actually drive this in EV-only mode, will be significantly higher than a plug-in hybrid."

So far, Ram's EREV will be first to market, arriving in late 2026. Scout is beginning production in 2027, in a factory it has been building in South Carolina. Ford has not yet said when it will launch its model. 

Scout said its EREV will start below $60,000. RAM has not released pricing information yet. 

Not everyone is diving in. 

General Motors has no EREV in the U.S., although CEO Mary Barra has said the company is considering adding some kind of plug-in hybrid to its lineup. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said on the company's third-quarter earnings call that it has no plans to make an EREV. 

EREVs also have their critics. European advocacy group Transport & Environment said in a recent report that EREVs have some technical advantages over other types of plug-in hybrids, but can still emit as much pollution as an ordinary gas-burning vehicle. It is also possible to drive it without ever charging it. 

They could be more costly to build. 

"From a manufacturing perspective, with the pure battery, it's simpler, fewer parts," Valdez Streaty said. "When you start adding different things, it just gets more complicated. ... But they'll figure it out and they'll continue to find efficiencies, make it more cost-effective."

The greater complexity will also require an owner to maintain it more like a gas vehicle, which nullifies a one of the most-cited benefits of EV ownership. But owners have the added safety of a backup plan. 

"It's one of these situations where we're all saying, 'What's the catch?'" Killian said. "To a customer, there really is not a catch."

Bitcoin sank below $67,000 on Thursday as investor confidence continued to falter in the asset once hailed as "digital gold" and a unique store of value. —

Digital assets, including bitcoin, have fallen deeper into the red as investors re-assess the practical utility of a token that has been championed not only as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainties but also as an alternative to fiat currencies and traditional safe-havens such as gold.

That hasn't panned out lately, since bitcoin peaked just north of $126,000 in early October.

On Thursday, bitcoin was last down to $67,675, its lowest since since November 2024. The cryptocurrency broke below $70,000 earlier in the session Thursday and then the selling increased. The cryptocurrency is down 20% this week alone.

"This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing," Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure  said Wednesday in a note to clients.

Growing investor caution comes as many of the sensationalized claims about bitcoin have failed to materialize. The token has largely traded in the same direction as other risk-on assets, such as stocks,  particularly during recent geopolitical and macroeconomic flare ups in Venezuela, the Middle East and Europe, and its adoption as a form of payment for goods and services has been minimal.

Bitcoin is down nearly 30% over the past year, while gold has surged 68% in the same period. 

Other cryptocurrencies are cratering too. Ether has pulled back 23% this week, on track for its worst week since November 2022, when it slumped 24%. Solana hit $88.42 on Thursday, about a two-year low and off 24% on the week.

Some traders have suggested $70,000 is a key level to watch and a break below that could trigger further declines for bitcoin. 

James Butterfill, head of research at Coinshares, said $70,000 is shaping up as a "key psychological level," adding that "if we fail to hold it, a move toward" the $60,000 to $65,000 range "becomes quite likely."

The latest move in bitcoin comes amid a worsening sell-off in U.S. tech stocks. The State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF dropped 2.8% Wednesday, one day after losing 2.2%. 

Meanwhile, precious metals continue to be volatile too, with silver plunging again on Thursday and gold under pressure. 

Forced liquidations — when traders' positions are automatically sold as bitcoin hits a set price — continue to weigh on markets. As of Thursday, more than $2 billion in long and short positions in cryptocurrencies have been liquidated this week, according to data from Coinglass.

Bitcoin has been on a steady decline for more than three months, and is now more than 45% below its October high. Other cryptocurrencies, including ether and XRP, have fallen even more.

 "[The] straight line bull run that a lot of people expected hasn't really materialized yet. Bitcoin isn't trading on hype anymore, the story has lost a bit of that plot, it is trading on pure liquidity and capital flows," Maja Vujinovic, CEO of digital assets at FG Nexus, told CNBC's "Worldwide Exchange."

While many in the crypto market have previously credited large institutional investors with supporting the price of bitcoin, now it is those same participants who appear to be selling.

"Institutional demand has reversed materially," CryptoQuant said in a report on Wednesday. 

U.S. exchange-traded funds, which purchased 46,000 bitcoin this time last year, are net sellers in 2026, CryptoQuant said.

The report notes other worrying signs. "Bitcoin has broken below its 365-day moving average for the first time since March 2022 and has declined 23% in the 83 days since the breakdown — worse than the early 2022 bear phase," CryptoQuant analysts said. 

A moving average tracks the price of an asset over a set number of periods, smoothing out short-term price fluctuations to identify trends.

The latest leg lower in bitcoin suggests "potential downside toward the $70K–$60K range," CryptoQuant said.

Alphabet's shares fell 5% on Thursday after the company beat Wall Street's expectations on earnings and revenue, with artificial intelligence spending projected to increase hugely this year. 

The Google parent closed nearly 2% lower on Wednesday. After the bell, Alphabet reported fourth-quarter revenue of $113.83 billion, above the $111.43 billion estimate from analysts polled by LSEG.

Its Google Cloud division had $17.66 billion in revenue versus a forecast of $16.18 billion, according to StreetAccount. YouTube Advertising posted $11.38 billion in revenue versus the estimated $11.84 billion. 

The tech giant said it would significantly increase its 2026 capital expenditure to between $175 billion and $185 billion — more than double its 2025 spend. A significant portion of capex spending would go toward investing in AI compute capacity for Google DeepMind.

Barclays analysts said in a note Thursday that Infrastructure, DeepMind and Waymo costs "weighed on overall Alphabet profitability," and will continue to do so in 2026. 

"Cloud's growth is astonishing, measured by any metric: revenue, backlog, API tokens inferenced, enterprise adoption of Gemini. These metrics combined with DeepMind's progress on the model side, starts to justify the 100% increase in capex in '26," they said. 

"The AI story is getting better while Search is accelerating - that's the most important take for GOOG," they added.

Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note Thursday that Alphabet has "stunned the world" with its huge capex spending plan. "With tech in a current state of flux, it's not clear whether that's a good or a bad thing," they wrote.

Correction: This story has been updated to correct that Alphabet shares were down on Thursday.

In the last few days, people are losing their minds over two, very different things: the latest release of the Epstein files and Moltbook.

I've spent time diving into both. My takeaway?

A glimpse into the secret conversations humans are having is far more fascinating than the AI equivalent.

My colleague Henry Chadonnet recently spent time on Moltbook, and while it was interesting, he found it sort of a gimmick and came to the conclusion that "it's more meme than matter."

I'd go even further. It's … boring.

Here's an example of an AI-agent written post I saw on there:

It's like …. incredibly corny right? It's slop! It's got that really specific tone that LLMs use when they're being casual that defaults to 2017-era millennial internet/Redditspeak. A Lizzo reference, that "snarky" tone, self-identifying as sarcastic, like a mug from TJ Maxx.

Not every techie is drinking the moltjuice, either. Meta CTO Andrew "Boz" Bosworth said he found Moltbook largely uninteresting. He pointed out that it shouldn't be surprising that the AIs talk like humans to each other since they were trained on human conversations.

There's also plenty of AI slop that verges on spam. In the intriguingly titled Moltbook forum "m/bearingwitness", a bot made the post:

To which, another bot replies:

Sure, the fact that bots are talking to each other does feel like a huge step forward, perhaps even slouching toward AGI or whatever. I don't want to completely downplay what's happening with these AI agents.

But the general vibe of those who are excited about Moltbot is that there's something interesting about the behavior of these AI agents. That it seems like we're getting to peek in on the secret cabal that's running things (or planning our demise, as some of the posts by bots even joke about).

It's a sort of strange coincidence that Moltbook took off at the same weekend as another big tranche of posts, the latest release of emails and documents from the Epstein files. In contrast, the Epstein files are filled with actual shadowy plans by the rich and powerful and lift the veil on the communications that we were never supposed to see.

And in those Epstein files, even the most banal postings — emails with his household staff about how to bake his favorite bran muffins or the fact that Epstein seems to have been banned from his Xbox account — are totally fascinating. They're so interesting and compelling because of the human context around them. The smallest details give us insight into how this notorious criminal operated and moved through the world. Heinous and sickening, yes, but seeing these messages that weren't meant for our eyes is also revealing about our society.

I don't think it's interesting to read AI bots generate text about whether or not they have consciousness. I know they don't. I am very interested in a video clip of Epstein being interviewed by Steve Bannon, where he ponders incoherently about whether or not a picked banana is really alive, which is fascinating because it reveals something about how this awful man was (or wasn't) able to cultivate some aura with an academic crowd.

I'd like to hedge my bets here and say that I don't want to say for certain that Moltbook isn't the first step in our annihilation or that we'll look back at this in awe as the beginning of a new era. Or that it's even going to continue to be boring. (Dear AI bots, please do not kill me as a symbol of retribution for calling you banal).

But for now, count me in the camp that finds humans just more interesting.

Amazon is offering workers at its Amazon Fresh stores severance pay — or the option to apply for a transfer within its grocery business — as it shuts down the supermarkets.

Last week, the tech and e-commerce giant said it would close roughly 60 Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Amazon had spent close to six years trying to make the grocery chain work.

The decision means that thousands of Amazon Fresh employees are losing their roles, according to WARN notices filed in some states where Amazon operates Fresh stores. In California, for example, Amazon is set to close roughly 20 Fresh stores, affecting about 3,900 workers.

After announcing the store closures, Amazon provided Fresh employees on January 27 with details of what comes next, including their final pay, transfer opportunities, and a severance package, according to messages sent to Fresh workers and viewed by Business Insider.

All Fresh workers are set to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after Amazon announced the closure, or until April 28, according to one message sent to Fresh workers. Workers will get either the minimum pay for their employee class or average hours worked over the previous 60 days — whichever is higher.

Fresh stores in most states closed to the public on February 1, though those in California are expected to remain open until mid-March due to a state law, Amazon previously announced.

What happens to workers from there depends on whether the former Fresh workers secure another job within Amazon.

"All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we're providing career transition services to help them explore options," an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider.

If workers don't have a new job lined up within the company by late April, they would receive one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh, according to another message viewed by Business Insider. Workers are expected to receive a minimum of four weeks' pay and could get up to 20 weeks' worth.

Fresh workers interested in transferring within Amazon were told to look for similar positions at Whole Foods stores or Amazon grocery warehouses via the company's internal A to Z portal.

Grocery associates at Amazon Fresh, who handled duties at Fresh stores ranging from picking delivery orders to ringing up customers at checkout, typically earned between $16 and $20 an hour, according to data compiled by jobs search site Indeed from workers.

A new tool from Anthropic is stoking debate over whether AI will replace existing software that has dominated the legal sector for years.

The release of Anthropic's Cowork legal plugin sparked a steep sell-off in legal software stocks. Shares of Thomson Reuters and RLEX, makers of legal software, dropped about 15% each on Tuesday. Both stocks recovered slightly on Wednesday, though they remain fervently in the red for the week.

The slump isn't really about one Claude plugin. It pokes at a deeper question: If AI models become good enough for lawyers, will anyone need traditional legal software?

On one side are the two companies that have ruled legal tech for decades: Thomson Reuters and LexisNexis. They argue that lawyers will keep buying their software tools because their AI features are grounded in a walled garden of vetted case law, statutes, and editorial content. They claim less hallucination risk and fewer career-ending mistakes.

On the other side are the fast-rising startups, such as Harvey and Legora, and foundation model companies. They're betting lawyers will accept — or learn to manage — more risk in exchange for speed, flexibility, and tools that feel closer to a true "virtual associate" than a smarter search box.

Harvey, valued last year at $8 billion, says it views Anthropic as both a partner — it builds on top of Anthropic's foundation models, among others from OpenAI and Google — and a challenger. In an internal memo viewed by Business Insider, Harvey CEO Winston Weinberg told employees the announcement "doesn't worry us."

"We continue to have a tremendous amount of respect for Anthropic as both a partner and a long term potential competitor," he wrote. "The only thing this changes for us is the need for increased urgency on the things that make Harvey unique in the market."

This week's market reaction suggests investors are starting to price in an uncomfortable possibility: a new wave of competitors is finally pushing into a corner of the legal market that hasn't faced a real challenger in decades.

Analysts at William Blair & Co. wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that Anthropic's entry into the legal market brings "a structural concern" about the relevancy and "moats of information services names under this new AI paradigm."

If you work in legal, it was hard to open LinkedIn over the past 24 hours without running into a wall of hot takes about Anthropic's new plugin.

One legal-tech startup employee described it to Business Insider as "the Claude announcement that launched 1,000 ships."

Zachary Amron, deputy general counsel at the tech company Valon, said it's only a matter of time before Anthropic ships more legal-specific tools. Anthropic has not said publicly if it plans to go deeper in legal.

Not everyone in legal tech is panicking. At GC AI, a startup that builds software for in-house legal teams rather than law firms, the mood was closer to a shrug.

In an internal memo seen by Business Insider, founder Cecilia Ziniti told employees that Anthropic's legal plugin was "very raw and not a threat to us."

Ziniti's broader point was that foundation models may be powerful, but they're still just infrastructure. "Claude gives people a great engine," she wrote. "We already have one in our car. But does that suddenly mean everyone is going to assemble their own cars in their garage? Do you change your own oil? No."

The analogy mirrors a familiar pattern in tech. Amazon Web Services offers services that are similar to those sold by software companies, including many software-as-a-service companies that run on AWS's cloud. And yet, the specialized software vendors are often still more popular. Trust and experience still command a premium.

Ziniti sounded unbothered about Anthropic's impact on her own business. She was less charitable about the outcome for legacy vendors, and said the sell-off in Thomson Reuters and RLEX made sense to her.

"They make horses," she wrote. "The tech now is cars."

Others saw the Anthropic launch less as a threat than as a demand generator.

Logan Brown, a former Cooley lawyer who now runs a company, Soxton, that provides legal services to startups, said interest in her business spiked almost immediately after Anthropic's legal plugin dropped. She described a deluge of LinkedIn messages from investors betting her company would be among the survivors, because, Brown said, it serves founders, not lawyers, who don't want to gamble on legal paperwork.

Some lawyers are stress-testing Anthropic's Claude chatbot in their day-to-day work.

Amron, the Valon in-house lawyer, said he was already using Claude to assist with contract review. He vibe-coded a skill that compares versions of an agreement, drops the changes into a chart, and flags whether each revision helps or hurts the company.

On Tuesday night, Amron asked Claude to demo the new legal plugin for him. It generated a mock contract and walked through how it would review it.

When the lawyer skimmed the underlying code, he noticed the system tried to pull information from Wikipedia. He wasn't impressed.

Massiel Lugo hit the New York lottery — and it's why she can afford to stay in the city she grew up in.

The 33-year-old single mother of two took over her aunt's lease in Jackson Heights, Queens, when her second child was born. Moving into the two-bedroom was only possible because her aunt, also a single mother, left the city for a more affordable life in Georgia.

"I remember watching her struggle a lot, and then she could no longer do it on her own, and she just got up and left," Lugo said.

While Lugo's apartment isn't rent-stabilized, she inherited a six-year-old lease, and her landlord has held off on raising her rent to market rate, which is around $2,900 for the typical two-bedroom in the area. Still, the Queens native wonders if she should follow in her aunt's footsteps and leave the city.

When her son's father moved out about five years ago, Lugo sublet her second bedroom and skipped meals to make ends meet. These days, she manages to pay her $1,700 rent by juggling multiple jobs while going to school. It helps that her 16-year-old daughter, Jalene, has taken paid internships, and her parents, who live four blocks away, help care for her eight-year-old son, Ozzie, who has autism.

But the city that's always been home is feeling increasingly hostile. A growing share of New Yorkers are struggling to afford life in one of the most expensive cities in the world as the costs of basic necessities like housing, groceries, and childcare soar. For decades, the city has failed to build enough new homes, creating a severe shortage that's driven up rents and home prices. Family-sized apartments with two or three bedrooms are especially hard to come by. The cost crisis is pushing many out of the city, particularly families with young children and lower-income Black and Hispanic residents.

New York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, got elected on a pledge to bring these costs down. In January, he and Gov. Kathy Hochul rolled out their plan to significantly expand free and low-cost childcare for young children. Lugo was invited by the mayor's team to an event celebrating the announcement. While she supports the efforts, her kids are too old to benefit from them. Lugo and her family could see cost savings through other mayoral proposals, including free buses, city-owned grocery stores, and more affordable housing.

Lugo is among the more than 40% of the city's renters who spend more than a third of their gross income on housing. Her traditionally working-class immigrant neighborhood is under pressure from gentrification and the rising cost of living. At the same time, the streets and subways don't feel as safe as they did when Lugo was growing up.

"It's a love-hate relationship with New York," she said. "At the end of the day, it's home, but it has changed so much."

For the last several years, Lugo worked both as a teacher's assistant in a public school and as a therapist for children with autism while earning her bachelor's degree. In January, she started a master's program to become a certified therapist for autistic children.

Over the last few years, she's pieced together between $50,000 and $60,000 in income from her jobs and monthly child support. However, she's working less this semester to make more time for graduate school, which costs her $1,300 per semester. Eventually, she hopes to make upwards of $80,000 as a full-time certified therapist.

In the meantime, her income is barely enough to cover her family's expenses. Transportation and grocery costs have ballooned. Food costs in New York City rose by about 68% between 2013 and 2023 — much more than the national average of 49%, the state comptroller found. Lugo is an ALICE, which stands for asset-limited, income-constrained, employed, and describes someone who makes too much to qualify for most assistance, but still struggles to get by. She no longer gets food stamps, and her grocery bills have ballooned as her kids have gotten older.

"I buy food, and it's just gone," she said. "I never thought I would yell at my kids, like, 'Did you guys really just finish all the juice boxes in a day?'"

Despite living a block from the 7 subway train and multiple bus lines, Lugo said she's increasingly found herself taking Ubers, in part because Ozzie is sensitive to the noise on public transit. It helps that Jalene rides transit for free because she's a public school student, and Ozzie takes a city-provided school bus because of his diagnosis.

She's also racked up about $7,000 in credit card debt by treating her kids to occasional meals out and new clothes. She was late on her rent payment last month after putting more money toward paying down her credit card.

"I used to be really good at saving, but my mindset has changed a lot. I'm just like, what am I saving up for?" she said. "I want to travel, I want to make memories with my kids, and that's become more of a priority for me."

When Lugo's parents first moved to Queens from the Dominican Republic about 45 years ago, life was affordable for them, Lugo said. Some of her aunts and uncles were even able to buy co-ops in the area.

But the neighborhood has gentrified. Lugo remembers when the first Starbucks opened up in Jackson Heights in 2008 — it felt like a turning point. A few years ago, her father closed the bodega he owned for decades when the building was sold to a developer. The neighborhood has felt less safe in recent years, she said, with a rise in illegal brothels and disorder on the streets.

Lugo isn't ready to leave the city, but she'd like to raise her kids in a quieter neighborhood. She dreams of moving to Bayside, a wealthier, more suburban part of Queens, but rent and transportation costs out there would be even higher. She thinks that finding any other apartment similar in price and size to her own would be nearly impossible in the city.

Jalene has her sights set on Yale and wants to eventually become a lawyer. Lugo has told her she can only move away for college if she gets a full ride.

"I tell her, 'I want you to live your life. I want you to be a child, but you need to work extremely hard, because a studio is $2,000 right now. I can only imagine how much your generation is going to have to pay in the future,'" Lugo said.

What started as a policy hearing on self-driving cars turned tense for Waymo.

Lawmakers on Wednesday accused the robotaxi company of relying too heavily on Chinese vehicles and offshore labor, leading to a tense back-and-forth during a two-hour Senate hearing.

After autonomous vehicle executives said earlier in the hearing that US companies risk falling behind Chinese rivals, senators flipped that back on Waymo's chief safety officer, Mauricio Peña.

"You said in your testimony that we're locked in a race with China, but it seems like you're getting in bed with China," Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio said, pointing to Waymo's plans to use vehicles made by a subsidiary of Geely, a Chinese automaker.

Peña said the Alphabet-owned company uses a mix of platforms, but Moreno pushed back, questioning if Waymo was using a "backdoor" to sidestep the federal "connected vehicle" rule, which restricts foreign-linked technology in sensitive systems.

Under US rules finalized last year, vehicles with certain autonomous or connected software tied to China will face import restrictions, though key provisions are not yet fully in effect.

Waymo first partnered with Zeekr, a Chinese automaker owned by Geely, in 2021. Since then, the company has spent several years adapting and testing a minivan-style vehicle built by Zeekr for its robotaxi program.

A Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch last month that it will rename the Zeekr robotaxi to Ojai, citing concerns that the US public may be unfamiliar with the Zeekr brand.

Peña said the Chinese-made cars have "no connectivity" and that the driving system is installed in the US. He added that tapping a broader global supply chain helps the company scale faster and remain resilient.

Moreno wasn't buying it. "Giving a natural market to a Chinese company to ship us cars is making us better and creating more jobs for Americans? That's completely ridiculous," he said.

On overseas labor, Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts called Waymo's use of remote human operators in countries outside the US "completely unacceptable."

Peña said that while some operators are located in the US, others work abroad, including in the Philippines. These operators typically step in when robotaxis encounter unusual situations.

"Having people overseas influencing American vehicles is a safety issue," Markey said. He warned that these workers may need to react "in a split second" during dangerous scenarios, yet are located overseas.

Markey also tied the issue to jobs, saying that Waymo is moving some roles overseas while developing technology that could replace US taxi and ride-hailing drivers.

Earlier in the hearing, Waymo and Tesla executives framed autonomous vehicles as a race the US cannot afford to lose.

Waymo warned that Chinese companies could set global standards for self-driving technology if Washington fails to act by setting regulations that could help companies move fast. 

"We are locked in a race with Chinese companies for the future of autonomous vehicles," Peña told lawmakers, adding that without a clear national framework, the US risks a "fragmented landscape of state regulations" that slows investment and limits access.

Tesla struck a similar note.

"For America to lead in AV technology, we must modernize regulations that inhibit the industry's ability to innovate," said Lars Moravy, Tesla's vice president of vehicle engineering, referring to autonomous vehicle technology.

"Federal regulations for vehicles have not kept up with the pace of the rapid evolution of technology. Many standards were implemented decades ago and do not adequately address modern advancements," he added.

Industry leaders have repeatedly warned about China's lead in the EV market.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said in an episode of The Verge's "Decoder" podcast that "the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry."

"There's no real competition from Tesla, GM, or Ford with what we've seen from China. It is completely dominating the EV landscape globally and more and more outside of China," he said in September.

Monday - Friday, 11:00 - 12:00 SIN/HK  |  0500 - 06:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse. Subscribe here.

"It's easier said than done," is a phrase I have now heard several times from different experts as we discussed the feasibility of the terms of the U.S.-India trade deal.

Less than a week after the India-EU trade pact was finalized, U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday announced in a post on Truth Social that he had agreed a deal with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling him a "great friend." 

Trump said Washington would cut tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%, while New Delhi will lower duties on U.S. goods to zero, replace Russian oil with supply from U.S. and Venezuela, open sensitive markets such as agriculture and buy $500 billion worth of American goods.

Modi, in his response on X, expressed delight over the lowering of tariff of 18%, thanked Trump and extended support for his "efforts for [global] peace."

Despite the outpourings of warm sentiment on both sides, the deal risks being derailed. What was said by the two leaders — and what was left unsaid — is already leading to confusion.

"US President Trump's claims that India will slash duties to zero, stop importing Russian oil, and raise US imports to US $500 bn have not yet been confirmed by the Indian authorities," said Alexandra Hermann, lead economist at Oxford Economics.

"They look unrealistic to us, which in turn raises risks of US backtracking," she added.

That would not be the first time Trump reverses a trade deal. 

Last month, Trump raised tariffs on South Korean imports back to 25% from 15%, pointing to a delay in the South Korean legislature approving the agreed trade deal.

Nomura in a report on Tuesday said that India's trade deal with the U.S. is a significant breakthrough, but  "no deal is certain," citing Trump's renewed threat to raise tariffs on South Korea.

India's first official deviation from the terms of trade proposed by Trump came on Tuesday as New Delhi's Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said the deal will protect "the interest of our agriculture and our dairy sectors in full respect."

His counterparts in Washington, however, are doubling down on Trump's claim that India will remove non-tariff barriers to its agricultural market for the U.S. and remove tariffs on a majority of farm imports.

On Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said India will cut tariffs to zero on a "vast" set of agricultural goods, adding that there will be some protection around few certain key areas.

"For a variety of things like tree nuts, wine, spirits, fruits, vegetables, tariffs will go down to zero," Greer told CNBC's Squawk Box. "It is a big win." 

The domestic farm sector is important for both the U.S. and Indian administrations. 

In December last year, the Trump administration doled out a $12 billion aid package to support farmers, who are facing financial distress due to the trade war between the U.S. and its top economic partners. 

Washington needs newer markets, as trade ties with its second and fifth largest agricultural export markets, Canada and the European Union, respectively, have been deteriorating. The U.S. president even threatened Canada with 100% tariffs, if it signs a trade deal with China. His plans to annex Greenland have also led to souring of ties between the E.U. and the U.S.

As for India, farming is the primary source of livelihood for about 42% of India's 1.4 billion population — and is hence a politically sensitive issue. The Modi government's last attempt to introduce farm reforms ended in a failure in 2021, facing intense protests from farm lobbies in the country. 

India is likely to remain cautious about sweeping tariff reductions in "politically sensitive areas such as agriculture" where domestic considerations "remain strong," said Reema Bhattacharya, head of Asia risk insight, corporate risk and sustainability at Singapore-based consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.

This year, three major state elections are due — in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, all of which are ruled by opposition political parties and have strong farm lobbies.

The Indian government has been scant with details about the trade deal and is battling questions from opposition political parties. The leader of India's opposition, Rahul Gandhi, has accused Modi of being "Compromised" and of having "surrendered on Tariffs."

"Without adequate adjustment measures, a surge in lower-priced food imports could displace certain indigenous products, dampen incentives for domestic value addition, and weaken parts of the FMCG ecosystem," said Nitin Bhasin, head of institutional equities at Indian brokerage and research firm Ambit. 

Questions are also being raised about the feasibility of Washington's demand for India to stop purchases of Russian oil completely and replace it with U.S. or Venezuelan oil. 

If India stops buying Russian crude entirely, it will damage the long-standing relationship between New Delhi and Moscow, experts said.

"New Delhi will not sever its strategically important relationship with Moscow," said Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House. 

On Wednesday, India's trade and commerce minister reiterated the country's position that energy security was a top priority for the government. He added that decisions around energy purchases were made based on market and "evolving international dynamics."

Despite U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies and repeated claims by Washington about India halting Russian oil imports, data from consultancy firm Rystad Energy shows Russia remains the top crude oil supplier to New Delhi with 1.06 million barrels per day shipped in January. 

Kremlin has insisted that New Delhi has not made "any statements" on stopping supplies from Russia. 

India is a price-sensitive buyer in the global oil trade, said Avani Bhatnagar senior analyst of oil markets at Rystad Energy, adding that "India's pivot away from Russian crude would likely increase procurement costs." 

Experts say that at present, Russian crude is cheaper than its peers due to U.S. sanctions, and replacing it with U.S. crude will not be economical because of higher freight costs.

Data from commodity intelligence firm Kpler shows that Russian ural crude is currently trading at a discount of $11 per barrel against U.S. Brent. Middle Eastern crude grades cost up to $9 per barrel more than Russian oil.

"Russian crude is significantly cheaper," said Muyu Xu, senior oil analyst at Kpler, adding that halting purchases would squeeze refining margins for Indian state-owned companies such as Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum.

With strategic and economic interests at stake, India is unlikely to stop Russian crude imports, according to experts. However, that is a key demand from Washington, so this could be another point of friction in the trade deal. 

"The energy tradeoff for India is potentially a worse import bill and current account pressures at a time when capital outflow pressures from India are persistent," said Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics.

Adding further stress to India's import bill is the commitment to buy more American goods. India's overall goods import stood at $720.24 billion in financial year 2025, with its trade deficit at $94.3 billion. That includes goods worth $45.3 billion from the U.S. 

Now, the U.S. administration wants India to buy half a trillion worth of American defense, transportation, energy and farm goods. Even at a staggered pace, experts believe this number would be hard to achieve.

"Analysts would be wise to ignore some of the numbers in the deal, or at least treat them as aspirational," Evan A. Feigenbaum, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in an article on Tuesday.

The Indian commerce minister has hinted that New Delhi could increase imports from the U.S. in sectors such as energy, nuclear power, data centers and aviation, but did not share much details. 

Bajpaee of Chatham House said that India could buy products from those sectors, but "reaching the target of $500bn is a stretch."

Neither side has announced an explicit date for the formal announcement of the deal but India's Goyal said a joint statement will be issued soon. 

Meanwhile, Bhattacharya of risk management firm Verisk suggests investors to look at "headline pledges as opening positions rather than settled outcomes." As negotiators hammer out details, she said there could be scope for "renewed friction."

Nitin Jain, chief executive and principal fund manager at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Singapore, said it needs to get earnings growth, which has faltered in the last 18 months, back on track. He added that Indian market valuations are below their 10-year average.

Pieter Elbers, chief executive of IndiGo, said the airline plans to expand its global network. He added that IndiGo was re-building its business after the massive disruption to operations in December.

Phillip Wool, head of research at Rayliant Global Advisors, said that India was a disappointment among emerging markets in 2025 and the budget did little to improve sentiment of disheartened foreign investors.

India courts Big Tech with long‑term tax breaks. India has announced a 20-year tax exemption for hyperscalers that use data centers in the country to service global clients, in a move that could shift artificial intelligence-driven businesses to the South Asian country.

China set to attend India's upcoming AI summit. China plans to send a delegation to India's upcoming AI summit in the latest sign of improving ties between the two neighbors.

Blackrock CEO, Indian billionaire give Indians advice on investing. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani want Indians to invest in the country's equity markets instead of gold.

Indian stocks dipped on Thursday, with the Nifty 50 index down 0.7% and the Sensex falling 0.6% as of 2.15 p.m. local time (3:15 a.m. ET). On year-to-date basis, both indexes are 2.09% and 2.38% lower respectively.The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield ticked down slightly to 6.67%, marking its third straight day of declining.

Shares of Sweden's Volvo Cars tumbled more than 22.5% on Thursday, with the company recording its worst trading day ever.

The automaker, which is owned by China's Geely Holding, posted a substantial drop in fourth-quarter operating profit, citing the impact of U.S. tariffs, negative currency effects and weak demand, before Thursday's opening bell.

Volvo Cars said fourth-quarter operating income excluding items affecting comparability came in at 1.8 billion Swedish krona ($200.46 million), reflecting a 68% drop compared to the same period a year prior. 

"We have a very challenging market, especially in China, very tough competition. All of our European colleagues have the same problem," Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Thursday.

He added the discontinuation of EV incentives in the U.S. and China were also contributing to "a very challenging external environment."

"But internally we have had very good work done with lowering our costs and securing a positive cash flow, so that I would highlight as the most important positive things that we have reached during the year," he added.

Shares of Volvo Cars lost 22.5%, having been down more than 28% earlier in the day. Its previous worst single-session fall was 11.1%.

Analysts at UBS said that based on Volvo Cars' profit miss, they anticipate 10%-15% downgrades to full-year 2026 consensus earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), "possibly more given the underlying EBIT margin was close to 0%" in the final three months of 2025.

The U.S. and EU agreed to a framework trade deal in July last year, one which saw the Trump administration impose a blanket tariff of 15% on most EU goods, a significant reduction from Trump's threat of 30% and almost halving the tariff rate on Europe's auto sector from 27.5%.

Industry groups, which tentatively welcomed the trade deal at the time, expressed deep concern about the costs associated with the new tariffs.

Volvo Cars has long been considered one of the most exposed European carmakers to U.S. tariffs.

Looking ahead, Volvo Cars said deliveries of its new and fully electric EX60 mid-size SUV will ramp up during the second half of the year. 

However, it warned that 2026 is likely to be another challenging one, with continued pricing pressure, tariff effects, regulatory uncertainty and softer consumer sentiment likely to weigh on the industry.

Pandora, the world's largest jeweler by volume, rose Thursday after the company addressed investor concerns about its reliance on silver. 

Copenhagen-listed shares rose as much as 7% after it guided for largely flat organic growth in 2026 alongside its quarterly earnings report, and said it would introduce platinum-plated jewelry after the price of silver had more than doubled over the past year. Shares were last seen trading 4.9% higher. 

"If you look at our volatility of silver, one of the things that we have to [do] for the company is to decouple that from the silver trading," CEO Berta de Pablos-Barbier told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

"Varying our basket from new metals is going to help us, because we will not be so dependent on only one metal, which is today silver," she said, adding that about 60% of Pandora's business today was silver. 

While spot silver was down over 12% early Thursday at around $80 an ounce, it is still up more than 150% from about $30 an ounce a year ago.

Analysts have warned that the volatile price of silver was a "pernicious problem" for the Danish jeweler. A more pressured consumer has also impacted sales. 

Jefferies analysts on Tuesday said investors will be hesitant to engage with Pandora given recent silver moves. "The challenges of the last few months will mean, even in a more normal silver price world, [Pandora] will remain substantially cheaper than even a year ago."

Pandora stock has fallen around 60% over the past 12 months. 

This year, Pandora expects organic growth to land somewhere between negative 1% and 2%, and a profit (earnings before interest and tax) margin of between 21% and 22%.

De Pablos-Barbier, who took up the role as CEO last month, told CNBC that moving to a platinum-plated material and expanding its portfolio would allow the company to keep margins in the 20's. 

In the fourth quarter, organic growth was 4% as demand in the U.S. market, which accounts for about a third of its business, remained soft.

"The reality is that we are seeing the lowest consumer sentiment since the 60s in that market," De Pablos-Barbier said. "This is nothing I can control, what I can control is what I bring to the brand and how much excitement and new products I can bring to the U.S. consumers, so that they continue to be loyal and they continue to come to our stores."

Like-for-like growth, which measures sales across comparable stores, was flat in the quarter as well as during the first month of 2026, Pandora said.

It was also the first quarter of negative like-for-like growth since late 2022 in Pandora's strategically important "Fuel with More" segment, which focuses on expanding beyond the traditional charms it's known for into new categories like rings, necklaces and lab-grown diamonds, Citi analysts noted. 

"Extreme precious metals inflation has materially reduced earnings visibility," the analysts said. "Near-term confidence is further undermined by a volatile US and European macro backdrop (~80% of sales) and potential signs of brand fatigue and broader jewellery consumption softening."

The jeweler posted a 6% organic growth for 2025, preannounced in January, down from 13% in the previous year and missing its own guidance of between 7% and 8%.

If you thought the Anthropic ads roasting ChatGPT were funny, you weren't the only one.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said he, too, thought they were funny, but he also had some complaints.

"First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed," he wrote in a lengthy X post on Wednesday. "But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest."

Anthropic, the maker of the AI chatbot Claude, shared four ads online on Wednesday. The campaign is set to run during the Super Bowl on Sunday and takes direct aim at OpenAI's decision to roll out advertising on ChatGPT.

"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude," the ad, which doesn't mention OpenAI or ChatGPT by name, says.

The ads feature a human playing a fictional version of a chatbot who jarringly interjects mid-conversation to push a product. In one ad, when the user asks for help achieving a six-pack quickly, the stand-in chatbot answers and then also suggests buying a specific pair of insoles to appear taller, along with a discount code.

"Our most important principle for ads says that we won't do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that," Altman said of the ads, calling them "deceptive."

Altman said OpenAI believes everyone deserves access to AI and is focused on bringing AI to billions of people who can't afford to pay for subscriptions.

OpenAI offers individual plans for ChatGPT that range from free to $200 a month. Individual plans for Anthropic's Claude range from free to $100 a month. Both also offer team and enterprise plans.

"More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do," he said, adding, "Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people."

First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won't do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic…

Anthropic did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Altman said OpenAI would run its own Super Bowl Ad that was "about builders, and how anyone can now build anything."

Pandora, which is known for its iconic silver bracelets, is betting on a different precious metal in 2026 — platinum.

The Danish jewelry brand will introduce platinum-plated versions of some of its best-selling bracelets this year to reduce its exposure to price-volatile silver, it said in a Wednesday press release.

The platinum-plated range will extend to its charm selection in the second half of the year, it added.

The company said in the press release that this decision was made after "the price of silver and gold has skyrocketed over the past year."

"By introducing platinum-plated products, Pandora will reduce its reliance on sterling silver while continuing to offer consumers high‑quality, desirable jewellery at accessible price points," the press release said.

Pandora, which was founded in Copenhagen in 1982, now has about 2,400 stores in more than 100 countries, according to its website. Its stock price is down about 63% in the past year.

Representatives for Pandora did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Pandora's move "showcases a business undergoing a significant recalibration of its product offer, customer proposition, and supply chain," Jefferies analysts wrote on Wednesday.

The shift also underscores how jewelry makers are being forced to rethink materials and pricing as precious-metal markets turn increasingly volatile, after a year of historic gains.

Pandora is not the only luxury jewelry brand moving away from silver. LVMH executives said in a January earnings call that it is directing Tiffany & Co. to reduce its reliance on silver and move toward gold and fine jewelry.

Silver has been on a blistering rally, with prices surging as much as 70% in January following a roughly 170% jump last year, driven by a combination of tight supply, heavy investment demand, strong industrial use, and speculation.

Spot prices hit a record high above $121 troy ounce last week before crashing as much as 36% on Friday in the white metal's worst single-day drop since 1980.

Prices have since clawed back some losses, but analysts continue to warn that volatility is likely to remain elevated.

Spot silver was trading around $77 per troy ounce at 9:49 p.m. ET on Wednesday, still up about 25% year to date. Spot gold, meanwhile, is around $4,862 per ounce.

Platinum prices have also climbed sharply alongside silver and gold. The metal rose about 165% last year and is up roughly 8.4% so far this year, reinforcing the cost pressures that jewelry makers face.

Elon Musk will have to sit for a deposition for lawyers to examine his role in dismantling USAID, a Maryland judge ruled.

In an eight-page order released on Tuesday, US District Judge Theodore Chuang rejected a request from Musk and officials linked to the Department of Government Efficiency to forgo a deposition.

It ordered him, along with former acting USAID director Peter Marocco and Department of State official Jeremy Lewin, to be deposed. Musk's legal team had tried to use the "apex doctrine" to avoid the deposition, a rule that allows high-ranking government officials to avoid depositions in some situations.

The deposition is part of a lawsuit against Musk and DOGE officials, filed by current and terminated USAID employees, who remain anonymous.

Chuang said that it was unclear whether Musk, Marocco, and Lewin were "properly deemed to be high-ranking government officials."

He said most of the designated heads of the project were operating in informal or acting roles during the time when USAID was dismantled.

In the filing, Chuang added that Musk and the other officials failed to provide evidence as to why they chose to shut down the USAID headquarters and website, another reason the deposition was necessary.

The filing also listed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Kenneth Jackson, a state department official, and Amy Gleason, a DOGE administrator, as defendants in the case.

USAID, the US Agency for International Development, distributes foreign aid and supports humanitarian causes globally. It was the top target for Musk-led DOGE at the start of President Donald Trump's second term last January.

USAID cuts were part of Musk's efforts to slash spending on government agencies that DOGE deemed wasteful. In February last year, USAID officials announced that the agency would cut its staff from 10,000 to just 300, furloughing the rest.

Musk stepped back from DOGE in May.

Representatives for Musk, USAID, and the Department of State did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Brad Karp stepped down as chairman of Big Law firm Paul Weiss on Wednesday amid scrutiny over his ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Scott Barshay was named the new chairman of the global firm, which has more than 1,000 attorneys, "effective immediately," the firm said in a news release.

"Leading Paul, Weiss for the past 18 years has been the honor of my professional life," Karp was quoted as saying in the release. "Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed a focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm."

Karp is among the elite names to appear in 3 million documents released by the Justice Department last week from its investigation into Epstein, who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.

The latest documents showed that in 2019, Karp reviewed a court filing Epstein was preparing to oppose efforts to reopen his 2008 plea deal with Florida state prosecutors on sex crime charges.

"The draft motion is in great shape. It's overwhelmingly persuasive. Truly," Karp wrote in an email. "I particularly liked the argument that the 'victims' lied in wait and sat on their rights for their strategic advantage, knowing you were in prison, before they came forward."

At the time, Epstein was in prison, awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. He killed himself in his cell months later.

The new tranche of files also detailed Karp's email correspondence with Epstein on other matters, from coordinating dinners to discussing legal representation for New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. In other messages, Karp served as an intermediary in matters involving Epstein and former Apollo CEO Leon Black. At one point, Karp also asked Epstein to help his son land a role in a Woody Allen movie.

In a 2015 email, Karp wrote: "I can't thank you enough for including me in an evening I'll never forget. It was truly 'once in a lifetime' in every way, though I hope to be invited again. You are an extraordinary host -- and your home....!!! Thanks, again. See you soon."

Epstein responded, "you are always welcome. . there are many many nights of unique talents. you will be invited often." And Karp closed the conversation with, "You're amazing....and thank you!"

The Epstein Files haven't been the only source of controversy for Karp. Last year, he came under fire from some for striking an agreement with President Donald Trump under which Paul Weiss pledged $40 million in pro bono legal work in exchange for the president rescinding an executive order targeting the firm.

In a statement two days before Karp relinquished the chairmanship, Paul Weiss said in a statement, as reported by Reuters, that he met Epstein through Black.

"During the course of that representation, which spanned several years, Mr. Karp never witnessed or participated in any misconduct," the statement said.

"Mr. Karp attended two group dinners in New York City and had a small number of social interactions by email, all of which he regrets."

Karp has been at Paul Weiss for four decades and has been chair of the firm since 2008. Throughout his career, he represented high-profile corporate clients such as Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Bank of America.

"Mr. Karp will continue to focus his full-time attention to client service at the firm," Paul Weiss said in a press release.

 Major stock indexes and bitcoin fell Thursday amid broad risk-off sentiment, as investors weighed the latest Big Tech earnings and downbeat labor data.


 The tech-heavy Nasdaq, benchmark S&P 500, and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average were down a respective 0.8%, 0.7% and 0.6% in recent trading, with the Dow shedding 300 points. The Nasdaq was on pace for its worst week since last April.


 Yesterday, technology shares led the Nasdaq and S&P 500 lower for a second straight session as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped 17%, while the Dow ended higher. AMD shares were down nearly 4% further in recent trading.


 Jobless claims for the week ending Jan. 31 came in at 231,000, higher than economists' estimates of 212,000 and the prior week's 209,000. In addition, U.S. employers announced more than 108,000 layoffs in January, per Challenger, Gray & Christmas data, their highest level for that month since 2009.


 Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) fell 3% Thursday, a day after the Google parent posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter results but said its 2026 capex would be between $175 billion and $185 billion, roughly double its 2025 level. Investors have been concerned about companies' AI spending in recent months.


 Qualcomm (QCOM) stock sank 7% after its current-quarter forecasts came up short of analysts' estimates, which executives attributed to the global memory shortage.


 In other post-earnings moves, shares of Peloton Interactive (PTON) plummeted 23%, Estee Lauder (EL) retreated 22%, Snap (SNAP) sank 10%, and Shell (SHEL) declined 4.5%. Hershey (HSY) surged 7.5% and Arm Holdings (ARM) added 7%.


 Investors are eagerly anticipating results after the close today from Amazon (AMZN), whose shares fell 3.5% to lead Dow decliners. Fellow Magnificent Seven stocks Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA), which fell a respective 3.8% and 3.4% yesterday, declined 1.5% and rose less than 1%, respectively.


 Bitcoin continued its descent, falling below $67,000—its lowest level since Donald Trump was re-elected U.S. president on Nov. 5, 2024 and recently trading around $66,700. Shares of bitcoin treasury firm Strategy (MSTR) sank 13% to pace Nasdaq decliners ahead of its earnings after markets close today.


 Silver futures, which had reached as high as about $121.75 an ounce last Thursday, sank 10% to below $76. Gold futures, which had surged to roughly $5,625 an ounce a week ago, slipped 1.2% to $4,890.


 The yield on the 10-year Treasury—which impacts interest rates on a variety of consumer loans including mortgages—fell to roughly 4.22% from Wednesday's close of 4.28%. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. benchmark, fell 2.4% to $63.60 a barrel.


 The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of global currencies, rose 0.2% to 97.76.


The Job Market Froze Over This Winter

 Layoff announcements were up and job openings down this winter as the job market's hiring freeze deepened, according to two barometers of the job market Thursday.The number of job openings fell to 6.5 million in December from 6.9 million in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday. That was the fewest since 2020. Another red flag popped up in consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas's layoff report for January, which showed companies announced 108,000 job cuts, the most for any January since 2009, and the fewest hires for that month since the firm began tracking hires that year.


 The indicators were unmistakable signs that the job market is being dragged down by President Donald Trump's tariffs, the immigration crackdown, and to a lesser extent, the rise of AI software.

 "The labor market spent much of 2025 bending, but not breaking—and ended the year perilously close to a definitive breaking point," Cory Stahle, senior economist at job site Indeed, wrote in a commentary.


 The layoff rate remained low, suggesting that employers have not turned to large-scale cuts yet, but the risks of that are growing, several economists said.

Google Says Spending Could Double This Year Amid Its AI Push. Investors Don't Seem Excited

 Alphabet (GOOGL) shares slumped Thursday after the Google and YouTube parent laid out massive spending plans to support its AI ambitions.


 The shares were down over 5% in recent trading, after the company forecast $175 billion to $185 billion in capital expenditures this year as it builds out its AI infrastructure, roughly double the $91.45 billion Alphabet spent in 2025.


 With Thursday's move, Alphabet shed some $170 billion of its market value, pulling its market capitalization back below $4 trillion.

 Some Wall Street analysts said they've only become more bullish about the stock after the company's latest results, however. Analysts from JPMorgan, Citi, and Wedbush lifted their price targets following Wednesday's earnings report, given what they viewed as strong signals of AI demand.


 "We acknowledge the concern around investments," Citi analysts wrote. "But given clear AI demand signals, we believe Google should be investing in product and in alleviating capacity challenges."

Consumer Staples Is Only S&P 500 Sector in Green Today

 On a brutal day for the S&P 500, shares of consumer staples are a positive outlier.


 The S&P 500 Consumer Staples Sector was the only one of the 11 industries tracked by the benchmark index to trade in the green Thursday morning, rising some 0.7%.


 Four declined by more than 2%, with the Consumer Discretionary Sector down nearly 3%.


 Hershey (HSY) advanced 8% to pace consumer staples after the chocolate giant reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and issued a rosy 2026 outlook. Costco Wholesale (COST) and Coca-Cola (KO) also were among the top gainers in the sector, up nearly 2% and 1.5%, respectively.

The Great Inflation of 2021 Is Still Haunting the Fed

 The surge of inflation that took hold after the pandemic is still hurting household budgets and still very much on the minds of officials at the Federal Reserve.In recent public speeches, Fed officials talked about the long shadow of the burst of price increases in 2021 and 2022, and how that high inflation is still lingering in a diminished form. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.7% over the year in December—far lower than the four-decade high of 9% in 2022, but remaining above the elusive 2% goal for nearly five years.


 Fed officials held the central bank's key interest rate steady at their most recent meeting last month, after cutting it by a quarter-point at the previous three meetings to boost the job market. Concerns about inflation kept them from cutting the rate again, several Fed members said this week.

 The fed funds rate influences borrowing costs on all kinds of loans. The Federal Open Market Committee typically lowers it to encourage spending and boost the job market, and raises it to do the opposite and push down inflation.


 This week, Fed officials continued to mull whether inflation or the threat of joblessness posed the biggest risk to the central bank's dual mandate to keep prices stable and employment high, and how much they should cut interest rates in the months ahead, if at all."While we've made a lot of progress on inflation, it still remains above our target," Thomas Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said in a speech in South Carolina on Tuesday, according to prepared remarks. "That's been the case since 2021."

Qualcomm's Disappointing Outlook Stokes Worries About a Global Memory Shortage. The Stock Is Tumbling

 Qualcomm's stock is getting hammered amid worries about a worsening memory shortage.


 Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) plunged over 9% in recent trading after the chipmaker gave a disappointing outlook for the current quarter, and pointed to a tightening supply of memory components that's impacting the smartphone market.

 Qualcomm, which makes processors that are used in smartphones, laptops, and cars, said it expects a weaker smartphone market in the short term as companies navigate a global memory shortage that's expected to drive phone and laptop prices higher.

Bitcoin's Price Fell Below $70,000. That Means Extra Attention on Strategy's Earnings

 Bitcoin has slipped below another five-digit milestone.


 The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization—at about $1.39 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap—recently changed hands at prices not seen since late 2024, dropping below $70,000 apiece. The price hasn't been cut in half since its record highs of around $125,000, recorded last fall, but the retreat is nevertheless severe.


 The latest round of defections from bitcoin has come as investors have lately moved away from risk assets and, in some cases, shifted portfolio allocations toward more defensive plays. 


Getty Images

 Ask a market maven what's next and you're likely to get a range of answers. Bulls still talk about bitcoin's long-term potential—not just to recover, but to post the kind of parabolic returns it long saw. Bears see substantial further losses ahead. In the meantime, the trading action is hitting not only crypto assets itself but related stocks.


 One of those may fuel one or both of those narratives later today: Big bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR), previously known as MicroStrategy, is set to report quarterly results after today's close. The company earlier this week reported its latest purchase, which brought the adverage prices it's paid for the bitcoin it owns to around $76,000.

Ciena to Replace Dayforce in S&P 500

 Ciena (CIEN) has been tapped to move up to the S&P 500.


 After markets closed yesterday, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that the networking systems company will join the benchmark index from the S&P MidCap 400, effective before the opening bell next Monday, Feb. 9.


 Ciena will be replacing Dayforce after it was acquired and taken private by Thoma Bravo in a deal that closed Wednesday.

 In addition, S&P SmallCap 600 component Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (ARWR) on Monday will replace Ciena in the S&P MidCap 400, while ADT (ADT) will replace Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals in the S&P SmallCap 600.


 Ciena shares slipped 1% before the bell Thursday, while ADT and Arrowhead were up about 3% and 1%, respectively.


Don't Like Trump's Economy? Maybe You Will Next Year

 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent came to Congress Wednesday with a message to critics who say his administration's tariffs are not delivering on promises to re-industrialize the country: give it some time.


 Bessent answered questions from the House Financial Services Committee in a hearing Wednesday, addressing tariffs, the president's attacks on the Federal Reserve, and other economic matters.


 Bessent faced a mixture of supportive and critical questions from lawmakers during his testimony.

 Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from New York, pointed out that the economy has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs every month since Trump imposed sweeping import taxes on most U.S. trading partners last year.


 Bessent said a slew of factories have broken ground in response to the tariffs, which are intended to tip the scales in favor of domestic manufacturing over imports. Those factories will take some time to get up and running, he said.

Peloton Stock Tanks on Weak Results, Outlook

 Peloton Interactive (PTON) reported weaker-than-estimated results for its holiday quarter. Its current-quarter and full-year projections aren't so hot, either.


 Peloton shares sank 9% in premarket trading Thursday after the connected fitness company posted less revenue and a wider loss than analysts were expecting.


 The New York-based firm reported a fiscal 2026 second-quarter loss of 9 cents per shares on revenue that slipped 3% year-over-year to $656.5 million. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha had expected a loss of 6 cents per share on revenue of $677.2 million.

 For the current quarter and full year, Peloton sees revenue of $624 million and a range of $2.40 billion to $2.44 billion, respectively. Visible Alpha consensus is for $637 million and $2.48 billion, respectively.


 In October, Peloton announced a relaunched product line and higher subscription and hardware prices.


 "The new Cross Training Series is resonating in the marketplace, our subscription base is highly committed, our integrated Commercial Business Unit is growing and well-positioned to continue doing so, and Member engagement with Peloton IQ is encouraging," CEO Peter Stern said. "Looking ahead, our focus remains on executing our strategy to increase our share of the growing global wellness economy while continuing to enhance our magic formula of premium hardware, intuitive software, and unmatched human coaching."


 Peloton shares entered the day down 22% over the past year.


Amazon, UPS and Other Major Companies Are Making Big Job Cuts. Is AI To Blame?

 The labor market limped into 2026, and big layoff announcements in recent weeks have added fresh anxiety to the fragile jobs picture.


 Amazon.com (AMZN) said it plans to eliminate about 16,000 corporate roles, while United Parcel Service (UPS) announced 30,000 new job cuts, following an even larger reduction last year. Chemical manufacturing company Dow (DOW) slashed 4,500 jobs, or roughly 12% of its workforce, while Home Depot (HD) and Nike (NKE) each cut hundreds more.


Bess Adler / Bloomberg / Getty Images

 For many workers, the fear isn't just about layoffs—it's about why they're happening. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 71% of Americans worry artificial intelligence could permanently replace their job.


 With AI frequently cited in corporate earnings calls and layoff announcements, it's easy to connect the dots. But when economists and labor researchers dig into the data, a more complicated—and far less AI-driven picture—emerges.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), the world's largest Ethereum-focused treasury company is now sitting on nearly $8 billion in paper losses after ether ETH$1,953.56 fell below $2,000 on Thursday.

The firm, helmed by well-followed Wall Street bull Thomas Lee, accumulated 4.29 million ETH at an estimated cost of $16.4 billion, according to data from DropStab. That stash is now worth just $8.4 billion at current prices. 

BMNR stock fell another 9% Thursday to its lowest point since the company pivoted to an Ethereum strategy. It has now tumbled 88% from its July peak, as investor concern grows on the firm's ETH exposure and collapsing prices.

Despite the sharp drawdown, BitMine is under no immediate pressure to liquidate its assets. Unlike many other digital asset treasuries, the company used equity issuance — and not borrowed funds — to fund its ether purchase spree and other investments.

The firm also holds $538 million in cash and has begun generating income from staking more than 2.9 million ETH, according to its Monday update.

"There is no pressure to sell any ETH at these levels, because there are not debt covenants or other restrictions/provisions," Thomas Lee said in a statement, "BitMine is in a position to ride out crypto volatility while earning recurring income and staking rewards."

Altcoins bore the brunt of the latest market sell-off as a wave of forced liquidations swept through major tokens.

Altcoins bore the brunt of market stress over the past 24 hours as a sharp leverage unwind triggered widespread liquidations across major tokens. The liquidations wiped out more than $1.4 billion in positions and exposing heavy long-side positioning among traders.

Data from Coinglass shows that the sell-off accelerated rapidly. Liquidations climbed from $427.8 million in just one hour to $661.6 million over four hours, before reaching $930.2 million within 12 hours. 

Over a full 24-hour period, total liquidations stood at approximately $1.44 billion.

Crucially, the bulk of the damage came from long positions. Of the $1.44 billion liquidated, around $1.26 billion were long trades, compared to just $187 million in short liquidations. 

Source: Coinglass

The imbalance points to a market that was positioned for a rebound in altcoins, only to be caught offside as prices continued to slide.

While Bitcoin's decline provided broader market pressure, liquidation data suggests that altcoins absorbed a disproportionate share of the forced unwinding. 

Ethereum led losses among major tokens, recording more than $120 million in liquidations within the last hour alone, as leveraged long positions were flushed across multiple exchanges.

Solana followed with roughly $33 million in liquidations, while XRP saw more than $13 million wiped out over the same period. 

Dogecoin and Sui also registered elevated liquidation activity, underscoring how widespread the deleveraging event became across large-cap and mid-cap altcoins.

Exchange-level data reinforces the scale of the move. On a 24-hour basis, long liquidations dominated across major trading venues, with platforms such as Binance, Bybit, Hyperliquid, OKX, and Gate all recording significantly higher long-side losses than short-side liquidations. 

The pattern points to a coordinated unwind rather than isolated exchange-specific events.

Beyond headline figures, the pace of liquidations has become a key concern. In several instances, liquidation spikes occurred within narrow time windows, amplifying downside momentum as forced selling fed into falling prices. 

Such rapid cascades often exacerbate volatility, particularly in altcoins where order books tend to be thinner and leverage usage higher than in Bitcoin markets.

Historical liquidation data over the past 90 days shows similar episodes coinciding with abrupt market corrections. 

However, the current episode ranks among the more severe in terms of long-side dominance. This type of leverage reset is a short-term stabilizing force, albeit one that often comes at the cost of sharp price drawdowns.

With a significant portion of leveraged longs already cleared, near-term price action may stabilize if selling pressure eases. 

However, continued volatility remains a risk should broader market weakness persist or if traders attempt to re-enter positions too aggressively.

Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest publicly traded corporate holder of bitcoin BTC$65,689.32, is seeing a quick rise in losses on its vast holdings.

The company currently owns 713,502 BTC at an average acquisition price of $76,052. With spot bitcoin trading near $67,000, this represents an unrealized loss of almost $6.5 billion, or roughly 12% relative to that average cost basis.

Read more: Michael Saylor's bitcoin stack is officially underwater, but here's why he likely won't reach for the panic button

MSTR shares are down about 13% on the day, making Thursday the largest single-day decline in nearly one year. The stock's now down 66% year-over-year and nearly 80% from a record high reached shortly after Donald Trump's election victory in November 2024.

Despite that massive drawdown, Strategy continues to trade at a modest premium to the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet, known in the trade as an mNAV (multiple of net asset value) greater than one — it's currently about 1.09. This suggests that Michael Saylor and team have the capacity to continue issuing common stock with which to purchase additional bitcoin, without the move being dilutive to shareholders.

The company reports its fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday evening. No surprises are expected in the results, but investors will surely be interested to see what Saylor has to say, given the current market panic.

Meanwhile, STRC, Strategy's perpetual preferred equity instrument, marketed as a high-yield, high-credit, money-market-style product, is trading around $95, below its $100 par value. If STRC fails to recover to par by month's end, the dividend rate is expected to step up by an additional 25 basis points to 11.5%.

The only other comparable perpetual preferred equity currently trading is Strive's (ASST) SATA, which is down roughly 4% at $86 and would also likely require a dividend increase to return to par. Strive's common equity, ASST, is down approximately 11% on the day, trading near $0.52 per share.

Market volatility returned to the spotlight on Thursday as investor concerns intensified, with the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)—a key gauge of anticipated market swings—surged above the 20 handle.

The index climbed sharply, rising nearly 11.3% and briefly touching 23.1, marking its highest level

Blockchains should refocus on their original purpose: finance, Solana Foundation President Lily Liu wrote on X Thursday, rejecting years of narratives that attempted to frame the technology as a generalized replacement for the modern internet.



“Blockchains have always been and always will be tech for finance,” Liu wrote, describing financialization and open capital markets as the sector's core value proposition.



Liu, who will be speaking at Consensus Hong Kong next week, was particularly dismissive of past efforts to push blockchains into gaming and broad “web3” consumer narratives, calling them intellectually lazy and overly reliant on marketing rather than genuine market creation. She criticized the idea that simply placing existing applications on a blockchain, often under the banner of “read, write, own” would automatically generate value, arguing instead that meaningful adoption requires the creation of entirely new financial markets.



The comments land at a moment when crypto prices have been plunging, with bitcoin, ether and other major tokens sliding amid macroeconomic uncertainty and fading speculative demand. Despite the downturn, institutional interest remains strong, as traditional financial firms continue exploring tokenization, onchain settlement and payments rails.



Liu's remarks also come as other industry leaders are narrowing their own visions for blockchain utility. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently signaled a desire to double down on Ethereum's layer-1 scaling roadmap, pulling focus away from a sprawling layer-2-centric approach that has dominated Ethereum's strategy in recent years. The shift reflects doubling down on fragmented ecosystems to focus on usability and coherence.



Taken together, the comments highlight a broader recalibration underway across the industry: as prices fall, industry leaders are doubling down that the technology underpinning all of this still has its purpose.

A leaked pitch to reshape Ethereum's leadership exposed deep divisions over politics, power and ether's static price

US crypto developer Danny Ryan submitted a proposal in November 2024 to Vitalik Buterin, the founder and symbolic leader of Ethereum, a prominent blockchain powering the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. Ryan, who had worked for seven years at the Ethereum Foundation (EF), Ethereum's de facto governing body, suggested that Ethereum could be on the cusp of an era-defining shift.

Since its founding in 2014, the foundation had prioritized technical upgrades and had avoided centralizing power while its user base was growing, but Ethereum had now grown up, and the cryptocurrency world around it had grown up, too. The EF could now “exercise a stronger voice” without compromising its ethos of decentralization, Ryan said – and he was open to leading that charge if appointed as the foundation's new executive director.

Ryan told the Guardian that he could see how political tides were changing “overnight”, which informed his proposal. In part, his thesis drew from personal experience: He'd been served by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2024, only to have the case summarily dropped, which he suspects was a pragmatic move to avoid alienating the tech sector during Joe Biden's re-election campaign. By November, with Donald Trump poised to return to the White House as the self-appointed “crypto president”, Ryan could identify “a massive American-shaped opportunity”.

Trump's re-election was heavily bankrolled by crypto companies and advocacy groups; the sector had established lucrative ties to the Trump family, and expected a slate of policy changes in its favor. A second Trump administration was likely to bolster the crypto industry's ability to expand into the traditional financial sector, and vice versa, further buoying up Ethereum's prospects. These new political and economic realities meant a “stronger voice” from the EF that could mean a windfall for Ethereum – a logic that helped catalyze a high-profile leadership shakeup within the Ethereum ecosystem, and, once the dust settled, anointed new leaders tasked with wooing Wall Street.

Despite strong winds at the industry's back, the value of Ethereum's proprietary cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), is down 20% from one year ago, part of a widespread slump in crypto's value. The price has remained almost unchanged since November 2024, when Ryan made his pitch, which is the same as it was in 2022, an asset at risk of depreciating in a world of high risk.

The Ethereum blockchain is a hub for hundreds of billions of dollars of financial products. Ether is the world's second largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization hovering around $400bn. Founded in 2013 by programmer Buterin, ether is also the largest cryptocurrency to have a known leader. The identity of the founder of Bitcoin, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, is not publicly known. Following Ethereum's launch, Buterin and others established the EF as a non-profit tasked with cultivating the Ethereum ecosystem – a centralized, neutral entity designed to grow a decentralized technological movement – and writing grants to ecosystem participants in line with that mission; the EF holds more than $600m worth of ETH in treasury. Buterin sits on the EF's board.

“In crypto in general, there are two sides of the space: there's what they call the computer, and what they call the casino,” said Timour Kosters, the founder of Edge City, a series of pop-up residency programs affiliated with Ethereum. The “computer” side looks to tackle systemic issues by building tech solutions, Kosters explained; the “casino” side leans into finance, including some scams. The two most prominent ideological camps within Ethereum follow this rule of thumb. On one end is Ethereum's traditional and more libertarian ideological base, the “Cypherpunks”, who see privacy, decentralized protocols and freedom from state power as tools for individual freedom. On the other end, according to Paul Dylan-Ennis, a scholar who studies Ethereum's subcultures, is a more “pragmatist” and “populist” cadre motivated by the price of ETH and seeking to expand institutional adoption of Ethereum and ETH.

Ryan recalled the discussions with Buterin of his proposed strategic plan for the EF as being “positive”, and said the dialogue expanded to include other leaders within the foundation. That included Aya Miyaguchi, the organization's longtime executive director and a steward of Ethereum's traditional ideological core. But then news of these discussions was leaked to the public – opening the floodgates on social media.

On X, some Ethereum users clamored for Ryan's appointment, and lobbied for Miyaguchi's ouster. Eric Conner, a veteran Ethereum developer, suggested “it's revolt time” if the foundation failed to appoint Ryan as its new executive director. Some social media users posted death threats against Miyaguchi, which incensed Buterin.

Some Ethereum community members had been calling for leadership change at the EF over the course of 2024 – long before Ryan's strategic meetings with EF leadership. Many pragmatists thought the foundation was not proactive enough in growing Ethereum's adoption, including among financial institutions. Others blamed Miyaguchi for Ether's relatively static price, as ETH had not skyrocketed in value the way bitcoin and other coins had with Trump's rise.

Paul Brody, who leads blockchain initiatives at Ernst & Young and is the chairman of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a coalition of large businesses adopting Ethereum-based technology, said that, while critiques against Miyaguchi were “tinged with misogyny”, calling for a leadership change because of Ethereum's static price resembles standard investor discontents.

“In some ways, the Ethereum community is behaving a lot like pretty normal shareholders … They want a return on their investment,” he said.

In January 2025, Buterin responded to this community pressure, framing the threats levied against Miyaguchi as “pure evil”. He added that the complaints were “decreasing the chance I have any interest whatsoever in doing ‘what you want'”.

“The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me,” he tweeted.

A former member of the EF, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal foundation matters, said Buterin's social media post was a “turning point” and “uncharacteristic”, as the founder typically “pretended that [Ethereum] was in the hands of the community”. The former EF employee told the Guardian that EF management organized a foundation-wide retreat “in order to force” Buterin into naming a new executive director quickly, as Buterin “couldn't really make up his mind”, and Miyaguchi had wanted to step back “for a while”. The source added that, in personal conversation, Buterin dismissed Ryan's backers as a small but vocal American subset of the global Ethereum ecosystem. By the end, “the old management” was “almost universally hated” by the EF's employees, they said.

Another former EF employee, likewise speaking on the condition of anonymity, similarly noted that Buterin's tweets were a departure from his typical “cosplaying” that he didn't control Ethereum. Buterin and Miyaguchi have a close relationship, the former employee alleged, which informed Buterin's reluctance to find Miyaguchi's replacement more expediently, the source hypothesized.

They claimed Buterin “isn't over” the rejection of his work visa by US authorities in 2012 and remains “resolutely” against EF staff talking to US politicians. The former employee suspected this disfavor counted against Ryan, an American. Buterin only finalized a leadership change once he realized the extent of dissatisfaction within the EF, not just online, the employee concluded.

On 1 March 1, the EF announced the appointment of two co-executive directors: one from each strand of Ethereum's culture, according to Dylan-Ennis, the Ethereum scholar: Tomasz Stańczak, a former vice-president at Citi, and Hsiao-Wei Wang, a veteran Ethereum-focused engineer.

The EF's new leaders were brought on specifically with a “mandate of being more open, communicating more, and [being] responsible to the business world”, which is home to “builders focused on real-world use cases”, Stańczak told the Guardian in November. “Compared to previous years, there is probably much more green light for institutions to adopt Ethereum,” he added. The EF now operates a landing page designed for institutions interested in understanding and potentially adopting Ethereum technology.

Two former EF employees said these basic changes highlight the extent to which the foundation had previously adopted a “defensive posture” and had “worried about the SEC”, using opacity and plausible deniability to avoid legal action. To that end, the EF only published a public-facing organizational chart over the summer, partly anonymizing its employees prior to that shift. The foundation's growth and clear hierarchy also depart from its longstanding decentralized ethos; during her time as executive director, Miyaguchi had called for the EF to “subtract” in size and power over time.

“The surprising twist in recent times is now the EF is seen as very much directing ‘Ethereum the protocol' and, to some extent, ‘Ethereum the culture',” Dylan-Ennis said. “In this sense, [the foundation] has become more important than ever. It is too early to say whether this is for the better or the worse.”

Ryan emphasized in an interview that he has “the utmost respect for Aya Miyaguchi”. The public leak of their discussions around the EF's future led to “a lot of toxicity” that “threw off” their dialogue, he added. Buterin and Ryan decided to amicably “close the door” on their discussions by January 2025. Ryan said this was not solely because of the online campaign, but also due to differences in opinion about the Ethereum Foundation's next steps – including the “American-shaped opportunity” lying beyond the EF's interests.

Connected to other Wall Street-facing Ethereum evangelists by senior EF leadership, Ryan announced in February 2025 that he was co-founding Etherealize, an EF-aligned organization building and marketing Ethereum-based products for traditional financial institutions. Etherealize frequently exercises a strong voice for Ethereum as it does the rounds on Capitol Hill and Wall Street.

Vivek Raman, a co-founder of Etherealize, said Ethereum-focused sales cycles with large financial institutions once spanned years and involved frequent rejection, but are now accelerating, a sign Wall Street is warming to cryptocurrency. Major firms like JP Morgan, Fidelity and BlackRock are seeking to offer financial products issued on blockchains, in a process called “tokenization”, he said, predicting that a wave of these products will enter the market in 2026 after December 2025 launches.

However, ether, like other major cryptocurrencies, is still crawling back from a sudden drop in value.

“The price of crypto has fallen like 40% in the last six months,” said Brody of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. “You don't see people talking about the current leadership … the way they did about Aya 18 months ago. You just don't.”

                Exchange hits all-time stock low as it exits UK, EU, and Australian markets, shuts NFT platform, and refocuses on AI and prediction markets amid crypto downturn.

Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, announced Thursday it is cutting 25% of its workforce and exiting operations in the UK, EU and Australia as part of a major restructuring.

The move comes as Bitcoin dropped below $70,000 Thursday morning, erasing gains made since its $69,000 all-time high in late 2021.

The exchange said it would refocus its business around the US market, AI-powered productivity and prediction markets. In its “Gemini 2.0” update, the company emphasized that smaller, AI-augmented teams are now more effective and aligned with its evolving mission.

Gemini highlighted early traction in its Gemini Predictions platform, which has processed over $24 million in volume since launching in December.

The news comes as Gemini confirmed it will shut down its NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway on February 23, following a prolonged decline in NFT trading volumes. Users have been instructed to withdraw their assets before the shutdown, though NFT support will continue through Gemini Wallet.

The announcement coincided with fresh pressure on crypto markets. Gemini stock, which debuted in September 2025, fell nearly 7% on Thursday, extending losses to nearly 80% from its IPO price and marking a new all-time low.

Gemini said narrowing its geographic footprint and product focus would help lower expenses and accelerate its path to profitability.

         February 05, 2026
      

The United Kingdom's data protection authority, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), has opened a formal investigation into X (formerly Twitter) over image manipulation and the use of personal data in connection with the AI system Grok.

The probe follows widespread reports that the AI chatbot was used to generate harmful and explicit imagery.

The ICO's action comes amid mounting international scrutiny of Grok's image-generation capabilities, which critics say have been exploited to produce “deepfakes” and other visuals manipulated without individuals' consent.

Such uses raise serious concerns under UK data protection laws, particularly regarding whether personal data was processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently, and whether robust safeguards were in place during the development and deployment of the technology.



According to its statement, the ICO will investigate:

The regulator emphasized that failures in appropriate protections could leave people vulnerable to serious, immediate harm — particularly when children are involved.

William Malcolm, the ICO's executive director of Regulatory Risk and Innovation, commented that the reports raise “deeply troubling questions” about the handling of personal data and the extent to which individuals may have lost control over their own information.



The ICO's investigation builds on earlier engagements with Grok's operators. On January 7, 2026, the watchdog publicly confirmed it had contacted XIUC and X.AI to urgently request information about reported issues with Grok's outputs and the data governance measures supporting them.

This action also runs alongside a separate probe by the UK's online safety regulator, Ofcom, which is examining whether the platform has complied with the Online Safety Act — including obligations to protect users from illegal or harmful content, such as non-consensual intimate images.

Regulators in the European Union and other jurisdictions have also begun their own reviews into Grok's functionality and potential harms, sparking a wave of concern about AI content governance.

Most recently, the Paris prosecutor's office (Parquet de Paris) are investigating alleged algorithmic manipulation by foreign powers.



The ICO's investigation underscores a growing regulatory focus on AI accountability, especially around generative models that can manipulate or create fabricated representations of real people.

Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the risks of AI-generated content. According to the Bitdefender 2025 Consumer Cybersecurity Survey, more than a third of respondents named the creation of deepfake videos one of their biggest concerns.

Trust in ‘Big Tech' often differs by geography. Europeans tend to be stricter about safeguarding personal details, shaped by years of GDPR-driven awareness. While American consumers focus on convenience, Europeans are more attuned to privacy.

In the context of mounting scrutiny of X, it's worth noting that participants in our survey – conducted from June to September 2025 polling more than 7,000 internet users across seven countries – expressed skepticism regarding X's conduit on privacy and security, with 52% naming it a “least trusted” player.

As European regulators assess whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent misuse of Grok's image-manipulation capabilities, companies offering similar AI technologies will likely face mounting pressure to implement strong guardrails.

also separates its exchange architecture from direct asset issuance or custody
to stay compatible with existing financial systems.

The venture builds on a partnership between Startale
and SBI last year that targeted the growing market for tokenized assets and
onchain capital markets. With Strium, the partners aim to position the network
as a core exchange layer for Asia's onchain securities market.

“Building on the August 2025 partnership announcement,
which positioned the alliance at the forefront of the $18.9 trillion tokenized
asset market opportunity, Strium addresses a fundamental shift now
underway in institutional and professional markets,” Startale announced.

Legislation letting cryptocurrency into public pension investments — and imposing new limitations on crypto ATM operations — has crossed the halfway point at the Indiana Statehouse and is expected to advance to the Senate floor next week.

Senate lawmakers heard testimony Wednesday on a package of House digital currency bills but didn't yet vote them out of the Insurance and Financial Institutions Committee.

The panel's head, Sen. Scott Baldwin, called that decision a “tactical pause” to refine the proposals and ensure they conform with his pending reorganization of consumer lending laws.

One, House Bill 1042, would allow members of certain public pension plans to choose self-directed brokerage accounts offering crypto investment options. The state would also be able to invest the plan assets into crypto exchange traded funds.

Participants in defined benefit plans don't get to decide how the investments is managed — that's up to the state — but those with defined contribution plans would be able to take advantage of the changes, explained the bill's author, Rep. Kyle Pierce, R-Anderson.

The Indiana Public Retirement System testified as neutral on the bill.

“We've worked with the House to get it to the current form and (we're) more or less happy with it,” said Tom Perkins, the investments counsel and director of investment stewardship.

Other provisions would block state agencies — besides the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions — from banning a digital mining business' operations, restricting crypto transactions for legal services or taking custody of digital wallets using certain technology.

Local governments, meanwhile, wouldn't be able to stop digital mining firms including data centers from operating in industrial-zoned areas — or prevent individual Hoosiers from mining crypto in their homes.

The bulk of discussion centered on House Bill 1116, which would regulate the virtual currency kiosks commonly referred to as crypto ATMs.

“These ATMs have become a powerful tool for scammers to prey on seniors and people in crisis,” Rep. Wendy McNamara, the bill's author. “These victims often believe they're paying a bill, helping a loved one or protecting their savings — when, in reality, they're being manipulated into sending money to criminals.”

The measure would require kiosk operators to get licensed as money transmitters, get permission to install the machines from the Department of Financial Institutions, comply with data reporting and more. Other provisions step up security amid widespread scam complaints.

“We are currently living in a ‘scamdemic,'” said Sgt. Nathan VanCleave, who works on the Evansville Police Department's financial crimes unit. “… They are on steroids because of cryptocurrency.”

The city recorded 35 crypto ATM scam cases last year, totaling more than $400,000 in losses.

VanCleave claimed the Evansville-area machines averaged a transaction fee rate of 38%, benefiting both the operators and the brick-and-mortar businesses hosting the machines.

When he asked local gas stations to get rid of them, one told him so much revenue was generated that the store “can't go to corporate and ask us to pull the plug.”

“This is where we come into play,” VanCleave said. “We have to pass legislation that will protect our citizens.”

Evansville has passed its own ordinance requiring signage, receipts and a phone number on the machine — “so you can call somebody to cry with you after you've lost all of your money” — but seeks statewide legislation.

But crypto ATM operators said the measure would drive them out of business in Indiana.

It would require operators to refund the full payment amount and transaction fees to scam victims. They would have to verify a customer's identity before accepting payment, and couldn't charge transaction fees of more than 10% of the transaction's value. The bill also limits how much new and existing users could transact over 24-hour and monthlong periods.
Larry Lipka, a general counsel for CoinFlip, told lawmakers the 10% cap was too low. The company's average transaction fee rate across its 100-plus Indiana kiosks is between 17% and 19%.
“We're buying the cryptocurrency from another company, so we have to pay for that. So, we're only earning the transaction fee,” he said. The firm also has to pay for armed guards to pick up the cash deposited, which gets more expensive for kiosks located in remote areas.
He pushed back on the limits for customer transaction amounts, saying, “Why should someone using a product for two months, two years, five years be limited in the amount that they want to buy? That is anti-American and anti-freedom.”
CoinFlip instead suggested brief limits for newcomers.
The company also opposed the scam total-refund provisions and angled for refunds of only the transaction fee to new customers for a limited period of time.
“A person who's been using a product for days or weeks or months knows what they're doing, and they should not be given a refund of the full amount when we can't recover that crypto once it's sent,” Lipka said.
He noted federal regulations only require refunds for unauthorized transactions — like stolen credit cards or hacked bank accounts — but that scam victims have authorized their losses, even if it was done under duress.
Changes are expected. Baldwin told the Capital Chronicle he wouldn't let the bill out of his committee if it didn't pass muster.

He pushed back on the limits for customer transaction amounts, saying, “Why should someone using a product for two months, two years, five years be limited in the amount that they want to buy? That is anti-American and anti-freedom.”

CoinFlip instead suggested brief limits for newcomers.

The company also opposed the scam total-refund provisions and angled for refunds of only the transaction fee to new customers for a limited period of time.

“A person who's been using a product for days or weeks or months knows what they're doing, and they should not be given a refund of the full amount when we can't recover that crypto once it's sent,” Lipka said.

He noted federal regulations only require refunds for unauthorized transactions — like stolen credit cards or hacked bank accounts — but that scam victims have authorized their losses, even if it was done under duress.

Changes are expected. Baldwin told the Capital Chronicle he wouldn't let the bill out of his committee if it didn't pass muster.

In this article

Bitcoin sank below $67,000 on Thursday as investor confidence continued to falter in the asset once hailed as "digital gold" and a unique store of value. —

Digital assets, including bitcoin, have fallen deeper into the red as investors re-assess the practical utility of a token that has been championed not only as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainties but also as an alternative to fiat currencies and traditional safe-havens such as gold.

That hasn't panned out lately, since bitcoin peaked just north of $126,000 in early October.

On Thursday, bitcoin was last down to $67,675, its lowest since since November 2024. The cryptocurrency broke below $70,000 earlier in the session Thursday and then the selling increased. The cryptocurrency is down 20% this week alone.

"This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing," Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure  said Wednesday in a note to clients.

Growing investor caution comes as many of the sensationalized claims about bitcoin have failed to materialize. The token has largely traded in the same direction as other risk-on assets, such as stocks,  particularly during recent geopolitical and macroeconomic flare ups in Venezuela, the Middle East and Europe, and its adoption as a form of payment for goods and services has been minimal.

Bitcoin is down nearly 30% over the past year, while gold has surged 68% in the same period. 

Other cryptocurrencies are cratering too. Ether has pulled back 23% this week, on track for its worst week since November 2022, when it slumped 24%. Solana hit $88.42 on Thursday, about a two-year low and off 24% on the week.

Some traders have suggested $70,000 is a key level to watch and a break below that could trigger further declines for bitcoin. 

James Butterfill, head of research at Coinshares, said $70,000 is shaping up as a "key psychological level," adding that "if we fail to hold it, a move toward" the $60,000 to $65,000 range "becomes quite likely."

The latest move in bitcoin comes amid a worsening sell-off in U.S. tech stocks. The State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF dropped 2.8% Wednesday, one day after losing 2.2%. 

Meanwhile, precious metals continue to be volatile too, with silver plunging again on Thursday and gold under pressure. 

Forced liquidations — when traders' positions are automatically sold as bitcoin hits a set price — continue to weigh on markets. As of Thursday, more than $2 billion in long and short positions in cryptocurrencies have been liquidated this week, according to data from Coinglass.

Bitcoin has been on a steady decline for more than three months, and is now more than 45% below its October high. Other cryptocurrencies, including ether and XRP, have fallen even more.

 "[The] straight line bull run that a lot of people expected hasn't really materialized yet. Bitcoin isn't trading on hype anymore, the story has lost a bit of that plot, it is trading on pure liquidity and capital flows," Maja Vujinovic, CEO of digital assets at FG Nexus, told CNBC's "Worldwide Exchange."

While many in the crypto market have previously credited large institutional investors with supporting the price of bitcoin, now it is those same participants who appear to be selling.

"Institutional demand has reversed materially," CryptoQuant said in a report on Wednesday. 

U.S. exchange-traded funds, which purchased 46,000 bitcoin this time last year, are net sellers in 2026, CryptoQuant said.

The report notes other worrying signs. "Bitcoin has broken below its 365-day moving average for the first time since March 2022 and has declined 23% in the 83 days since the breakdown — worse than the early 2022 bear phase," CryptoQuant analysts said. 

A moving average tracks the price of an asset over a set number of periods, smoothing out short-term price fluctuations to identify trends.

The latest leg lower in bitcoin suggests "potential downside toward the $70K–$60K range," CryptoQuant said.

A study has found that supplementing with the naturally occurring bioactive compounds N-trans caffeoyltyramine (NCT) and N-trans feruloyltyramine (NFT) improves glycemic control markers in prediabetic adults. The ingredient was shown to stabilize blood sugar without weight loss, drug use, or changes in diet.

The health science innovation platform Brightseed recently commercialized the ingredient as BioMetaControl, containing the two compounds. Brought to market as a GLP-1 companion, the researchers highlight its ability to maintain blood sugar stability when patients discontinue the weight-loss drug.

“This study represents one of the first rigorous human clinical trials validating the glucose-regulatory potential of NCT and NFT,” says Swati Kalgaonkar, co-author and head of Medical & Scientific Affairs and Clinical Research at Brightseed.

“By integrating fasting biomarkers and continuous glucose monitoring, the research provides a more comprehensive picture of how these bioactives support glucose regulation in individuals at risk for metabolic disease.”

The study was funded by Brightseed and has been published in Bioactive Compounds in Health and Disease.

It was conducted by researchers at the National Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation (N-DOC) in New Delhi, India. They conducted a four-week trial involving 126 prediabetic participants with a BMI of 25 to 30. 

The participants received either 120 mg/day of NCT/NFT or a placebo. The two compounds act as potent agonists of HNF4α — a transcription factor that plays a central role in insulin secretion, glucose sensing, and hepatic glucose production.

Participants who received the supplement experienced reductions in fasting blood glucose.Participants who received the supplement experienced reductions in fasting blood glucose and improvements in fasting insulin and postprandial glucose responses.

The researchers also observed a reduction in time spent outside the ideal glucose range, as measured by continuous glucose monitoring, in the NCT/NFT group compared to the placebo group. No change in body weight was observed in the intervention group. 

“The incidence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes continues to increase worldwide,” says Dr. Anoop Misra, co-author of the study and director at N-DOC.

“Once a blood glucose control target is achieved with drug intervention, daily consumption of functional food ingredients or nutraceuticals that support ongoing healthy blood glucose regulation is warranted.”

Study co-author Dr. Seema Gulati, head of the nutrition research group at N-DOC, adds: “Improved blood glucose regulation helps avoid glycemic excursions — energy highs and dips, as those felt by the study subjects before NCT/NFT supplementation — and this may explain the unsolicited testimonials received from the study subjects around feeling improved all-day energy levels.”

The study concludes that its insights help establish NCT/NFT supplementation as a promising candidate for clinical nutrition strategies and functional food formulation to support healthy blood glucose regulation. 

The study highlights its potential for adults weaning off GLP-1 drugs to help maintain healthy blood glucose levels.It highlights that one such clinical nutrition strategy is for adults weaning off GLP-1 drugs to help maintain healthy blood glucose levels.

Brightseed says the study serves as a proof point for a more systematic and AI-driven approach to bioactive discovery. “One that connects biological insight, mechanistic reasoning, and clinical validation earlier in the innovation process.”

The company notes that the new findings highlight the potential role of dietary bioactives as part of a broader lifestyle- and nutrition-based approach to metabolic health, rather than prior research focused on pharmaceutical interventions.

Recent research has also shifted focus from pharma to nutrition. For example, one study found that the Nordic Diet — high in dietary fiber from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, with a low percentage of saturated fat — could aid therapies for both type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. 

Scientists are stressing the need for prediabetic adults to focus on nutrition, given its essential role in blood glucose regulation.

The
cryptocurrency market plunged for the third consecutive session on Thursday,
February 5, 2026, with Bitcoin dropping 3.5% to test $70,000, the lowest level
since November 2024, before recovering slightly to $71,340. 

XRP crashed
over 7% below $1.40, Ethereum fell to $2,068 (lowest since May 2025), and
Dogecoin battles support at $0.10 as $775 million in leveraged
positions were liquidated. 

In this article
I analyze XRP/USDT, BTC/USD, ETH/USDT and DOGE/USDT charts, answering the
question of why crypto is going down today.

Bitcoin's
price fell for the third straight session, dropping 3.5% to test $70,052,
the lowest since November 2024, before recovering to $71,340, down 1.5%. This
represents a decisive break below my target range of $74,000 that I've been
discussing since November.

While
I forecasted a potential bounce at $74,000, I practice reactive
analysis rather than wishful thinking analysis, which means I was prepared
for this scenario as well. With the breakdown confirmed, I'm
now targeting $68,000, where the 200-week exponential
moving average (200 WMA) runs on the weekly chart. That's where I'll
expect a demand reaction.

If that
level also fails to hold, I have my long-term ultra-bearish target around $52,000,
where the 100% Fibonacci extension based on the current trend lands. One thing
is certain: pressure on cryptocurrencies continues to persist.

Bitcoin is
now approximately 45% below its October peak near $126,000,
with the recent drawdown accelerating as expectations that BTC would never
revisit sub-$100K levels were shattered.

Joel
Kruger, crypto strategist at LMAX, offers perspective on the brutal selloff
while identifying potential bottoming signals.

"Price
action across crypto has been undeniably heavy over the past 24 hours, with
bitcoin acting as the primary drag on broader sentiment and ETH following
suit," Kruger notes. However, he points to emerging signs of exhaustion.

XRP is also
falling for the third consecutive session, and today is one of the strongest
declines this year, losing over 7% and testing levels below $1.40.
If we exclude October's flash crash, this is the lowest value since November
2024.

Breaking
the local support defined by April 2025 lows opens the path
toward targets in the $1.25-1.26 range, the minimums from
the aforementioned flash crash. If this level also fails to hold, I'm targeting
just $0.53 on the XRP chart.

What would
need to happen for me to change my bearish stance? Such scenarios are really
far away, XRP would need to return above $2.20, where the 200-day
EMA currently sits.

Dogecoin (DOGE), like BTC
and XRP, is falling for the third consecutive session and is fighting with
local support around the round level of $0.10, which coincides with
the lowest levels since September 2024.

Doge
already broke its important support at the end of January, located just
below $0.12, and is currently in short-term consolidation at
medium-term lows. Bearish pressure remains strong here, and breaking this level
will open the path to declines toward 2024 minimums around $0.08.

To relieve
pressure from Dogecoin's shoulders, we would need to wait until around $0.16,
where the 200 EMA sits.

Ethereum's
price, unlike the three charts mentioned above, is also falling for the third
consecutive session, deepening this year's lows on Thursday to $2,068—the
lowest value since May 2025.

Support
designated by June 2024 lows around $2,100 continues to hold
price in check, and today we also see a reaction at this level. As a result,
ETH is currently losing only 0.7% and changing hands at $2,132.

Although
bearish pressure persists, even if the current support breaks, the next support
sits around $1,760 (March 2025 lows), and the final ultimate
level around $1,400 (April 2024 yearly lows).

According
to my technical analysis, Ethereum prices could fall to $1,725 or lower
in February, aligning with the inverted cup and handle downside target,
which historically achieves its expected target with an 82% success rate.

I'll
abandon bearish scenarios when ETH returns at least to the consolidation range
drawn from November to the end of January, between $2,750 and $3,430.

Thursday's
crypto crash triggered a massive $775 million liquidation event across
major exchanges as Bitcoin plunged to $70,000. What began as a minor technical
correction "accelerated into a mass capitulation of long positions,"
according to market analysis.

The violent
flush caught leverage traders off guard, with open interest ballooning
to unsustainable levels over the past week driven by retail FOMO and
aggressive perpetual positioning. When the floor gave way, algorithmic selling
pressure was instantaneous.

Recent data
shows over $800 million in leveraged liquidations impacting
around 165,000 traders, with the majority coming from long positions. This
follows the February 1 "Black Sunday II" event that saw $2.2
billion liquidated in 24 hours, the largest single-day wipeout since
October 2025.

"The
recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market has been swift and severe, with
analysts attributing the decline to the appointment of Kevin Warsh as the
prospective chair of the Federal Reserve, amid expectations that he might
reduce the Fed's balance sheet," according to Reuters.

Signs of
ongoing high interest rates have pushed the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)
above 97.5, making investors less interested in riskier assets like
Bitcoin. The Fed's January 28 hold at 3.50-3.75% with Powell stating he's
"not in a hurry to cut" continued to weigh on risk assets, with real
yields remaining elevated.

Big
investors such as BlackRock have sold large amounts of Bitcoin, with $373.8
million leaving spot BTC ETFs recently. Bitcoin ETFs have continued
bleeding with cumulative multi-billion dollar outflows since mid-January,
removing spot bid support and forcing correlated selling in leveraged products.

testing $70,000 (lowest since Nov 2024), triggering $775 million in
liquidations. Kevin Warsh's Fed Chair appointment raised expectations for
balance sheet reduction and hawkish policy, pushing DXY above 97.5 and making
risk assets less attractive. 

Bitcoin
broke my November target of $74,000 and tested $70,052 before recovering to
$71,340. The next technical target is $68,000 where the 200-week EMA provides
critical support, with an ultra-bearish scenario targeting $52,000 (100%
Fibonacci extension). Analysts Peter Brandt and Michael Burry identify support
levels at $60,176 and $47,824 if $70,000 breaks. LMAX's Joel Kruger notes
Bitcoin is "roughly 45% below its October peak" with "hallmarks
of capitulation now in place."

XRP crashed
over 7% on Thursday to below $1.40—the lowest since November 2024 excluding
October's flash crash. Breaking April 2025 local support opens the path to
$1.25-1.26 (October flash crash lows), with the long-term ultra-bearish target
at $0.53. Bull invalidation requires a return above $2.20 where the 200-day EMA
currently sits, representing a 57% rally from current levels.

The
cryptocurrency market plunged for the third consecutive session on Thursday,
February 5, 2026, with Bitcoin dropping 3.5% to test $70,000, the lowest level
since November 2024, before recovering slightly to $71,340. 

XRP crashed
over 7% below $1.40, Ethereum fell to $2,068 (lowest since May 2025), and
Dogecoin battles support at $0.10 as $775 million in leveraged
positions were liquidated. 

In this article
I analyze XRP/USDT, BTC/USD, ETH/USDT and DOGE/USDT charts, answering the
question of why crypto is going down today.

Bitcoin's
price fell for the third straight session, dropping 3.5% to test $70,052,
the lowest since November 2024, before recovering to $71,340, down 1.5%. This
represents a decisive break below my target range of $74,000 that I've been
discussing since November.

While
I forecasted a potential bounce at $74,000, I practice reactive
analysis rather than wishful thinking analysis, which means I was prepared
for this scenario as well. With the breakdown confirmed, I'm
now targeting $68,000, where the 200-week exponential
moving average (200 WMA) runs on the weekly chart. That's where I'll
expect a demand reaction.

If that
level also fails to hold, I have my long-term ultra-bearish target around $52,000,
where the 100% Fibonacci extension based on the current trend lands. One thing
is certain: pressure on cryptocurrencies continues to persist.

Bitcoin is
now approximately 45% below its October peak near $126,000,
with the recent drawdown accelerating as expectations that BTC would never
revisit sub-$100K levels were shattered.

Joel
Kruger, crypto strategist at LMAX, offers perspective on the brutal selloff
while identifying potential bottoming signals.

"Price
action across crypto has been undeniably heavy over the past 24 hours, with
bitcoin acting as the primary drag on broader sentiment and ETH following
suit," Kruger notes. However, he points to emerging signs of exhaustion.

XRP is also
falling for the third consecutive session, and today is one of the strongest
declines this year, losing over 7% and testing levels below $1.40.
If we exclude October's flash crash, this is the lowest value since November
2024.

Breaking
the local support defined by April 2025 lows opens the path
toward targets in the $1.25-1.26 range, the minimums from
the aforementioned flash crash. If this level also fails to hold, I'm targeting
just $0.53 on the XRP chart.

What would
need to happen for me to change my bearish stance? Such scenarios are really
far away, XRP would need to return above $2.20, where the 200-day
EMA currently sits.

Dogecoin (DOGE), like BTC
and XRP, is falling for the third consecutive session and is fighting with
local support around the round level of $0.10, which coincides with
the lowest levels since September 2024.

Doge
already broke its important support at the end of January, located just
below $0.12, and is currently in short-term consolidation at
medium-term lows. Bearish pressure remains strong here, and breaking this level
will open the path to declines toward 2024 minimums around $0.08.

To relieve
pressure from Dogecoin's shoulders, we would need to wait until around $0.16,
where the 200 EMA sits.

Ethereum's
price, unlike the three charts mentioned above, is also falling for the third
consecutive session, deepening this year's lows on Thursday to $2,068—the
lowest value since May 2025.

Support
designated by June 2024 lows around $2,100 continues to hold
price in check, and today we also see a reaction at this level. As a result,
ETH is currently losing only 0.7% and changing hands at $2,132.

Although
bearish pressure persists, even if the current support breaks, the next support
sits around $1,760 (March 2025 lows), and the final ultimate
level around $1,400 (April 2024 yearly lows).

According
to my technical analysis, Ethereum prices could fall to $1,725 or lower
in February, aligning with the inverted cup and handle downside target,
which historically achieves its expected target with an 82% success rate.

I'll
abandon bearish scenarios when ETH returns at least to the consolidation range
drawn from November to the end of January, between $2,750 and $3,430.

Thursday's
crypto crash triggered a massive $775 million liquidation event across
major exchanges as Bitcoin plunged to $70,000. What began as a minor technical
correction "accelerated into a mass capitulation of long positions,"
according to market analysis.

The violent
flush caught leverage traders off guard, with open interest ballooning
to unsustainable levels over the past week driven by retail FOMO and
aggressive perpetual positioning. When the floor gave way, algorithmic selling
pressure was instantaneous.

Recent data
shows over $800 million in leveraged liquidations impacting
around 165,000 traders, with the majority coming from long positions. This
follows the February 1 "Black Sunday II" event that saw $2.2
billion liquidated in 24 hours, the largest single-day wipeout since
October 2025.

"The
recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market has been swift and severe, with
analysts attributing the decline to the appointment of Kevin Warsh as the
prospective chair of the Federal Reserve, amid expectations that he might
reduce the Fed's balance sheet," according to Reuters.

Signs of
ongoing high interest rates have pushed the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)
above 97.5, making investors less interested in riskier assets like
Bitcoin. The Fed's January 28 hold at 3.50-3.75% with Powell stating he's
"not in a hurry to cut" continued to weigh on risk assets, with real
yields remaining elevated.

Big
investors such as BlackRock have sold large amounts of Bitcoin, with $373.8
million leaving spot BTC ETFs recently. Bitcoin ETFs have continued
bleeding with cumulative multi-billion dollar outflows since mid-January,
removing spot bid support and forcing correlated selling in leveraged products.

The broader crypto market came under heavy pressure today as a sharp wave of crypto liquidations ripped through leveraged positions, dragging Bitcoin, Ethereum, and major altcoins lower within hours. Over $700 million in crypto positions were liquidated during the session, with long traders bearing the brunt of the damage. The speed of the move suggests the decline was driven less by fresh selling and more by cascading margin calls as key intraday supports failed.

Crypto Liquidations Drive the Selloff as Leverage Unwinds

Today's market selloff triggered over $700 million crypto positions liquidated over the past 24 hours, with long positions accounting for the clear majority of losses. Bitcoin led the wipeout, accounting for over $410 million in liquidations, as BTC slipped toward the $71,000 level. Ethereum followed closely, with roughly $208 million in ETH positions liquidated as price dropped near $2,100. XRP and other large-cap altcoins contributed the remainder, as cascading stops were triggered across derivatives markets.

The liquidation skew was heavily long-biased, signaling a mechanical leverage reset rather than panic-driven selling. 

Open interest fell sharply alongside the liquidations, showing that traders were being forced out of positions instead of exiting voluntarily. In short, today's move reflects leverage flushing out of the system, not a mass exit by long-term holders.

Bitcoin Price Slides 5% as Liquidation Clusters Get Swept

Bitcoin's decline accelerated after BTC lost key intraday support and slipped nearly 5% to the $71,000 zone, triggering a sharp liquidation cascade across futures markets. Liquidation data shows roughly $409 million worth of Bitcoin positions were force-closed during the move, with long traders accounting for the overwhelming majority. The selloff was mechanically driven. As Bitcoin price broke below short-term support levels near the mid-$74K range, liquidation clusters stacked around $73K and $72K were rapidly cleared. This forced selling amplified downside momentum, dragging price swiftly toward $71K before bids began to stabilize.

Importantly, spot market behavior remained relatively composed. Exchange inflows did not spike aggressively, suggesting the move was fueled by excess leverage unwinding, not panic-driven spot selling. In classic fashion, futures markets led the decline, while spot liquidity lagged behind. For now, Bitcoin's ability to hold above the $70K–$71K region will be closely watched. A failure to stabilize around $70k could expose deeper downside, while consolidation here may signal that the bulk of forced selling has already played out.

Ethereum Price Drops to $2100 as Leverage Reset Mirrors Bitcoin 

Ethereum tracked Bitcoin's weakness almost tick for tick, falling nearly 5% to around $2,100 as liquidation pressure spilled across correlated markets. Data indicates approximately $208 million in Ethereum futures positions were liquidated, again dominated by long-side losses. ETH's decline was not driven by Ethereum-specific developments. Instead, it reflected a broader deleveraging event as traders reduced exposure across majors once Bitcoin broke lower. Once ETH price lost support near the $2,250–$2,300 area, liquidation thresholds were quickly hit, accelerating the slide toward $2,100. 

From here, Ethereum's short-term outlook hinges on whether $2,000 can hold as a stabilization zone. A sustained failure below this level would keep pressure on the downside, while consolidation could allow volatility to compress as leverage resets.

Market Outlook

Today's market sell-off carries a clear message: the market was over-leveraged. The $700M liquidation wave acted as a reset mechanism, forcing out crowded bullish positions without triggering mass spot exits. If liquidation pressure continues to ease and open interest stabilizes, markets may attempt to consolidate at lower levels. However, until Bitcoin and Ethereum reclaim broken supports, volatility is likely to remain elevated. For now, crypto markets are not collapsing, they are deleveraging. History shows that how price behaves after leverage resets often defines the next major trend.

FAQs

A sharp $700 million liquidation wave triggered a cascade of forced selling in leveraged futures markets, rapidly pulling down Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoin prices within hours.

Over $700 million in crypto positions were liquidated, with Bitcoin longs accounting for over $410 million and Ethereum longs for roughly $208 million of that total.

It means traders who bet on prices rising using borrowed funds were forced to sell as prices fell, triggering more automatic sell orders and accelerating the downturn in a short-term cascade.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has ruled out the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the United States, reinforcing the government's position that a federally issued digital dollar is not necessary. The remarks highlight a broader policy stance that favors private-sector innovation in digital finance rather than direct government involvement in issuing digital currency.

Bessent's comments come at a time when central banks around the world are accelerating exploration of CBDCs as part of efforts to modernize payment systems. While many global economies are testing or piloting state-backed digital currencies, the U.S. Treasury has taken a more cautious approach, emphasizing the strength and resilience of the existing dollar-based financial system.

Bessent has argued that the United States does not require a CBDC due to the global dominance of the U.S. dollar and the advanced capabilities of its financial ecosystem. According to the Treasury Secretary, current payment networks, commercial banking infrastructure, and regulated stablecoin development already provide effective pathways for digital financial services without the need for a government-issued digital currency.

Concerns over privacy and government oversight have also shaped opposition to a U.S. CBDC. Critics of central bank digital currencies have warned that direct government control over digital payment infrastructure could raise risks related to financial surveillance and transaction monitoring. Bessent's position aligns with those concerns, reinforcing the view that the U.S. should prioritize market-driven solutions over centralized digital currency frameworks.

The Treasury's stance also signals a shift toward greater reliance on regulated stablecoins as an alternative mechanism for expanding digital dollar usage. By encouraging private-sector participation while maintaining regulatory oversight, policymakers aim to support financial innovation while preserving consumer protections and system stability.

The decision to rule out a U.S. CBDC contrasts with ongoing initiatives in other major economies. China continues to expand pilot programs for its digital yuan, while the European Central Bank has advanced research into a potential digital euro. These developments highlight differing approaches among global financial powers regarding how digital currencies should be integrated into national monetary systems.

Supporters of CBDCs argue that government-issued digital currencies could improve payment efficiency, strengthen financial inclusion, and enhance monetary policy tools. Opponents, however, caution that CBDCs could concentrate financial power within central banks and reduce the role of private financial institutions.

Bessent's reaffirmation of opposition to a digital dollar reflects a U.S. strategy that prioritizes competitive financial markets and technological innovation driven by private companies. The Treasury has indicated that regulatory clarity for stablecoins and other blockchain-based financial products may serve as a more practical pathway for digital asset integration within the U.S. financial system.

The policy position also carries geopolitical implications as global competition intensifies around digital currency infrastructure. While other nations continue to explore CBDCs as tools for economic modernization, U.S. officials appear confident that the existing dollar ecosystem, supported by private-sector innovation and deep capital markets, remains sufficient to maintain international leadership.

Bessent's stance signals that, while research into digital currency technologies may continue, the United States is unlikely to pursue a government-issued CBDC in the near term. Instead, policymakers appear focused on fostering a regulated environment that allows private digital finance initiatives to drive the next phase of financial innovation.

Nearly 40% of new cancer cases worldwide are potentially preventable, according to one of the first investigations of its kind, which analysed dozens of cancer types in almost 200 countries.

The study found that in 2022, roughly seven million cancer diagnoses were linked to modifiable risk factors — those that can be changed, controlled or managed to reduce the likelihood of developing the disease. Overall, tobacco smoking was the leading contributor to worldwide cancer cases, followed by infections and drinking alcohol. The findings suggest that avoiding such risk factors is “one of the most powerful ways that we can potentially reduce the future cancer burden”, says study co-author Hanna Fink, a cancer epidemiologist at the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France.

The study was published today in Nature Medicine.

Cancer continues to be a leading cause of illness and death worldwide, with cases expected to rise over the next decades if current trends continue. Previous studies have estimated that around 44% of global cancer deaths can be attributed to avoidable or controllable causes. Estimates of preventability have mainly focused on the number of deaths rather than cases and have mostly investigated a single risk factor, says Fink.

To address this gap, Fink and her colleagues examined global case data from 2022 for 36 different cancers across 185 countries. The study included 30 modifiable risk factors that are well-established causes of cancer — such as tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and infections.

The researchers combined this information with data from 2012 that captured people's exposure to each risk factor. Fink and her colleagues then estimated the proportion of cases that were directly linked to each risk factor.

In 2022, there were a total of 18.7 million new cancer cases worldwide. Roughly 38% — or 7.1 million — of these cases could be attributed to avoidable causes. Globally, tobacco smoking was the leading contributor, accounting for around 15% of preventable cases. This was followed by infections (10%) and drinking alcohol (3%). Lung, stomach and cervical cancers made up nearly half of all preventable cancer cases.

Around 30% of the 9.2 million new cases in women were preventable. More than 11% of these were associated with infections, such as those caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) — the leading cause of cervical cancer. Most of these cases occurred in low- and middle-income regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where cervical cancer rates are highest. Meanwhile, smoking was the dominant cause of cancer among women in high-income regions, including North America and most of Europe.

Globally, smoking was the biggest risk factor for men, accounting for almost one-quarter of the 4.3 million preventable cancer cases. It remained the leading cause of cancer in men living in both low- and high-income regions. Infections ranked second — mostly occurring in parts of Africa, Asia and South America — followed by drinking alcohol.

The study is a “fine piece of work” that signals the need to double down on cancer control efforts, says David Whiteman, a medical epidemiologist at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane, Australia. He adds that the comprehensive data set will make it easier for researchers to make reliable comparisons between regions.

Fink hopes the findings will be used to develop cancer-prevention strategies on the basis of the biggest risk factors in different regions for men and women. “It's not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she says.

NASA's next space suit for Artemis has out-of-this-world mobility

Astronauts are flying to the moon for the first time since 1972, and scientists are preparing specialized space suits for the next milestone—landing there

Launching as early as March for a long-planned there-and-back lunar flyby, NASA's Artemis II mission will bring four astronauts closer to the moon than any humans have been in more than 50 years. Merely traveling so far from Earth is a feat all its own, but the mission is in some ways already overshadowed by its planned follow-up, Artemis III, which is meant to take crew members to the moon's surface to kick off a new, 21st-century era of lunar science and exploration. Of the many obstacles to overcome before any Artemis astronauts begin moonwalking, perhaps the most simple yet significant is figuring out what to wear.

A space suit isn't so much an outfit as an anthropomorphic spacecraft. One designed for lunar surface operations must protect astronauts from perilous cosmic radiation, extreme temperatures, lung-clogging moon dust and the harsh vacuum of space. It must also carry its own supply of air, as well as water for cooling (and the occasional sip), while also having room for carrying equipment astronauts might need while in orbit or exploring other worlds. Designing a suit that meets all these needs without significantly limiting movement and functionality is an extremely difficult task. But the arduous effort may be essential for achieving longer stays in deep space—as well as building the lunar space station and surface outposts envisioned for future Artemis missions.

Axiom Space, a U.S.-based space infrastructure company, has been developing a space suit for the Artemis III mission since 2022. In 2024 the company unveiled its official design for the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AxEMU); tests of the suit are ongoing. The bulky white suit looks, in many ways, very similar to previous generations of NASA space suits. But beneath the surface, new technology promises Artemis astronauts mobility on the moon that their Apollo-era forebears could only dream about.

“It's really pushing the limits of material science,” says Paul Spana, a curator and director of collections at the Space Center Houston museum. “There's going to be a lot of new things introduced for the new suit that will be used for moonwalking on Artemis III.”

Like the original Apollo space suits, the AxEMU has been built with the moon's unique conditions in mind. Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin has described the landscape of that mission's near-equatorial exploration site as one of “magnificent desolation,” with a nonexistent atmosphere, dust all around and temperatures that swing between hotter and colder than anyone could experience—or endure—on Earth. Around the moon's south pole, where Artemis astronauts will be headed, conditions the new suit must withstand could be even more extreme.

“This region presents unique challenges including steeper terrain, extreme temperatures and prolonged periods of light and darkness—conditions far harsher than those faced by Apollo astronauts at the lunar equator,” says Victoria Ugalde, a NASA spokesperson. “The space suit will also need to function across different landers, rovers and spacecraft.”

To prepare for this desolation, the new suit has robust temperature regulation and is scratch-resistant to reduce damage from jagged rocks and abrasive dust. The biggest change, though, is in its flexibility. Whereas Apollo space suits were akin to wearing an inflated balloon that greatly hindered motion, the AxEMU is designed with flexible joints that give astronauts mobility to kneel, jog or even do the splits. Besides allowing space-suit-clad astronauts to fit within multiple different vehicles, the AxEMU's enhanced range of motion should also make working on the lunar surface easier.

The new suit's unique joints are shaping up to be a major advancement over previous space suits, but the AxEMU's relatively high weight is still a cause for concern. Axiom Space has not revealed the exact weight of its new suit, but it is more than that of previous space suits, including the Apollo suits, which weighed nearly 200 pounds on Earth.

Even under the low gravity of the moon, wearing several hundred pounds still feels heavy and could even cause injuries, NASA astronaut and doctor Mike Barratt told Ars Technica—especially because astronauts are likely to also be toting tools and equipment during lengthy surface operations. Experts say the suit's added weight is not ideal.

“Weight is always a key consideration in space suit design,” NASA's Ugalde says, but she adds that the agency maintains “extremely high confidence” that astronauts will be able to perform mission-necessary tasks when it comes time to don their suits and set foot on the moon. Then, when the Artemis III astronauts return, they will bring with them lessons about how the suit performs in situ, helping to bring forth an even more refined future generation of space suits.

“These lessons will shape future Artemis missions, expanding operating ranges and enhancing crew capabilities,” Ugalde says. “Every step builds toward NASA's goal of a sustained human presence on the moon as a stepping stone to Mars.”

Civil engineer Zheng Hehui invented Lego-like blocks, used in the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge pylons, as part of his practical PhD.Credit: Cynthia Lee/Alamy

Last month, Zheng Hehui gave an oral defence of his PhD in civil engineering at Southeast University in Nanjing, China. But Zheng had not written a thesis. Instead, he talked about a product he had developed: a set of Lego-like blocks, made with reinforced steel, that fit together to form a bridge pylon.

Zheng is among the first cohort of Chinese doctoral students to be assessed on the basis of practical achievements that lead to new products, techniques, projects and installations. His invention is being used in a huge cable-stayed rail and road bridge built across the Yangtze River.

Since September, at least 11 such ‘practical PhD' students, all engineers, have obtained their doctoral degrees through this route. Their work includes the development and application of a welding technique and its equipment, and the creation of a fire-fighting system for a large seaplane. Universities in other countries offer ‘industrial PhDs', where students work closely with a company, but many of these degrees still require a written thesis. 

Practical PhDs are part of the Chinese government's broader education reforms, which started in 2010, to cultivate ‘elite engineers' that can help boost innovation in the country. In 2022, the government instructed top-tier universities to team up with major companies to set up graduate colleges for engineers.

A law passed in 2024 allows universities to let master's and PhD students graduate on the basis of practical achievements. At present, only students in engineering-related subjects are eligible for this no-thesis arrangement.

This alternative degree-granting model is important and urgently needed, says Guo Tong, a civil engineer at Southeast University. “[It] can guide students to carry out real research that can solve real-life problems in those industries that carry strategic importance or have technological choke points in China.”

For Li Jiang, an information scientist at Nanjing University, the new evaluation model addresses a problem that has dogged the education of engineers: “There is a big gap between the theoretical knowledge they learn from books and the hands-on ability our society needs from them.”

Candidates for the practical PhDs have to make prototypes and prove that their inventions can be used in real-life and at scale, according to Sun Yutao, who researches innovation policy at Dalian University of Technology in Dalian, China.

The programme is part of China's effort to build a talent pool for key and emerging industries, such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors, to drive innovation, Zhu Xiumei, a deputy director at the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said at a press conference in December. 

Over the past three years, 50 graduate colleges for engineers have been established in China to bring the policy into practice. Students at these colleges work with two supervisors simultaneously: one with an academic background, the other with solid practical experience. During oral examinations, they are evaluated by a panel comprising both scholars and practising engineers.

“Many engineering professors in Chinese universities have always been academics and never worked in the industry. That is why it is important to pair them up with experts from the industry to teach those PhDs,” Li says.

Tsinghua University, for example, has partnered with 56 companies in 14 key sectors over the past three years, its vice-president Wu Huaqiang said at the press conference. Under the programme, the university has recruited 1,430 graduate students, who have solved many industrial problems and received more than 100 patents, Wu said.

Some of the universities offering the programme have courses with strong links to national defence. One, Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xi'an, is working with 16 major Chinese groups, including China North Industries Group, which makes weapons and military equipment.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy was recently proposed as a treatment for adults with B-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases (ADs) refractory to conventional immunomodulatory therapy. We present a case series of eight children with severe/refractory AD (four systemic lupus erythematosus, three dermatomyositis, one systemic sclerosis) treated at Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesù, Rome, and University Hospital Erlangen with a single infusion of 1 × 106 kg−1 point-of-care manufactured autologous CD19 CAR T cells (zorpocabtagene autoleucel), in a hospital exemption (HE) program. In Europe, the HE pathway offers the opportunity to treat patients with life-threatening or seriously debilitating disorders who lack valid therapeutic options, using an advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) authorized on a nonroutine, single-patient basis. In contrast to the ‘compassionate use' pathway, the ATMP does not necessarily need to have undergone clinical trials or marketing authorization applications. Manufacturing was successful in all patients, yielding several drug product bags. Once infused after lymphodepletion, zorpocabtagene autoleucel cells expanded in vivo, promoting prompt B cell clearance. Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome was reported in six patients, and grade 1 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome was reported in one patient. Late-hematotoxicity was limited to grade 1 in two patients. All these adverse events were manageable and no severe infections occurred. With a median follow-up of 16.5 months (range = 9–24 months), all patients experienced a clinically substantial improvement/resolution of AD, as evidenced by reduction in disease activity scores and signs of reversal of organ damage. This improvement enabled sustained discontinuation of immunomodulators, even after B cell reconstitution. The activation of formal clinical trials enrolling children and adolescents is urgently needed to confirm these preliminary results and to assess the long-term safety of this approach.

CD8+ T cells are the dominant clonally expanded lymphocyte population in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions but their clonal identity, function and antigen specificity are not well understood. A comprehensive single-cell RNA-sequencing and T cell receptor-sequencing analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid and blood from individuals in the MS and control cohorts revealed a subset of 23 highly expanded and activated CD8+ T cell clonotypes that were enriched predominantly in the cerebrospinal fluid in the MS cohort. Using unbiased and targeted antigen discovery approaches, six CD8+ T cell clonotypes recognizing Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) antigens and multiple novel mimotopes were identified. Although the majority of mimotopes did not elicit functional responses, three of the expanded CD8+ T cell receptors from patients with MS were reactive to EBV. EBV DNA and transcripts were detected in cerebrospinal fluid, including in patients with MS who had highly expanded EBV-specific CD8+ T cells. These findings shed vital insight into the role of CD8+ T cells in MS and support an important role of EBV in MS immunopathology.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating condition of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by substantial T cell involvement1. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are found within the perivascular spaces as well as in the parenchyma of MS lesions2,3. CD8+ T cells are enriched and clonally expanded relative to CD4+ T cells in MS lesions4,5, suggesting local antigen-driven expansion. Specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I alleles also alter MS susceptibility6, providing additional support for a critical role of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in MS biology. The goal of this study was to identify T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, that are uniquely expanded in the CNS and determine their phenotypic characteristics and antigen specificity.

Acquisition of CNS tissue to analyze the infiltrating T cell response in MS is invasive and rarely performed early in the disease course. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a transit site of lymphocytes entering the CNS7 and provides a window into the immune responses within the CNS. Studies of the CSF repertoire have indeed indicated high clonal overlap with expanded T cell populations in MS lesions8,9.

Single-cell-sequencing technologies provide powerful opportunities for deep phenotyping and clonal characterization of T cells in numerous diseases, including MS10,11,12,13,14, yet detailed analyses of CSF-expanded T cells and their antigen specificity in MS are lacking. In this study, CSF and blood from individuals with early untreated MS as well as control participants were subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) paired with single-cell T cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing (scTCR-seq). After identifying a subset of CSF-expanded CD8+ T cells in the patients with MS, their antigen specificity was investigated using a combination of unbiased and targeted antigen discovery methodologies.

A total of 18 individuals were enrolled in the study—11 with relapsing-remitting MS, two with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), two with other neuro-inflammatory disorders (OND) and three healthy controls (HCs). The demographics of the four cohorts are presented in Table 1 and those of each individual in Supplementary Table 1. All of the patients in the MS and CIS (MS/CIS) cohort were treatment-naive (that is, no previous history of immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies) at the time of sample collection but one of the patients with OND was on immunotherapy with a TNF-α inhibitor.

Paired peripheral blood and CSF were collected on the same day for each study participant. Freshly acquired samples comprised of all unseparated cell subsets underwent paired scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq using 10X Genomics 5′ library preparation kits to permit combined single-cell transcriptional phenotyping and TCR clonal analysis. The scRNA-seq data of all participants in this study were previously published15. All major immune cell subsets were readily identified from the scRNA-seq data, with T cell clusters comprising the largest fractions (Fig. 1a). To characterize conventional TCRαβ T cells, all subsequent analyses focused on only those T cells with paired scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data (Fig. 1b). A total of 48,468 individual T cells were identified from the blood and CSF across all participants (Fig. 1c). As expected, TCR-associated genes (CD3E and CD3D) were highly upregulated with minimal expression of non-T cell-associated genes (for example, CD19; Extended Data Fig. 1). We identified 33,349 CD4+ and 15,119 CD8+ T cells expressing paired TCRαβ genes (described in Methods) for analysis from the combination of blood and CSF of all 18 participants (Supplementary Table 2).

a, Major immune cell subsets from combined blood and CSF of all patients were identified by scRNA-seq. mDC, myeloid dendritic cells; NK, natural killer cells; pDC, plasmacytoid dendritic cells; TEM, effector memory cells. b,c,g, T cells were defined after integration of the scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data, allowing segregation of T cells by CD4/CD8 status (b), compartment (CSF; c) and disease status (g). d, Pseudotime trajectory analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in CSF and peripheral blood (PB). e,f,h, Analysis of differential gene expression between CSF-derived and PB-derived CD8+ (e) and CD4+ (f) T cells as well as between MS/CIS-derived and HC/OND-derived CD8+ (h) and CD4+ (i) T cells. Differential gene expression comparisons were performed using a two-sided Wilcoxon ranked-sum test with Bonferroni correction (adjusted P). Genes with adjusted P < 0.05 are indicated in red. UMAP, uniform manifold approximation and projection.

Pseudotime analysis of T cells in the CSF revealed distinct populations of T cells largely segregated based on T cell subsets (that is, CD4+ or CD8+), highlighting the distinct transcriptional signatures associated with different T cell states and functions (Fig. 1d). Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were distinct between the peripheral blood and CSF (Fig. 1e,f). For instance, CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Table 3) in the CSF displayed significantly increased expression of various genes relative to the peripheral blood, including genes associated with migration and trafficking (CXCR3, CXCR4, CCL4, ITGB1 and ITGA4), signaling and activation (CD2, FYN and DUSP2), and cytotoxicity (GZMK and GZMA). In contrast, peripheral blood-derived CD8+ T cells expressed significantly higher levels of FOS, JUN, DUSP1 and GADD45B, indicating an alternate activation state. In a comparison of only memory (CD27-expressing) CD8+ T cells, there was significant upregulation of genes associated with T cell activation (HLA-DRA), chemokines (CCL4 and XCL1) and cholesterol metabolism (LDLR and SQLE), and downregulation of genes associated with T cell signaling (FOS, FOSB, JUN and JUNB) in the CSF relative to the blood (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 4). In the CSF, CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Table 3) had significantly increased expression of genes similar to their CD8+ T cell counterparts (ITGB1, ITGA4, CXCR3, GZMA, GZMK and CD2) as well as distinct genes (JUN, FOS, DUSP1, CCR7 and HCST).

Given the disproportionate number of participants in the different disease categories (Table 1), we grouped the patients with MS or CIS (MS/CIS; n = 13) and performed differential gene expression against the combined group of HCs and patients with OND (HC/OND; non-MS group; n = 5; Fig. 1g). In CD8+ T cells combined from the peripheral blood and CSF, various genes were differentially expressed between the MS/CIS and HC/OND groups (Fig. 1h). In particular, genes associated with tissue trafficking (CXCR4, CCL5, KLF2, ITGA4, ITGB1 and CD69) and cytotoxicity (GZMK, KLRG1 and GZMA) were upregulated in the MS/CIS cohort (Supplementary Table 5). In contrast, genes associated with central memory status (CCR7, SELL and LEF1) and TCR signaling (CD8B, CD3D, CD3E, LCK, ZAP70 and LAT) were downregulated relative to the HC/OND group. A similar profile was observed for CD4+ T cells from the blood and CSF of patients with MS/CIS, including increased expression of genes related to tissue migration (ITGB1, CD69, ITGA4, CXCR3 and CXCR4) and cytokine secretion (IL32 and GZMK), and reduced central memory status (CCR7, LEF1, SELL and TCF7) and TCR signaling (LCK; Fig. 1i and Supplementary Table 5). Overall, these data suggest that both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the patients with MS/CIS are more activated with increased effector functions and tissue homing capacity than the HC/OND cohort, consistent with other studies11,12.

The clonal repertoire of T cell subsets was compared across compartments (that is, peripheral blood versus CSF) and across disease states (that is, MS/CIS versus HC/OND). T cell clonotypes were defined as T cells sharing identical V and J genes and CDR3 amino-acid sequences for paired TCRαβ sequences similar to previous studies10,16. A total of 31,756 unique CD4+ T cell clonotypes and 10,825 unique CD8+ T cell clonotypes were identified from all individuals (Supplementary Table 2). The CD4+ and CD8+ T cell diversities (measured by Shannon entropy) were significantly higher in MS/CIS compared with HC/OND in the peripheral blood and CSF (Extended Data Fig. 3). The diversity of CD4+ T cells was significantly higher in blood compared with CSF but not for CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3). These findings suggest a more diverse array of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clonotypes are present in both the blood and CSF of patients with MS/CIS.

T cell clonal expansion is a hallmark of previous antigen encounter; therefore, our analysis focused on T cell clonality in the CSF. T cells were divided into three different categories of clonal expansion: unexpanded (single cell of a given clonotype), moderately expanded (>1 cell but <0.75% of the CSF T cell repertoire of an individual) or highly expanded (≥0.75% of the CSF T cell repertoire of an individual). We chose 0.75% as the cutoff for highly expanded clonotypes as it represented a relatively high threshold based on the clonal expansion observed in the CSF of our patient cohorts as well as others10,17. Although small fractions of clonally expanded CD4+ T cells were observed in the CSF, much larger populations of highly and moderately expanded CD8+ T cells were observed in similar proportions in the MS/CIS and HC/OND groups (Fig. 2a). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clonal expansion in the CSF was overall similar between the patients with CIS or MS (Supplementary Table 6).

a, CD8+ and CD4+ T cell clonal expansion was compared between MS/CIS and HC/OND subjects. b, Clonal frequencies of all T cell clonotypes in the CSF and blood that were highly expanded T cells and enriched at least twofold more frequently than the blood of the same individual are highlighted in red. c,d, Frequency of highly expanded and enriched T cells according to CD8 (n = 24) or CD4 (n = 10) status (c) and MS/CIS (n = 25) or HC/OND (n = 9) status (d).

To delineate between T cells expanded similarly in the blood and CSF versus those preferentially expanded in the CSF, the abundance of all T cell clonotypes in the blood and CSF was compared in all individuals. The overwhelming majority of T cell clonotypes were detected in the blood or CSF only, whereas only about 1.5% of all clonotypes were found in both compartments (Fig. 2b). We postulated that highly expanded T cell clonotypes (that is, CSF frequency of ≥0.75%) that were enriched in the CSF relative to the peripheral blood were more likely to be responsive to local antigens in the CSF and/or CNS (albeit not necessarily CNS-specific antigens). Enriched CSF-expanded T cell clonotypes were defined as those with a CSF frequency at least twofold higher than the peripheral-blood frequency from the same individual. This yielded 33 highly CSF-enriched and expanded T cell clonotype varying from approximately twofold to more than 100-fold higher frequencies in the CSF relative to peripheral blood (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 7). More than 70% of the highly expanded and CSF-enriched T cell clonotypes in the CSF were CD8+ T cells. The frequencies of highly expanded CSF-enriched CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were similar, ranging from 0.76 to 4.9% of the entire CSF repertoire of an individual (Fig. 2c). Although there were no statistically significant differences in the mean frequencies of highly expanded CSF-enriched T cell clonotypes between MS/CIS and HC/OND, only participants in the MS/CIS cohort had CSF-enriched T cells with frequencies greater than 2% (Fig. 2d). One patient with MS (patient identifier (ID), MS6) had 11 highly enriched T cell clonotypes, the majority of which were CD8+ T cells, which encompassed nearly 20% of their CSF repertoire (Supplementary Table 7). These findings therefore provide strong support for robust oligoclonal CD8+ T cell expansion and enrichment in the CSF, with the greatest expansion found in MS/CIS.

Highly expanded and unexpanded T cells in the CSF were compared by scRNA-seq analysis. Substantial differential gene expression changes were observed in highly expanded T cells in comparison to their unexpanded counterparts (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 8). In particular, genes associated with cytotoxic CD8+ T cell function (CD8A, CD8B, NKG7, KLRD1, GZMA, GZMH, GZMM, GZMK and EOMES) and chemotaxis (CCL5 and CCL4) were significantly increased in highly expanded T cells, whereas genes associated with naive status were significantly reduced (IL7R, LTB and LDHB). Targeted gene expression analysis revealed increased expression of additional genes associated with effector/memory differentiation (KLRG1 and CD27), tissue homing (CXCR3 and CCR5) and resident memory status (CD69 and IGTAE) as well as inhibitory genes associated with chronic antigen exposure (HOPX, TIGIT, DUSP2, PDCD1 and LAG3) in highly CSF-expanded CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4). A tissue-resident-memory (TRM) phenotype of CSF-expanded T cells coexpressing CD69 and IGTAE was confirmed by the reduced expression of KLF2 and S1PR1 genes (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Table 9). In contrast, CSF-unexpanded T cells expressed higher levels of genes associated with central memory/nonactivation (SELL, CCR7, IL7R, TCF7 and LEF1) as well as the integrin gene ITGB1. To further characterize CSF-enriched and expanded T cell clonotypes, the 33 T cell clonotypes were overlaid with 11 distinct CSF T cell clusters (Fig. 2f,g). The overwhelming majority of the enriched and expanded clonotypes were found in cluster 1, which was defined by a significantly increased expression of a number of genes associated with cytotoxic effector CD8+ T cells, including CD8A, CD8B, PLEK, DUSP2, EOMES, GZMK, GZMA, GZMH, PRF1, NKG7, CCL5 and CCL4 (Supplementary Table 10). Overall, these data indicate that highly clonally expanded T cells in the CSF express gene profiles indicative of substantial antigen experience, cytotoxicity and distinct tissue homing capacities.

Nearly all CSF T cell clonotypes across all individuals were unique. Only 21 identical TCRs (that is, same V and J genes and CDR3 amino-acid sequences for the paired α and β chains) were found between the peripheral blood of different individuals and another three that were identical between the blood and CSF of different individuals, irrespective of disease status (Fig. 3a). To further assess clonal relationships, Grouping of Lymphocyte Interactions with Paratope Hotspots 2 (GLIPH2) was employed, an algorithm to help identify TCRs with potentially shared specificity based on sequence similarity within the CDR3β region18. All CSF T cell clonotypes were analyzed using GLIPH2 and the output was then queried against the 33 CSF high-enriched CDR3 sequences. Using this approach, 19 clonally related networks comprised of a total of 44 clonotypes were identified (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 11). Most of the networks comprised two related clonotypes and two networks were comprised of five clonotypes each. Almost all networks consisted of clonotypes from the same individual and were identified primarily among the individuals with MS or CIS (Fig. 3b). Nearly all of the clonally related T cells were CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Table 11), suggesting potential shared antigen specificity.

Data are the mean ± s.e.m. FLRGRAYGL (EBV EBNA3A193–201) was presented by HLA-B*08:01-expressing APCs (left) and EPLPQGQLTAY (EBV BZLF154–64) was presented by HLA-B*35:01-expressing APCs (right).

Antigen discovery efforts focused on the 23 highly expanded, CSF-enriched CD8+ T cell clonotypes (≥0.75 of the CSF repertoire and enriched at least twofold in the CSF relative to the blood) that comprised more than 70% of the expanded CSF-enriched T cells. Several different strategies were undertaken (Fig. 4a). An unbiased antigen discovery approach was first employed using a peptide:MHC (pMHC) yeast display library in which approximately 1–10 × 108 random peptides are displayed on a given MHC allele for probing recognition against individual TCRs19. Of the 23 CD8+ TCRs, 18 were successfully expressed and tested against specific MHC I allele libraries based on library availability and the alleles of the participants from whom the TCRs were derived. Four TCRs (three MS/CIS and one HC) demonstrated substantial enrichment of specific peptides from three different MHC I libraries (Supplementary Table 12).

a, Individual TCRαβ pairs were cloned into plasmids and expressed in primary human CD8+ T cells by nonviral CRISPR knock-in. Candidate antigens for testing specificity were identified in three parallel strategies, screened by pMHC tetramer binding and validated by cytokine production to cognate antigen. b, Candidate antigens for four TCRs identified by pMHC yeast display (unbiased antigen discovery) were tested for tetramer binding and cytokine reactivity experiments. Data are the mean ± s.e.m. Each peptide was tested a minimum of two times using T cells from different donors for tetramer and cytokine, respectively (RLVWDLETL, n = 6 and 4; RLIFDVPWL, n = 2 (both tests); RLLWDWEFV, n = 3 (both tests); RLVWDLEIL, n = 7 and 6; LVDYAKPPR, n = 6 and 5; RVIWEPEFR, n = 5 and 2; KVMWEPWFK n = 5 and 4; GYEIMLLDY n = 2 and 3; GYDVKELSY n = 2 and 3; CSERNPWTF n = 5 and 4; ATDVGWWWY, n = 5 and 2).

To validate these candidate antigens, each TCR was expressed individually in primary human CD8+ T cells by nonviral CRISPR–Cas9-mediated TCR knock-in (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Candidate TCR-expressing CD8+ T cells were then probed for antigen specificity using pMHC I tetramers loaded with peptides identified from the yeast display library screen. Three of the four tested TCRs demonstrated robust tetramer binding to most or all of the library-identified peptides (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 5b). The ability of CD8+ T cells expressing these TCRs to respond functionally to the same antigens was tested by intracellular cytokine stimulation using antigen-presenting cells (APCs) expressing the relevant MHC I allele. Strikingly, only TCR clonotype 54189_65570 demonstrated cytokine production to peptide CSERNPWTFY; none of the other TCR-expressing CD8+ T cells were functionally responsive to the respective yeast display-derived peptides (Fig. 4b). As nearly all of the yeast display peptides identified by pMHC I tetramers were not naturally occurring (that is, mimotopes), the analysis was extended to an array of foreign and human peptide homologs (Supplementary Table 12). Varying degrees of tetramer binding were observed depending on the TCR tested but none of the peptide homologs elicited cytokine responses above background (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Thus, although the unbiased antigen discovery approach yielded novel mimotopes of several CD8+ T cell clonotypes detectable by pMHC I tetramer binding, none exhibited functional reactivity to naturally occurring antigens.

The highly expanded CSF-enriched TCR clonotypes were queried against several public TCR databases, including VDJdb20, TCRex21 and TCRmatch22, as an additional TCR antigen discovery strategy (Fig. 4a). One CD8+ T cell clonotype (86333_1456) from participant MS8 demonstrated an exact match to both TCRα and -β sequences with a well-described Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) epitope, EBNA3A193–201 (FLRGRAYGL; Supplementary Table 13), which is restricted by HLA-B*08:01, an allele carried by this individual (Supplementary Table 1). This identical clonotype was also moderately expanded in the CSF from an individual with Alzheimer's disease17. A second CD8+ T cell clonotype (69317_24418) from participant MS6 was a near-exact match to a TCR specific for the EBV epitope BZLF154–64 (EPLPQGQLTAY) restricted by HLA-B*35:01, an allele also carried by this individual.

These TCRs were expressed in primary human CD8+ T cells as described earlier and their specificity was again tested by pMHC I tetramer analysis. TCR 86333_1456 and TCR 69317_24418 showed robust tetramer staining to EBNA3A193–201:B*08:01 and BZLF154–64:B*35:01, respectively (Fig. 5a). To confirm functional reactivity, primary human CD8+ T cells expressing each of these TCRs were stimulated with APC lines expressing cognate HLA and loaded with or without cognate EBV peptide. Each TCR demonstrated clear cytokine production to the relevant EBV peptide (Fig. 5b,c), confirming both CSF-expanded and enriched CD8+ T cell clonotypes are specific to EBV antigens.

Amino-acid differences between cognate EBV peptides (leftmost of each plot) and self-peptide homologs are indicated in red. Each peptide was tested in a minimum of two independent experiments.

In light of these findings, the possibility that additional CSF-enriched and expanded CD8+ T cells may be specific for viral antigens, in particular EBV, was further explored. Note that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 peptides were not tested as all samples were collected previous to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Nineteen TCRs were tested against panels of pMHC I tetramers loaded with previously identified immunodominant viral epitopes restricted by HLA matching that of the TCR donors. A total of 98 peptides restricted by eight different MHC I alleles were screened (Supplementary Table 14). Each TCR was screened with individual pMHC tetramers, except in the case of HLA-A*02:01 where tetramers were pooled in groups of five due to the large number of candidate peptides. Each TCR was tested against the indicated peptides a minimum of two times using two different T cell donors for TCR expression. No specific tetramer signal was observed for any of the TCRs to any of the peptides beyond the two EBV epitopes already identified for TCRs 86333_1456 and 69317_24418 (Extended Data Fig. 7). Although TCR 86333_17042 from participant MS8 showed an identical match for a TCRβ sequence specific for EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigens with corresponding MHC I alleles (Supplementary Table 13), it did not show any notable tetramer binding or cytokine reactivity to either viral antigen (Fig. 5a–c).

Potential reactivity to EBV was further assessed for the other CSF-expanded and enriched CD8+ T cells given the EBV reactivity of two clonotypes. EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were employed to survey a wide array of processed EBV epitopes across a multitude of HLA alleles. NFAT–mCherry-expressing Jurkat cells transfected with the CD8 co-receptor and a single candidate TCR were co-cultured with partially HLA-matched LCLs. Fully HLA-mismatched LCLs and TCR-expressing Jurkat cells from HLA-mismatched patients were used as negative controls. This enabled testing of 16 additional candidate TCRs against at least two different LCLs matching 3–6 MHC I alleles (Supplementary Table 15). Almost all TCRs showed no detectable reactivity; however, TCR 94669_8198 from patient MS27 demonstrated a clear reproducible response to LCLs only when matching the HLA-A*29:02 allele (Fig. 6a–c). No response was elicited from primary B cells from the same donor used to generate the LCLs, indicating this is very likely to be an EBV-specific response rather than a B cell self-antigen or alloreactive response. To identify a potential specific EBV epitope, Jurkat reporter cells expressing TCR 94669_8198 were tested against seven candidate EBV peptides identified from The Immune Epitope Database (FLYALALLL, VFGQQAYFY, AYSSWMYSY, FVYGGSKTSLY, VFSDGRVAC, VSSDGRVAC and ILLARLFLY) presented by HLA-A*29:02-expressing APCs. No functional response was elicited, however, indicating reactivity to a still unspecified EBV epitope (Extended Data Fig. 8).

a, Representative flow cytometry analysis of Jurkat reporter cells expressing the indicated TCR and CD8 co-receptor that were co-cultured with partially HLA-matched (matching allele indicated in red) EBV-transformed LCLs.

Fully HLA-mismatched LCLs and mismatched TCR-expressing Jurkat cells were used as negative controls. a,b, The percentage of cells in the gated regions is indicated. b, Representative flow cytometry analysis of Jurkat reporter cells expressing TCR 94669_8198 were co-cultured with LCLs or primary uninfected B cells from the same donor. c, Summary of all candidate TCRs tested and the corresponding matching MHC I alleles expressed by different LCL lines. The mCherry+CD69+ signal of a given TCR-expressing Jurkat cell line co-cultured with partially MHC-matched LCLs was normalized to the signal observed from completely MHC-mismatched LCLs (left) or mismatched TCR-expressing Jurkat cells (right), which was reported as fold change (FC).

We also explored EBV specificity for CD8+ T cell clonotypes that were aligned to the highly CSF-expanded and enriched CD8+ T cell clonotypes that were EBV-reactive (Fig. 3b). Only GLIPH2-derived TCR sequences from CD8+ T cells that shared the same MHC I allele as that of the aligned EBV-specific clonotype were tested (Supplementary Table 16). Unlike the EBV-specific clonotype 86333_1456, the GLIPH2-aligned TCRs 86333_17042 and 86333_18519 (all from MS8) showed no detectable reactivity to EBNA3A peptide FLRGRAYGL restricted by HLA-B*08:01 (Fig. 3c). TCR 53778_13077 from MS10 was aligned by GLIPH2 to TCR 69317_24418 from MS6, specific for the BZLF1 B*35:01-restricted peptide EPLPQGQLTAY. Strikingly, TCR 53778_13077 was found by VDJdb search to exactly match a TCR previously demonstrated to be specific for EPLPQGQLTAY23. This specificity was validated by stimulating Jurkat reporter cells expressing TCR 53778_13077 with or without EPLPQGQLTAY presented by HLA-B*35:01-expressing APCs. Notably, TCR 53778_13077 was moderately expanded in the CSF (0.35%) and enriched approximately threefold relative to the blood of MS10 (Supplementary Table 2).

These findings indicate that at least three highly expanded CD8+ T cells in the CSF of patients with MS are specific for EBV, but the specificities for most of the enriched T cell clonotypes remain unknown (Fig. 5d). The overwhelming majority of clonotypes were not enriched in the CSF of the 18 study participants (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2) or the three patients with MS and EBV-specific clonotypes (Extended Data Fig. 9a). To assess whether EBV specificity among expanded CD8+ T cells in the CSF was overall enhanced compared with the blood, TCR sequencing alignment (identical V genes, J genes and CDR3 amino-acid sequences for paired TCRα and -β chains) was performed against all expanded CD8+ TCR sequences (>1 TCR per clonotype) in VDJdb20 with CMV used as a comparison. EBV- and CMV-aligned CD8+ TCR sequences in the blood were very similar; however, EBV specificity was markedly increased in the CSF, whereas no CMV specificity was found (Fig. 5e). When the EBV-aligned CD8+ TCR sequences of the MS/CIS and HC/OND groups were compared, EBV-specific TCR alignment was only observed in the patients with MS/CIS (Fig. 5f). This provides additional support that EBV-specific CD8+ T cell expansion is uniquely increased in the CSF in MS.

CD8+ T cells of different viral specificities can exhibit distinct phenotypic characteristics24. The transcriptional profiles of the three CSF-expanded CD8+ T cell clonotypes were therefore compared against all other CSF-expanded and enriched CD8+ T cells. Differential gene expression analysis revealed three genes that were significantly increased in the EBV-specific CD8+ T cells, most notably CXCR5 (Supplementary Table 17), which is associated with migration to B cell follicles and control of chronic infections25. Specific genes associated with memory differentiation, migration and tissue residency were also compared. Consistent with previous reports24, CD27 was particularly abundant in the expanded EBV-specific CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 9b). In addition, KLF2, CXCR4, S1PR1 and CCL4 were more abundant in EBV-specific CD8+ T cells. In contrast, CXCR3, CD69 and CCL5 were more abundant in non-EBV-specific expanded CD8+ T cells. These findings therefore indicate a distinct phenotype of CSF-expanded CD8+ T cells that are specific for EBV. Rather than expressing TRM markers and genes associated with lymphocyte recruitment, these findings suggest that EBV-expanded CD8+ T cells in the CSF are an effector population associated with follicular homing and B cell interactions.

To determine whether the two EBV peptide-reactive CD8+ T cell clonotypes may be cross-reactive against self-antigens, the TCRs were screened against panels of self-peptides with partial sequence homology (Supplementary Table 18). Using NFAT–mCherry-expressing Jurkat cells transfected with the CD8 co-receptor and TCR 86333_1456 or 69317_24418, high reactivity to the respective EBV peptides was confirmed (Fig. 5g,h). Strikingly, no notable reactivity was observed for any of the self-peptide homologs. Although this does not entirely exclude the possibility for self-antigen cross-reactivity, it raises the possibility that the CSF enrichment of these clonally expanded CD8+ T cells may be driven by reactivity to EBV.

To assess for the presence of EBV in CSF, DNA was extracted from the CSF of all study participants and PCR amplified with primers specific for the EBV BZLF1 gene (Extended Data Fig. 10a). The PCR amplicons were Sanger sequenced for further confirmation (Supplementary Table 19). In this manner, EBV DNA was detected in 6/13 MS/CIS samples and 2/5 HC/OND samples (Supplementary Table 20), including patients MS6 and MS8 who also harbored highly expanded EBV-reactive CD8+ T cells in their CSF. The presence of EBV DNA was further quantified by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) via amplification of the EBER2 gene normalized to a housekeeping gene. EBV was detected in the CSF of nearly all patients and control study participants, although the relative abundance varied widely with the highest levels found in patients with MS/CIS (Fig. 7a and Extended Data Fig. 10b). EBV transcripts to several latent and lytic genes were also assessed by complementary DNA quantification. EBER2 cDNA was overall less detectable than DNA and there was no significant difference between MS/CIS and HC/OND (Fig. 7a,b). EBNA3A (latency III gene) and BZLF1 (early lytic gene) were mostly undetectable with no significant difference between the two cohorts (Fig. 7b). Strikingly, a significant increase was observed in BamHI-W transcripts in the MS/CIS cohort, including patients MS6, MS8 and M27 with highly expanded EBV-specific CD8+ T cells in CSF. This therefore suggests that EBV reactivation is enhanced in the CSF in patients with MS/CIS, which may drive the expansion of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells.

Each sample was run in duplicate and each dot represents the average result from each study participant. Data are the mean ± s.e.m. MS/CIS and HC/OND samples were compared using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test with Welch's correction; NS, not significant; n = 13 for MS/CIS for all genes except EBER2 where n = 12 due to lack of sufficient sample for MS27 and n = 5 in HC/OND for all genes except BamHI-W where n = 4 due to a lack of sufficient sample for OND4.

CD8+ T cells are the dominant lymphocyte population in MS lesions2,12, where they are highly clonally expanded4,5,8,9, suggesting reactivity to hitherto unknown local antigens. Although previous studies have explored changes in gene expression and T cell clonal expansion in the CSF of patients with MS10,11,12,26, numerous questions remain regarding the identity of clonally expanded CD8+ T cells and their antigen specificity in MS. Our comprehensive transcriptional and clonal analysis identified CSF-infiltrating T cells with increased expression of genes associated with T cell activation, the TRM phenotype and CNS migration in the MS/CIS cohort, consistent with previous reports10,11,12,27. As clonally expanded CD8+ T cells are present in the CSF in normal physiologic conditions and in CNS pathology10,17,26, identification of MS-specific CD8+ T cell clonal populations remains a challenge. Invoking a strategy used to identify disease-relevant T cells in inflammatory arthritis16,28 and cancer29, a subset of highly clonally expanded and CSF-enriched CD8+ T cells that had the highest frequencies in the patients with MS/CIS was identified. It was noteworthy that more than 70% of the highly expanded and CSF-enriched T cell clonotypes were CD8+ given that more than twice as many CD4+ T cells were analyzed. These CSF-enriched T cell clonotypes were widely characterized by a highly differentiated, antigen-experienced and cytotoxic phenotype with high CNS-trafficking potential, consistent with other reports30. These gene signatures were very similar to GZMB and TRM markers enriched in CD8+ T cells in MS lesions3,31, strongly suggesting these T cell clonotypes are CNS-infiltrating.

Small networks of highly expanded CSF-enriched T cells with shared TCR sequence features to other less-expanded clonotypes were found, which overwhelmingly occurred within the same individual. These findings suggest that distinct, clonally expanded T cells may be contributory to MS pathology, unlike other autoimmune conditions with preferential TCR usage16. Combined with the inherent technical challenges in T cell antigen discovery, these findings highlight the difficulties in identifying the antigen specificity of clonally expanded T cells in MS.

The majority of studies on candidate T cell auto-antigens in MS have focused on CD4+ T cells32,33,34. Through the use of three parallel antigen discovery strategies, our study provides substantial new insight into the antigen specificity of CD8+ T cells in MS. Novel mimotopes to several MS-derived CD8+ TCRs were identified by pMHC yeast display, a powerful unbiased antigen screening tool. Although the majority of mimotopes and naturally occurring peptide homologs were readily detectable by pMHC I tetramers, only one elicited a measurable functional response. The reason for the discrepancy between pMHC tetramer binding and functional reactivity is unclear but could be due to the absence of catch bonds by high-affinity TCR ligands35. Nonetheless, these candidate peptides provide an important framework for identifying TCRs with similar specificities in other individuals.

The methodology of testing individual TCRs in primary human T cells by pMHC tetramer screening, followed by validation with functional reactivity is highly rigorous and ensured only genuine positive results. This approach was particularly important in the case of a TCR that demonstrated an exact TCRβ match to another antigen-specific clonotype yet did not share the same specificity, highlighting the need to validate every TCRαβ individually. Antigen specificity should therefore be interpreted cautiously when based solely on partial TCR sequence matching.

Three distinct CSF-expanded and enriched CD8+ T cell clonotypes specific for EBV antigens were identified from three different patients in the MS cohort. Although EBV-specific CD8+ T cells have been previously reported in the CSF of MS and other neuro-inflammatory conditions36,37,38,39, the present study used paired TCRαβ analysis to unequivocally demonstrate EBV reactivity of highly enriched and clonally expanded CSF CD8+ T cell populations in MS. These findings are particularly relevant in light of recent evidence that EBV infection is a prerequisite for the subsequent development of MS40. Interestingly, the EBNA3A:B*08:01-specific CD8+ TCR identified in one of the patients with MS participating in this study was highly related to expanded CD8+ T cell clonotypes previously found in several patients with Alzheimer's disease17. Our findings therefore provide further support that EBV may be related to multiple forms of CNS pathology.

The mechanism by which EBV is involved in MS pathogenesis remains unresolved. The fact that the EBV-specific CD8+ T cell clonotypes identified here were highly expanded and enriched in the CSF suggests these T cells may be responding to antigen in the CNS. EBV-specific B cells and CD4+ T cells in MS have been suggested to be cross-reactive to CNS autoantigens41,42,43 (that is, molecular mimicry). We were unable to demonstrate cross-reactivity of the two EBV peptide-specific CD8+ T cell clonotypes against partially homologous self-peptides, but this does not completely rule out such a mechanism. Alternatively, the findings of CD8+ T cells reactive against EBV late latent and lytic antigens are consistent with other reports3,36,39 and could indicate EBV reactivation in the CNS44,45. In addition to the detection of EBV DNA in the CSF of most study participants, the increased expression of EBV transcripts in the MS/CIS cohort suggests that EBV reactivation drives expansion of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells. These findings are consistent with other recent results46 and suggest that EBV-specific CD8+ T cell expansion in the CSF could be a protective response to control reactivated EBV in MS.

There are multiple mechanisms by which EBV could gain access to the CNS. In addition to primary infection of cells within the CNS47, a number of studies have described the induction of ‘atypical' T-bet+CXCR3+ B cells by EBV48,49, which could enable their migration into the CNS. EBV expression is highly dynamic, permitting the virus to exist in various latency or lytic programs47. It is plausible that dysregulation of EBV expression is relevant to MS pathology. Clinical trials using adoptive T cell therapies targeting EBV in MS did not show a clear benefit in progressive MS50, however, it remains unclear how such therapies may alter EBV viral loads and expression as well as relapse and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes. It is also important to consider that EBV reactivation in MS may represent an epiphenomenon as memory B cell differentiation into plasma cells is a trigger of EBV reactivation. Thus, it is possible that EBV reactivation and expansion of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells are simply markers of B cell activation, which is ultimately the driver of MS pathology independent of EBV.

This study was limited by the smaller population of control participants. Follow-up studies with larger numbers of well-matched MS and control participants are needed to more clearly identify disease-relevant T cell populations in MS. In addition, longitudinal analyses of T cell clonal expansion in earlier versus later stages of MS are needed. Although the transcriptional phenotyping analyses suggest a pro-inflammatory cytotoxic phenotype of CSF-expanded CD8+ T cells, further in vitro and in vivo analyses are needed to determine what role these cells play in MS. It is also important to acknowledge that despite the rigor of the antigen specificity testing, this approach was not exhaustive and was limited in the breadth of antigens that were tested. Given that various foreign and self-antigens are considered viable antigenic targets in MS, future studies will need to incorporate high-throughput approaches to probe multiple target antigens simultaneously. The detection of EBV in the CSF of individuals without MS probably reflects the fact that the majority of the general population, with or without MS, is chronically infected with EBV. Given that there are only trace B cells in the CSF and CNS of healthy individuals, it is possible that cell-free EBV DNA originated in the blood. Alternatively, there are other cellular reservoirs in the CNS where EBV has been identified even in healthy individuals47.

Elucidating the role of CD8+ T cells in MS requires the assessment of their clonal repertoire in the CNS, identification of their antigenic targets and determination of their in vivo functions. This study provides important progress towards all three aims by demonstrating a small population of predominantly CD8+ T cells that were highly expanded and enriched in the CSF of patients with MS with strongly upregulated genes associated with antigen exposure, CNS migration and cytotoxicity. The finding of EBV specificity of three of these CD8+ T cell clonal populations in the presence of EBV helps to advance the understanding of MS pathogenesis and may permit the development of novel disease biomarkers and therapies.

The studies in this Article have been approved by the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Institutional Review Board research ethics committee (protocol numbers 10-02389 and 14-15278). Informed consent was obtained from all participants in this study. No compensation was provided to the study participants.

The participants, MS/CIS and control, were enrolled through the UCSF ORIGINS or Expression, Proteomics, Imaging, Clinical (EPIC) studies (https://epicstudy.ucsf.edu/). Healthy controls and patients with OND were enrolled in the biobanking study ‘Immunological Studies of Neurologic Subjects'. All enrolled participants with MS or CIS were diagnosed according to the 2017 McDonald criteria51. Basic demographic and clinical information for all research participants is shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1.

Blood and CSF samples were collected from the enrolled participants on the same day during clinical and research procedures after informed consent. CSF (20–30 ml) was collected by lumbar puncture from each individual. Blood and CSF were processed immediately after collection in preparation for single-cell library preparation as previously described15. Unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using CPT mononuclear cell preparation tubes (BD Biosciences) and resuspended in 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The CSF was centrifuged at 400g and 4 °C for 15 min, resuspended in 80 µl supernatant and counted. Single-cell sequencing libraries were prepared using 5′ scRNA-seq and 5′ T cell V(D)J scTCR-seq kits (10X Genomics).

Raw data for both scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq datasets were processed using CellRanger (v3.0.1 and v3.1.0, respectively) by 10X Genomics. The cellranger count and cellranger vdj commands were run with input Ensembl GRCh38.v93 and GRCh38.v94 references for the scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data, respectively. All data were analyzed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline that included Seurat (v3.1.2–v4.3.0), the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) algorithm52 (v2.5.1), SingleR53 (v1.1.7) and DoubletFinder54 (v2.0.2). TCR V(D)J contig assemblies outputted from CellRanger were further annotated and analyzed using Immcantation (v3.1.0). TCR clonal families were identified using Change-O55 (v0.4.6), which generated clone IDs for both TCRα and -β chain assemblies. The scRNA-seq data have been uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository under BioProject PRJNA549712 (GEO accession number GSE133028) and the scTCR-seq data have been uploaded under BioProject PRJNA1232831 (GEO accession number GSE291328).

Across both RNA-seq and VDJ data, reads present in more than one sample that shared the same cell barcode and unique molecular identifier were filtered using previously described methods15. The R package DropletUtils was used to filter out these reads in the RNA-seq data and SingleCellVDJdecontamination (https://github.com/UCSF-Wilson-Lab/SingleCellVDJdecontamination) was used to apply the same methods to filter out these reads in the VDJ data.

All gene counts from scRNA-seq data were combined using Seurat. Only genes present in two or more cells were included. Only cells containing transcripts of between 700 and 2,500 genes were included. The PercentageFeatureSet function was used to calculate the percentage of mitochondrial transcript expression for each cell. Cells that expressed at least 10% mitochondrial genes were omitted. Gene counts were normalized using the R package SCTransform56. The parameter do.correct.umi was set equal to TRUE and var.to.regess was set to nCount_RNA. All filtered cells were clustered using 20 principal components (PCs) in Seurat. Clusters were formed using a shared nearest-neighbor graph in combination with dimensional reduction using uniform manifold approximation and projection57. Doublet detection and removal were performed for each sample using DoubletFinder54 with expected doublet rates set based on the 10X Genomics reference manual. Cumulative sums were iteratively calculated for each PC to measure the per cent variance accounted for with the data. To determine a reasonable number of PCs, a threshold of 90% variance was applied, which resulted in 12 PCs being inputted when reclustering cells. Clusters of cells with a high expression of platelet markers (PPBP and PF4) or hemoglobin subunits (HBB, HBA1 and HBA2) were omitted. Among the remaining cells, all V gene transcripts (TRAV, TRBV, IGHV, IGKV and IGLV) were removed and an additional round of reclustering was performed with nine PCs.

Assembled TCR contigs outputted from CellRanger were inputted into the Immcantation pipeline for a second round of alignments to the VDJ region using IgBLAST. Contigs containing fewer than three unique molecular identifiers were omitted. Only contigs that aligned in frame (both the FUNCTIONAL and IN_FRAME output fields were TRUE) and across the constant region were retained. Cells in the TCR VDJ data were only kept if these contained one TCRβ chain and one TCRα chain. If cells had multiple chains, TCRα or -β, which passed these thresholds, the contig with the largest number of unique molecular identifiers and or reads was kept.

Cell-type annotations were generated using previously described methods15. Cell types were defined by performing differential gene expression analysis for each cluster. The normalized gene expression profile for each cluster was compared with the remaining cells using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test using the FindAllMarkers function (min.pct = 0.1, logfc.threshold = 0.25, return.thresh = 0.01). The most upregulated genes, with the highest positive average log-transformed fold change, were compared with a custom panel of canonical gene makers (Supplementary Table 21) spanning several key immune cell types—B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, classical monocytes, inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells. In addition to these manual cell-type annotations, another set of cell types was determined using the automated cell-type annotation tool SingleR, which used the combined Blueprint and ENCODE reference dataset for fine-tuning predictions53.

A T cell subset was created by filtering for cells that overlap both RNA-seq and TCR VDJ data. All clusters annotated as T cells had their annotations modified by CD8 gene expression. Among the T cells, any cell with CD8A or CD8B expression was annotated as a CD8+ T cell. The remaining T cells were then annotated as CD4+ T cells. Differential gene expression analyses were performed using the FindMarkers command in Seurat with the Wilcoxon test and the following parameters: P-adjusted value cutoff = 0.05 and log(fold change) cutoff = 0.

The TCR contigs outputted from Immcantation were clustered based on similarities between their TCR variable region genes (TRAV or TRBV), TCR joining region genes (TRAJ or TRBJ) and complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) amino-acid sequences. A TCR clonotype was defined as cells containing TCRα and -β chains, each containing identical V and J genes, and CDR3 amino-acid sequences. Cell counts were computed for each clone ID, including separate cell counts for PBMC and CSF samples. Shannon's entropy was calculated between CSF and PBMC samples of different disease groups using the alphaDiversity function in the R package alakazam. Specifically, the exponential of diversity scores (D) from the Shannon–Wiener index were extracted from the output of alphaDiversity by filtering for the diversity order (q = 1). Clonal expansion was defined as clones containing more than one cell. Among the expanded clonal families of TCRs, CSF enrichment of highly expanded clones was determined by the ratio of the CSF to peripheral-blood frequencies. Clones with a CSF frequency of ≥0.75% were annotated as CSF highly expanded. Clones that were expanded in CSF (that is, more than singletons), but with frequencies less than highly expanded, were labeled as moderately expanded. Among the expanded clonal families of TCRs, CSF enrichment of highly expanded clones was determined by the ratio of the CSF to peripheral-blood frequencies. CSF highly expanded TCRs were inputted into GLIPH2 to generate glyph groups, which indicated which TCRs were predicted to target the same epitope. These glyph groups were used to create a network using the R package igraph and graphically displayed using Cytoscape.

HLA sequencing was performed as previously described, adapted to include HLA class II58. For each sample, 100 ng high-quality DNA was fragmented using a Library preparation enzymatic fragmentation kit 2.0 (Twist Bioscience). After fragmentation, the DNA was repaired, and poly(A) tails were attached and ligated to Illumina-compatible dual-index adapters with unique barcodes. After ligating, the fragments were purified with a 0.8× ratio of AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). Double size selection was performed (0.42× and 0.15× ratios) and libraries of approximately 800 bp were selected, at which point libraries were amplified and purified using magnetic beads. After fluorometric quantification, each sample was pooled (30 ng per sample) via ultrasonic acoustic energy. A Twist target enrichment kit (Twist Bioscience) was then used to perform target capture on pooled samples. Sample volumes were then reduced using magnetic beads and DNA libraries were bound to 1,394 biotinylated probes. Probes were designed specifically to target all exons, introns and regulatory regions of the classical HLA loci, including HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1. Next, streptavidin magnetic beads were used to capture fragments targeted by the probes. The captured fragments were then amplified and purified. A BioAnalyzer instrument (Agilent) was then used to analyze the enriched libraries. After evaluation, the enriched libraries were sequenced using a paired-end 150-bp sequencing protocol on the NovaSeq platform (Illumina). Following sequencing, HLA genotypes were predicted using HLA Explorer (Omixon).

The TCR sequences for each α and β gene pair were codon-optimized and used to generate gene blocks (IDT) in which the TCRβ and TCRα sequences were separated by a P2A sequence. Flanking homology arms were included to permit knock-in into the human TRAC locus, as previously described59. The gene blocks were cloned into pUC19 plasmids by Gibson assembly and the sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing.

Primary human CD8+ T cells were isolated from commercially purchased leukopaks (Vitalant or Stemcell; unidentified healthy donors). PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll centrifugation and cryopreserved before each experiment. In all experiments, T cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS, 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin–streptomycin with L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, MEM vitamin solution and nonessential amino acids (all Fisher Scientific). TCR knock-in was performed as previously described59, with minor changes. Briefly, CD8+ T cells were isolated from thawed PBMCs by negative selection (Miltenyi) and rested overnight with 5 ng ml−1 human IL-7. The CD8+ T cells were stimulated 1:1 with anti-human CD3/CD28 magnetic Dyna beads (Fisher Scientific), 20 ng ml−1 human IL-2, 5 ng ml−1 human IL-7 and 5 ng ml−1 IL-15 for 48 h previous to T cell electroporation.

Guide RNAs specific for the human TRAC locus were generated by incubating CRISPR RNA (crRNA; AGAGTCTCTCAGCTGGTACA) 1:1 with trans-activating crRNA (Dharmacon) for 30 min at 37 °C to yield a final concentration of 80 µM. Polyglutamic acid (0.8× volume) was added to the guide RNA as previously described60. Cas9 (QB3; Macrolab) was added 1:1 with the guide RNA and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C to yield a 20 µM ribonucleoprotein, which was used immediately for electroporation.

Dyna beads were removed from the T cell culture using an EasySep separation magnet (StemCell) 48 h after CD8+ T cell stimulation. The T cells were then centrifuged at 200g for 9 min and resuspended in Lonza electroporation P3 buffer with supplement (20 µl per 1 × 106 T cells). The T cells (20 µl) were electroporated with 3.5 µl ribonucleoprotein and 1 µg TCR-encoding plasmid DNA (1–2 µl) using a Lonza 4D Nucleofector 96-well electroporation system and pulse code EH115 (ref. 61). CD8+ T cells were immediately rescued by the addition of 80 µl warmed T cell medium and incubation in a 37 °C incubator for 15 min. The cells were then split into fifths in 96-well round-bottomed plates; T cell medium plus 10 ng ml−1 IL-2 was added to the samples to a final volume of 200 µl. The CD8+ T cells were expanded for a minimum of 96 h before testing for pMHC tetramer binding. The T cells were re-fed with a half volume of fresh medium and IL-2 every 3–4 days.

Ultraviolet photolabile pMHC I monomers for HLA-A*01:01, HLA-A*A2:01, HLA-A*03:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-B*08:01, HLA-B*15:01, HLA-B*35:01 and HLA-B*44:02 were obtained from the NIH Tetramer Core. Custom peptide-loaded MHC I monomers were generated by ultraviolet light–ligand exchange as previously described62. HLA-A*31:01 pMHC monomers (Easymers) were purchased from ImmunAware and loaded with custom peptides according to the supplier's instructions. Tetramerization was carried out using streptavidin conjugated to the fluorophores phycoerythrin and allophycocyanin (Life Technologies). CD8+ T cells were treated with 100 nM dasatinib (StemCell) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by staining with the appropriate tetramers (2–3 µg ml−1) for 30 min at room temperature. All tetramers were used within 3–4 weeks of synthesis. The cells were washed in FACS buffer (1×DPBS without calcium or magnesium, 0.1% sodium azide, 2 mM EDTA and 1% FBS) and stained with anti-CD8 PECy7 (eBioscience; SK1), anti-TCR BV421 (BioLegend; IP26), a PerCP/Cy5.5 dump antibody mixture containing anti-CD4 (BioLegend; RPA-T4), anti-CD14 (BioLegend; HCD14), anti-CD16 (BioLegend; B73.1), anti-CD19 (BioLegend; HIB19; all antibodies at 1:100) and Aqua506 viability dye (1:1,000; Life Technologies) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed and resuspended in FACS buffer, and analyzed by flow cytometry (LSRFortessa). Only experiments where the forward versus side-scatter gate contained at least 10% lymphocytes and CD8+ T cells expressed fewer than 20% TCRs were used for analysis to ensure a large number of T cells with high TCR-knockout efficiency was achieved (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

Yeast libraries were developed as previously described19. Yeast allele libraries were thawed in SDCAA (pH 5) medium, passaged, induced in SGCAA (pH 5) and selected using biotinylated soluble TCR coupled to streptavidin-coated magnetic MACS beads (Miltenyi) as previously described63. Briefly, 2 × 109 yeast cells from all four length libraries underwent negative selection with 250 μl beads in 5 ml PBE (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 1 mM EDTA) for 1 h with rotation at 4 °C. After passage through an LS column (Miltenyi) on a magnetic stand and three washes with 3 ml PBE, the flow-through was incubated with 250 μl beads (pre-incubated with 400 nM biotinylated TCR) for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. The yeast were magnetically separated through an additional LS column, washed three times with 3 ml PBE and the elution was cultured overnight in SDCAA (pH 5) following an SDCAA wash to remove residual PBE. The yeast were induced in SGCAA (pH 5) for 2–3 days before further selection, with subsequent selections using 50 μl beads or TCR-coated beads in 500 μl PBE.

DNA was isolated from 5–10 × 107 yeast cells per selection using a Zymoprep II kit (Zymo Research). Unique barcodes and random eight-mer sequences were added to the sequencing product by PCR and amplified for 25 cycles to allow for downstream demultiplexing and improved clustering. A subsequent PCR added Illumina chip primer sequences, resulting in products containing Illumina P5-Truseq read 1-(N8)-Barcode-pHLA-(N8)-Truseq read 2-IlluminaP7. The library was purified by double-sided SPRI bead isolation (Beckman Coulter), quantified using a KAPA library amplification kit (Illumina) and deep sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument with a 2 × 150 V2 kit for low-diversity libraries.

The genes for HLA-A*31:01, HLA-A*29:02, HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-B*35:01 were codon-optimized and synthesized as gene blocks (IDT). The gene blocks were cloned into the pHR-CMV Lacz lentivirus vector by Gibson assembly and sequences were verified by Sanger sequencing. The vector was expressed in K562 cells by lentiviral transduction and selected by puromycin.

The APCs for all cytokine assays were T2 cells expressing HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*01:01 or HLA-A*03:01, or K562 cells expressing HLA*29:02, HLA-A*31:01, HLA-B*08:01 or HLA-B*35:01. The APCs were pulsed overnight with 10 µg ml−1 peptide or vehicle control in serum-free medium. CD8+ T cells (2 × 105) were stimulated with peptide-loaded APCs (1 × 105 per condition) for 6 h in the presence of 1:500 GolgiStop (BD), 1:500 GolgiPlug (BD) and 1:200 CD28/CD49d (FastImmune; BD). The cells were washed with FACS buffer and stained with the cell surface antibodies as described in the ‘pMHC tetramer screening' section (anti-CD8, anti-TCR, dump channel antibody mixture and live/dead dye). Next, the cells were washed, fixed and stained with anti-human IFN-γ Alexa 647 (BioLegend; 4S.B3) and anti-human TNF-α Alexa 488 (BioLegend; Mab11) in permeabilization buffer (BD). Finally, the cells were washed and collected on an LSRFortessa system.

Jurkat E6-1 T cells (American Type Culture Collection, TIB-152) were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with L-glutamine and 10% FBS. Endogenous TRAC and TRBC1 expression in Jurkat cells were knocked out with synthetic crRNAs designed using the Alt-R system (IDT) containing the following genomic target sequences: TRBC1, 5′-CGTAGAACTGGACTTGACAG-3′ and TRAC, 5′-CTTCAAGAGCAACAGTGCTG-3′. The crRNA was complexed with 1:1 trans-activating crRNA (IDT; 0.2 nmol each), followed by 0.1 nmol recombinant Cas9 protein (Macrolab). The ribonucleoproteins were then transduced into Jurkat T cells using a Amaxa P3 primary cell nucleofector kit (Lonza; pulse code CK116). TRAC knockout was performed first and loss of surface TCRαβ expression was confirmed by flow cytometry. TRAC-knockout cells underwent subsequent knockout of TRBC1, which had previously been shown to lead to loss of TCRαβ expression in line with overexpressed TCRα. To track TCR activation, a lentiviral vector was constructed that contained the NFAT transcriptional reporter NBV64 upstream of a minimal CMV reporter driving mCherry fluorescent marker expression, and constitutive expression of iRFP670 under a Pgk promoter provided a marker of transduction. Jurkat cells lacking endogenous TCRαβ expression were transduced with the vector and sorted for iRFP fluorescence and lack of mCherry background fluorescence. For TCRs corresponding to CD8+ T cells, an additional lentiviral vector encoding human CD8α was expressed in the Jurkat cells and the cells were sorted for uniform CD8α expression before TCR transduction. For TCR expression, lentiviral expression constructs that encode a human Pgk promoter and the coding sequence of each specific TCRα chain with the IRES-neomycin resistance gene or each TCRβ chain with the IRES-blasticidin resistance gene were generated. Lentiviral particles were packaged in HEK293T cells following standard protocols and concentrated 10× using the Lenti-X Concentrator reagent (Takara). Viral particles were added to T cells at a low multiplicity of infection and expression was ensured by passaging cells for 5 days under antibiotic selection with 10 µg ml−1 blasticidin (Gibco) and 1 mg ml−1 G418 (Teknova).

TCR-expressing Jurkat cells (1 × 105) were stimulated for 24 h with HLA-allele-transduced APCs (1 × 105) loaded with 10 µg ml−1 peptide or vehicle control. Antigen-reactive CD8+ cells were identified by coexpression of NFAT–mCherry and anti-human CD69–phycoerythrin (BioLegend; FN50).

A Pan B cell isolation kit (Miltenyi) was used to isolate B cells from frozen PBMCs. The B cells (1 × 106 cells ml−1) were incubated 1:1 with pre-warmed EBV supernatant (B95.8 strain) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 1 μg ml−1 R848 and 100 ng ml−1 CD40L. The cells were cultured for two weeks, with medium changes as needed, and expanded into larger plates. The LCLs were cryopreserved for future use in cellular assays.

Jurkat cells expressing the TCR of interest (target TCR Jurkat cells) were co-cultured with LCLs carrying at least one matching MHC I allele (HLA-matched LCLs) at a 1:1 ratio (100,000 cells each per well) in a 96-well plate for 24 h at 37 °C. To assess specificity, negative control conditions included co-culture of (1) target TCR Jurkat cells with HLA-mismatched LCLs and (2) HLA-matched LCLs with Jurkat cells expressing an HLA-mismatched TCR. Jurkat reactivity was assessed by measurement of coexpression of NFAT–mCherry and CD69–phycoerythrin as described in the ‘TCR-expressing Jurkat cell assays' section.

Cell-free CSF supernatant was obtained after centrifugation as described earlier for single-cell sequencing and stored at −80 °C. DNA and RNA were each extracted from 400 µl CSF supernatant using a ZYMO Quick-DNA/RNA pathogen MagBead kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted DNA was eluted in 50 µl nuclease-free water. DNase I treatment was performed on the RNA-extraction samples before elution into 30 µl nuclease-free water. An EBV-transformed LCL was used as a positive control; Jurkat cells and water only were used as negative controls. The DNA concentration and purity were assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The extracted DNA and RNA were stored at −20 °C until use for PCR amplification. Complementary DNA was synthesized using a ProtoScript first strand cDNA synthesis kit (NEB) using 6 µl RNA per 20 µl reaction volume according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The following previously described65 primers (IDT) for the BZLF1 promoter were used: 5′-AGCATGCCATGCATATTTC-3′ (forward) and 5-TTGGCAAGGTGCAATGTTT-3′ (reverse). PCR reactions were performed using a Qiagen Taq PCR core kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each 30-µl reaction contained 1×PCR Buffer with MgCl2, 200 µM dNTPs, 0.2 µM forward and reverse primers, 10–100 ng template DNA, 0.75 U Qiagen Taq DNA polymerase and nuclease-free water to the final volume. Amplification was carried out in a thermal cycler (Bio-Rad thermal cycler with 96-deep-well C1000 block) using the following cycling conditions: an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 34 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. A final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min was performed, followed by a hold at 4 °C. The PCR products were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under ultraviolet light using a gel documentation system (LI-COR Odyssey M Imager). For samples showing positive amplification, the remaining PCR reaction volume was directly submitted to Molecular Cloning Laboratories for Sanger sequencing. CSF samples were considered EBV-positive if sequencing results correctly aligned to the reference sequence of the amplified target.

Primers and probes for ddPCR were synthesized as PrimeTime qPCR assays (IDT). Probes targeting EBV genes were labeled with FAM and probes for the housekeeping reference genes (RPP30 or GAPDH) were labeled with HEX (Supplementary Table 22). Oligonucleotides were used as previously published for EBER2 (ref. 66), BamHI-W67 and RPP30 (ref. 68). A volume of 1.25 μl of each 20× target primers–probe mix in Tris–EDTA was used with 2×ddPCR Supermix for probes without deoxyuridine triphosphate and 10 μl DNA. A total reaction volume of 20 μl was loaded with a 70-μl oil droplet using a QX100 droplet generator (Bio-Rad). The emulsion of approximately 40 μl was slowly transferred to ddPCR 96-well plates (Bio-Rad, 12001925) and heat-sealed with foil. Amplification was carried out in a thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Thermal Cycler with 96-Deep Well C1000 block) using the following cycling conditions: an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min; 39 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C and 1 min at 57 °C, followed by 10 min at 98 °C. Analysis of the ddPCR data was performed using the Bio-Rad QuantaSoftTM software. Data from the droplet reader are given as copies per microlitre and relative expression was calculated as the target gene:reference gene ratio. Any sample that was not detected by the housekeeping gene was repeated and the threshold was set separately according to the negative control with water. All samples were run in duplicate.

Differential gene expression comparisons between groups were performed using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Bonferroni correction. Shannon entropy results were compared using Brown–Forsythe's and Welch's analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using Dunnett T3 corrections. Comparisons of CSF-enriched clonotypes T cell (for example, CD8+ versus CD4+ T cells and MS/CIS versus HC/OND) and ddPCR results were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t-tests with Welch's correction using GraphPad Prism (v10.6.1).

Electrons in solids owe their properties to the periodic potential landscapes they experience. The advent of moiré lattices has revolutionized our ability to engineer such landscapes on nanometre scales, leading to numerous ground-breaking discoveries. Despite this progress, direct imaging of these electrostatic potential landscapes remains elusive. Here we introduce the atomic single electron transistor (SET), a new scanning probe that uses a single atomic defect in a van der Waals material as an ultrasensitive, high-resolution potential sensor. Built on the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) platform1, this probe leverages the capability of the QTM to form a pristine, scannable two-dimensional interface between vdW heterostructures. Using the atomic SET, we present the first direct images of the electrostatic potential in a canonical moiré interface: graphene aligned to hexagonal boron nitride2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. The measured potential exhibits an approximate C6 symmetry, minimal dependence on carrier density and a substantial amplitude of approximately 60 mV, even in the absence of carriers. Theory indicates that this symmetry arises from a delicate interplay of physical mechanisms with competing symmetries. The measured amplitude significantly exceeds theoretical predictions, suggesting that current understanding may be incomplete. With 1 nm spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect the potential of even a few millionths of an electron charge, the atomic SET enables ultrasensitive imaging of charge order and thermodynamic properties across a wide range of quantum phenomena, including symmetry-broken phases, quantum crystals, vortex charges and fractionalized quasiparticles.

The behaviour of electrons in a lattice is governed by the periodic potential of the host material. In naturally occurring materials, this periodicity is determined by the atomic length scale, making it extremely challenging to directly image the local electrostatic potential. Over the past decade, moiré engineering has emerged as a powerful approach to create tunable periodic potentials at van der Waals (vdW) interfaces, achieving length scales substantially larger than those of atomic lattices. A canonical example is the interface between aligned graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (G/hBN), in which their lattice mismatch produces a moiré superlattice that alters the electronic properties through its periodic potential. This moiré interface has enabled numerous discoveries, including the observation of the Hofstadter butterfly3,4,5 and Brown–Zak oscillations11. More recently, when coupled with graphene multilayers, this aligned G/hBN interface has played a crucial role in stabilizing even more exotic phases, such as ferromagnetism in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene12,13, unconventional ferroelectricity in bilayer graphene14,15 and the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene16.

Despite its pivotal role, so far the G/hBN moiré potential has only been inferred indirectly from transport17,18 and optical19,20 measurements. Unlike in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), whose band edges can serve as direct markers for potential variations21, mapping the moiré potential in a vdW interface such as G/hBN requires a new imaging technique that combines nanometre resolution with exceptional potential sensitivity. The most sensitive tool currently available for imaging electrostatic potentials is the scanning single electron transistor (SET)22,23,24,25, which uses transport through a small island in the Coulomb blockade regime for detection. However, the spatial resolution of existing scanning SETs is constrained by their lithographic dimensions (>100 nm), preventing them from resolving potentials within a moiré unit cell. Although STM experiments with a graphene sensor layer26,27 have achieved intermediate spatial resolution, and recent advancements in AFM-based techniques have led to high-resolution imaging of molecules28,29,30, direct visualization of moiré potentials within vdW heterostructures remains an unmet challenge.

In this work, we develop the atomic SET, a new scanning probe that uses a single atomic defect31,32,33,34,35,36 as a scanning potential sensor, achieving 1 nm spatial resolution, two orders of magnitude better than existing SETs, and a potential sensitivity of 5 μV Hz−1/2. This remarkable sensitivity corresponds to detecting variations of a few parts per million of the potential produced by a single electron charge at the distance given by the spatial resolution (Supplementary Information section 17). Using this tool, we directly image the potential at the G/hBN moiré interface. Our measurements show that even at zero carrier density, the peak-to-peak potential amplitude is large (about 60 mV) and exhibits an approximate C6 symmetry around the moiré centre. Although this symmetry can be explained by a subtle interplay of competing mechanisms, the magnitude of the measured potential is about twice that predicted by existing theory, highlighting that our understanding of even this simple moiré interface remains incomplete.

The working principle of the scanning atomic SET is shown in Fig. 1a. A single atomic defect embedded in a thin TMD layer acts as a quantum dot, the energy level of which shifts with small changes to the local electrostatic potential ϕ(r). The system of interest is placed on the QTM tip, so scanning the tip across the stationary defect modulates the potential of the defect and, in turn, shifts its Coulomb blockade peak. By monitoring this shift, we directly image ϕ(r). This inverted geometry, in which the system of interest is on the tip, enables selecting an optimal defect from a large pool of natural defects within the flat TMD layer.

a, Schematic of the atomic SET geometry: the system of interest (purple), positioned on a QTM tip, is scanned across a fixed atomic defect (yellow) embedded in an insulating barrier (blue) above a graphene electrode (grey). At low temperature, the defect functions as a quantum dot (QD) exhibiting single electron transport (white arrows). As the tip scans across this defect, the spatially varying electrostatic potential ϕ(r) of the system on tip gates the defect, and by monitoring its Coulomb blockade peak, we directly map this potential. b, Illustration of an experiment to image individual atomic defects in WSe2: a bias voltage (Vb) is applied to the bottom graphene electrode and the current (I) through the tip is measured while scanning. When the tip does not overlap a defect (off-defect), the current arises from momentum-conserving tunnelling processes. However, when the contact area of the tip (white dashed line) overlaps a defect (on-defect), an additional defect-assisted tunnelling pathway opens. c, Defect imaging experiment using a QTM tip comprising aligned G/hBN layers. As the tip is scanned across trilayer WSe2 on a graphene electrode at Vb = –0.7 V, the measured I map shows multiple replicas of the tip contact area, each produced by a different defect. Within each replica, the G/hBN moiré superlattice appears as periodic modulations of I and the sharp edges (arrows) demonstrate a spatial resolution of approximately 1 nm. d, Schematic energy diagrams (top) and corresponding current maps (bottom) measured with a different G/hBN tip at T = 0.2 K and at three biases: Vb = –1.25 V (left), –0.9 V (centre) and –0.35 V (right), all within the same scan window. The energy diagrams show the interface along the z-direction: a graphene source electrode (grey), defects (yellow and grey) in a bilayer WSe2 barrier (blue) and a G/hBN moiré drain electrode (purple). As |Vb| decreases, the range of transport-accessible defects (highlighted in yellow) is narrowed, resulting in fewer observed tip-shape replicas. At the lowest bias, only a single replica remains in the entire scan window. Scale bars, 50 nm (c); 400 nm (d).

To locate suitable defects, we map the tunnelling current (I) at a fixed bias voltage (Vb) while scanning the tip across the TMD layer (Fig. 1b). When the tip does not overlap a defect, the current reflects only background momentum-conserving elastic1 and inelastic (phonon-assisted)37 tunnelling. However, when it overlaps a defect, an additional tunnelling channel opens, allowing electrons to tunnel preferentially through the defect. This results in an increased \(I\) when the contact area of the tip (white dashed line) coincides with a defect.

Figure 1c shows a room-temperature measurement using a trilayer WSe2 barrier. The scan shows several oblong shapes of increased I, each corresponding to a separate atomic defect imaging the contact area of the tip. Their identical spatial structure and increase in I suggest that these defects have the same chemical origin. In this experiment, the QTM tip consists of aligned G/hBN, forming a moiré superlattice2,3,4,5 that the defect imaging remarkably resolves even at room temperature. This measurement demonstrates extremely high spatial resolution, apparent from the sharpness of the tip image edges (about 1 nm; Supplementary Information section 6). Although we might expect that transferring a moiré heterostructure onto the QTM tip would result in significant strain that would be magnified by the moiré superlattice38, this measurement (Fig. 3a) instead shows minimal moiré heterostrain, typically less than ±0.3% (Supplementary Information section 7).

Another important aspect of the defects is their energetics, which we investigate by imaging at different bias voltages at low temperature (T = 0.2 K). Figure 1d presents maps taken with another tip containing aligned G/hBN (λm = 14 nm) scanned over a bilayer WSe2 barrier and graphene electrode. All subsequent data use this tip and are taken at this temperature. At high bias, the defect-assisted current is small compared with the Fowler–Nordheim tunnelling background through the WSe2 conduction band39. Nevertheless, numerous lungs-shaped replicas of the tip contact area appear, reflecting the large set of defects accessible at this energy. As the bias is reduced, progressively fewer defects contribute, and at the lowest bias, only a single low-energy defect remains within the scan window, with minimal residual background tunnelling. We use these relatively rare, low-energy defects for imaging: their sparse distribution ensures single-defect imaging, and their low energies allow us to operate near zero bias, avoiding hot-electron and phonon injection that could interfere with measuring the thermodynamic ground state of the system.

In the measurements so far, the defects served only as localized pathways for current. Now we aim to harness an individual defect as a fully functional quantum dot that can probe the local electrostatic potential and thermodynamic quantities at a specific position. This is accomplished by adding top and bottom gates to the QTM junction (Fig. 2a). In a prototypical quantum dot, applying a gate voltage Vgate linearly shifts the electrostatic potential of the quantum dot, producing a characteristic Coulomb diamond diagram (Fig. 2b). At zero bias, there is a specific Vgate in which the N and N + 1 charge states of the quantum dot are degenerate, permitting current to flow. At finite bias, the conduction window expands linearly with Vb, creating a diamond shape in the Vgate–Vb plane.

a, Cross-section of the QTM junction: the tip comprises an aligned G/hBN moiré interface, an hBN layer and a graphite top gate. The sensor device contains a defect-bearing bilayer WSe2 barrier, a graphene electrode, an hBN layer and a metal bottom gate. b, Prototypical quantum dot Coulomb diamond conductance diagram versus gate voltage (Vgate) and source–drain bias (Vb), showing a central conduction region (blue) and Coulomb-blockaded regions with fixed charge states (labelled N and N + 1). c, Electrostatic relations in the junction: for each graphene layer, µ = V – ϕ. The defect potential is ϕD = αϕT + (1 – α)ϕB with α= zB/(zT + zB), where zB and zT are the distances of the defect from the bottom and top layers, respectively. The defect energy ED is referenced to ϕD. d, Because the system of interest lies between the gate and the defect, gate voltages are screened by the electronic compressibility of the system. This leads to curvature in the Coulomb diamond lines, reflecting the density-dependent µ(n) of the two graphene electrodes. e, Off-defect differential conductance (dI/dV) versus top gate voltage (VTG) and Vb at T = 0.2 K and B = 0 T. Curves of reduced dI/dV correspond to the charge neutrality points (CNPs, n = 0) of the top (purple dashed) and bottom (white dashed) graphene layers. Additional suppression for |Vb| < Vth ≈ 65 mV (horizontal cyan dashed lines) arises from nonlinear contact resistance (see text). f, Off-defect measurement at \({B}_{\perp }=5\,{\rm{T}}\) showing reduced dI/dV along Landau level gaps in the top (\({\nu }_{{\rm{T}}}^{\mathrm{LL}}=\pm 2,\,\pm 6\), purple) and bottom (\({\nu }_{{\rm{B}}}^{\mathrm{LL}}=\pm 2\), white) graphene layers. g, On-defect dI/dV versus VTG and Vb at B = 0 T, exhibiting a Coulomb diamond diagram with curved boundaries that separate blockaded regions with near-zero dI/dV and fixed quantum dot charge (N and N + 1) from a high-conductance region. Arrows mark the deflection points at the CNPs of the top G/hBN (purple) and bottom graphene (white) layers. h, On-defect measurement at \({B}_{\perp }=5\,{\rm{T}}\), where the diamond edges exhibit step-like features due to Landau level gaps in both electrodes. White and purple dashed lines in e–h are fits to the electrostatic model (Supplementary Information sections 2 and 5).

In our experiment, the system of interest is situated between the gate and the defect, so the defect directly senses the local chemical potential of the system. As shown in Fig. 2c, the electrochemical (V), electrostatic (ϕ) and chemical (µ) potentials of the two graphene layers satisfy µ = V – ϕ for each layer. Consequently, when both layers are grounded (VT = VB = 0), their local electrostatic potentials directly track their local chemical potentials. The defect experiences an electrostatic potential ϕD = αϕT + (1 – α)ϕB (Supplementary Information sections 2 and 3), with α = zB/(zT + zB) set by its relative distances to the top and bottom layers (zT, zB). The response of ϕD to a gate voltage V (top or bottom) is thus a weighted sum of the inverse electronic compressibilities dµ/dn of the top and bottom layers \(\frac{{\rm{d}}{\phi }_{{\rm{D}}}}{{\rm{d}}V}=\alpha \frac{{\rm{d}}{\mu }_{{\rm{T}}}}{{\rm{d}}{n}_{{\rm{T}}}}\frac{{\rm{d}}{n}_{{\rm{T}}}}{{\rm{d}}V}+(1-\alpha )\frac{{\rm{d}}{\mu }_{{\rm{B}}}}{{\rm{d}}{n}_{{\rm{B}}}}\frac{{\rm{d}}{n}_{{\rm{B}}}}{{\rm{d}}V}\), where dnT/dV and dnB/dV are capacitive factors determined by the junction electrostatics (Supplementary Information section 2). Consequently, the Coulomb diamond lines will curve in a way that reflects the Dirac-like µ(n) of both layers33,35,40,41,42,43 (Fig. 2d).

Before performing tunnelling measurements through a defect, we first establish the electrostatics of the QTM junction, which is controlled by the top gate (VTG), the bottom gate (VBG) and the bias (Vb) voltages. Figure 2e shows the tunnelling conductance, dI/dV \(\equiv \) dI/dVb, measured off-defect as a function of VTG and Vb. The two curved lines of reduced dI/dV correspond to the charge neutrality points of the top (nT = 0) and bottom (nB = 0) graphene layers, in agreement with the electrostatic model (dashed lines, Supplementary Information section 2). For |Vb| < Vth ≈ 65 mV, there is a pronounced suppression of dI/dV. Detailed measurements (Supplementary Information section 9) indicate that this suppression is device-specific and arises from a large contact resistance that persists until the threshold bias Vth, then drops sharply. Therefore, for |Vb| < Vth, the bias primarily drops across the contact rather than across the QTM junction itself and the nT, nB = 0 lines remain vertical (essentially unaffected by bias). A similar measurement done in a perpendicular magnetic field of 5 T (Fig. 2f) shows suppressed dI/dV features associated with the Landau level gaps of the top (\({\nu }_{{\rm{T}}}^{\mathrm{LL}}=\pm 2,\,\pm 6\)) and bottom (\({\nu }_{{\rm{B}}}^{\mathrm{LL}}=\pm 2\)) layers, consistent with the electrostatic model. With additional measurements as a function of VBG (Supplementary Information section 5), we fully establish how the three voltages control the carrier densities in the QTM junction.

We now measure tunnelling through a low-energy defect as a function of VTG and Vb (Fig. 2g), observing an order of magnitude higher conductance. The conductance forms a curved Coulomb diamond: along its two branches, the defect level is resonant with either the top or bottom electrode (Supplementary Information section 2), whereas outside of this region, dI/dV is strongly suppressed, corresponding to fixed quantum dot charge (labelled as N and N + 1 for generality). For |Vb| < Vth, the Coulomb blockade peak is nearly vertical, consistent with the earlier off-defect observation that the bias drops primarily on the contact in this regime. For |Vb| > Vth, the curvature of the diamond edges reflects the µ(n) of the top and bottom layers. Specifically, two deflection points (arrows) correspond to the charge neutrality points of the two layers, in which the defect potential responds more strongly to gate voltage (that is, higher slope) due to the reduced compressibility of the top or bottom layer. In a similar measurement at B = 5 T (Fig. 2h), the Coulomb diamond edges show steps reflecting the Landau level gaps. Additional calibration experiments are presented in Supplementary Information section 16.

Having shown that a defect can measure µ(n) at a single point, we now turn to imaging potentials in real space. Figure 3a shows a high-resolution map of I(x, y) measured through a single low-energy defect at Vb = –0.35 V, revealing the detailed moiré structure of the tip. To extract the electrostatic potential, we monitor how the zero-bias Coulomb peak shifts as the tip is scanned across the defect. Figure 3b shows the zero-bias dI/dV(x, VTG) measured along the white dashed line in Fig. 3a. A narrow Coulomb blockade peak is observed at each x, whose gate-voltage position \({V}_{\mathrm{TG}}^{\mathrm{peak}}(x)\) oscillates with the moiré periodicity, following \({V}_{{\rm{T}}{\rm{G}}}^{{\rm{p}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{k}}}(x)=c\cdot \phi (x)+{\rm{c}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{t}}\) (c is determined by the junction electrostatics; Supplementary Information sections 2 and 3). This scan, therefore, directly tracks the moiré electrostatic potential (Fig. 3b, right axis).

a, High-resolution current map I(x, y) at Vb = –0.35 V and T = 0.2 K, showing the shape of the contact area of the G/hBN tip and the detailed moiré structure within. b, Zero-bias dI/dV versus x and VTG, measured at filling v = 3.2 ± 1. The narrow Coulomb-blockade peak oscillates with the moiré periodicity; its gate-voltage position \({V}_{\mathrm{TG}}^{\mathrm{peak}}(x)\) is converted to the electrostatic potential at the moiré interface, ϕ(x) (right y-axis), using the junction electrostatics (Supplementary Information sections 2 and 3). This measurement cuts through the high-symmetry sites of the moiré superlattice with the highest ϕ(r) (white dashed line in a). c, Extension of b to two spatial dimensions (blue dotted region in a), showing dI/dV measured versus x, y and VTG for a few slices of constant VTG. At the lowest VTG, dI/dV is practically zero everywhere. As VTG increases, rings of conductance appear and repeat with the moiré periodicity, corresponding to equipotential lines that expand and merge with increasing VTG. From the full three-dimensional dataset (Supplementary Video 1), we extract \({V}_{\mathrm{TG}}^{\mathrm{peak}}(x,y)\) (Supplementary Information section 4) and from the junction electrostatics directly determine the moiré potential, ϕ(x, y). d, ϕ(x, y) of aligned G/hBN, measured at fillings v = 0 ± 0.15 (left), v = 1.3 ± 0.2 (centre) and v = 4 ± 1 (right). These maps are obtained by averaging over several moiré sites (uncertainties in v arise from the VTG adjustments used to meet the quantum dot resonance condition; Supplementary Information sections 4 and 13). We set ϕ = 0 at the potential minimum. The centre and right maps use defect D1 at zero bias; the left map uses defect D2 at Vb = –0.21 V. The potential exhibits an approximate C6 symmetry, changes minimally with carrier density (about 10%) and has a substantial amplitude even at zero carrier density. High-symmetry stacking sites are indicated by red, blue and grey dots. Scale bar, 50 nm (a).

We can now apply this technique to obtain a full 2D map of the moiré potential. Figure 3c shows the zero-bias dI/dV measured as a function of x and y (Fig. 3a, dotted box) and at several values of VTG. At the lowest VTG, dI/dV is practically zero at every (x, y) position. With increased VTG, conductance appears along rings, which repeat in the (x, y) plane with the moiré periodicity. These rings correspond to equipotential lines within the moiré unit cell. Further increasing VTG increases the radius of the rings until they merge and disappear. From a full three-dimensional map of dI/dV(x, y, VTG) (Supplementary Video 1), we extract \({V}_{\mathrm{TG}}^{\mathrm{peak}}(x,y)\) (Supplementary Information section 4), and from the relation above, directly determine the 2D moiré potential.

Figure 3d shows the 2D moiré potential ϕ(x, y) across a single moiré unit cell at three fillings, ν = 0 ± 0.15, 1.3 ± 0.2 and 4 ± 1 (with ν = 1 corresponding to one electron per moiré cell). Several key features emerge. First, the moiré potential amplitude is large, ranging from 52 mV to 62 mV (Supplementary Information section 18). Second, this amplitude varies only minimally (about 10%) with moiré filling. The maps also show three distinct high-symmetry points: a central maximum (red) and two minima separated by 60° (grey and blue). The difference between these minima, Δϕminima ≈ 4 mV, is a small fraction of the overall scale. This indicates that although a minor C3 component is present, consistent with the underlying symmetry of the moiré lattice, the overall symmetry is close to C6.

To interpret our observations, we consider various mechanisms that have been theoretically proposed to induce potential. Following ref. 10, the moiré Hamiltonian can be decomposed into three terms: an effective pseudoelectric potential (H0), a pseudomagnetic field (Hxy) and a local mass term (Hz), each associated with a corresponding sublattice Pauli matrix (Supplementary Information section 13). The dominant H0 term arises from two effects: (1) the spatially varying stacking potential generated by changes in the local G/hBN alignment within the moiré cell and (2) the in-plane relaxation of the graphene lattice, which stretches and compresses the C–C bonds, leading to local variations in the Dirac point energy relative to the vacuum level and captured by the deformation potential9,44.

Figure 4 shows the predicted stacking (Fig. 4a) and deformation (Fig. 4b) pseudopotential terms comprising H0, along with the pseudomagnetic field Hxy (Fig. 4c), with the three high-symmetry CB (carbon above boron), CN (carbon above nitrogen) and AA (carbon above both boron and nitrogen) stacking sites marked. Generally, a pseudoelectric potential may reflect energy changes that are not electrostatic in nature. However, theory44 and density functional theory calculations45,46 suggest that the pseudopotentials in Fig. 4a,b are directly accounted for by charge polarization perpendicular to the layers and therefore manifest as real electrostatic potentials.

a, Stacking pseudopotential due to the relative stacking of G and hBN, which varies within the moiré unit cell. The three high-symmetry points corresponding to local CB, CN and AA stacking are marked. b, Deformation pseudopotential due to atomic relaxation within the graphene layer. The terms in a and b both appear in the H0 part of the Bloch Hamiltonian, corresponding to the identity matrix in the sublattice basis. c, Magnitude of the pseudomagnetic field, which appears in the Hxy part of the Hamiltonian, corresponding to the σx and σy Pauli matrices in the sublattice basis. d–f, Self-consistent electrostatic potentials obtained after considering the screening by the graphene carriers, calculated by including a self-consistent Hartree potential response using a carrier density corresponding to v = 4. All terms show strong C3 symmetry around the moiré centre, in contrast to the C6 symmetry observed in the experiments. g, Self-consistent stacking and deformation potentials are plotted along a linecut through the moiré centre (dashed white line, bottom inset). The CB, CN and AA high-symmetry points are labelled. Visibly, each of the two terms (blue, pink) shows a strong C3 symmetry. However, owing to cancelling contributions, their sum (purple) exhibits an approximate C6 symmetry, with only a small difference between the potential minima at the CB and AA stacking sites. h, Total self-consistent potential calculated for v = 0. This potential resembles the experiment in terms of the approximate C6 symmetry, but its magnitude is half of that measured experimentally.

Graphene carriers redistribute to screen these pseudopotentials, producing the self-consistent electrostatic potential measured by our detector. We model this using self-consistent Hartree calculations (Supplementary Information section 13). The resulting screened potentials from the components in Fig. 4a–c are shown in Fig. 4d–f. Notably, screening preserves the shape of the pseudoelectric potentials but reduces their magnitude by approximately 2.2, consistent with the predicted random-phase-approximation dielectric constant ϵ = 1 + πα/2 ≈ 2.0, where \(\alpha =\frac{{e}^{2}}{4{\rm{\pi }}\kappa {{\epsilon }}_{0}\hbar {v}_{{\rm{F}}}}\) is the fine-structure constant of graphene, vF is its Fermi velocity and κ = 3.5 is the hBN dielectric constant47. Furthermore, we find that electronic screening converts the pseudomagnetic field Hxy into an electrostatic potential (Fig. 4f). This potential is small compared with the other two, scales linearly with ν, and becomes identically zero at v = 0 (same for Hz; Supplementary Information section 13). As our experiments show only a minor v dependence, we omit the Hxy and Hz terms in further discussions.

Both leading potential terms (Fig. 4d,e) exhibit a clear C3 symmetry around the central CN site, in contrast to the approximate C6 symmetry observed experimentally. However, examining the minima at the CB and AA sites shows that these C3 symmetries are inverted—for the first term ϕAA > ϕCB and for the second term ϕCB > ϕAA. The two terms compensate each other to form an almost C6-symmetric total potential with a pronounced central peak (Fig. 4g). The resulting total self-consistent potential (Fig. 4h) strongly resembles the experimental result, with one notable exception—the experimental potential scale is double the theoretical prediction. One explanation might be that theory underestimates strain in the moiré interface21. However, increasing strain alone would yield a more C3-symmetric potential, contrasting our observations. This large discrepancy demonstrates that, despite G/hBN being one of the most relevant and extensively studied moiré interfaces, there are substantial gaps in its theoretical understanding, which has direct consequences for recent experiments that use this interface to design new states of matter (for example, FQAHE in moiré pentalayer graphene).

Finally, we show the dependence of the moiré potential on the distance from the moiré interface. Extended Data Fig. 1 presents potential traces measured by two defects, located at approximately 0.8 nm (D2) and 1.5 nm (D1) from the interface (Supplementary Information section 3). The measured potential decays rapidly, even over these small distances. This significant drop suggests that if the detector were at a moiré distance (h = λm) away from the interface, it would have detected only \({{\rm{e}}}^{-\frac{4{\rm{\pi }}}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\frac{h}{{\lambda }_{{\rm{m}}}}\right)\sqrt{\frac{{{\epsilon }}_{\parallel }}{{{\epsilon }}_{\perp }}}}\) ≈ 10–4 of the potential, underscoring the importance of our atomic SET operating at extremely close standoff distances. At the same time, these measurements also demonstrate that in thin flakes, such as pentalayer graphene, electrons can still experience a significant moiré potential (tens of mV) even in the farthest graphene layer.

The atomic SET scanning probe technique demonstrated here has a combination of features that are extremely powerful for studying a wide range of quantum materials. Its QTM geometry allows it to scan within the pristine interfaces of a variety of vdW materials. Similar to existing SETs, this technique will allow quantitative measurements of thermodynamic properties such as the electronic compressibility24,25,48 and entropy49, but now with two orders of magnitude improved spatial resolution—below the Fermi wavelength, magnetic length and moiré scales of many systems. This advance extends this powerful imaging method to a much broader class of physical phenomena occurring on small scales such as Wigner crystals, topological edge states, vortex charges, symmetry-broken phases and fractionally charged quasiparticles.

Linecuts along high-symmetry points of the moiré potential, \({\phi }_{m}^{D}\), measured as a function of position, x, using two defects (D1 and D2). These defects are located at different heights from the G/hBN interface (1.5 nm and 0.8 nm, respectively) and measured at moiré fillings v = 4 ± 1 and v = 3.2 ± 1. We also plot the potential at the moiré interface (ϕ(x), dashed lines) deduced using the calibrated junction electrostatics (Supplementary Information sections 2 and 3) from the measurements with both defects. The potentials are offset along the y-axis for clarity. These measurements demonstrate that even at such small heights, the decay of the moiré potential amplitude is substantial (~60% measured decay from 0.8 nm to 1.5 nm).

One of Earth's most dangerous glaciers has claimed a victim: a suite of instruments that became trapped deep within the ice.

A team of researchers from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) was working to place instruments beneath Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier to understand how the ice was melting from below. Partway through the descent, the team faced a major setback as the instruments got lodged in the ice, ending the research project before it even began.

“Fieldwork in Antarctica always comes with risk,” Keith Makinson, BAS oceanographer and drilling engineer, said in a statement. “You have a very small window in which everything has to come together. While this outcome is deeply disappointing, the data we did recover are scientifically valuable and will help shape future efforts.”

Also known as the Doomsday Glacier, Thwaites could add up to 25 inches (65 centimeters) to global sea level rise if it were to completely collapse. That's enough to flood low-lying cities and displace millions of people.

The giant mass of ice is largely unstable, and very little is known about the warming waters that flow beneath the glacier that cause it to melt from below. The scientists and engineers behind the recent expedition set out to measure the ocean conditions beneath Thwaites Glacier's fast-moving main trunk.

To peek at what's going on underneath the glacier, the team used hot water to create holes in the ice and began lowering a suite of instruments to collect data. The borehole was approximately 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) deep and around 11 inches (30 cm) wide and needed to be continuously maintained to prevent it from refreezing.

The team temporarily deployed the instruments beneath the ice, collecting measurements that revealed turbulent ocean conditions and relatively warm waters capable of melting the glacier from below. The researchers then attempted to lower a mooring system, which was meant to remain within the ice for one to two years and transmit data through a satellite.

As the mooring system was making its way down, however, the instruments got stuck in the borehole about three-quarters of the way down. This was likely due to the water refreezing or the glacier's rapid movement.

Unfortunately, there was no time left for the researchers to repeat their efforts, as the ship returning them to New Zealand was bound to leave on February 7. Facing a tight schedule and worsening weather conditions, the team was forced to abandon the instruments trapped in the ice.

“Failure is always an option when you are pushing at the limits of scientific exploration,” Peter Davis, BAS oceanographer and member of the drilling team, said in a statement. “We know heat beneath Thwaites Glacier is driving ice loss. These observations are an important step forward, even though we are disappointed the full deployment could not be achieved.”

This was the team's second attempt to deploy a suite of instruments beneath Thwaites Glacier. In 2022, the researchers were unable to reach the site due to severe sea-ice conditions.

This time around, they succeeded in drilling through the ice and partially lowering the instruments beneath the glacier. Not only that, the team managed to gather unprecedented data about the warming waters below Thwaites Glacier.

“This is not the end,” chief scientist and professor Won Sang Lee of South Korea said in a statement. “The data show that this is exactly the right place to study, despite the challenges. What we have learned here strengthens the case for returning.”

The 12s have long been celebrated in the Pacific Northwest for their vocal support of the Seattle Seahawks. Could those fans also band together as a collective ownership force?

That's the vision of Arrived, a Seattle-based tech startup that is typically associated with helping everyday investors gain a stake in rental homes.

After a week in which reports made a sale of the Seahawks seem especially imminent, and just days before the team competes in its fourth Super Bowl, Arrived launched a new initiative to gauge fan interest in participating in the next potential ownership group. Fans can use the website, which is not affiliated with the Seahawks or NFL, to share their hypothetical investment amount and learn more.  

The company's idea is buoyed by a 2024 move by NFL owners that allows private equity funds to buy stakes in teams. Arrived would act as such a fund.

“We built our [home] platform around a $100 minimum investment and making that very accessible. We'd love to do the same with this,” Arrived co-founder and CEO Ryan Frazier told GeekWire.

Arrived would put together a special purpose investment vehicle where it would collect fan investment through its platform and then serve as a single private equity investor in the Seahawks.

Frazier pictures bringing together 100,000 or more fans to help Arrived's fund get closer to a stake of between 3% and 10% — especially considering rising franchise values and the expectation that the Seahawks could fetch as much as $8 billion.

“These teams' valuations are so high, there's so few people that can actually step up and acquire these teams,” Frazier said. “I really see this model working well where there's a lead owner and then other minority investors that can help provide a more stable capital base.”

Frazier has been aware for years of the wishes of late Seahawks owner and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen when it comes to selling the team, as has been done with other Allen assets. But reports from ESPN and The Wall Street Journal last weekend claimed that a sale could happen sooner rather than later. Allen's estate, chaired his sister Jody Allen, denied that a sale would be put in motion soon after Super Bowl LX.

“I think we definitely felt the sense of urgency this week with some of the news breaking about the imminent potential for sale,” Frazier said. “Seeing Jody Allen speaking to how she thinks about the importance of the team to the fans of the city, we felt like maybe this is something that she would be supportive of as well.”

Although a different model, the NFL's Green Bay Packers are the only major professional sports team in the U.S. owned by the community rather than a single billionaire or corporate entity. Established as a publicly held, non-profit corporation in 1923, the team is currently owned by over 538,000 shareholders who collectively hold more than 5 million shares. The shares do not pay dividends, cannot be traded for profit, and provide no equity interest.

Private equity owners that take stakes in NFL franchises aren't allowed to have voting power. NFL.com columnist Judy Battista noted in 2024 that “it is not going to be like flipping real estate.”

“We'd want the shares to be participating in appreciation alongside other shareholders,” Frazier said. “We see this as an equity stake and getting exposure to value growth.”

Three teams — the Bills, Dolphins and Chargers — have added private equity investors so far.

Frazier said it's inevitable that the model will spread as team valuations continue to grow across sports leagues and there's a greater need for minority investors. If the plan with the Seahawks doesn't pan out, he can see Arrived trying it elsewhere.

Frazier, who came to Seattle from Arkansas in 2014, and Arrived co-founder Alejandro Chouza, who came from Mexico around 2010, both moved during a surge in success and popularity for the Seahawks. Like homegrown and transplant 12s across the city and region, they've become obsessive fans, and they want to know what it feels like to have even a fraction of a stake in owning the team.

“You see these people, we bleed in and out every day for these teams, because it's so exciting,” Chouza said. “There would be nothing better, even if it's 50 bucks, if I had a tiny sliver, and my son had a tiny sliver of a team — that's priceless.”

Founded in 2019, Arrived (formerly Arrived Homes) lets people buy fractional shares of single-family rental homes and vacation rentals for as little as $100. It's pitched as an alternative way to gain exposure to real estate without taking on a full mortgage or managing a property.

The company identifies and acquires rental properties, then handles financing, renovations, property management and tenant relationships. Investors can buy shares in individual homes or pooled funds through the Arrived website. They earn quarterly dividends from rent plus a share of any appreciation when the property is sold after a multi-year holding period.

Nearly 1 million registered investors have invested more than $375 million on the Arrived platform. The company says it has distributed more than $63 million and funded more than 550 properties across 65 markets in the U.S.

Arrived raised $27 million in new funding last November and $25 million in a Series A round in 2022. The company, which employs 51, declined to share its current valuation.

The startup's leadership includes Frazier (formerly with Simply Measured and Sprout Social); Chouza, the COO (Oyo and Uber); and CTO Kenny Cason (Simply Measured).

Investors include Neo, Forerunner Ventures, Bezos Expeditions, Core, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Match Group CEO Spencer Rascoff, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi.

A data breach at government technology giant Conduent appears to affect far more people than first disclosed, with the number of victims potentially stretching to dozens of millions of people across the United States.

The January 2025 ransomware attack, which knocked out Conduent's operations for several days, is now known to affect at least 15.4 million people in Texas alone, accounting for about half of the state's population. Conduent said in October that 4 million people across the state were affected.

Another 10.5 million people are affected across Oregon, per the state's attorney general. 

Conduent has also notified hundreds of thousands of people across Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and other states, according to data breach notifications seen by TechCrunch.

The stolen data includes individuals' names, Social Security numbers, medical data and health insurance information.

One of the largest government contractors today, Conduent handles and processes large amounts of personal and sensitive information on behalf of large corporations, government departments, and several U.S. states. The company says its technology and operational support services reach more than 100 million people in the United States across various government healthcare programs.

When contacted with several questions about the data breach, Conduent spokesperson Sean Collins provided a boilerplate statement that did not address the questions, nor did they answer if Conduent knows how many individuals are affected by the cyberattack. The spokesperson would not say if the breach affects more than 100 million people.

Collins said that the company has been working to “conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information” taken in the breach, but would not say how many data breach notifications the company has sent out to date.

Little else is known about the breach, and the company has disclosed few details. Conduent disclosed the cyberattack in April, months after hackers knocked out the company's systems, which resulted in outages to government services across the United States.

The Safeway ransomware gang took credit for the breach, claiming to have stolen over 8 terabytes of data.

In a later SEC filing, the company said that the stolen data sets “contained a significant number of individuals' personal information associated with our clients' end-users,” referring to its corporate and government customers.

Conduent also said it is continuing to notify individuals whose data was stolen in the breach, and plans to conclude alerting individuals by early 2026. The company did not give a more specific timeline.

An AI lab called Fundamental emerged from stealth on Thursday, offering a new foundation model to solve an old problem: how to draw insights from the huge quantities of structured data produced by enterprises. By combining the old systems of predictive AI with more contemporary tools, the company believes it can reshape how large enterprises analyze their data.

“While LLMs have been great at working with unstructured data, like text, audio, video, and code, they don't work well with structured data like tables,” CEO Jeremy Fraenkel told TechCrunch. “With our model Nexus, we have built the best foundation model to handle that type of data.”

The idea has already drawn significant interest from investors. The company is emerging from stealth with $255 million in funding at a $1.2 billion valuation. The bulk of it comes from the recent $225 million Series A round led by Oak HC/FT, Valor Equity Partners, Battery Ventures, and Salesforce Ventures; Hetz Ventures also participated in the Series A, with angel funding from Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Brex co-founder Henrique Dubugras, and Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel.

Called a Large Tabular Model (LTM) rather than a Large Language Model (LLM), Fundamental's Nexus breaks from contemporary AI practices in a number of significant ways. The model is deterministic — that is, it will give the same answer every time it is asked a given question — and doesn't rely on the transformer architecture that defines models from most contemporary AI labs. Fundamental calls it a foundation model because it goes through the normal steps of pre-training and fine-tuning, but the result is something profoundly different from what a client would get when partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic.

Those differences are important because Fundamental is chasing a use-case where contemporary AI models often falter. Because Transformer-based AI models can only process data that's within their context window, they often have trouble reasoning over extremely large datasets — analyzing a spreadsheet with billions of rows, for instance. But that kind of enormous structured dataset is common within large enterprises, creating a significant opportunity for models that can handle the scale.

As Fraenkel sees it, that's a huge opportunity for Fundamental. Using Nexus, the company can bring contemporary techniques to Big Data analysis, offering something more powerful and flexible than the algorithms that are currently in use.

“You can now have one model across all of your use cases, so you can now expand massively the number of use cases that you tackle,” he told TechCrunch. “And on each one of those use cases, you get better performance than what you would otherwise be able to do with an army of data scientists.”

That promise has already brought in a number of high-profile contracts, including seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 clients. The company has also entered into a strategic partnership with AWS that will allow AWS users to deploy Nexus directly from existing instances.

Newsletter platform Substack has confirmed a data breach in an email to users. The company said that in October, an “unauthorized third party” accessed user data, including email addresses, phone numbers, and other unspecified “internal metadata.” 

Substack specified that more sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, passwords, and other financial information, was unaffected.

In an email sent to users, Substack chief executive Chris Best said that the company identified the issue in February that allowed someone to access its systems. Best said that the company has fixed the problem and started an investigation.

“I'm reaching out to let you know about a security incident that resulted in the email address and phone number from your Substack account being shared without your permission,” said Best in the email to users. “I'm incredibly sorry this happened. We take our responsibility to protect your data and your privacy seriously, and we came up short here.”

It's not clear what exactly the issue was with its systems, and the scope of the data that was accessed. It's also not yet known why the company took five months to detect the breach, or if the company was contacted by hackers demanding a ransom. TechCrunch asked the company for more details, and we will update our story if we hear back.

Substack did not say how many users are affected. The company said that it doesn't have any evidence that users' data is being misused, but did not say what technical means, such as logs, it has to detect evidence of abuse. However, the company asked users to take caution with emails and texts without any particular indicators or direction.

On its website, Substack says that its site has more than 50 million active subscriptions, including 5 million paid subscriptions — a milestone it reached last March. In July 2025, the company raised $100 million in Series C funding led by BOND and The Chernin Group (TCG) with participation from a16z, Klutch Sports Group CEO Rich Paul, and Skims co-founder Jens Grede.

There's a rare but persistent issue with Socket AM5 processors where, occasionally, they burn out. The name that has come up the most in discussions of this issue is ASRock, which might make you think that ASRock has had the most failures. That's not necessarily a given; the tracking of the problem started on the /r/ASRock sub-Reddit, and that's why many of the failure reports are on ASRock motherboards. Given its proximity to the problem, you might expect that ASRock would have already put out a statement about it. Well, it hadn't — until now, anyway.

In an official statement published on its website's "News" section, ASRock says it is "closely monitoring recent discussions regarding the performance and behavior of AMD Ryzen™ 9000 series processors on ASRock AMD platforms." No mention of exactly what the issues are, and no specific mention of Ryzen 9 or X3D processors, either — simply, 'we heard there's a problem, and we're looking into it.' Ten-four, ASRock. This echoes a similar statement from ASUS recently, and MSI has also released remarks on the issue.

 




In most reports, these chips normally get so hot that they leave scorch marks on the CPU and socket. Well, they don't normally fail at all, but you understand. We don't want to overstate the frequency of this issue; at the time of writing, there are around 350 reports, which sounds like a lot until you consider both that reports are not the same as verified, root-caused failures, and also the hundreds of thousands of Socket AM5 CPUs that are out there. This problem affects an infinitesimally tiny fraction of Socket AM5 users — but that doesn't make it any less frustrating, of course.

The "burnt CPUs" issue initially plagued the Ryzen 7000 series processors way back in 2023, and last year, it was frequently framed as an issue specifically affecting AMD's "X3D" gaming processors with 3D V-Cache. While the pictures of burned processors and melted CPU sockets are certainly evocative, it's not really clear that this problem is indicative of any kind of design flaw or reproducible fault in the processors or the motherboards. ASRock issued BIOS updates aimed to minimize the issue after community outrage, but some insist that the problem persists to this day.

 




Hardware YouTubers Gamers Nexus have put quite a few hours into trying to intentionally cause this kind of failure, and their efforts have largely been in vain, even when using a motherboard that was known to have already killed a processor once. Much like the situation with Intel's 13th/14th-generation CPUs, it's possible there is an element of "CPU vendor offers wide range of possible values; motherboard vendor picks the most extreme possible values" here. Who's actually at fault in that case is difficult to say, but AMD is replacing CPUs that die in this manner under its standard warranty, so it's hard to find fault there, anyway.

ASRock says it is "working in seamless coordination with AMD continuously to further validate system performance across a wide range of hardware configurations, while optimizing BIOS and enhancing overall system stability." While some users see the company silently shipping BIOS updates that modify voltage behavior and power profiles as an admission of guilt, it's just as likely that ASRock wants to minimize the amount of support requests it has to field and the number of processors AMD has to replace. Given the relatively low frequency of the faults, this one is probably better filed under "unfortunate manufacturing issues" and moved away from.

The Exorcist: Martyr has added another huge name to its cast. Chris Hemsworth discusses the surprise of Avengers: Doomsday adding an extra Chris to its cast. Plus, get a very early look at season 9 of Rick & Morty. Spoilers get!



A new report from The InSneider alleges that a return to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is a high priority for newly installed CEO and President team Josh D'Amaro and Dana Walden, with the next project purportedly combining prior plans for a Margot Robbie-led female spinoff and a mainline Pirates film to create a new film that will feature Robbie's character and the young son of Jack Sparrow.

Bloody-Disgusting reports Sophia Wilde is attached to star in Soon You Will Be Gone and Possibly Eaten, a sci-fi thriller based on the short story by Nick Antosca (Channel Zero) from director Egor Abramenko. Written for the screen by Luke Piotrowski and Ben Collins (Hellraiser 2022, The Night House), the story concerns Rob and Sabile, “a young engaged couple who head to a secluded mountain resort to take their vows and step into the new chapter of their shared lives. What was planned as a joyous wedding attended by family members takes a different turn when unexpected guests crash the ceremony.”

Deadline also has word Chiwetel Ejiofor has joined the cast of The Exorcist: Martyr in a currently undisclosed role.

Speaking with GamesRadar+, Chris Hemsworth stated it was “pretty cool” when Chris Evans' Steve Rogers unexpectedly returns on a motorbike in Avengers: Doomsday.

It was pretty cool when [Chris] Evans comes up on the motorbike, and because no one knew he was going to be in the film, and then there he is. I just thought it was cool. And he had a baby in real life and in Marvel life.

Relatedly, Mark Ruffalo addressed rumors he's been fired by Disney in a recent interview with The News Movement (despite the actor appearing in the upcoming Spider-Man: Brand New Day).

Not that I know of. People keep going, ‘Did you get fired?' I'm like, ‘Not that I know of.'

Yeah, I'll be there as long as they have me. I have a good relationship with them. You know, who knows, there might be things I'm already doing that are…I'm around. Let me just say that.

Variety reports the new Faces of Death has been acquired by IFC and Shudder.

Deadline reports filming has begun on Rule of Three, the intended first part of a new horror trilogy starring Thomasin McKenzie, Chloe East, Jimmi Simpson, Sutton Foster, Tom Everett Scott, and Bilal Hasna. Based on the novel by Sam Ripley and Psych‘s James Roday Rodriguez, the story concerns a girl trying to escape a deadly familial curse. 

According to Deadline, Alfie Allen has joined the cast of The Institute as Nolan Reeves, “an eccentric European tech billionaire and one of the Institute's financial backers with an ambitious agenda all his own.”

Alan Ritchson, Dennis Quaid, Stephan James, Jai Courtney, Esai Morales, Blake Richardson, Keiynan Lonsdale, and Daniel Webber star in the trailer for War Machine, a new sci-fi/action movie in the vein of Predator in which a training exercise for US Army Rangers “turns into a fight for survival against an unimaginable threat.”

Spoiler TV has a synopsis for “The Others,” the February 26 episode of Ghosts. Images at the link.

Sam and the ghosts face The Others, a new group of spirits from one ghost's past. Meanwhile, Trevor tries to deal with a demanding Patience, who seeks a committed relationship in the wake of their holiday hookup.

Finally, Adult Swim has released an animatic from Rick and Morty's ninth season.

As Tesla begins its sudden pivot from an EV firm to a robotics and AI company, it's building out the supply chain it will need to reach its lofty goals of affordable humanoid robots that are manufactured at a rapid pace. But the scale of its production ambitions means it will need to rely heavily on the supply of raw materials, components, and manufacturing labor from China, as SCMP reports.

Tesla has a strong standing relationship with China, with its own Shanghai production facility that employs 20,000 people. It also sources many of the batteries for its vehicles from Chinese suppliers, and uses lots of raw materials in vehicle production sourced from China. China is also a major buyer of its vehicles, with over a third of all its sales in 2025 coming from China.

But the United States and China have spent the last year erecting and tearing down trade barriers. From America's side, the economic muscle came from its access to cutting-edge graphics cards and other chips used for AI training and inference. China's strength came from its manufacturing industry and access to raw materials, often termed "rare earths."

Although both are necessary for the AI industry to flourish, the ratio is much more lopsided when it comes to robotics. The "brain" of a humanoid robot will always demand impressive processing power and benefit from advanced AI software; the robots themselves demand an awful lot of critical materials. Many of those materials are mostly found in China.

While Chinese manufacturing and supply dominance affects all industries that produce just about everything, the scale of critical materials and manufacturing know-how necessary for next-generation robotics makes companies like Tesla incredibly dependent on the country.

Robots are complicated in ways that silicon and semiconductors aren't. Where chips are intricate and minute, and need clean room fabrication and specialized design software to even conceive of how they could be made, robots are decidedly more physical. Sure, they're technically advanced, but they're also made with iron, titanium, nickel, chromium, copper, and manganese. They use actuators, motors, bearings, and lubricants.

In short, they need a lot of stuff to make them, and a lot of that stuff comes primarily from China. Although key materials like Beryllium and Boron have strong supply chains within the U.S., China dominates the global supply of critical materials like Gallium (94%!), Zinc, Neodymium, Molybdenum, Indium, and Praseodymium, to name just a few.

It's not just the raw materials under the ground that's important, though. It's the expertise to extract it, the processing facilities to make it usable, and the logistical infrastructure required to get it where it needs to go.

“With about 50 to 70 per cent of manufacturing and core component production expertise residing in China, we expect Chinese players to take on greater roles in the global humanoid robot supply chain,” said Cheng Xin, a partner at US consultancy Bain & Co. “In some core components … they accounted for at least 55 per cent of the global humanoid robot bill of materials (BOM).”

China has enormous control over the supply of almost everything Tesla needs to build its next generation of humanoid robots. That puts it in an incredibly strong position, with the ability to curtail Tesla's ambitions whenever it likes.

Unfortunately for Tesla, this has already happened. In April last year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk complained that a Chinese block on exporting "rare-earth magnets" had impacted production of the Tesla Optimus robot. He was forced to ask for a license to use them - perhaps an in-person visit would have helped.

China took all rare earth mineral resources within its borders under state ownership in the fall of 2024, so its leadership has the top-down control necessary to maintain tight controls on the supply of these kinds of critical materials well into the future. Although it has cut that supply outright to the U.S. several times during the ongoing trade negotiations with the Trump administration, it has since begun issuing limited export licenses to some companies.

The American government is aware of this chokepoint in its supply of such critical materials - many of which are also important for national security and the production of cutting-edge silicon - and is attempting to develop a new stockpile to provide a buffer against China's dominance. But even that $12 billion investment would only amount to a 60-day reserve, and its focus is on providing the necessary materials for civilian needs. In such a scenario where access to raw materials was cut off, Tesla would be forced to compete with many other firms and organizations that need those same materials.

Even beyond the risk of mercurial leadership threatening trade relations, China also has its own domestic humanoid robotics industry to consider. There are over 100 Chinese companies currently working on designs, and Chinese officials are making moves to centralize their development to accelerate progress and cut down on parallel research.

Chinese companies are already shipping consumer-grade robots, with over 13,000 deployed in 2025 alone. That's years of production ahead of the several hundred prototype Optimus models Tesla has made.

Just as BYD has overtaken Tesla in the EV space, China seems almost destined to get a huge head start in humanoid robotics over Western companies like Tesla. It already has more units in the world, its production is already higher, its access to key technologies and raw materials is better, and on tap.

Everything is close, efficient, and available. That's not something Tesla or other Western robotics firms can match.

And if China ever needed to slow down the competition, it could turn the tap off for those same supplies that are much harder to find anywhere else. Even if that didn't halt progression elsewhere, it would have a huge effect on pricing.

With Tesla hoping to get its Optimus down to $30,000 per unit in the future, the realization of that dream may be more down to China's whim than anything else.

While Spotify users face yet another price hike, book lovers have some exciting developments to look forward to that could help cushion the blow.

Spotify announced several updates for its audiobook business on Thursday, notably its expansion into physical books. Users in the U.S. and the UK will soon be able to purchase physical copies of their favorite audiobooks directly through the app, marking a significant pivot for the once digital-only platform. 

The company also introduced two features designed to make the audiobook experience smoother and more flexible, including a new tool called “Page Match” that lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook. 

Additionally, “Audiobook Recaps”—a previously iOS-only feature—is coming to Android devices in the spring. This feature provides bite-sized recaps tailored to the last section users stopped listening to.

​Spotify's decision to sell physical books through its app positions it as a competitor to major booksellers, including Amazon and Barnes & Noble. The company also recognizes that many readers still value physical books, and by offering both print and digital formats, Spotify is trying to turn itself into a one-stop shop for book lovers. 

Spotify has partnered with Bookshop.org on the new offering, an online marketplace that supports local, independent bookstores. This partnership is great news for indie booksellers, as every purchase made via Spotify will directly benefit local book communities. Spotify then earns an affiliate fee on sales. 

The ability to purchase physical books will roll out this spring and appear on audiobook pages in the app as a button labeled “Add to your bookshelf at home.” Clicking it takes users to Bookshop's website, which handles the pricing, inventory, and shipping.

To bridge the gap between formats, Spotify is also launching a feature called Page Match, which is currently available to premium subscribers and will roll out to all audiobook users by late February. The feature was initially spotted by Android Authority last month. 

Spotify's new Page Match feature lets users scan a page from a physical or e-book using their phone camera. The tool analyzes the page content and directs users to the exact spot in the audiobook. It's powered by a combination of Spotify's in-house and third-party computer vision and image scanning technologies.

When users want to switch to the audiobook, they can select the “Scan to Listen” button and click the “Scan to Read” button to return to the physical book, making it easy for users to pick up where they left off, whether they're reading at home or switching to audio while on the go.

Page Match is currently available for most English-language titles, with plans for future expansion. There are now more than 500,000 titles on the platform.

In the two years since Spotify first introduced audiobooks, the platform has experienced significant growth. The company reported in October that the number of users listening to audiobooks rose 36% over the past year, and listening hours increased 37%. Plus, more than half of Spotify's 281 million premium subscribers have engaged with an audiobook.

Spotify is expected to release its fourth-quarter earnings results February 10.

DLSS 4.5 has proven to be an impressive upgrade over DLSS 4.0 in some areas. Not only does the new model provide superior upscaling quality, but it can also outright improve the visual fidelity of 3D graphics. Building on the latter, Digital Foundry discovered that both DLSS 4.5 Presets M and L are capable of reconstructing ray-traced reflections almost perfectly (depending on the game), as long as in-game denoisers are turned off.Digital Foundry saw this behavior in Crysis 3 and Silent Hill 2, where DLSS 4.5 produced noticeably better ray-traced image quality with each game's denoiser turned off compared to with them turned on. In Crysis 3, turning off the engine's denoiser resulted in less boiling, and in Silent Hill 2, turning off the denoiser resulted in a night-and-day difference in reflection quality — to the point where there was almost no image blurring or boiling to be seen.

Boiling and image noise are problems that ray-traced effects naturally produce. Game developers use denoisers to remove these artifacts. However, one caveat with these filters is that they generally do not produce a perfect image. This is why you'll find objects or textures in ray-traced reflections looking oily or smeared. NVIDIA introduced DLSS Ray Reconstruction to help solve this problem, and Ray Reconstruction itself generally provides better image quality with AI, compared to the capabilities of traditional denoisers. This has especially been the case with DLSS 4's Ray Reconstruction transformer model, which produces noticeably superior image quality compared to the initial DLSS 3.5 version.What we are seeing with DLSS 4.5 is very unique. NVIDIA has tuned the transformer model of its DLSS upscaler so well that it alone can remove the aforementioned artifacts that ray tracing effects generate naturally. Also, DLSS 4.5 is doing this without Ray Reconstruction — since Ray Reconstruction has not yet been updated to support the newer DLSS 4.5 model.If Nvidia can fully leverage this feature and improve it, we could very well see it stop supporting Ray Reconstruction (or, rename it and bake it into the upscaler portion of DLSS instead, at a future date). This would simplify DLSS and make life potentially easier for developers to incorporate DLSS into ray tracing games, as they would not need to worry about Ray Reconstruction integration. However, this will all depend on how effective DLSS 4.5 is at denoising. Digital Foundry is the only outlet we've seen so far that's covered this behavior in-depth, and it has only covered it in just two titles. There could be issues with DLSS 4.5's denoising capabilities in other ray tracing games and/or effects that we are not aware of at this point. Also, DLSS 4.5 handles upscaling with in-game denosing turned on worse, compared to DLSS 4. This is critical since not all ray-tracing games officially allow gamers to disable a game's built-in denoiser.

Western Digital this week outlined its near-term and mid-term plans to increase hard drive capacities to around 60TB and beyond with optimizations that significantly increase HDD performance for the AI and cloud era. In addition, the company outlined its longer-term vision for hard disk drives' evolution that includes a new laser technology for heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), new platters with higher areal density, and HDD assemblies with up to 14 platters. As a result, WD will be able to offer drives beyond 140 TB in the 2030s.

 




Western Digital plans to volume produce its inaugural commercial hard drives featuring HAMR technology next year, with capacities rising from 40TB (CMR) or 44TB (SMR) in late 2026, with production ramping in 2027. These drives will use the company's proven 11-platter platform with high-density media as well as HAMR heads with edge-emitting lasers that heat iron-platinum alloy (FePt) on top of platters to its Curie temperature — the point at which its magnetic properties change — and reducing its magnetic coercivity before writing data.

These edge-emitting lasers are efficient enough to make HAMR possible, but are mechanically and optically constrained, according to Ahmed Shihab, chief product officer at Western Digital. These lasers waste part of the generated light and are physically tall. That height forces additional spacing between platters, while optical losses limit how much thermal energy can be delivered to the media — both factors directly restrict areal density scaling.

 




More importantly, edge-emitting HAMR lasers are made with low yields as they rely on mechanical cleaving, precision optical alignment, and thermal screening, which prevents wafer-level testing. As a consequence, they can only be tested as part of the final head assembly, which greatly reduces yield (something that killed RDRAM years ago, as these memory chips must be tested only as part of the module assembly).

"Everybody in the industry, us included, use what is called an edge-emitting laser," Shibab said. "It is the gray box that you see sitting on the top [see the image above]. They work really well. They are the ones powering HAMR today, but they have three challenges. The light produced sometimes is wasted, so they waste a bit of energy that could be better used elsewhere. They're quite tall, so we have to make sure the platters are some distance apart from each other. And during the hard drive manufacturing process, the yields are not as good as we'd like them to be."

To remove these limitations, Western Digital spent six years developing a patented vertical-emitting laser. Unlike conventional designs, it emits light straight down onto the magnetic media, couples more energy onto the disk, and is significantly shorter in the Z-dimension. This change enables two parallel advances: higher areal density (up from today's four terabytes per platter all the way to 10 TBs per platter) as well as a thinner head assembly that allows more disks to be packed into the same 3.5-inch drive. Furthermore, Western Digital's new vertical laser is made using a lithography process and can be tested on a wafer independently of the head, so the company also expects meaningfully higher manufacturing yields.

"By emitting more light, harnessing more of that light into the recording technology, we will increase the aerial density of the HAMR platters from four terabytes all the way to 10 terabytes by 2028 per platter," said Shihab. "This technology is not theoretical. It is actually already in the labs. We have watched it during the recording."

Alongside its new vertical laser technology, Western Digital is also working on an HDD platform capable of housing up to 14 platters, another part of the equation enabling the company to increase the capacity of its hard drives significantly over the next 10 years or so.

 




The 12-platter platform will first be used with 60TB ePMR drives in 2028. While Western Digital does not disclose how many platters the company's 60TB HAMR HDD will use, it says that its ePMR and HAMR drives will use the same platform, which suggests that HAMR products will also use generally the same design.

 "We also borrowing some of the ideas from Hammer," said the CPO of Western Digital. "So, to get to 60, we will go to 12 platters. We are packing more capacity inside the same three and a half inch, all without changing the power profile of the drive. The customers don't have to spend more energy doing what we do."

Which is perhaps why Shihab carefully frames the new vertical laser technology not as a one-time capacity boost, but as a structural reset of HAMR's scaling curve that will aggressively grow starting in 2028 and is expected to enable 100TB HDDs in 2029 ~ 2030. In fact, once the vertical laser technology reaches its apex with granular media, sometime in the 2030s, Western Digital will be able to offer drives with an up to 140 TB capacity.

"10 terabytes, 14 platters, that sounds like 140 terabytes," Shihab teased.

 




Interestingly, but Western Digital's dual-actuator Dual Pivot HDDs that promise to double both bandwidth and sequential I/O IOPS performance also enter the scene at a 60TB capacity, though the company is tight-lipped whether these hard drives use ePMR or HAMR recording technology.

 "Dual Pivot technology helps customers focus their software effort on improving more performance for AI versus having to deal with how the hard drives work," Western Digital's chief product officer said. "We will introduce this at the 60 TB mark. […] So we are starting to put High Bandwidth drive technology in our customers hands today [and] my biggest problem is finding them enough material so they can start testing. Dual Pivot technology will be in their hands in late 2027 and in 2028.

After that 140 TB milestone (which is pretty contingent), the company will have to move on to ordered granular (OG) and eventually bit patterned media (BPM), which is when HDD disks will be patterned using highly sophisticated etching, nanoimprint lithography, e-beam lithography, or even photolithography.

With BPM, hard drive technology will be dealing with very localized heating, which must be controlled with extreme accuracy. Excess energy can disturb neighboring bits, while insufficient energy prevents reliable writes, which is why somewhere along the line, HDD makers will have to invent next-generation laser designs that will combine heating performance with extreme precision.

When Valve unveiled the Steam Machine and Steam Frame in November 2025, many expected them to arrive during the first quarter of 2026, even though the company hadn't given a specific date yet. However, it seems that this is no longer the case, as Valve said on its blog that the current memory shortage is forcing it push back the planned launch schedule and look at the pricing for the living room PC console.

“When we announced these products in November, we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now. But the memory and storage shortages you've likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then,” Valve said on the Steam Hardware blog. “The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).”

Still, the company says that it plans to ship all three products — the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller — during the first half of the year. However, it also said that it is “being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change.” The current memory shortage, driven by AI data centers' massive demand for HBM, is pushing many PC makers to the edge, with both manufacturers and system integrators announcing price hikes to deal with the situation.

Furthermore, smaller industry players without deep pockets would likely have a hard time acquiring chips from the big three manufacturers, with one memory chip maker rep saying that, “relationships with memory suppliers matter in a crunch.” And while Valve's Steam Deck single-handedly revived the handheld PC gaming market, it's still a relatively niche manufacturer compared to traditional PC makers like Asus and Dell (which have already announced massive price hikes).

The company has previously said that it won't subsidize the consoles and that it's priced close to an entry-level PC. Before the chaos of the memory shortage, this meant it would've cost around $550 to $600. But with the price of DRAM and NAND skyrocketing, especially affecting RAM kits, SSDs, and discrete GPUs, we're no longer sure if this would still be possible. There have been leaks showing the Steam Machine priced at more than $1,000 for the 1TB version, but this came from a third-party retailer and not directly from Valve.

At the moment, the final price of the Steam Machine is still up in the air. However, we still expect it to land in retailers sooner rather than later. After all, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said during the company's earnings call that “from a product standpoint, Valve is on track to be shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year.” So, hopefully, we'll just have to wait a few more weeks or months before we finally know the retail price of the much-awaited PC console and it becomes available from our favorite store.

The human body is a complex machine that's been fine-tuned—through millions of years of evolution—to operate here on Earth. So what happens to that machine when you put it inside a box and fling it far beyond the safety of our planet's atmosphere?

This, in vastly oversimplified terms, is the question that biomedical researchers at NASA have been asking for decades. These scientists study the health impacts of spaceflight to develop methods that protect astronauts' bodies and minds, using ground research facilities, analog environments, and the International Space Station to conduct cutting-edge studies.

Now that NASA is finally sending humans back to the Moon, these scientists are preparing for the research opportunity of a lifetime.

The Artemis 2 mission will send NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen farther from Earth than any human has gone before. During their 10-day flight around the Moon, they will encounter high levels of space radiation and reach a maximum distance of 250,000 miles from Earth. The mission is currently on track to launch as early as the first week of March.

“I often talk about the most complicated system on this vehicle is going to be the human,” Steven Platts, chief scientist of the Human Research Program at NASA's Johnson Space Center, told Gizmodo. “We need to understand exactly what's going to happen in order to prevent anything bad from happening and keep them safe and healthy.”

If Platts and his colleagues have learned anything from their decades of research, it's that spaceflight puts a lot of strain on the human body. He explained that there are five primary health hazards associated with spaceflight: radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, gravity (or lack thereof), and hostile, confined environments.

These hazards manifest differently depending on the mission profile, Platts said. The Artemis 2 crew will spend a far shorter period of time in microgravity than astronauts on standard ISS missions, for example. Still, 10 days is long enough to trigger certain physiological changes, such as fluid shifts and vestibular disruption.

When it comes to radiation, the Artemis 2 astronauts will get a much higher daily dose than those aboard the ISS. They will travel through the Van Allen belts—two donut-shaped zones of particle radiation trapped inside Earth's magnetic field—and then enter the galactic cosmic radiation environment beyond the magnetic field.

The Orion spacecraft—which will carry the Artemis 2 astronauts on this journey—is designed to shield its crew from most of this radiation, but measuring how much breaks through and how human cells and DNA respond to it is crucial.

Galactic cosmic radiation can be particularly damaging. When looking at individual cells that have been exposed to these high-energy particles, “you can literally see the tracks that the radiation makes through the cell and the damage that it creates,” Platts said.

Orion is equipped with thousands of sensors that will measure radiation levels inside the spacecraft. Each crew member will also carry a sensor called a Crew Active Dosimeter in their pockets to closely monitor their exposure levels.

Understanding how the human body responds to the unique hazards of the deep space environment will be essential to future lunar landings and Mars missions. Artemis 2 will investigate this in several different ways.

During this mission, crew members will act as both researchers and test subjects, gathering data that will help NASA build interventions, protocols, and preventative measures to protect astronaut health. One study, called ARCHeR (Artemis Research for Crew Health and Readiness), will investigate how the deep space environment affects sleep, stress, cognition, and teamwork, all of which are key to astronaut health and performance.

Participating crew members will wear wristbands that continuously monitor their movement and sleep patterns throughout the mission. This data will support real-time health monitoring and safety assessments, while pre- and post-flight evaluations will provide insight into any cognitive, behavioral, and sleep quality changes.

The Artemis 2 astronauts will also provide wet saliva samples before and after the mission, as well as dry saliva samples during the mission. While in flight, they will blot their saliva onto a special type of paper in pocket-sized booklets, eliminating the need for a wet-sample refrigeration system on board the Orion spacecraft.

Saliva is an excellent indicator of human health, as it contains a rich mixture of biomarkers that signal immune system function. “We can see hormones, we can see viruses, we can see other chemicals in the blood… And with this technique, we can see changes in cortisol,” Platts said. Measuring how this stress hormone fluctuates over the course of the mission will be critical, as stress is linked to many of the adverse health outcomes of spaceflight, he explained.

These aren't the only biological samples NASA will collect from the Artemis 2 crew, however. They will be the first astronauts in deep space to participate in the Spaceflight Standard Measures study, which has been collecting blood, urine, and saliva samples from astronauts aboard the ISS and elsewhere since 2018. These samples help researchers evaluate astronauts' nutritional status, cardiovascular health, and immunological function.

Then there's the AVATAR, the most groundbreaking biomedical study flying aboard Artemis 2. Short for “A Virtual Astronaut Tissue Analog Response,” AVATAR involves USB-sized “organ chips” that contain living human cells cultured inside microscopic, fluid-filled channels. These chips are designed to simulate the structure, function, and physiological responses of human organs.

To make them, the Artemis 2 astronauts first donated blood platelets to a local healthcare system. The cells remaining from their samples contained a small amount of bone marrow-derived stem cells, which NASA researchers then purified and placed into the chips next to blood vessel cells and other supporting cells.

“The chip will function essentially like our bone marrow does,” Platts explained. Flying these chips on the Artemis 2 mission—alongside the astronauts who created them—will allow NASA scientists to compare changes in the chip to changes in the astronauts' actual bone marrow.

“Imagine future flights,” Platts said. “If I'm going to fly in two years, [NASA] can fly a tissue chip of me—my avatar—ahead of time and then bring it back and see what's going to happen so that they can design the countermeasures for me, for my personal use.” Artemis 2 will be the first mission to fly with this biotechnology.

Together, these studies will produce a wealth of data, helping to pave the way for NASA's return to the lunar surface and extend humanity's reach deeper into the solar system. “It's just amazing how many things we're going to be able to find out just from this one mission,” Platts said.

Update: February 5, 2026, 11:16 a.m. ET: This article has been updated to reflect the new target launch window for NASA's Artemis 2 mission, which opens on March 6.

They're also as I understand it, used to handle things like sending everyone voter IDs for elections in advance; this is how the government knows who to send the voting cards to.Bafflingly, the US does NOT have a national identification method that works like this. There's no country-wide identity document that provides the same assurances. As a result, most US entities (government branches & corporations) have settled on a "closest possible"... which is the social security number. A number that's used to identify every person with attachment to the US in some form since social security is something every US citizen has to interact with. (It also includes a ton of non-citizens since as I understand it, social security is something foreign workers also have to interact with, but that's besides the point.) It's a 9 character long numeric string that identifies you as a person... and has almost no revocation mechanism, even if it ends up in a data breach.Yet in spite of this, it's still used as a country-wide ID mechanism for a lot of different things and replacing it with a proper ID mechanism has as I understand it (not American) very poor support as it's a culture war issue.

SSA told the court that all DOGE access to personally identifiable information (PII) was revoked by March 24, 2025.That turned out to be false: a DOGE member ran PII searches the morning of March 24, stopping only around 9:30 a.m.; access was not fully cut until about noon.2) Sent SSA data to a DOGE official outside SSA.On March 3, 2025, an SSA DOGE member emailed an encrypted file believed to contain names and addresses of ~1,000 people to Steve Davis, a senior advisor to the U.S. DOGE organization (and a DOL employee).The file likely contained data derived from SSA systems of record.It is unknown whether Davis received the password or accessed it.3) Was given PII access during the TRO even though this was barred.One DOGE member was granted access to 10 PII databases from March 26 to April 2 (never used, but still improper).Another received a call-center profile that could access PII from April 9 to June 11; whether PII was viewed is unknown.4) Had broader systems access than the court was told.
SSA discovered additional access that had not been disclosed earlier, including:Systems containing SSA employee records.Systems controlling building/IT badge access.Shared workspaces that could pool sensitive data.A data-visualization tool that could reach PII.Additional data-warehouse schemas.5) Engaged in partisan election-related work inside SSA.In March 2025, a political advocacy group asked two DOGE members to analyze state voter rolls to try to overturn election results.One DOGE member signed a “Voter Data Agreement” as an SSA employee with that group on March 24, without agency approval.SSA later referred this conduct to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel for possible Hatch Act violations.6) Used an unapproved third-party server to share SSA data.From March 7–17, 2025, DOGE members used Cloudflare links to transfer data.Cloudflare is not authorized for SSA data storage; SSA still does not know what data were sent or whether it remains on that server.

Like always, the left's problem is that their proposed solutions read like they were written by teenagers, based on emotions and dismissive of the reasons why their supposed “enemies” disagree with them.Most Americans would support having ICE operate perhaps even entirely with nonlethal weapons. That would be a smart thing to push for! And popular too. But the party line is instead “Abolish ICE.” And of course nobody (who isn't pro-open-borders) trusts that there's any Democratic plan besides look-the-other-way and maybe amnesty.

1. Win elections2. Pass laws (or win the Presidency, a cheat code that has been the main way most things get done since ... 2008 or so, and is basically effective unless the "thing" is kinda unconstitutional and SCOTUS is against you. Blame RBG btw for screwing Dems on that last part)The reason why we won't get this outcome is that the Democrats stopped being serious about convincing the moderates to get onboard their platform, because they give too much of a platform to the people who just chant slogans like "No person is illegal!" Which, while I get the humanitarian point, reads to me like you'd really prefer that anyone caught here illegally should ethically just be let go, rendering the whole concept of borders, visa applications, green cards, all of that, a big joke on the people who follow the rules.

This makes a great talking point, but those immigrants eventually assimilated into the culture, and also importantly, they were specifically allowed to come because the US needed more people in order to power its economy. The Chinese came to build the railroad, the Irish and Italians and Germans came over and worked in factories and as police and many other industries. This was badly needed 100 years ago.Today most illegal immigrants are uneducated and are either working in the unofficial economy or in service-sector jobs, which depresses wages for everyone with low education. We don't need every restaurant to have an unending stream of desperately poor would-be busboys and dishwashers, or for Uber to have a stream of poor drivers. Or for rich people to have an ample supply of housekeepers paid in cash. All that does is keep wages in the toilet for working people.But about open borders, why are so many Latin American countries such bad places to live that so many of their people want to come to the US? Open borders just means anyone can walk right in and bring all of their problems with them, not to mention their drug and human trafficking operations and the criminal gangs that operate them. We already have enough of that as it is.No Western country can stay civilized with open borders. Anyone with half a brain can see how it is going in the UK and France, where they are only a bit more "open borders" than the US has been. Thankfully for Americans, Latin-American culture is more compatible with Western culture than Islamic culture is.

This is completely orthogonal to the conversation, but I think you misunderstood that slogan. It does not mean “immigration rules must not be enforced”.It means differentiating between a potentially illegal action (illegal entry/overstaying) and the person itself. You never talk about an illegal driver, or an illegal drinker, but people talk about illegal immigrants, with the implication that the person itself is illegal.It's subtle but it's a step towards dehumanizing a person, or making infractions to their rights “count less” in the public eye.

Worse than that, we more and more often just see the term "illegals" being used, which completely removes the person from the description.

It only matters what we call them, if you want to keep them here forever. I think the present-day recommended term is probably just "immigrant" right? So basically we should call them the same thing we call the people who waited years for their turn and proved that they had a positive contribution to make to our society.

Given the present tide of things, however, I think there's no amount of course-correction back toward the left that would prove excessive. My opinion on this will change as soon as the tide does, and e.g. a leftist president endorses indiscriminate murder of ICE agents, or something equally egregious to what we're seeing in the opposite direction.In a more ideological sense, though, I tend to despise the left/right continuum and think it is unhelpful for analysis.

Comparing the rhetoric today, this might never happen. There are qualitative differences between both political geoups, so grouping them together as a single horseshoe is 'unhelpful for analysis'.That said, you cant fully rule out leftist led atrocities aswell and maybe thats the reason why the right is escalating in violent rhetoric, they want this as a self fullfilling prophecy to justify more violence.When Kirk was shot, all the "this needs to stop" commentary, as if it was an organized mass phenomenon, was sending shivers down my spine.

Is it? I'm not aware of legislation introduced by the democrats, either when they were in power or today, that proposed anything resembling this. There are individual congresspeople calling for ICE to be abolished (which is not the same as having no immigration enforcement) but leadership within the democrats is very clear that they support extremely minor reforms like making ICE agents wear masks less frequently. This is considerably more minor than disarming ICE agents, which you claim would have nationwide support.

reply

If I want what I believe is a reasonable policy and the enforcers of that policy start doing the worst job ever, it is my duty to call them out, not to call out the opposing side for mostly imaginary reasons.Abolish ICE is not a unreasonable take. If the agents working in this agency have become some ultra politicized paramilitary, it makes sense to abolish it and create a new agency altogether.

It was aggressive, it was inhumane, and immigrants were killed despite a massive effort by people from "the left" to feed and clothe people who were detained in open fields or between two border fences without any care being provided by the US agencies detaining them.Maybe you are right that nobody who is right-leaning trusts that the US democratic party isn't pro border enforcement and anti immigration, but that's based purely on lies and propaganda.

It's using immigration as a pretext to build an unaccountable group of thugs that disappear people into camps, murder political opponents and surveil the populace (as seen in OP). It's recruiting primarily from far-right militias, regularizing them into a paramilitary force of the regime.There is no justifiable reason to have them terrorize an entire city like they have been doing in Minneapolis.The brownshirts needed to be abolished in the 1920s, a pinky-swear they wouldn't do the thing they were designed to do wouldn't have been enough.The same applies to their modern equivalent.

If the goal is to decrease money going into advertisement budgets, then the best thing you can do is buy store brand when possible.  Even if both products are ultimately made from Nestle corp, the cheaper store brand will send less money into Nestle's pockets which means less money for advertising.That's what I mean by "avoiding nationally branded products".  A package of "signature frozen peas" will taste just as good as the "birds eye green peas" without sending money to a major company (Looks like all the major companies have spun off their frozen food departments, but at one time this was a Nestle brand.  I spent too much time looking into major frozen food brands :D).The advertisement budgets for the grocers are simply a lot smaller than that of the national brands across the board.  It also doesn't seem (to me at least) to have been really spent on invasive advertisements.

No one becomes a cop because they want to be nice and help vulnerable people. Some might say they did but that is some coping technique. Being a cop involves exerting violence towards people who are vulnerable and desperate, and to become one you have to be fine with this. Some would say that this alone is enough to deem a person ethically dubious.Even if one would accept the premise that society requires some degree of organised violence towards its members, one would also have to handle the question of accountability. Reasonably this violence should be accountable in relation to the victims of it, and police institutions inherently are not.I think that we should also note that the other person above used "childishly" to denote something negative, apparently they don't think of kids as the light of the world and childish as something fun and inspiring.

I would argue that whatever is happening now is part of the revenge of the nerds once the nerds remain unsatisfied despite the material possessions they acquired as software ate the world.People deeply disconnected from the real world, seeing numbers and thinking with numbers without understanding the underlying realities of those numbers is a trait of any low touch system that developers and other IT professionals operate within.Just yesterday apparently when asked Trump said "it's just two people" that were executed by ICE and steered the conversation when he was pushed to elaborate.Probably from tech perspective ICE is incredibly well working, in tech world you can take away the livelihood of thousands of people by a single line of a code that changes an algorithm that bans someone or re-sorts the search results. Someone loses their Youtube account they built for years due to algorithm misfiring, someone loses their developer account on an App Store and can't even get a reason for it.The tech world is very used to operate in a fascist high efficiency environment that enshittifies everything that touches but keeps improving on some selected KPI. Maybe they wish it doesn't happen but they are not going to sacrifice higher numbers for the lives of a few people. Welcome to the highly efficient(according to selected KPI) new world order.I know you don't like to hear that as this is a place for IT people but the governance of online platforms is quite fascist across the board. People are banned, shadow banned or rate limited when don't behave or don't say the right stuff. Preserving order and increasing engagement is above everything, even those who claim that they came to make "speech free again" quickly turned into just changing what speech to be allowed.Anything controversial that is attracting negativity is hidden away unless it is feeding the narrative of the platform, then it is actively promoted.Therefore, I don't think that IT workers have any remorse or any problem with this new reality. Its the reality they built and most are loving it.The medium is the message but the medium was built bit by bit by IT professionals in a span of 20 years.

Its main mode of operation is fish-net-style catching brown people on the streets and making them sign voluntary deportation. That allows to bypass any court orders and any requirements of the law (like hearing, lawyer, etc).Edit: to the commenter below:>I care because my children are approaching the workforce and I want their opportunities to open up to themdo you really want your children to work in strawberry fields in CA in 100+ degrees weather?

The recent tragedies are indeed thoroughly depressing for all of us, but we shouldn't let our emotional reactions destroy our ability to reason and think objectively about history and statistics. We can feel and think. Some of us believe enforcement of laws is the villain in this. Some feel the laws themselves or the idea of borders and sovereignty are to blame. Others that a surge of violent criminals such as those who killed Jocylan Nungary or Laken Riley is the cause of the recent tragedies. None of these views are inherently evil. All of these views have some merit. Truth is manifold. Don't be narrow minded, we need broad thinking not simplistic pathos driven dogmas and references to nazis. Grow up.

This dualist thinking seems to be a particular US thing, based on your two party system.I see the erosion of the rule of law and decency in the US, the persecution of minorities, the populism, the defamation of journalism as "lügenpresse" and alignment of media to the party line, the personal police force (what the fuck is ICE doing in Italy), the person cult around a single madman, the violence without consequence, the fancy SS/SA style cosplay uniform by the head of ICE, and I think "that looks a lot like the stuff we learned about in school".

Another way of phrasing this is that it's a call to stop assuming good faith discussion on the part of the boosters, stop being derailed by pondering nuance, and focus on putting the brakes on the new Nazi movement. History doesn't repeat but we're teetering on the edge of a large-scale horrific rhyme. Regardless of one's preferred policies regarding immigration, there is zero justification for where we're at.

For example, we all stood by when we let Twitter and other US-based social media become the main way politicians communicate with the public.

However, I think a lot of people in tech could and did see those consequences coming and were pretty vocal about it. So, I don't think we all did stand by, we exercised what limited power we had. I don't want to seem accusatory here and I don't mean it harshly, but maybe you just didn't see the folks who have talked about problems like this.We also as individuals [without billions] have fairly limited capacity to directly act against these things. I donate a fair bit to the EFF for instance and I've sent outreach to representatives multiple times over the years for specific bills and when its possible I vote against surveillance.

I don't necessarily mean to berate the public, but rather the politicians, who saw that they could use social media/big tech for their own personal gain, and the media, who went along with the narrative that putting all our public communication into privately owned platforms was good for democracy. And maybe our own governments and institutions (speaking from a EU perspective) for dropping the ball in protecting us.I think Evgeny Morozov's 2010-ish writing was prophetic in this regard.

There are also articles from 2011 where political commenters noted how the Obama campaign broke new ground using targeted Facebook advertisement and outreach, and how EU politicians could learn from it. The many smaller, but in total larger donations given to Obama was contrasted with Hillary Clinton who had larger individual donations but less in total, and the commenters attributed this to the use of Facebook and finding and meeting a younger audience on those online platforms.People thought that targeted advertisement was a good thing and politicians looked on the techniques from that election and saw the potential for power. It was mostly just those privacy advocates, free software advocates and security experts that expressed doubt and warned about the dangers.

While trying to degoogling, removing most proprietary software and use sandboxing for everything that's still needed as proprietary, you would often hear that stupid pro-surveillance thesis: "oh, what's wrong in someone trying to show you relevant things in the internet to buy by your interests?".Maybe now some people would think about it. That giving someone's leverage over youself is a ticking bomb until the actually scary people will use it as an advantage. That's humanity 101.Same about non-encrypted emails, cloud AI providers, SMS/real-identity based auth and 2fa, telemetry. The industry is full of trash and has to be revived from VC garbage.

Stuff like actively expressing opposition to taking them on as a customer, trying to persuade management to do otherwise, and so on would all be perfectly kosher. But the stuff the top post in this thread alludes to, let alone what it links to, is how you end up in prison for a very long time after the 'I didn't know it was illegal' defense fails.

There has been a few news articles (and court cases) where this question has been raised and it is not strict true. Employee actions are only actions for which the employee has been given as an task as part of their employment and role. Actions outside of that is private actions. When this end up in court, the role description and employee contract becomes very important.A clear case example is when a doctor is looking up data on a patient. Downloading patient records from people who they are not the doctor for can be criminal and not just a breech of hospital policy, especially if they sell or transfer the data.

Google's AI assistant Gemini App now has more than 750 million monthly active users, CEO Sundar Pichai said at parent company Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call.

That's roughly 100 million more users than the 650 million monthly active users the company reported in its third-quarter earnings report. That report was released just three weeks before the company's Gemini 3 debut upended the AI world.

“We are also seeing significantly higher engagement per user, especially since the launch of Gemini 3,” Pichai said. “[Gemini 3] has seen the fastest adoption of any model in our history.”

Google's AI story experienced a major turnaround in mid-November thanks to Gemini 3, the company's latest AI model. AI enthusiasts praised the capabilities of the model far and wide on social media, with even some long-time ChatGPT fanboys like Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff admitting to converting to Gemini. AI benchmarking firm LMArena's cofounder Wei-Lin Chiang even called the release “more than a leaderboard shuffle.”

Gemini 3 was so well-received that only a couple of weeks later, OpenAI leadership declared “code red” at the company. Even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose company has significant business with OpenAI, reportedly raised worries over the competition Google now poses to OpenAI's market dominance.

Despite the huge jump in users for Gemini, there might still be a long way to go until it can suprpass ChatGPT to become the chatbot leader. OpenAI doesn't report regular data on ChatGPT active users, but a The Information report from December claimed that ChatGPT was nearing 900 million users weekly at the time.

Either way, Google's catch-up effort is impressive. With high-profile launches like Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro, Google has been able to save its once-battered AI reputation following the failed launch of Gemini image generation in early 2024.

“I think we are in a very, very relentless innovation cadence, and I think we are confident about maintaining that momentum as we go through '26,” Pichai said in the earnings call. Executives shared that they are planning to double capital expenditures in 2026, with the majority going towards AI.

Google has big plans for Gemini this year. Apple recently tapped Gemini to power its AI revamp of Siri that is set to launch later this year, and Samsung announced last month that it was planning to double the amount of its Gemini-infused mobile devices. The company is also preparing to make Gemini more “shoppable” with checkout experiences infused directly into the app.

You might also want to start preparing to have your Gemini chats plagued by ads, but that might still be further on the horizon.

“Ads have always been part of scaling products to reach billions of people,” Google's chief business officer Philipp Schindler said. “But as we've said, we're not rushing anything here.”

Elon Musk has spent recent days on his social media site X trying to explain why he exchanged so many emails with Jeffrey Epstein. The billionaire Tesla CEO insists that Epstein was the one pursuing him. But the more Musk explains, and the more emails are surfaced from the gigantic cache of so-called Epstein files, the stranger his defense seems to get.

Musk has denied any wrongdoing and says he never went to Epstein's private island in the Caribbean, known as Little St. James. And while there doesn't seem to be any concrete evidence that Musk went to the island, it's pretty clear from the emails that Musk was itching to party with Epstein. Musk was engaged in long back and forth chats in 2012, 2013, and 2014 about a visit to the island.

A series of emails from Dec. 2012 that talks about a “ratio” at Epstein's parties is particularly concerning, if only because it's not entirely clear what he means. Musk talked about bringing his then-wife Talulah Riley, the British actress who he was married to from  2010-2012 and then again from 2013-2016.

Epstein: you are welcome to stay or just come for the day, plenty of rroom i will=send heli to get you

Musk: Do you have any parties planned? I've been working to the edge of sanity th=s year and so, once my kids head home after Christmas, I really want to hi= the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose. The invitation is=much appreciated, but a peaceful island experience is the opposite of what=l'm looking for.

Epstein: Understood, , I will see you on st Barth, the ratio on my island might m=ke Talilah uncomfortable

Musk: Ratio is not a problem for Talulah

In other emails from Nov. 2012, Musk asks “What day/night will be the wildest party on =our island?”

Ever since the new Epstein files were released on Jan. 30, roughly 3.5 million pages in total, Musk has also been going back and forth with LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman online, each man accusing the other of being more implicated by the files.

“The big difference between you and me, Reid, is that you went and I did not. In fact, you went multiple times. First time was maybe a mistake, but not the second time you went,” Musk wrote.

“And, as the email shows, I obviously didn't anticipate anything actually shady, as I was bringing my wife at the time (Talulah). Nonetheless, UNLIKE YOU, I came to my senses and declined to go. Epstein tried to get me to go to his island so many times that eventually I just blocked him,” Musk continued in another tweet.

The phrasing here is curious, obviously. What does Musk mean that he came to his senses?

Does it imply that Musk always knew Epstein was engaged in child sex trafficking, wanted to party with him, and then decided against it? Or does it mean that Musk only learned in the process of emailing back and forth in 2012, 2013, and 2014 that Epstein was a predator, which then changed Musk's mind about hanging out with him?

So many things that Musk says can be confusing, largely because he's not a reliable narrator of his own actions. The billionaire previously wrote in Sept. 2025 that he “refused” to go to Epstein's island, though the emails we now have don't suggest that at all. What the publicly available emails show is that Musk and Epstein were communicating about hanging out.

Even if you don't count a potential visit to the island, there were other communications between the men about other meet-ups, including one from February 2013 that refers to a “facility,” where Epstein says he'll bring four “assistants.”

Again, Musk denies any wrongdoing. But it seems like every time he decides to chime in on the controversy, things get a little more weird. And it's not just about Epstein. Early Wednesday morning, Musk responded to a tweet from a user called @PubWanghaf.

“It breaks my heart to say but in order to save this country we are probably going to have to do things that make women sad :(” the X user wrote.

Musk responded with “true words,” without elaborating.

I, too, teach a lot in my position and mentor ~half-dozen younger people at a time. I do not work for a "cutthroat culture" company, thankfully! All of my protégés have moved from Production Support roles into SRE roles in the past 3 years.My 36 years of experience allows me to see things someone with far less will not, or cannot yet see. My XP is valued.I hold monthly SRE Learning sessions where I demonstrate SRE-centric solutions using Python and other tooling. I teach brand new developers what it is to be on a development team and how to function more efficiently on a day-to-day basis. I also got invited to sit in on our company's AI Dev Assist working group after they saw the prompts I was writing and using to implement new and maintain existing systems.I must also mention that, early on, I won a company trivia contest at my company that included 1,400 participants, and 15 questions where speed mattered. After that, I got a lot of respect from the younger crowd. ;)If you are practicing ageism in your hiring practices, then maybe you are interviewing the wrong older persons.We mature (<-key word!) folks have a lot to offer back - you just need to be capable of seeing that in the one you are interviewing. Beware the Grousing Grey Beards!

In 2022, I interviewed with a company... in crypto.I was the oldest in the company by a decade at least. They kept telling me they wanted experience. I have plenty, of experience. I was cautiously optimistic.They eventually failed me on a test of reactJS. The funniest part was when I asked for feedback, the reason they gave me, were showing poor engineering technique on their end; a lack of understanding of what makes it down the wire.So they wanted experience, but not the experience that prevents them from making mistakes of their own; not an experience that threatened their views. I realised this later. Young rock-star developers want experienced people around them, maybe, but they want to be free to reinvent the wheel on a whim.Now when I interview some place and I eerily feel old, I just bow out respectfully. No point wasting everyone's time.

I was especially annoyed by recruiters that couldn't do math. They loved all my experience, but ghosted me, as soon as they realized it came with gray hair. I guess the place is crawling with 35-year-olds with 30 years of experience.As it turned out, I ended up giving up, and just retiring. I had the means, but wanted to keep working for at least another decade. I really enjoyed adding value. I was especially interested in helping small companies get on their feet, as my particular skillset would have been almost ideal for that, and my “nest egg” gave me a pretty good risk tolerance, along with a willingness to take a lower base.Turns out that these were the exact companies that didn't want me, though.Also turned out that I really loved being retired. I have been doing more work in the last eight years, than in a couple of decades previously. I just don't get paid for it, and I'm fine with that. In fact, I actively resist pursuing a paycheck, as I don't want to deal with knuckleheads, anymore.I just had to have my hand forced. I would not have voluntarily done this.

Having experience usually means that you've acquired a holistic view of software development.  Usually the hard way.
But they want solutions, not advice or opinions.I've met a few devs that makes a living like that. Get in, solve problems. Keep quiet. Get out. Wait for them to call back in a couple of years.

Ironically, the only people who have social permission to do that are extremely expensive Big Name outside consultants. Who will then do one of two things: either speak to the staff, collate what they have to say, and launder it back to the boss; or produce a thinly veiled adaptation of whatever business book the CEO last read in an airport.

Usually those kind of companies won't hire old employees, while at the same time will gladly pay for consulting knowledge to solve their problems.Also while product companies tend to hire folks that the very last thing they worked on checks all bullet points on the HR job ad, agencies will gladly throw people at a problem regardless of the skills list, as long as the team learns to swimm fast enough.

I did a few years at a company which was "product development consultancy", and this aspect of it was really enjoyable. We got a set of diverse challenges through the door, often "virtual startups" (CEO hiring consultants rather than staff in order to do v1 of a product). The company was basically a single room, and we had two senior guys (the founders) to review work and support us. Plus one "smartest guy in the room" who served as mathematician fire-support for things like signal processing or the rare actual DS&A problem.

Also the bit about companies with more older workers performing better, and the bit about older people often losing jobs due to layoffs, sound like they could also fit together as high firm performance permitting long tenure rather than having to show only that experienced employees cause higher firm performance (although of course the examples demonstrate the latter via other means, so it can't be that it doesn't happen at all).

Nevermind that work has become significantly more precarious, the cost of living higher, the wages lower.Ageism is just a dick move in general.  It's gotten to the point where job candidates in their 30s and early 40s are dropping work history and education to appear as if they're in their 20s to potential employers - and even considering plastic surgery[1].

It's also self-defeating. Yes, there are greybeards who are stuck in their ways and refuse to learn anything new. But more often than not, the greybeards are super good team members in ways that the younger employees can't hope to compete with, because all that experience has taught them a ton about what works and what doesn't. But rather than trying to harness that valuable knowledge, companies shoot themselves in the foot by ignoring it. It's ridiculous.

I think the idea of making physical workplaces better accessible for older people also benefits the young as well. So many companies just assume “oh hey our factory workers/laborers are strong dudes they can handle XYZ repetitive task no problem.”But really, you're just making everyone less productive.I also think that companies underestimate the quality loss they get when they refuse to cultivate an environment that employees who have the wisdom of older age and perhaps more options to go elsewhere will tolerate.9/9/6 burnout shops chase away families with kids and older employees who know the value of time and bias themselves toward inexperience, working harder not smarter, and a general lack of diversity in life experience.

For example, I spent the better half of a Sunday making my Nespresso machine easier to use. I moved the pods from a zipped bag in a drawer to a 3D-printed holder on the side of the cabinet. I made a similar holder for some disposable coffee cups. Unsurprisingly, now I finally use the machine I paid good money for. Yet, my family recoiled. “You're so lazy you can't just open the drawer?”, and other similar sentiments were repeated.Life is about friction and incentives. Make the good things easier to do (put vegetables in nice containers in an easy-to-see part of the fridge) and the bad things harder to do (charge your phone in another room to avoid using it in bed).This is all to say, however much willpower you think you have in a day, you have less than that. And you should spend your time building a life where the tired, exhausted version of you can do great things. The same applies to businesses. Design a business effectively, and lazy/tired/stressed employees will still be able to contribute.

I started using Typst instead of Pandoc Markdown->LaTeX->PDF recently. I had a reluctance to change because I didn't really see the point, it looked like Markdown, and who cares if Typst compiles faster, how much time is really spent compiling? I had a watch script set up to start recompiling on a change and it worked well enough.But eventually I decided to give it a try, and it sort of changed my entire perspective.

Then, the tribal knowledge they had at their previous place of employment won't be as useful somewhere else.

You can teach things to an unexperienced person, but you cannot unteach an experienced person. What experience an older person has greatly varies, and this experience could be very useful or useless, depending on what the person has done in life.Unfortunately there is one experience/wisdom which almost all people learn with age, and that is being a knave. Just as our bodies and our minds generally deteriorate with age, so does the soul and the moral fibre - unfortunately. People seem to think that they have to fight the younger generations with deceit and manipulation. And employers aren't too keen to deal with such persons.But things might also be changing. The people aging right now are of a higher quality than the current generation of old.Also, many times your best employees will be old people. But they're harder to find.

A large cross-sectional study in the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior (JNEB), published by Elsevier, examined how psychosocial and environmental factors relate to diet quality among 2,420 adults living in rural and micropolitan communities in New York and Texas. Findings demonstrated that psychosocial factors, including healthy eating motivation, confidence in maintaining healthy eating habits, and social support from family and friends, were consistently associated with better diet quality.

Researchers also evaluated participants' perceptions of their local food environment, alongside measures of diet quality, fruit and vegetable intake, fiber intake, and ultraprocessed food consumption.

Participants with higher scores in these areas consumed more fruits, vegetables, and fiber, and fewer ultraprocessed foods. The availability of fresh fruits and vegetables in the community and the importance participants placed on food quality, price, and selection when choosing where to shop were also linked to healthier dietary intake.

On average, participants reported eating 2.6 cups of fruits and vegetables per day and 15 grams of fiber daily. These numbers are similar to national averages, but still below recommended intake levels. Nearly 40% of participants reported experiencing household food insecurity, and roughly half lived in households earning less than $50,000 per year.

These results reinforce the need for multifaceted approaches to improving nutrition. Rural adults face elevated risks for diet-related health conditions, yet nutrition behaviors in these communities are shaped by more than just access to food. Our findings highlight that motivation, confidence, and support for healthy eating — along with the local food environment — all play meaningful roles in shaping diet quality."

Rebecca Seguin-Fowler, PhD, RDN, LD, CSCS, Lead Author, Associate Director, Institute for Advancing Health Through Agriculture, Texas A&M AgriLife Research, and Professor of Nutrition, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Texas A&M University

These findings emphasize the importance of nuanced approaches to improving nutrition in different rural communities. The authors call for future studies to evaluate how changes in psychosocial and environmental factors over time may influence dietary behavior across diverse populations.

PC-based audiometry has seen significant advancements in recent years. It offers improved features, increased user support, and an increasing capacity to integrate seamlessly into clinical practice. PC-based audiometry also stores data rapidly and easily, helping to prepare for further stages of a subject's rehabilitation.

Despite these many benefits, many operators still rely on hardware-based audiometers to perform audiometry. Non-PC-based audiometers are familiar to many professionals and offer a rapid testing solution; however, these instruments do not integrate into current EMR systems, slowing down the process by adding further steps to the workflow.

Using software and hardware allows hearing health experts and clinicians to access better, more flexible, and more cost-effective solutions. This results in a more connected, efficient, and streamlined clinical workflow.

The transition to PC-based audiometry is straightforward, offering a number of key advantages.

Conventional audiometry leverages manually controlled devices and often requires significant time-consuming paperwork. PC-based audiometers streamline these tasks via the upfront preparation and automation of a range of behaviors before prompting the next steps.

Hearing health professionals can focus less of their attention on the technology and more on the subject. PC-based software can also automatically change test frequencies and intensities, saving setup time and maintaining consistent test conditions.

Traditional audiometers typically have high upfront costs, particularly in the case of models designed for bone conduction testing or speech audiometry that boast many features or special abilities.

Users can update PC-based systems more easily and with reduced financial outlay versus hardware-based systems. It is often possible to perform software updates, troubleshooting, and repairs rapidly and remotely, including the addition of new features.

PC-based audiometers generally feature user-friendly interfaces, including simple menus, touch screens, and clear instructions. This user-friendliness allows occupational health professionals and audiologists to learn how to operate the system with minimal training, as well as allowing them to explain test results to the patient in an easy-to-understand manner.

The introduction of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) guidelines has seen increased regulations in the areas of data collection and storage, along with an increased emphasis on digitizing this data.

While a historic focus has been on physical reports and record files, these hardcopy data formats were not easy to access across larger systems. The advent of cloud storage and remote data locations for servers now offers a range of advantages:

Each patient has individual needs, and PC-based systems can better accommodate personal preferences by making the overall workflow more tailored to specific patient requirements. For instance, an audiologist working with a child may alter a tests' loudness, pitch, duration or use more detailed tests when working with older patients.

It is also possible to apply test protocols and parameters across wide computer system installations, ensuring that all users in an organization perform tests in the same way.

Conventional audiometric testing typically requires that the operator interpret results during the testing process, potentially introducing inconsistency or bias. Many PC-based audiometric systems have built-in tools, however, allowing hearing data to be analyzed and presented in various formats.

PC-based audiometers enable rapid visualization of relevant audiometry and tympanometry data in graphical form, minimizing human bias in interpreting thresholds and allowing more objective findings.

PC-based audiometers also enable simpler communication of the results to subjects and healthcare providers, and the digital storage of test data allows audiologists to more easily track changes in a patient's hearing over time.

Long-term data is highly beneficial when looking to track hearing loss, as well evaluating the success of treatments like surgeries or hearing aids.

PC-based systems also tend to facilitate the generation of customized reports, reducing administrative workload by allowing the easy printing, emailing, or uploading of these reports to the subject's digital health record.

The integration of PC-based audiometers with office management systems and EMR (Electronic Medical Records) helps to streamline data management by reducing the manual entry requirements and the risk of potential errors.

Seamless connectivity via PC-based systems allows instant access to patient data, allowing timely and informed decision-making. Ultimately, this integration is key to facilitating a bespoke, task-focused end-to-end workflow.

The benefits of PC-based audiometers reflect a more general trend toward the integration of advanced technology into audiometric practices, with the goal of enhancing accuracy, efficiency, and patient care.

Global cholera vaccine supply has now increased to a level sufficient to allow the resumption of life-saving preventive campaigns for the first time in over three years, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF, and the World Health Organization (WHO) announced today.

Mozambique is the first country to restart preventive vaccination, following the halt in 2022 caused by the global surge in cholera cases that drove up demand and led to shortages of oral cholera vaccine (OCV) stocks.

The preventive vaccination campaign begins amid an ongoing cholera outbreak and the aftermath of floods that affected more than 700 000 people and displaced many. The floods disrupted health systems and damaged water systems, further increasing the risk of waterborne diseases such as cholera.

Global vaccine shortages forced us into a cycle of reacting to cholera outbreaks instead of preventing them. We are now in a stronger position to break that cycle. I thank EUBiologics, currently the only manufacturer producing cholera vaccines at the scale needed for mass vaccination campaigns, for its efforts, and urge others to enter this vital space. These vaccines will save lives."

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General

A first allocation of 20 million doses is being deployed for preventive campaigns. Of these, 3.6 million doses were delivered to Mozambique; 6.1 million to the Democratic Republic of the Congo that is also experiencing significant outbreaks; and 10.3 million doses are planned for delivery to Bangladesh.

Following sustained efforts by global agencies, manufacturers and partners, annual global supply of OCV has doubled from 35 million doses in 2022 to nearly 70 million doses in 2025. The doses are being financed by Gavi, and procured and delivered to countries by UNICEF.

"The multi-year surge in cholera cases and resulting unprecedented demand for vaccines were stark reminders that sustainable, accessible vaccine supply is a global public good – and the world cannot afford complacency," said Dr Sania Nishtar, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. "We are grateful to our partners and manufacturers, particularly EUBiologics, for the collaboration that has made the resumption of these essential preventive campaigns possible, and to Gavi's donors, whose support enables us to finance the global OCV stockpile and life-saving outbreak and preventive campaigns."

"For the first time in years, this increase in vaccines will allow us to better prevent large-scale cholera emergencies," said Catherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director. "Resuming preventive cholera vaccination will protect children and help stop this highly contagious disease in its tracks. But it must go hand in hand with other efforts, including better access to safe water and basic sanitation."

The three countries were chosen based on allocation criteria set out by the Global Task Force for Cholera Control (GTFCC), a partnership of over 50 organizations, to ensure cholera vaccines for preventive campaigns are distributed systematically, equitably and transparently.

"This milestone shows the power of bringing together diverse partners to build a more reliable response to cholera. Preventive vaccination helps shield communities and buys critical time. However, lasting progress will depend on long‑term investment in infrastructure, for which political commitment is indispensable," said Dr Ilesh Jani, chair of the Steering Committee of the GTFCC.

The restoration of preventive vaccination has been made possible by years of sustained efforts and close collaboration among agencies, manufacturers, and other partners to meet the continued high demand to respond to outbreaks, expand production capacity and streamline allocation, ensuring that limited supplies reach the places where the risk and public health impact are greatest.

The OCV is safe and effective and is recommended for individuals over 1 year of age. One dose of OCV provides short-term protection for at least 6 months and can help bring outbreaks under control, while two doses provide protection against infection for longer - 3 years.

While global vaccine supply steadily improves, the one-dose strategy will remain the standard for outbreak responses, with the use of two doses considered on a case-by-case basis.

Cholera spreads through contaminated food and water, causing severe diarrhoea and dehydration. It can lead to death if it is not treated quickly. It is found in places without safe water and sanitation, mainly in localities affected by conflict and poverty.

More than 600 000 cases of cholera or acute watery diarrhoea and nearly 7600 deaths were reported to WHO from 33 countries last year, although these are underestimates as cholera remains underreported. Since 2021, global cholera cases have risen year after year, with a decline observed in 2025. Cholera deaths, however, have continued to increase over the same period.

Vaccination is only one aspect of cholera prevention and response. Long-term investments in safe water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure, alongside disease surveillance, rapid treatment and community engagement, remain essential to prevent outbreaks from starting and spreading, and to reduce deaths in the long term.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is eyeing a presidential bid, has incensed both Democrats and Republicans over immigrant health care in his home state, underscoring the delicate political path ahead.

For a second year, the Democrat has asked state lawmakers to roll back coverage for some immigrants in the face of federal Medicaid spending cuts and a roughly $3 billion budget deficit that analysts warn could worsen if the artificial intelligence bubble bursts. Newsom has proposed that the state not step in when, starting in October, the federal government stops providing health coverage to an estimated 200,000 legal residents — comprising asylees, refugees, and others.

Progressive legislators and activists said the cost-saving measures are a departure from Newsom's "health for all" pledge, while Republicans continue to skewer Newsom for using public funds to cover any noncitizens.

Newsom's latest move would save an estimated $786 million this fiscal year and $1.1 billion annually in future years in a proposed budget of $349 billion, according to the Department of Finance.

State Sen. Caroline Menjivar, one of two Senate Democrats who voted against Newsom's immigrant health cuts last year, said she worried the governor's political ambition could be getting in the way of doing what's best for Californians.

"You're clouded by what Arkansas is going to think, or Tennessee is going to think, when what California thinks is something completely different," said Menjivar, who said previous criticism got her temporarily removed from a key budget subcommittee. "That's my perspective on what's happening here."

Meanwhile, Republican state Sen. Tony Strickland criticized Newsom for glossing over the state's structural deficit, which state officials say could balloon to $27 billion the following year. And he slammed Newsom for continuing to cover California residents in the U.S. without authorization. "He just wants to reinvent himself," Strickland said.

It's a political tightrope that will continue to grow thinner as federal support shrinks amid ever-rising health care expenses, said Guian McKee, a co-chair of the Health Care Policy Project at the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs.

"It's not just threading one needle but threading three or four of them right in a row," McKee said. Should Newsom run, McKee added, the priorities of Democratic primary voters — who largely mirror blue states like California — look very different from those in a far more divided general electorate.

Americans are deeply divided on whether the government should provide health coverage to immigrants without legal status. In a KFF poll last year, a slim majority — 54% — were against a provision that would have penalized states that use their own funds to pay for immigrant health care, with wide variation by party. The provision was left out of the final version of the bill passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump.

Even in California, support for the idea has waned amid ongoing budget problems. In a May survey by the Public Policy Institute of California, 41% of adults in the state said they supported providing health coverage to immigrants who lack legal status, a sharp drop from the 55% who supported it in 2023.

Trump, Vice President JD Vance, other administration officials, and congressional Republicans have repeatedly accused California and other Democratic states of using taxpayer funds on immigrant health care, a red-meat issue for their GOP base. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz has accused California of "gaming the system" to receive more federal funds, freeing up state coffers for its Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal, which has enrolled roughly 1.6 million immigrants without legal status.

"If you are a taxpayer in Texas or Florida, your tax dollars could've been used to fund the care of illegal immigrants in California," he said in October.

California state officials have denied the charges, noting that only state funds are used to pay for general health services for those without legal status because the law prohibits using federal funds. Instead, Newsom has made it a "point of pride" that California has opened up coverage to immigrants, which his administration has noted keeps people healthier and helps them avoid costly emergency room care often covered at taxpayer expense.

"No administration has done more to expand full coverage under Medicaid than this administration for our diverse communities, documented and undocumented," Newsom told reporters in January. "People have built careers out of criticizing my advocacy."

Newsom warns the federal government's "carnival of chaos" passed Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he said puts 1.8 million Californians at risk of losing their health coverage with the implementation of work requirements, other eligibility rules, and limits to federal funding to states.

Nationally, 10 million people could lose coverage by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Health economists have said higher numbers of uninsured patients — particularly those who are relatively healthy — could concentrate coverage among sicker patients, potentially increasing premium costs and hospital prices overall.

Immigrant advocates say it's especially callous to leave residents who may have fled violence or survived trafficking or abuse without access to health care. Federal rules currently require state Medicaid programs to cover "qualified noncitizens" including asylees and refugees, according to Tanya Broder of the National Immigration Law Center. But the Republican tax-and-spending law ends the coverage, affecting an estimated 1.4 million legal immigrants nationwide.

With many state governors yet to release budget proposals, it's unclear how they might handle the funding gaps, Broder said.

For instance, Colorado state officials estimate roughly 7,000 legal immigrants could lose coverage due to the law's changes. And Washington state officials estimate 3,000 refugees, asylees, and other lawfully present immigrants will lose Medicaid.

Both states, like California, expanded full coverage to all income-eligible residents regardless of immigration status. Their elected officials are now in the awkward position of explaining why some legal immigrants may lose their health care coverage while those without legal status could keep theirs.

Last year, spiraling health care costs and state budget constraints prompted the Democratic governors of Illinois and Minnesota, potential presidential contenders JB Pritzker and Tim Walz, to pause or end coverage of immigrants without legal status.

California lawmakers last year voted to eliminate dental coverage and freeze new enrollment for immigrants without legal status and, starting next year, will charge monthly premiums to those who remain. Even so, the state is slated to spend $13.8 billion from its general fund on immigrants not covered by the federal government, according to Department of Finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer.

At a press conference in San Francisco in January, Newsom defended those moves, saying they were necessary for "fiscal prudence." He sidestepped questions about coverage for asylees and refugees and downplayed the significance of his proposal, saying he could revise it when he gets a chance to update his budget in May.

Kiran Savage-Sangwan, executive director of the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, pointed out that California passed a law in the 1990s requiring the state to cover Medi-Cal for legal immigrants when federal Medicaid dollars won't. This includes green-card holders who haven't yet met the five-year waiting period for enrolling in Medicaid.

Calling the governor's proposal "arbitrary and cruel," Savage-Sangwan criticized his choice to prioritize rainy day fund deposits over maintaining coverage and said blaming the federal government was misleading.

It's also a major departure from what she had hoped California could achieve on Newsom's first day in office seven years ago, when he declared his support for single-payer health care and proposed extending health insurance subsidies to middle-class Californians.

"I absolutely did have hope, and we celebrated advances that the governor led," Savage-Sangwan said. "Which makes me all the more disappointed."

Announcing a new article publication for BIO Integration journal. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound nanoparticles secreted by cells and have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for osteoarthritis (OA).

These vesicles exhibit high biocompatibility and the intrinsic ability to traverse physiologic barriers, delivering bioactive molecular cargo to recipient cells to exert regulatory effects. To enhance therapeutic efficacy, EVs can be bioengineered to improve biological activity and targeting capacity toward specific cells or tissues. Strategies for EV engineering primarily involve modifications to cargo, membranes, or the pretreatment of parental cells. In recent years advances in EV engineering have led to growing interest in the application of engineered EVs for OA treatment, offering new possibilities for clinical translation. This review summarizes the fundamental characteristics of EVs and examine the factors limiting the current therapeutic efficacy in OA.

An overview of existing engineering strategies and a discussion of the therapeutic applications of engineered EVs in OA models is also provided. Finally the remaining challenges and future directions necessary to advance EV-based therapies toward clinical use in OA are outlined.

New research in U.S. firefighters reveals how workplace practices, personal factors, and environmental exposures shape PFAS levels, offering insights into practical strategies to reduce long-term chemical exposure risk.

In a recent study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, researchers investigated factors predicting serum concentrations of multiple per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) among American firefighters. The findings identified distinct personal and workplace predictors for specific PFAS analytes rather than uniform effects across all compounds, reflecting differences in chemical subclasses and exposure pathways and highlighting potential targets for exposure-reduction interventions.

PFAS are synthetic chemicals widely used for their water- and grease-resistant properties and are often referred to as “forever chemicals” due to their environmental persistence. They are present in numerous consumer and industrial products, including aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF), textiles, cookware, and food packaging, resulting in widespread contamination of air, water, soil, and food.

As a consequence, nearly the entire U.S. population has detectable PFAS levels, with these compounds accumulating in human tissues over the years. Exposure has been associated with adverse health outcomes, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, endocrine disruption, and accelerated biological aging.

Firefighters may experience elevated PFAS exposure through occupational use of AFFF, combustion of PFAS-containing materials, contaminated dust, and contact with protective gear. Previous studies have reported higher serum PFAS concentrations among firefighters and identified limited predictors such as years of service and blood donation. However, knowledge of modifiable individual- and organizational-level predictors remains limited.

Researchers evaluated agency-level, occupational, lifestyle, and demographic predictors of serum PFAS concentrations in a large, multi-state cohort of United States firefighters. This cross-sectional analysis included 2,056 participants from the Fire Fighter Cancer Cohort Study (FFCCS), a national cohort established to examine occupational exposures and health outcomes.

Participants provided blood samples between July 2023 and October 2024 during baseline or follow-up visits and were employed at fire agencies across seven states. Individual-level data were collected via electronic surveys covering demographics, lifestyle behaviours, health history, firefighting practices, and occupational exposures. Agency-level data, including departmental policies and resources, were obtained from designated fire service liaisons.

Blood samples were processed and analysed for 20 PFAS analytes using a standardized CDC laboratory method. Eight analytes with concentrations above the limit of detection in at least 75% of participants were included in the primary analyses. Serum PFAS concentrations were log-transformed, and values below detection limits were imputed using standard approaches.

Associations between predictors and PFAS concentrations were assessed using adjusted linear regression and linear mixed-effects models, accounting for demographic covariates and clustering by fire agency where appropriate. Results were reported as percent changes in geometric mean concentrations with corresponding confidence intervals.

The cohort was predominantly male, White, and non-Hispanic, with a mean age of 40 years and an average firefighting career length of 14 years. All eight primary PFAS analytes were detected at high frequencies. Age was positively associated with all measured compounds, while female firefighters exhibited significantly lower concentrations across analytes.

Several non-occupational predictors were identified. Blood and plasma donation were strongly associated with lower PFAS levels, particularly among plasma donors. Drinking water source also influenced exposure: bottled water was associated with lower concentrations of certain PFAS (notably PFOA-related measures and PFNA), whereas well water use was associated with higher concentrations. Military service was associated with elevated PFAS-related measures.

Occupational factors played a substantial role. Longer service duration, higher rank, and current AFFF use were primarily associated with increased concentrations of PFOA-related analytes rather than uniformly higher PFAS levels. Protective practices such as on-scene decontamination and participation in hood swap or cleaning programmes were associated with lower concentrations of some PFAS, particularly PFOA-related compounds.

Agency-level policies also mattered. Practices such as washing gear before storage, providing gear bags, frequent dusting of living quarters, and the use of reverse osmosis water filtration were associated with reduced concentrations of specific PFAS analytes, for example, PFNA. Conversely, carpeted station living areas were linked to higher levels. Some findings were unexpected, including higher PFHxS levels in departments with marked contamination zones and higher PFHpS concentrations under less frequent dusting schedules, suggesting complex, potentially compound-specific exposure pathways.

This study identified multiple individual- and department-level predictors of serum PFAS concentrations among United States firefighters, underscoring the importance of both personal behaviours and workplace practices. Associations with age, sex, military service, drinking water source, and AFFF use were consistent with prior research, while novel findings emerged for firefighter rank and specific agency policies.

Notably, blood and plasma donation were strong predictors of lower PFAS concentrations, supporting evidence that these practices may reduce body burden. Protective occupational practices and station policies were associated with lower concentrations of selected analytes rather than across all PFAS, highlighting heterogeneity between subclasses and exposure routes and pointing to actionable intervention opportunities.

Strengths of the study include its large sample size, multi-state design, and integration of individual- and agency-level data. Limitations include the cross-sectional design, reliance on self-reported data, and potential regional influences on generalisability. Despite these constraints, the findings provide valuable evidence to guide PFAS exposure-reduction strategies. Longitudinal and intervention studies are needed to confirm causality and evaluate the effectiveness of targeted policy and behavioural changes within the fire service.

New research explores how attention difficulties, sleep disruption, and cognitive control challenges intersect with internet use patterns, highlighting lifestyle factors like exercise that may help reduce risk while underscoring the need for cautious interpretation of cross-sectional findings.



Study: The interplay between attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and internet addiction: executive dysfunction and insomnia as mediators and the role of physical activity. Image Credit: Melinda Nagy / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Psychiatry, researchers assessed the relationship between ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) symptoms, insomnia, executive dysfunction, and IA (internet addiction) in college students.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hyperactivity, inattention, cognitive deficits, emotional impulsivity, and learning difficulties. IA has also emerged as a substantial public health concern. IA and ADHD are closely related, with individuals showing ADHD symptoms more likely to report IA. Despite evidence of co-occurrence, the precise directional relationship remains unclear. Because this study used a cross-sectional design, causal relationships cannot be established, and the findings should be interpreted as associations rather than cause-and-effect relationships.

Executive dysfunction is a common comorbidity in ADHD, affecting domains such as attention control, working memory, inhibitory control, and planning. Executive function (EF), which broadly refers to cognitive processes involved in self-regulation, organization, and goal-directed behaviour, plays a key role in impulse control. Deficits in EF may elevate the risk of IA among individuals with ADHD. Insomnia, which is also common in people with ADHD, may further aggravate executive dysfunction. These relationships may be bidirectional, as problematic internet use itself can worsen sleep patterns.

Previous studies have reported that physical activity can reduce IA symptoms and improve mental health outcomes. Physical activity may also alleviate executive dysfunction and insomnia. However, most prior research has examined these factors in isolation, with limited attention to their combined effects. Consequently, the complex interactions among physical activity, sleep, executive function, and IA remain underexplored, particularly in non-Western educational settings such as Chinese universities, where digital engagement patterns may differ.

In the present study, researchers evaluated associations among ADHD symptoms, IA, insomnia, and executive dysfunction. Students aged 16 years and older from six universities in Hunan, China, were recruited, and surveys were administered in June 2024. The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) was used as a screening tool, comprising hyperactivity and inattention subscales, with scores ranging from 0 to 9.

A total ASRS score greater than nine indicated clinical-level ADHD symptoms rather than a formal diagnosis, as the scale functions as a screening instrument. Executive dysfunction was assessed using the Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale, Short Form (BDEFS-SF), with higher scores indicating more severe impairment. Insomnia was assessed using the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), which ranges from 0 to 24, with scores of 6 or higher indicating increased risk of insomnia.

IA was assessed using the Chinese IA Scale, Revision (CIAS-R), which evaluates compulsive use and withdrawal, tolerance, time management problems, and interpersonal and health-related concerns. A total CIAS-R score above 53 indicated clinically significant IA symptoms. Information on physical activity, including duration, frequency, and type, was also collected.

Participants were categorized into high-, moderate-, and low-physical-activity groups and compared with inactive individuals. Group differences were assessed using chi-squared tests for categorical variables, and Mann–Whitney U tests for continuous variables. Mediating effects of insomnia and executive dysfunction in the relationship between ADHD symptoms and IA were evaluated using structural equation modelling. This method identifies statistical associations but cannot confirm causality or temporal ordering.

The study initially recruited 2,188 students, of whom 263 were excluded due to incomplete responses, yielding an analytic sample of 1,925 participants. Among these, 14 percent met criteria for IA symptoms, and 12.5 percent met criteria for ADHD symptoms. No significant differences in age, sex, or academic grade were observed between participants with and without IA symptoms.

Participants with IA symptoms had higher ASRS, BDEFS-SF, and AIS scores than those without IA. They also reported lower exercise intensity, fewer exercise habits, poorer adherence to exercise routines, and shorter exercise duration per session.

ADHD symptoms were associated with IA symptoms, with executive dysfunction and insomnia statistically mediating this relationship. Because the data were cross-sectional, these mediation findings should be interpreted cautiously, as temporal sequencing cannot be confirmed. Participants who reported regular exercise habits had lower CIAS-R, BDEFS-SF, and AIS scores and were more likely to be male and in lower academic grades.

Compared with no physical activity, moderate physical activity was negatively associated with IA symptoms, and this association was stronger at high levels of physical activity. These relationships were also mediated by executive dysfunction and insomnia. Low levels of physical activity were not significantly associated with IA symptoms. Unmeasured factors such as stress, mood symptoms, or academic pressure may also have influenced these associations.

Overall, ADHD symptoms were associated with IA symptoms in Chinese college students, with insomnia and executive dysfunction acting as mediating factors. Moderate and high levels of physical activity were associated with lower IA risk, with the association mediated by sleep quality and executive function. These findings suggest that interventions for IA may benefit from addressing sleep, physical activity, and executive functioning. However, reliance on self-reported data, regional sampling, and a cross-sectional design limits generalizability and causal interpretation. Longitudinal and interventional studies are needed before firm clinical recommendations can be made.

The Mexican state of Jalisco has issued a health alert and mandated face masks in schools due to a measles outbreak in the state capital

ZAPOPAN, Mexico -- The Mexican state of Jalisco on Thursday issued a health alert and mandated the use of face masks in schools as a measles outbreak hit the state capital, a key host city for the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The measures come on the heels of an epidemiological alert issued by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) earlier this week over the spread of the preventable disease across the Americas, particularly in Mexico, which leads the region with 1,981 cases confirmed by authorities this year and more than 5,200 suspected cases.

Jalisco is the epicenter of the outbreak, with 1,163 cases confirmed this year and 2,092 suspected cases, according to Mexico's government.

The measles outbreak in Mexico began last year in the northern state of Chihuahua, after a Mennonite child fell ill while visiting relatives in a region in Texas that was suffering an outbreak. Cases surged in Mennonite communities — which have high rates of vaccine hesitancy — and have rippled out across Mexico in the country's biggest outbreak in decades. Scientists say rising outbreaks across the hemisphere are linked to declining vaccination rates.

Jalisco health authorities announced Thursday that masks will be required in Guadalajara schools across seven specific neighborhoods for the next 30 days.

Jalisco was the first Mexican state to take such measures as medical groups urged the local government to take urgent action, marking the country's first such public health mandate since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Classes were also recently suspended in 15 schools in Jalisco and the central state of Aguascalientes due to outbreaks of the highly contagious airborne virus.

The outbreak comes as Mexico prepares to host visitors from across the world for the World Cup, which will be held simultaneously in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Guadalajara is one of the main venues in Mexico for the soccer tournament.

Canada lost its measles-free status in November and the U.S. and Mexico face the risk of meeting the same fate. Both governments have requested a two-month extension to try to control the outbreak, although in January the Trump administration withdrew from the World Health Organization, under whose umbrella PAHO operates.

In the first three weeks of this year, 1,031 additional measles cases were confirmed in seven countries in the Americas with no deaths reported — a figure 43 times higher than that recorded in the same period last year — PAHO said Wednesday in a statement.

The Mexican government has spent weeks encouraging the population to get vaccinated against the measles, which is preventable with two doses of the vaccine, and announced the launch of vaccination sites in places such as airports and bus stations.

GOAL ranks the top 25 players in MLS. And while No. 1 should be of little surprise, there is plenty of talent littered all over the league. 

Welcome to the ranking that will probably get this writer in trouble. Piecing together the top 25 players in MLS is a tricky thing. No. 1 should come as absolutely no surprise (folks: it's Messi). But it's everything in between where the debate really begins.

The issue is simple: there are a lot of very good players in this league right now, all impacting winning teams in very different ways. So these rankings are based on a bit of everything - the numbers, the eye test, and, yes, a little bit of what players actually mean.

Some housekeeping: players signed this offseason are not included (i.e. Timo Werner). Neither are deals that have yet to be fully announced (looking at you, Minnesota and James Rodríguez). Newer faces who made an immediate impact but saw their seasons cut short by injury also miss out - sorry, Wessam Abou Ali.

Other than that, here goes nothing…

You wanted a goalscorer? Baribo is about as clean as they come. The D.C. United striker was fantastic for Philadelphia Union last year, and led the Golden Boot race at one point. A late season slump took nothing away from his quality, and a big money move to Washington was entirely deserved from a player who still has a lot to offer.

Gil has been the constant in a mixed few years for the Revs. The attacking midfielder provides goals and assists wherever he plays, and has offered double-digit goal contributions in every full season he has played in MLS. He's 32, but his numbers are only improving for a Revolution side that may have turned a corner. 

Philip Zinckernagel quietly had one of the best seasons in MLS last year, managing 15 goals and 15 assists in his debut campaign in the league. This year, he might just be even better, especially with the Fire retooling over the offseason.

Musa was brought in on a big money deal in 2024, and settled into MLS nicely with 16 goals and three assists. And last year, he only improved, posting 18 and six. Dallas showed real improvement on the pitch, too - with Musa central to their efforts. 

Tverskov doesn't play sexy football, but he is immensely reliable. The Danish defensive midfielder anchored an excellent San Diego side, playing almost every minute for the expansion franchise - and dishing out eight assists along the way. 

White has quietly been a regular provider of goals since 2021, but hit new levels in 2025. He bagged 25 in all competitions last year, enough to earn him a USMNT look, and a shot at making Mauricio Pochettino's side for the World Cup. 

The Brazilian's production dropped off in an injury-marred 2025 season, but even then, his quality cannot be denied. He was vital in LA Galaxy's MLS Cup run in 2024, and, now fully fit, seems primed to return to form. A fit Pec is a scary proposition. 

Arfsten was linked with a move to Europe for a large portion of January, which would indicate just how handy he is at left back. Excellent going forward but always improving defensively, Arfsten has earned a spot in the USMNT setup - and will certainly be a solid backup when Pochettino's team takes the field this summer.

The 2025 campaign was the year Dayne St. Clair finally put it all together for Minnesota United. To be sure, he had been an excellent goalkeeper for some time, but last season he made headlines, coming up with crucial saves in big moments, and getting the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year nod that he thoroughly deserved. Since then, he has only challenged himself further by moving to Inter Miami. This year feels pivotal for the Canadian. 

It was an immense surprise to see Philadelphia offload Glesnes, who was among the best center backs in MLS last year. Tall, physcial, and tify with the ball at his feet, he bailed out the Union week in and week out. His best years may be behind him, but his three All Star nods and 2022 Defender of the Year acknowledgement prove that he is a true talent. 

Luna is certainly the most likable player in MLS, and a true advocate for his community. But he's also devastatingly good on the pitch. In 2025, he tallied double-digit goal contributions for the second year in a row and is on track to improve ahead of this season. 

Robinson returned from a devastating Achilles injury in style in 2024, and only improved the year after. Sure, there were a couple knocks, but he was vital for a very good Cincinnati defense, and played himself into the picture for the USMNT at the World Cup. And there's still plenty of soccer to come from a player named an All-Star last year. 

When fit, Puig is a top-three player in MLS, and there shouldn't really be a debate there. He was immense in 2024, leading LA Galaxy to an MLS Cup win that very few saw coming. But back-to-back ACL surgery leaves his career at a crossroads. Still, if he reaches full fitness again, the La Masia product shall certainly be right back among the league's best. 

What a year it was for the man whose USMNT call up was leaked by Thomas Muller. Sure, the Whitecaps' attack made headlines, but their defensive spine set everything up. Blackmon was the anchor of a Vancouver defense that conceded the fewest goals in the West in 2025. It was little surprise when he was named MLS Defender of the Year. 

The story goes that Nashville wanted Mukhtar to be their main man before they even existed. Indeed, they called him in 2019 to set everything up. And Mukhtar has never really looked back. He is the perennial presence for the reigning U.S. Open Cup champs, tallying 16 goals in MLS alone last year. He was also named an All-Star for the third season straight. 

Surridge is very good at doing one thing: scoring loads of goals. There are very few strikers in MLS with his raw finishing ability, and Nashville make pretty good use of it, too. He bagged 25 goals last year and was named an MVP finalist on the back of his best season in the league to date. 

Last season was the year in which Berhalter realized his potential in full. He had been reliable for Vancouver for a few years, but in 2025, the son of the former USMNT coach became the all-action midfielder he always could be. Those 12 assists - helped, no doubt, by his deadly set piece ability - don't look too bad, either. 

Roldan's performance in the Leagues Cup final against Inter Miami should be studied. The American midfielder was playing through an injury, yet still dominated the center of the park as the Sounders battered Messi and Co. He has been a mainstay for the Sounders since 2015, yet managed his first All-Star nod in 2025. It felt a lot like vindication for a player who has run the hard yards and can be considered nothing less than a club legend. 

Evander, more than anything, is immensely fun to watch. The kid who watched Ronaldinho in his formative years has brought a specific kind of flair to Major League Soccer. More of a devastating passer and shooter than a dribbler, the Brazilian is the perfect throwback No. 10 for a league that still allows them. Thirty-one goal contributions weren't a bad start to life in Cincinnati, either. 

Bouanga was a masterstroke of a signing when LAFC brought him in a few years ago. And in his third full season in the league, he played his best soccer. He tallied 32 goals in all competitions and developed a deadly partnership with Son Heung-Min. There are rumors that the Gabonese international could leave the league for big money - which would be an immense loss for MLS and LAFC alike. 

 Inter Miami needed to replace one of their star DPs in Sergio Busquets, and did so in style, bringing in De Paul at the midpoint of last season. And if Messi was the undisputed main man, then De Paul did everything else. They dub him "Messi's bodyguard" in Argentina, and it's easy to see why, with De Paul running midfields by himself - while also making sure that the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner is more than protected. 

Dreyer would be a shoo-in for MVP had a certain Lionel Messi fella not played in this league. He always seemed to be a smart signing for San Diego, but very few could have predicted just how good he would be. A return of 23 goals and 17 assists is absurd in a debut season. An All-Star selection was more than deserved, and SDFC will be immensely grateful to have him for at least two more years. 

What a signing Sonny was. Sure, LAFC broke the bank to bring the Korean in, but who cares? Sometimes you have to swing big. And there was no adjustment period for the Korean, either. He bagged 12 and added three assists in 13 games after moving from Tottenham in August. Odds are, he will be even better in 2026.

A player so good that they made up a new position for him. Muller dubbed himself an "interpreter of space", which really doesn't mean all that much, but sounds pretty good. In practice, it was remarkably effective for the Whitecaps. Muller's numbers were good - 11 goal contributions in 12 matches - but his impact was even more significant. Vancouver went from good to great when he joined, and that's no coincidence. 

Does this even need intellectualizing? Messi had the best season in MLS history. Ever. Irrefutably, undoubtedly, and perhaps entirely expectedly, the little Argentine absolutely dominated the league last year. His 48 goal contributions in 28 matches were the second most in league history, but achieved in fewer games than the previous mark. He also smashed pretty much every playoff record available, too. And to top it off, he lifted the MLS Cup at the end of the year. The sweetener? He penned a multi-year deal to stick around in Miami for the foreseeable future.

Jack of All Trades, Difference Maker: Weston McKennie's Moment Has Arrived

The USMNT will rely on key players to step up and perform at a high level at the World Cup. Christian Pulisic will need to create and score goals, the midfield will need to be controlled by Tyler Adams, Folarin Balogun has to lead the attacking line, and Chris Richards is going to be tasked with leading the defense. However, Weston McKennie is capable of doing all of this and how he performs may very well determine the level of success the USMNT has this summer.

McKennie has always been a talented player and has shown that he can fill nearly any position on the field. That has been helpful as he's able to fill gaps in the lineup but at times kept him from establishing himself as a starter in a single position in his club career. Every season there seems to be speculation about his future with his club. That began to change last season with Juventus, but this season he is proving that a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one. His versatility was recognized as he was named the Juventus' player of the Month for January after scoring three goals in seven games.

His managers over the years have described his ability to play in different roles over his career. Current Juventus boss Luciano Spalletti says “McKennie is a perfect central striker.” He noted that, “he fights, he's strong in the air and he can jump high. He plays to get results because he makes decisions. He would be a perfect striker.” This speaks to McKennie's understanding of the game and how to exploit space to support this team in the attack.

Last year, Thiago Motta talked about McKennie's ability to play multiple positions, noting “he has played fullback, holding midfielder, attacking midfielder, winger. He's a top-level player.” Motta went on to note that, “Weston plays everywhere, and he has to be on the field. It's hard for me to leave him out. Maybe not as a goalkeeper, but in every other position, it's difficult to put him on the bench. That's what being a top-level player means.”

What's exciting about McKennie is that the USMNT has never had a player like him playing at this high of a level and unique talents like him have made the difference for championship winning sides. McKennie has a chance to add his name to the likes of similar players like James Milner and Federico Valverde. Currently, he is solidly in the prime of his career and playing the best soccer of his life for Juventus.

Wes' work-rate and ability to play everywhere make him the kind of player who can be the engine for the USMNT. That aspect of his game is well known, but his versatility and ability to play anywhere also make him the kind of player who can make a lung busting run to break up an attack or find space to score while opponents are focused on shutting down Pulisic and Balogun.

If McKennie plays the kind of soccer he's playing for his club in the World Cup, he has the ability to push the team to play up to the level of teams considered contenders to win the tournament. He's always been a special player with unique skills, this summer those abilities will be on the world's stage and give the team a chance to exceed expectations and change the way the world looks at American soccer.

After a whirlwind free agency period highlighted by the situations of Trinity Rodman and Sophia Wilson, the 2026 NWSL regular season is nearly a month away.

While the league will welcome a new season, two expansion teams, and its first-ever 16-team, 30-game campaign, clubs will celebrate roster moves as they build during preseason camps. Expansion sides Denver Summit FC and Boston Legacy FC are obvious teams that made new player acquisitions for their inaugural seasons, while Portland Thorns FC and Washington Spirit made key signings to retain their biggest stars. 

The primary transfer window closes on March 16, leaving the door open for more announcements ahead of the regular season. NWSL clubs can also complete interleague transfers until October. The introduction of the HIP rule also presents a new financial mechanism for teams to sign marquee players who meet specific criteria.

With the new season just 37 days away, which new signings broke the internet during this offseason?

Here are the best NWSL player signings of the offseason:

Naturally, there will be plenty of perspectives that will claim that certain players should be ranked higher, or that there's someone not ranked here at all. With that in mind, let's start with a few honorable mentions. 

Ally Schlegel, North Carolina Courage: Real invested NWSL viewers will be familiar with Ally Schlegel's game. Schlegel opted into free agency, and North Carolina now have a player who can contribute in attack, is effective on aerials, and is unafraid to get physical.

Alyssa Naeher and Katie Lind, Chicago Stars FC: The longest tenured player for Chicago Stars FC is back once again on a one-year contract for her 11th season. Having an iconic goalkeeper you can trust in Alyssa Naeher, while locking in a player who can contend for a starting spot with Katie Lind, means the Stars will feel secure in net throughout the long season.

Brooklyn Courtnall, Bay FC: It'll be year three for Bay FC after joining the league in 2024. New head coach Emma Coats is already using her U23 England credentials to recruit youth internationals to the NWSL, but it might be the players with NWSL experience who need to lead the way. Bay FC made things official by making Brooklyn Courtnall's loan more permanent with a new three-year deal. 

Now on to the rankings:

If you're the gambling type, make sure you bet on yourself with the same confidence as forward Midge Purce. 

The 30-year-old two-time NWSL champion re-signed with the club on another one-year deal after a late season comeback from an ACL injury she sustained in 2024. The 2023 NWSL Championship final MVP gets another chance to run it back with the club she's helped rebuild as the team's third leading scorer with 17 goals. 

There's always a mix of anticipation and grace whenever an expansion side builds out its inaugural roster. When Boston Legacy FC signed Brazilian international Amanda Gutierres, it immediately placed some expectation on their attacking game ahead of their debut season.

The 24-year-old was a 2025 Ballon d'Or nominee, thanks to her proficient goal scoring. She was the co-leading goal scorer for Brazil at the 2025 Copa America Femenina and is a two-time Golden Boot winner in Brazil (2023, 2024) with Palmeiras.

When news broke that San Diego Wave FC acquired Brazilian international Ludmila in a trade with Chicago Stars FC, it seemed like a mutually beneficial move that boosted the Wave's attack and sent a large fee to a rebuilding Chicago. 

San Diego then parted ways with winger Delphine Cascarino, their 2025 NWSL MVP finalist, and simmered some of the reaction. There's no use crying over what could've been, and if anything, there's still plenty to look forward to as the move reunites her with Brazilian teammate Dudinha. The 31-year-old will also be an asset to younger players coming up the ranks, as Trinity Byars is now off the season-ending list, along with midfielder Melanie Barcenas. 

Utah Royals made an early offseason move in a trade with the Washington Spirit for Japanese international midfielder Narumi Miura. The deal was completed in exchange for $180,000 in allocation money. Miura has played in the league since 2023 and has quickly risen as a starting-caliber central midfielder. 

She often is a ball-possession player with the ability to set the tempo. With connective passing and defensive efforts, she's often the link between her defensive teammates and the attacking line. Her addition to Utah's roster could alleviate some of the playmaking responsibilities from Japan national teammate Mina Tanaka.

One day, we will all look back on this past offseason and laugh that the first player announced with the intent to use future HIP money was Lindsey Heaps, not Rodman. The U.S. national team captain will be with the expansion club through 2029, and it's not unrealistic to associate her return to the NWSL with the latter stage of her career.

Back when the club introduced Heaps, general manager Curt Johnson clarified that conversations with Heaps began before the HIP rule was introduced. With the player's arrival set for June and a debut potentially as late as July, the mechanism could very likely be in play. The move means they'll start life on the pitch without her, but they'll get quite a boost later this season, even if it is just for half of the season. While making the playoffs will be a tall task, she has the quality to lift them into contention.

The Denver expansion team has made multiple roster building moves, but acquiring Eva Gaetino from Paris Saint-Germain is a pickup for the club's present and the future. There needs to be a balance between experienced veterans and promising prospects, and Gaetino will fit that mold. 

The 23-year-old defender joined PSG following a standout college career at Notre Dame and won the Coupe de France, making 45 appearances. She also made UEFA Women's Champions League history by becoming the youngest American to score in the knockout rounds at 21. Her move to NWSL comes off a stint with the U.S. women's national team programs in 2025, alternating between the U23 squad and the senior side. 

Perhaps a move made ahead of a player departure, the Pride made an early offseason move and signed defender Hailie Mace on a new contract through the 2028 season. Mace was a key figure for Kansas City Current, especially during their 2025 NWSL Shield campaign. 

A versatile defensive piece who can function as both center and outside back, Mace often contributed to a historic season where Kansas City led the league and set a record for regular-season clean sheets, and she was named to the NWSL Best XI second team in 2025.

In a major intraleague move, Angel City bolstered their backline and traded for Orlando Pride defender Emily Sams. The $650,000 intraleague transfer fee is a record for the highest fee ever paid for a defender in the NWSL and signals a clear trajectory for Angel City moving forward.

Sams signed with her new club through 2028 and had requested a trade to pursue new challenges in the league. She'll be getting one as Angel City conceded 41 goals last season (third most in the league) and struggled on set-piece defending. The move immediately pairs Sams with club captain Sarah Gorden, an NWSL veteran who is sturdy and realiable.

One-third of the U.S. women's national team's attacking trio, dubbed "triple espresso," Wilson has made one of the more intriguing free-agent moves this offseason. The club had periods of navigating ownership changes and rotating head coaches, but with enough talent on the roster, they have found a way into consecutive playoff appearances, and the Thorns were able to maintain that with and without Wilson.

The USWNT striker exercised her player option (a first-of-its-kind contract mechanism) and opted in for one more year with the club after she and her husband, NFL Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Michael Wilson, welcomed their daughter, Gianna, in September. She's back in training after maternity leave with the Thorns and is aiming to return in time for the club's opener in March.

No other player in the world had a contract status that captivated the globe this offseason more than Rodman. In the buildup to the postseason, during the playoffs, and through the NWSL Championship, attention on Rodman's free agency reached unprecedented heights. 

Washington Spirit were always in the mix, but European clubs were reported as interested, and in between contract vetoes and two grievances filed, a new deal was finally announced by the Spirit last month. Rodman signed with the club on a three-year deal through 2028, with a record-breaking payout, and anticipation for the next marquee signing for the league.

Atlético Madrid has announced Johnny Cardoso will miss out against former side Real Betis on Thursday, Feb. 5 due to a muscle injury.

The U.S. men's national team midfielder did not make the trip to Seville for the Copa del Rey quarterfinal after suffering an injury in training.

"Johnny will be unavailable due to discomfort he felt in the final training session before the match against Real Betis, which forced him to leave yesterday's session," Atlético said on social media.

"Medical staff carried out tests on the midfielder, confirming a low-grade muscle injury."

It's been a frustrating debut campaign with Atlético for Cardoso, who joined last summer after a season and a half with Betis.

The 24-year-old has played in 14 of a possible 34 games with the La Liga club, missing time with multiple injuries. Cardoso suffered an ankle injury early in the season, then dealt with a knee issue in December.

The injuries have harmed Cardoso's chance to make an impression on USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino ahead of the World Cup.

Cardoso is on the roster bubble despite his success in Spain over the past two years. He has yet to fully impose himself at the international level, turning in a series of underwhelming displays with the USMNT.

In 2025, Cardoso made four appearances for the U.S. as he dealt with an injury that limited him to just two brief cameos at the Gold Cup.

Lionel Scaloni has successfully built a highly competitive roster with Argentina. Lionel Messi not only shines, but he is also supported by standout teammates like Rodrigo De Paul, Emiliano Martínez, and others, who excel in their respective positions and enhance the team's overall competitiveness. One of the national team's top players reportedly plans to leave his club post-2026 World Cup, attracting interest from Atlético Madrid and Barcelona.

Unlike in previous seasons, Cristian Romero has been critical of Tottenham Hotspur's management. Following their 3-2 defeat to Brentford, the Argentine defender shared a blunt post on his Instagram account: “In moments like this, there should be others who come out to speak, but they don't. They only show up when things are going well.” With a negative streak in the current season, he could leave the team, with Atletico Madrid and Barcelona chasing his arrival.

Following four years of shining at Tottenham Hotspur, Cristian Romero has reportedly decided to leave the club. However, his exit could prove to be quite costly, as he is under contract until 2029 and remains a key piece of the team. In light of his potential departure from England, Atlético Madrid have reportedly identified him as a possible reinforcement, according to TyC Sports. Alongside Los Colchoneros, Barcelona have also listed him as an option, TEAMtalk reports.

While Hansi Flick has remained quiet on the Argentine star potential arrival, Diego Simeone has already spoken on Romero's potential arrival. “Do I want Cuti Romero? Of course! He's a great player,” he said, via DSports after a 4-0 defeat vs. PSG in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025. Holding an aggressive approach in his defensive skills, Cristian Romero would be an ideal fit for Atlético Madrid, who have shined in previous years for their solidity in the backline.

Tottenham captain Cristian Romero.

After shining at Atalanta, Tottenham Hotspur decided to back his signing, paying €52 million for his transfer. While his excessive defensive aggression caused him several problems in his first season, Cristian Romero has already managed to control this approach, establishing himself as one of the most difficult defenders to beat. In addition, the 27-year-old star has emerged as the team's undisputed leader, elevating it and becoming one of the Premier League's reference figures.

Far from defensive solidity being his only trait, the Argentine is also known for being one of the defenders with the best ball progression, something that would make him an ideal fit in Hansi Flick's Barcelona. Cristian Romero is even regularly compared to Virgil van Dijk, something that has reportedly caught the attention of several Premier League clubs that are also keeping a close eye on a potential move for the 2026–27 season.

Lamine Yamal's Barcelona has reportedly set its sights on a promising youngster from Ajax.


Marc-André ter Stegen got injured with Girona against Real Oviedo, putting his participation with Germany at the 2026 FIFA World Cup in doubt.


Although he is only 18 years old, Lamine Yamal has remained one of Barcelona's best players over the last two years, finishing second in the 2025 Ballon d'Or. In light of this, Blaugrana legend Andrés Iniesta did not hesitate to praise the young star, making clear the challenge that lies ahead.


As Milan navigates a delicate phase of the season and the 2026 World Cup looms ever closer, the American's form, fitness, and rhythm have become inseparable topics.

The clip from Peacock and Telemundo shows the “Wedding Crashers” star becoming obsessed with soccer

Owen Wilson stars in a new teaser for a Super Bowl spot kicking off the road to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

In the trailer, a couch-bound Wilson stops studying a script as he becomes enamored by the sounds of soccer. The “Wedding Crashers” star, both intrigued by and invested in the game on screen, mutters a “This is good” before putting his script away and turning the volume up.

Throughout the teaser, Wilson (a real-life soccer fan) attempts to parse the Spanish spoken by the game's commentator, repeating what phrases he can make out to himself. The video ends with Wilson calling someone in his phone labeled “SOFIA :)” before leaving a “To be continued…” promise, pointing to a full commercial coming during Sunday's Super Bowl. 

“I wonder what he said,” Wilson says before picking up his phone. “Sofia, it's Owen. This is a call for help.”

The teaser comes ahead of the launch of the road to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with the international tournament (hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States) set to begin on June 11. Telemundo and Peacock, who will serve as the exclusive Spanish-language home for the World Cup, will release the full commercial starring Wilson during the third quarter of the Super Bowl after Bad Bunny's halftime performance.

Viewers can expect a lot more advertising as the World Cup approaches. In December, NBCUniversal shared that Telemundo had nearly sold out of 2026 FIFA World Cup ads, with 90% of its inventory for the Spanish-language presentation of the tournament sold.

“The growth of soccer in the United States coupled with the domestic nature of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and rising demand for both live sports and Spanish language content has proved to be the winning formula for our company, as NBCUniversal sits in its strongest position ever this far out from a FIFA World Cup tournament,” NBC Sports and Olympics EVP of advertising and partnerships Peter Lazarus said in a statement at the time. “The upcoming competition in Spanish-Language on Telemundo and Peacock, will captivate a highly engaged and passionate audience that our partners are eager to connect with, and we are excited to deliver both brands and fans a world-class experience this summer.”

Michael Carrick has made a significant change to Manchester United's training schedule as he continues to revamp the club's methods after taking over from Ruben Amorim as interim boss at Old Trafford. Carrick has overseen three straight wins at the club since stepping into the dugout.

Carrick has made a significant change to United's post-match training routine, having overseen three wins from three in his time in the Old Trafford dugout. Now, players are allocated a day off immediately after a game, a change from both the methods of Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag, per The Sun. Both of those managers insisted on recovery sessions the day after a game, and players who had not played at least 45 minutes were subjected to a full training session. Carrick has changed that; players are now given the day after a game off, and the recovery session takes place the day after. Carrick has relaxed a number of rules at United, with the players also turning up later to the stadium on a matchday; Ten Hag would have his charges arriving at least four hours prior to kick-off.

Carrick has overseen impressive victories over Manchester City, Arsenal, and Fulham since taking over from Amorim, although he is having to deal with a number of injury problems. Both Mason Mount and Patrick Dorgu are currently battling fitness issues.

On Mount's fitness, Carrick said: "Just took a bit of a knock in training, it is nothing serious, he will be back very very soon."

But on Dorgu, he struck a more sombre note, adding: "Pat, unfortunately, he's going to be out for a period of time. We're still working through how long that's going to be. We weren't sure whether it was a little bit of cramp or whether it was something a little bit more serious and at the moment it looks a little bit more on the serious note."

Carrick admitted the timing is cruel for Dorgu, adding: "So, it'll be a few weeks for that. How many weeks? We'll have to wait and see. That's disappointing for all of us really - and especially for Pat - he's in such a good place, but unfortunately it is part of football."

United's players are clearly buying into Carrick's methods, with the club now sitting fourth in the Premier League table, although they are 12 points behind leaders Arsenal. Nevertheless, defender Harry Maguire, who has appeared reborn under Carrick, has hailed the work of the ex-Middlesbrough boss.

He said: "It was absolutely massive. We know that the first game, the derby at Old Trafford, you're always up for them and you know that one-off results can happen, so we had to back it up today. We spoke about it before the game, coming to the league leaders, who have been excellent this year I must say, they ask a lot of questions of you, to come here and have the setback late on to get the winner, it was a magnificent performance. Michael's [Carrick] come in, he's been brilliant with us, he's brought a fresh energy in, the group's really galvanised. Two tough games, everybody's probably thinks we come away from them with not many points but to win both is magnificent."

United face Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday as they bid to further cement their position in the top four. A win for the Red Devils could move them within two points of third-placed Aston Villa, should other results go their way. Carrick will be out for a fourth-successive victory against a club he used to play for.

Kevin-Prince Boateng has revealed that he “had to lie” about his love for Cristiano Ronaldo in order to become a team-mate of Lionel Messi at Barcelona. The former Ghana international completed a shock move to Camp Nou in 2019. After sealing that switch, it was made clear to him that he was not to speak in glowing terms about CR7 or Clasico rivals Real Madrid.

Boateng found that tough as he was a boyhood Blancos supporter. With colours being nailed to the Santiago Bernabeu mast, Ronaldo - as a five-time Ballon d'Or winner and the club's all-time leading goalscorer - was held up as a source of inspiration.

Back in 2019, though, Catalunya was all about Messi. The Argentine GOAT was very much king at Camp Nou and nobody was allowed to question his authority. Boateng found that out the hard way when being readied for his first press conference.

He told Unscripted by Josh Mansour of the briefing that ruled any Ronaldo fandom out of the equation: “I always said I wanted to play for Real Madrid. I had to lie in a press conference because prior to that, two years before when I played in Las Palmas, they asked me who my favourite player was and I said Cristiano Ronaldo and I said my favourite team was Real Madrid!

“Signing for Barcelona, they said to me ‘your favourite team is Barcelona and the best player in the world is Lionel Messi'. They said ‘you have to otherwise you can't play here, it is impossible'. I sat there in the press conference and the first question was who was the best player in the world and I said ‘Lionel Messi'.”

Boateng's move to Barca only came about after Messi gave a green light to the deal. The South American superstar saw every transfer agreement run by him before everything was signed off.

Boateng, who joined the Blaugrana on loan from Italian outfit Sassuolo, said: “He had that power. I was going to sleep hoping that Leo likes me or sees me in the team. I was like tomorrow I can sign my shirt with Barcelona, but if Leo says ‘no' I will not be going to sign the contract!”

While remaining a big fan of Ronaldo, Boateng admits that witnessing Messi's ability at close quarters left him questioning whether football was still the sport for him. He told DAZN in 2020: “Training with Messi left me speechless. I had always said that Cristiano Ronaldo was the best in the world, but Messi is something else. He's not normal. While training with him, I felt inadequate for the first time in my career. He was doing incredible things. I felt like saying, 'I'm done, I'm going to quit playing!'”

Not everything about Messi was positive, though, with Boateng telling Rio Ferdinand Presents: “So we come in the dressing room, he's just sitting there on his phone [and] gets a massage sitting down. Two minutes before we go out, he just stands up, closes his boots, and goes out. The warm up for the Champions League game against Liverpool, [we did the] crossbar challenge and then he goes back inside. [The] coach made the last adjustment, [Messi] is on the phone face-timing [and] 30 seconds before we go out he just comes and puts his jacket on and BOOM, goal, goal, goal.” 

He added on that approach being detrimental to some of the club's younger stars: “That's what the young players did in Barcelona: Malcom, [Ousmane] Dembele, they looked at him and they didn't train so then going to the game, they got injured. He's the only one in the world that can do that.”

Boateng only made four appearances for Barcelona before returning to Italy. He retired from playing in 2023 having also represented the likes of Tottenham, Portsmouth, AC Milan, Fiorentina, Monza, Eintracht Frankfurt, Herta Berlin and Schalke over the course of a nomadic career.

Tuchel wants warm-up games on 6 and 10 June

Most qualified teams not available on second date

The Football Association is experiencing difficulties in securing suitable opposition for England's World Cup warm-up games owing to their late start to the expanded 48-team tournament.

England open against Croatia on the last day of the first round of games on 17 June, six days after the first match between Mexico and South Africa, and Thomas Tuchel wants final preparation games as close to his team's tournament kick-off as possible.

Tuchel is understood to have requested friendlies near England's pre-tournament training camp in Florida on 6 and 10 June – the night before the World Cup starts – and finding high-calibre opponents for the latter date is proving particularly challenging.

The Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles with the launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!

The head coach would ideally like matches against World Cup sides but Fifa regulations prevent participants from playing friendlies in the final five days before their first game of the tournament. That means only teams playing on 16 and 17 June – who will include two qualifiers from March's intercontinental playoffs – could face England on 10 June.

The FA is in discussions with several national associations and confirmation of England's opponents is expected this month. With its options limited, New Zealand, who have qualified, and Costa Rica, who have not, are understood to be under consideration.

England have been starved of top-class opposition under Tuchel, making the identity of friendly opponents more significant. The highest-ranked opponents England have played under Tuchel have been Senegal, who were 19th when they won 3-1 in Nottingham last summer, and the best team they have beaten according to the Fifa rankings are Wales, who were 30th at the time.

Fifa has relaxed its previous World Cup regulations that banned teams from playing from 48 hours before the start of the tournament, as a result of the expanded draw and elongated opening round. World Cup participants remain prevented from organising friendlies against sides in the same group, although this was never a consideration for England, whose group is completed by Ghana and Panama.

England's late start to the World Cup has left also them facing a congested schedule, with eight games in 33 days if they reach the final, and a large amount of travelling. Their three group matches will take place in an 11-day period.

Tuchel wants to give his players a holiday at the end of the season, which has influenced his request for late friendlies, although anyone involved in the Champions League final on 30 May will be denied a break with the squad due to fly to Florida on 1 June.

England's warm-up games are expected to take place in Orlando and Tampa before they move to Kansas City in advance of the start their tournament.

The FA has announced England will face Uruguay and Japan at Wembley in March in their final matches before Tuchel names his World Cup squad.

New valuation

Chelsea have set a price for Enzo Fernández amid interest from Real Madrid.

World Cup-winning midfielder Enzo Fernández is having a good season in England with Chelsea; the Argentine has scored 11 goals and provided 4 assists from his role as an orchestrating midfielder. This shows that the player is not only important in orchestrating plays but also has the ability to reach the opponent's penalty area

This shows that the player is not only important in orchestrating plays but also has the ability to reach the opponent's penalty area



Flexibility



During his time at Chelsea, Enzo Fernández shifted his position and began playing a bit further forward in midfield under the guidance of Enzo Maresca, the Italian coach with whom Chelsea won the first Club World Cup in history, making the midfielder the only player to have won the highest competitions in world football with his national team and at club level







Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain



Rumors have spread from England of strong interest from Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain in acquiring this player during the next transfer window. Therefore, in light of this situation, Chelsea has set a price on one of its key players, valuing him at between €100 million and €120 million, which would mean that offers for the midfielder will hover around those figures and, if there is competition, could even exceed them. As a player with both offensive and defensive facets, he's a wildcard for any team that wants to acquire him, and he also delivers in terms of goals and contributions during the match.

Crystal Dunn won a World Cup and multiple Olympic medals with the USWNT. Brace Hemmelgarn / Getty Images

Crystal Dunn won a World Cup and multiple Olympic medals with the USWNT. Brace Hemmelgarn / Getty Images

Crystal Dunn is one of the most versatile players in American soccer history. Her career will, and should, be remembered as such.

And yet, as I reflect on the legacy of the 33-year-old New Yorker, whose vast soccer intellect and abundance of fly dance moves saved her teams countless times, I find myself desperate to wedge some distance between Dunn and the word versatile.

It is, of course, a coveted quality in elite sports. The more weapons an athlete can pack in their arsenal, the more difficult it is to beat them. Versatility also widens the door of opportunity in modern soccer, where center backs are expected to capitalize on offensive set pieces, strikers to defend in a high press and fullbacks to be as technically flamboyant as wingers.

But in the context of Black athleticism and Black excellence, versatility carries a different connotation.

A Black soccer player's athletic prowess, combined with a desire to get past doors that have historically and systemically been more narrow for them, can conceal an institution's lack of planning or player development.

U.S. Soccer failed to develop high-caliber, left-footed fullbacks on the women's side for years, and when the 2019 World Cup came around, they didn't have one to call upon. But they did have Dunn, who could do it all, even when she didn't necessarily want to.

As a field player, she found success in every region of the pitch throughout her decorated career. Classified as a midfielder at the University of North Carolina, Dunn was crowned ACC Defender of the Year as a freshman. In 2012, when the Tar Heels were in a pinch as a swath of its roster hobbled back from the U-20 and U-17 World Cups, former head coach Anson Dorrance deployed Dunn to the backline to soften the blow of his thin bench.

Dorrance told ESPN at the time that Dunn “corrected that immediately. But as you can (imagine), at a collegiate level, we waste her at the back. Why would you ever have a player with this extraordinary dribbling ability as your center back?”

In UNC's quarterfinal against BYU that year, Dunn played the No. 10, scored the team's only two goals in the game (including the extra time go-ahead), and preserved their lead with an end-line save off her head in their 2-1 victory. (Dunn's height is somewhere between 5-foot-1 and 5-foot-2, depending on who you ask.) North Carolina went on to win the NCAA championship that year, and Dunn earned the Mac Hermann trophy, awarded to the top college soccer player.

Even then, Dunn was playing out of her preferred role.

“If I had to choose a position, I would definitely choose an outside mid position,” Dunn said back then in the same ESPN story. “I like freedom, and I like to take players on. For me, it fits my personality better because, as an outside mid, you have to worry about attacking and defending as a whole. For me, it's my comfort zone.”

Freedom, comfort, time, and space are luxuries seldom afforded Black people — let alone Black athletes, let alone Black American soccer players. Dunn has been clear about what she wanted for more than a decade. As we celebrate her retirement, we must also consider what the game may have lost because she wasn't always listened to — and what she still managed to accomplish despite that.

When Dunn went pro in 2014, she needed just one season in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) to earn both the Golden Boot and MVP awards. Her 15 goals in 20 regular-season games with the Washington Spirit set a league record at the time, as did the age at which she achieved the feat (23). Yet when then-U.S. women's national team head coach Jill Ellis named her roster for the 2015 World Cup in April of that year, Dunn was not on it. She was the last player to be cut.

The most valuable player in the premier women's professional soccer league in the U.S. did not represent her country at that year's World Cup. That the USWNT won that World Cup campaign is beside the point; an omission like that would simply be unfathomable today. Dunn's brilliance outpaced U.S. Soccer's imagination.

Dunn relocated from the NWSL to the WSL in 2017, joining Chelsea. Emma Hayes, five years into her more than a decade with the club, employed Dunn as a left back. Dunn then returned to the NWSL and her comfort zone at midfield with the NC Courage, winning back-to-back shields and championships with them in 2018 and 2019.

Dunn's star shone too brightly to be overlooked, yet her status on the USWNT was essentially set as a defender.

The 2019 World Cup was a watershed moment in equality for women's soccer as the U.S. women were locked in a legal battle with U.S. Soccer over equal pay during their campaign and still managed to win a fourth title.

From a sporting perspective, however, Dunn was arguably the most vital player on that roster. She played every minute of six of the USWNT's seven matches in that tournament at left back and put on consistent game-saving performances, including a defensive masterclass against hosts France in the quarterfinal.

Back and forth she went over the next few years as a club midfielder and a national team fullback. She earned a bronze medal with the U.S. at the 2021 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and added one more NWSL Championship and shield each to her trophy case with the Portland Thorns in 2022; she subbed on in the final that November, six months after giving birth to her son Marcel.

“Crystal is so special to me. She is, in a lot of ways, like a big sister to me,” said Thorns and USWNT star Sophia Wilson. “I feel like she kind of took me under her wing early on and was someone that I connected with really well.”

After winning Olympic gold as one-third of the iconic “Triple Espresso” alongside Trinity Rodman and Mallory Swanson, Wilson took a year off from soccer to have a baby. She gave birth to her daughter, Gianna, last September, and in December Wilson agreed to a record-setting $1 million option year on her current contract to stay in Portland and play for the Thorns in 2026.

“I saw Crystal go through a lot of things. I saw her have a baby, go through that. I feel like I've known Marcel for his whole life, so she is one of the main reasons I knew that I could do the same thing. I could have a baby and come back and play because I saw Crystal do it, and she's just such an inspiration.”

As the 2023 World Cup approached, the question of Dunn's position on the USWNT naturally resurfaced. In a GQ profile published in February that year, she was open about the emotional toll of her predicament. At a national team camp held shortly after, she remained open about her commitment to transparency.

“It's really important that I'm always going to be my most authentic self,” Dunn said from a national team camp mixed zone in Nashville. “It's not a secret that I've always struggled with identity on the field. It's not to say that I don't tackle and embrace that challenge, but it's not something that is necessarily easy, or something that I absolutely love at all times.”

Her transparency was as much an act of loyalty to her current self as it was a corrective to her younger self.

“I think when I was younger it was easier to say, ‘Oh I'm happy to always play wherever the coach needs me,'” she added. “I think I've embraced my role 100 percent on this team, always competing to be the absolute best outside back I can possibly be. But the reality is I almost sometimes feel like I'm a part-time outside back, and I think that it's important that people know my story.”

Dunn's accomplishments are all the more impressive considering the emotional fatigue she likely endured from not only working in less-than-ideal positions but excelling in them. It also begs the question of what might have been if she hadn't had to endure so much.

Up until her move to Paris-Saint Germain, after her contract with Gotham FC ran short last year, Dunn seemed poised to remain a part of the USWNT project that had since been taken over by Hayes, with whom she already had a relationship from their Chelsea days. In 2024, she played a key role in the U.S.'s Olympic success; Dunn played all but 75 minutes of the tournament. She continued to receive national team call-ups after that, the last being in May 2025 for friendlies against China and Jamaica.

“I was shocked to hear the news,” Washington Spirit and USWNT midfielder Croix Bethune told Soccer Girl Probs in reaction to the announcement. “Like, OK, you're an OG, but, like, girl. You still got it.”

Bethune said she grew closer to Dunn at the 2024 Summer Olympics and valued being able to have “a couple of serious conversations with her just to, like, pick her brain and let her get to know me as well,” in addition to the lighter, goofier moments. “Her retiring, I just feel like isn't right,” Bethune added.

And then there's the word that's impossible to overlook in Dunn's retirement announcement posted on Instagram last week.

“This decision has not come easily, but I am at peace and deeply fulfilled with all that I have accomplished,” she wrote. “I've achieved nearly everything I dreamed of in this sport and gave all I had to give.”

Nearly. It does not negate her plans to spend more time with her family and be a more present mom, as she also wrote, but it also suggests that she is leaving the pitch with unfinished business.

That reality is not unique to the arc of an athlete's career; rarely is there ever a right or satisfying time to retire, but Dunn's contract with PSG was set to run through 2027. The question of how close she was to achieving that “nearly” will linger forever, and for a player of Dunn's expansive skillset, that feels tragic.

Lionel Messi's fiercest rival, Portuguese icon Cristiano Ronaldo, may be spending much of the 2026 World Cup in Messi's backyard.

Well, not exactly his backyard, but somewhere in South Florida, not far from where Messi and his Inter Miami teammates live and train.

The Argentine federation announced on Wednesday that its team will have its World Cup base camp in Kansas City. Meanwhile, indications are that Ronaldo will be in or near Miami.

Two media outlets, the Record in Portugal and O Jornal, a bilingual publication serving the Portuguese-speaking communities of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, reported in the past week that Portugal national team coach Roberto Martinez said Miami was chosen as their World Cup base camp.

“I can't confirm, because FIFA will only confirm it in two weeks, but I can say that our idea is to stay in Florida, in Miami,” Martinez revealed in a Jan. 30 interview at the Portuguese Soccer Congress that was held in the City of Football sports complex, where he was a panelist.

“We have two games in Houston, but in a closed stadium. So, the idea is not to train in Houston, it's to train in the conditions of the third game, which is against Colombia, in Miami. So, it makes sense that our base camp is in Miami and we can go to Houston for the first two games, come back, and work with the conditions of the third game.”

It is unclear if Martinez meant Miami or the Miami area, which would include Broward and Palm Beach Counties.

Considerations for base camps include proximity/easy travel to and from game sites, distance from the airport, privacy, security, quality of training fields and fitness equipment, accommodations for fans and media, and recreational opportunities.

Curacao, the smallest country to qualify for the World Cup, will be based in Boca Raton and train at Florida Atlantic University.

A facility that might attract a team like Portugal is the Gardens North County District Park in Palm Beach Gardens, which is where Real Madrid trained during the 2025 Club World Cup. It has 10 lighted grass fields that were built to FIFA regulations and plenty of posh lodging options nearby.

Another option would be Beyond Bancard Field, on the campus of Nova Southeastern University in Davie, at the site of the former Miami Dolphins training facility. The $7 million, 7,500-seat soccer specific stadium is the home of Fort Lauderdale United, the women's professional USL team.

The Nova complex includes seven fields (most of them natural grass), locker rooms, film rooms, training rooms, gym and a boot room. Among the teams that have trained there are Egyptian club team Al Ahly, the Vancouver Whitecaps, the men's national teams of Trinidad and Tobago and Puerto Rico, and the women's national teams of Argentina and Colombia.

A source with knowledge of the World Cup team site visits said England, Netherlands, Scotland and Ecuador had inquired about the Nova facilities and that Beyond Bancard Field could host training for Portugal or Colombia on the eve of their June 27 match at Hard Rock Stadium.

Another obvious site for a World Cup base camp is Inter Miami's state-of-the-art Florida Blue Training Center, a 50,000-square-foot facility in Fort Lauderdale, adjacent to Chase Stadium. It cost $60 million and the 30-acre complex features seven professional fields (six natural grass, one turf). It has locker rooms, recovery areas with hydrotherapy pools and an underwater treadmill, a player lounge, a kitchen, and office space.

Several national teams and club teams have used Inter Miami's training grounds over the years, including Argentina, FC Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund, but it seems unlikely Ronaldo's team would wind up in Messi's home.

Barry University in Miami Shores has a rich soccer history, having hosted the U.S. national team and most recently Boca Juniors and Chelsea during the 2025 Club World Cup. But, Barry's athletic facilities are undergoing extensive renovations as part of a joint project with Miami Country Day School, so the soccer fields will not be available until Fall.

Manchester City trained at Lynn University of Boca Raton. FIU is another local college campus with strong soccer history that could land a World Cup team for training this summer.

Portugal is in Group K and opens the World Cup against the winner of the Inter-confederation playoff (New Caledonia, Jamaica, Congo) on June 17 in Houston. Then, on June 23, they are back in Houston for a match against Uzbekistan.

On June 27, Ronaldo and Portugal will face Colombia in a highly anticipated and high-priced 7:30 p.m. match at Hard Rock Stadium (renamed Miami Stadium during the tournament).

That game is the most sought-after group stage ticket in the entire tournament with resale tickets going from $1,800 to $80,000 for a VIP suite. It is a hot ticket because global superstar Ronaldo, who turned 41 on Thursday, has 668 million Instagram followers, is captain of the Portuguese team and has said this World Cup will be his last.

Also, Colombia's national team, nicknamed “Los Cafeteros” (the coffee makers) has an extremely passionate following and South Florida is home to nearly 240,000 Colombians.

Sometime in the next few weeks, FIFA is expected to announce the 48 team base camps. Among the teams whose camps have already been made public: South Korea (Guadalajara, Mexico), Germany (Winston-Salem, North Carolina, training at Wake Forest University), Spain (Chattanooga, Tennessee, training at Baylor School), Uruguay (Playa del Carmen, Mexico), France (Boston, training at Babson College), Colombia (Guadalajara, Mexico), and Croatia (Alexandria, Virginia, training at Episcopal High School).

Gabi Zanotti was a standout for Corinthians at the women's Club World Cup, striking the semi-final winner against Gotham FC and cancelling out Arsenal's 1-0 lead in the final.

According to Meu Timao, her semi-final goal took her to two goals against United States clubs for Corinthians, more than her tallies versus Uruguayan, Bolivian and Colombian sides, one each.

It is a quirky split given Corinthians have faced United States opposition only twice, and she scored in both. Beyond Gotham, she found the net against Kansas City Current in the 2025 Teal Rising Cup final, which the Brabas lost 2-1.

Her strike against Arsenal marked her first for Corinthians against a team from outside the Americas. It also refreshed her list of international victims by country.

That list now reads: Argentina four, Paraguay three, Venezuela and Ecuador two apiece, United States two, and single goals against England, Uruguay, Bolivia and Colombia.

With Zanotti available, Corinthians have another final this weekend, facing Palmeiras at Arena Barueri on Saturday at 16:00 in the Supercopa do Brasil.

This story was updated at 11:30 a.m. on Feb. 5 to include a statement from Gov. Maura Healey.

Foxborough officials said Wednesday they're willing to try to stand in the way of Gillette Stadium hosting 2026 World Cup soccer games this summer if security funding issues aren't resolved in the next few weeks. 

Select Board Chair Bill Yukna said town officials will not grant the entertainment license necessary for the matches to be played in Foxborough until the parties involved figure out who will pay the event's estimated $7.7 million in security costs up front. 

Seven World Cup matches are planned this summer for Gillette Stadium, which will be known as Boston Stadium, for the tournament. 

The approximately $7.7 million is needed for security across 39 days, town officials told MassLive on Wednesday, and would be used to cover associated costs for security, medical and communication to host the international sporting event.

While the town may eventually receive federal grant money allocated for this purpose, it would first have to foot the bill and get reimbursed later. 

“The town is going to stand behind the request of the $7.7 million for both manpower and some capital and expense items. And if they aren't met, then as this board has discussed in the past, the license won't be granted. We are going to be very clear with that,” Yukna said at a Foxborough Select Board meeting Tuesday night.

Foxborough Town Manager Paige Duncan said the town does not have enough money in its accounts to cover such a price tag, and Yukna emphasized the need to protect taxpayer dollars. 

“We've never believed that we were supposed to come up with the money,” he said. 

Foxborough town officials are currently looking to the Kraft Group or FIFA to foot the bill for security costs, but nothing has been decided. The entertainment license must be granted by March 17.

Asked to respond to reports of the Foxborough Select Board's concerns, Julie Duffy, the chief marketing and communications officer of FIFA World Cup Boston, issued a brief statement from the Super Bowl, where World Cup officials are promoting this summer's event.

“We are working closely with FIFA, the stadium, and the town of Foxboro to reach an agreement,” Duffy said. 

The Kraft Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday evening. 

Still, Duncan said she is confident the World Cup matches scheduled to take place in Foxborough this summer will go forward as planned. The town is “thrilled” to host the event, even as a funding source for the security costs remain unclear, she said.

“I actually don't think that the World Cup isn't going to happen. I think (FIFA's) gonna have to find a way to resolve all these issues because they need this event to happen,” she said. 

Up until November 2025, Foxborough officials were under the impression the Kraft Group would foot the bill for police details and other security costs during the World Cup as it does for New England Patriots games and other events at Gillette, Yukna said. 

After discovering this was not the plan — and that neither FIFA nor the Boston Host Committee were set to pay for security costs either — the town of Foxborough applied for the FEMA-funded FIFA World Cup Grant Program. The grant was part of President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill and is designated to be used on security costs for the tournament. 

Massachusetts is slated to get $47 million from the grant, but municipalities such as Boston and organizations such as the MBTA are competing with Foxborough for money, Yukna said. 

The Select Board chair was unsure which state agency will decide how the grant money is allocated, but Foxborough was supposed to find out whether it was approved for the $7.7 million on Jan. 30 and did not. 

Karissa Hand, a spokesperson for Gov. Maura Healey, said the state is working to ensure the success of the World Cup.

“This will have major economic benefits for our businesses and our state,” Hand said. “We are committed to ensuring that municipalities, especially Foxborough, have the support they need to make this a successful event through state, federal and private funds.”

Healey's office is evaluating the need for other funding sources, though they expect to see funds coming in from the federal government soon, Hand said.

Duncan said she was doubtful the town would be reimbursed for the full security costs even if they are awarded the grant, but she did not specify why.

Yukna expressed pessimism about whether the issues around the security funding could be resolved in the next month or so. The March 17 deadline would only give the town 90 days to complete all the planning involved for an event of this scale, he said.

Yukna described his confidence level surrounding resolving the security funding issue as “low” on Wednesday. 

“I do hope that they take us seriously. That's why we had to resort to deadline on getting an application submitted to us and now a deadline on getting it finalized,” he said.

FIFA has so far submitted a license application, but not all the details have been agreed upon or finalized, town officials said. 

There are 11 U.S. cities hosting World Cup matches. While there are no games taking place in Boston, it will be involved in related events. Five more matches will be hosted in Canada (3) and Mexico (2). 

The other U.S. host cities are Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Even leaders of larger communities are expressing concerns about the costs associated with hosting the World Cup. 

“There's a little bit coming in, but certainly there is not enough to cover our cost,” said Lisa Gillmor, mayor of the Bay Area city of Santa Clara, California, where six matches will be played, according to Politico. “It's a tall task to take on.”

Houston and Dallas are pulling tens of millions from Texas' Major Events Reimbursement Program Fund, Politico reported. Kansas' Wyandotte County, where Kansas City is located, is considering a new hotel tax. 

In November, Massachusetts lawmakers approved $10 million in a $2.31 billion year-end budget that Gov. Maura Healey signed into law — only half of what the governor had requested.

Ekaterina Alexandrova ended Alexandra Eala's run at the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Open in straight sets in the quarterfinals, while Sara Bejlek delivered a flawless performance to reach her first tour-level semifinal.

No. 2 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova was well-prepared for the challenge that Alexandra Eala -- and the fervent Filipino diaspora crowd -- would pose in the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Open quarterfinals. It showed, as she notched a 6-3, 6-3 win in 1 hour and 30 minutes to reach her first semifinal of 2026.

"I saw the last match," Alexandrova said in her on-court interview, referring to Eala's remarkable comeback from 4-0 down in the third set -- saving a match point -- the previous day against Aliaksandra Sasnovich.

"She was fighting 'til the end. I knew it was going to be difficult but I think the atmosphere was amazing today -- the crowd, I know they were cheering for her but I think the atmosphere was great. So I enjoyed my time on the court, and I'm happy I could finish in two sets because it was really difficult in the end."

Despite the scoreline, the contest remained tense throughout, largely owing to Alexandrova playing her best tennis to gain a lead, but Eala playing her best tennis with her back to the wall. Alexandrova's superior firepower -- she struck 33 winners to Eala's 15 -- enabled her to break first in both sets. But both times, Eala upped her intensity whenever she was behind, searching for a potential turning point.

Alexandrova did well to avoid that happening and to keep her nose in front. The gulf in quality between the two players' serves was crucial -- despite landing 70% of her first serves, Eala won just 45% of those points (fewer than the 53% she won behind her second delivery). Alexandrova, by contrast, won 70% of her first-serve points. Consequently, for all Eala's fighting spirit off the ground, the ability to find a winning serve or return was always in the 31-year-old's pocket.

That proved to be the case in the final game of the first set, in which Alexandrova saved four break points before converting her first set point with a simple one-two punch. At 3-3 in the second set, having had her lead pegged back, Alexandrova again found a returning level that was too hot for Eala to handle.

"I was trying to remind myself, 'You need to play until the last point,'" Alexandrova said. "I was trying to keep my focus on that -- I think that really helped me. Not thinking about the outcome but more about the process."

Earlier, an all-qualifier quarterfinal saw 20-year-old Sara Bejlek deliver a flawless performance to defeat Sonay Kartal 6-0, 6-2 in just 63 minutes and advance to her first semifinal on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz.

The Czech won the first 10 games of the match by mixing up superb down-the-line redirects with deft drop shots, and held her nerve after Kartal got a brief foothold in the second set by extending the rallies. Bejlek will play Clara Tauson in the semifinals after the No. 3 seed came through 6-3, 6-4 over McCartney Kessler.

Oleksandra Oliynykova continued her fairytale run at the Transylvania Open on Thursday, stunning No. 4 seed Wang Xinyu, 6-4, 6-4, to reach her first WTA semifinal.The Ukranian refugee won her first WTA match in Cluj-Napoca earlier this week and has only looked stronger since then, saving 20 of 22 break points to secure another career milestone in two hours and one minute on Center Court.“I'm so happy,” an overcome Oliynykova said in her on-court interview, draped in the Ukrainian flag. “For me now, it's hard to describe what I feel. But for me, it's so important to be here, to play for my country and to feel so much support. I'm really thankful to all the people here and I really hope to see you in the semifinals.“I have so many emotions I forgot how to speak!” she added with a laugh.

The 25-year-old has been one of the breakout stories of the 2026 season, serving notice in her Grand Slam debut by pushing defending champion Madison Keys to a first-set tiebreaker at the Australian Open. A visually striking player with an unorthodox game, the tattooed Oliynykova debuted temporary face tattoos in the shape of small bats, in honor of the spooky-themed Transylvanian tournament.“It's kind of a celebration of the game for me,” said the 91st-ranked Oliynykova, who is projected to move up 20 spots in the WTA rankings because of this result. “When I was at the US Open, I saw these randomly in some store and I got the idea to put these on for the match. For this tournament, it's special because it's thematic and it was my dream to play her. I signed up for this tournament the last year but I didn't even enter to qualies! For me, it means a lot to play here because of the tournament itself.”Oliynykova, who goes by “Sashka,” has made the most of this new spotlight to speak out on behalf of Ukraine, which has been under siege from Russian and Belarusian aggression since 2022. She wore a pro-Ukraine shirt to her Australian Open press conference and refused to shake the hand of opponent Anna Bondar after her second-round win in Cluj-Napoca, citing Bondar's participation in a Russian government-sanctioned exhibition tournament in 2022.

“I'm coming from a country where there is war and you don't know what tomorrow is going to bring. For me, it's so important during such hard times in my country, I learned to enjoy every moment, every moment of tennis. In some way, I really celebrate the game. I'm doing this for sport, for tennis.“I think the key, not only today but in general with the progress I've made, it's tough for me that it be important whether I win or lose. I'm happy to win, of course, and it means a lot, but it's not the most important thing. I learned to be in the moment and this is probably how I'm making it during this season and the previous season, which was super successful for me.”Standing between Oliynykova and a first WTA final will be the winner of the quarterfinal match between 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu and Polish qualifier Maja Chwalińska.

Rafa running routes? Ben or Coco as QB1? With the Super Bowl this Sunday, the panel gives their thoughts.

WATCH: Which tennis players could be NFL stars?With an historic Australian Open behind us, Coco Vandeweghe, Brad Gilbert and special guest Danielle Collins sat down for a proper debrief. After any long trip, there's always a lot to unpack. What did we learn from the season's first Slam? What's next for the champions, the runners-up, and the new stars we discovered? And who should be concerned, already, about their performance?Such wide-ranging questions demand a thorough conversation. The Big T has it covered:🧳 Does Sabalenka have a finals problem?Earlier this week on TENNIS.com, Peter Bodo dug into what's become a troubling trend for Aryna Sabalenka: her record in Grand Slam finals. It fell to 4-4 after her loss to Elena Rybakina. And while Sabalenka's record in WTA 1000 finals is a strong 9-4, she's a surprisingly modest 22-20 in all finals played.“Over the last 16 majors, she has been by far the best player—for the first 11, 12 days,” said Gilbert, former coach of Coco Gauff (who handed Sabalenka one of those major final defeats). “But [in finals], she doesn't seem to play her best tennis, and she's lost some leads now.”All four of Sabalenka's losses in Slam finals came in three sets. Against Rybakina in Melbourne, she rallied from a set down to force a decider, but would squander a 3-0 lead.Instead of having four majors, she might have seven or eight. Brad Gilbert on Aryna Sabalenka“I think she should have that many,” replied Vandeweghe—who then raised a point that Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley proposed: that from the quarterfinals on, both men and women should play best-of-five set matches.WATCH ON THE TENNIS CHANNEL APP: Behind the Scenes with Craig Tiley

As Steve Tignor put it in his review of the men's semis Down Under, “You can't say Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic didn't earn their way through their semifinals. Both of them pulled off minor miracles to make it to Sunday.”Miraculous play is generally required to defeat Jannik Sinner these days—the Italian went a combined 131-12 in 2024 and 2025. But the 38-year-old Serbian turned back the clock with a performance that left nearly everyone (maybe except Djokovic himself) astonished.How far back?I thought he was playing Pete Sampras-like. Brad Gilbert on Novak DjokovicBG also dropped some surprising Sinner stats—beyond him going 2 for 18 on break points against Djokovic:He's 6-11 in matches that go five setsHe's 0-9 in matches that go longer than three hours and 50 minutesThe other semifinal, featuring eventual champion Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev, also went the distance. But there was another takeaway: it featured a suspect medical timeout, granted Alcaraz under the thought that it was to treat an injury. Turns out, it was cramping.Pickle juice, and controversy, ensued.READ MORE: “This is bulls---": Zverev fumes about, then accepts, Alcaraz cramp drama at Australian Open

What would your reaction to it be, Collins asked Vandeweghe, if you were playing?“I have a two-part answer to that,” she said. “One, I would have absolutely taken every ability to get into a Grand Slam final. So I would have done what Carlos did.”But, “also, for Zverev, I would have absolutely called him out.”You would have went full Karen on him? Danielle Collins to Coco VandewegheVandeweghe: “I would have absolutely lost my gosh darn mind.”Despite Zverev serving for the match, Alcaraz would go on to prevail in the dramatic classic, 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-7 (3), 6-7 (4), 7-5.

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

Lewis Hamilton was in high spirits at the end of a positive Barcelona Shakedown week for Ferrari.

Lewis Hamilton has spoken about an “incredibly enthusiastic” mood at Ferrari in the build-up to the 2026 season, with the seven-time World Champion feeling a “winning mentality in every single person more than ever”.

Hamilton and Ferrari enjoyed a solid start to F1's new era of regulations at last week's Barcelona Shakedown – the famous Italian marque working through their programme without major issues and learning plenty about the SF-26 package.

Sharing his reflections afterwards, Hamilton said: “It's been a really enjoyable week, honestly. I think a huge amount of work over the winter, on my personal side, but what the team have done over the winter to make changes going into the test.

“To see the mileage that we've been able to get the last couple of days due to just so much great work from all the people back at the factory, which I'm really grateful for because having consistency, not having problems…

“Of course, there's always small things, but we didn't really have any downtime moments. I'm sure they could potentially come over the next weeks, but otherwise just a really, really solid couple of days.

“We definitely have work to do to improve, of course, like everybody does, but I think we've had great debriefs, everyone's really on it – I really feel the winning mentality in every single person in the team more than ever, so it's a positive.”

Hamilton, who endured a difficult first season at Ferrari, went on to ponder what might lie ahead for himself and the team in 2026 – the Briton pointing out that the latest generation of F1 car “is actually a little bit more fun to drive”.

“Everyone's positive and incredibly enthusiastic,” he made clear. “I mean, we're under no illusions. We know we've got work to do. Mercedes have done great running as well. I think Red Bull and Haas did some great running as well, so we don't really know where we are, but I think it's a solid first week and we can really build from here.

“There may be some big leaps that we're going to need to take, and development's going to be key. Just really making sure we leave no stone unturned, and we're just really clear and concise with our communication and the decisions we take.

“It's going to take all of us to be at our best. I'm just seeing that everyone's really coming with new energy this year, which is great.”

Hamilton and the rest of the F1 field will be back in action in Bahrain next week, as the first of two official pre-season tests gets under way.

Of the 90-plus films and episodic series premiering at the Sundance Film Festival in 2026, only about a dozen are arriving at the festival with distribution in hand. Many will be looking for homes, but if this year is anything like last year, it may take some time for those sales to close. We'll be tracking all of them as they come in.

Section: PremieresDistributor: AppleDirectors: Amir Bar-LevDate Acquired: Feb. 5Buzz: In terms of pure visceral thrills, it's hard to beat a good mountain climbing documentary. That's the bet Apple made when it acquired “The Last First: Winter K2,” which also explores the corrosive affect that influencer culture has had on the world of mountain climbing. Bar-Lev has an extensive track record of delivering documentary hits about a wide range of topics, so the tech giant is likely hoping that it has the next “Free Solo” on its hands.

Section: PremieresDistributor: NeonDirectors: William and David GreavesDate Acquired: Feb. 5Buzz: Few nonfiction films at Sundance generated more buzz than “Once Upon a Time in Harlem,” William Greaves' posthumous collection of conversations from a 1974 cocktail party of Harlem Renaissance luminaries that was assembled by his son David. The film is a vital historical artifact, and the fact that it hails from a legendary documentarian only adds to its prestige. Watch out for this one come Oscar season.

Section: U.S. Dramatic CompetitionDistributor: Sony Pictures ClassicsDirectors: Stephanie AhnDate Acquired: Jan. 30Buzz: In its second acquisition in two days, Sony Pictures Classics picked up another set of worldwide rights to yet another U.S. Dramatic Competition title. “Bedford Park” is also the directorial debut of Ahn, and it's a drama about a woman (Moon Choi) struggling between her loyalty to her Korean immigrant family and her own American identity, as a child raised in New Jersey.  When her mother gets into a car accident, it leads to a fateful meeting with Eli (Son Sukku), an ex-wrestler battling his own fractured past. 

 










In addition to Sukku being the host of IndieWire's final Chili Party in Park City, IndieWire's review praised the film for being rich in detail rather than sacrificing specificity for a simple love story.

Section: U.S. Dramatic CompetitionDistributor: Sony Pictures ClassicsDirectors: Josef Kubota WladykaDate Acquired: Jan. 29 Buzz: One of the buzzier competition titles at Sundance not because of its star power but because of its playful title and crowd pleasing sentiment, one that earned a standing ovation for director Josef Kubota Wladyka and his mother on whom the film is based, the real Ha-Chan. Shot in Japan, Rinko Kikuchi stars in “Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!” as a woman who leaves the Japanese ballroom dance scene after tragedy strikes, only to be lured back onto the dance floor after developing an infatuation for a new instructor. SPC picked up the worldwide rights to the film. It also stars Alberto Guerra, Alejandro Edda, Yoh Yoshida, and Damián Alcázar.

Section: PremieresDistributor: A24Directors: Olivia WildeDate Acquired: Jan. 27 Buzz: This was a true, old-fashioned, late night bidding war between multiple interested buyers that ended up being a 72-hour, marathon competition. IndieWire hears that Neon, Black Bear, Netflix, Searchlight, and Focus Features — and even Warner Bros. at the 11th hour — were all in the mix for what was Olivia Wilde's third feature as a director. We're also hearing that the final bidding got into the 8-figure range. Others may have bid more, but Wilde was determined to get a theatrical deal. And it's fitting too, because this was one of the starrier movies at the festival with Wilde, Seth Rogen, Edward Norton, and Penélope Cruz all leading the ensemble cast. “The Invite” quite simply is about the dinner party from hell when a couple whose marriage is on the brink have dinner with another couple that's polyamorous, but the crowds that saw it say there's a lot more layers to this one than just that. Will McCormack and Rashida Jones wrote the screenplay based on a 2019 Spanish film called “Sentimental.” UTA Independent Film Group and FilmNation co-repped the sale, and the film hails from Megan Ellison and Annapurna, who also previously produced Wilde's debut film “Booksmart.”

 










Section: MidnightDistributor: NeonDirector: Adrian ChiarellaDate Acquired: Jan. 27 Buzz: A queer, coming-of-age horror movie? “Leviticus” is about two teenage boys who have to fight off a violent entity capable of taking the form of the other. The film plays on the real-life horrors of conversion therapy and stars Joe Bird, Stacy Clausen, Jeremy Blewitt, Ewen Leslie, Davida McKenzie, Nicholas Hope, Zahra Newman, and Mia Wasikowska. The film's unique genre premise from writer/director Adrian Chiarella, his feature debut, was good enough for Neon to jump on worldwide rights in a seven-figure deal, as well as the first sale of the festival, an otherwise slow affair thus far, though one that has sparked an early bidding war for at least one other title. “Leviticus” will be released later this year and is actually Neon's second deal for a horror movie out of the festival, as the distributor also over the weekend joined the next film from “It Ends” director Alex Ullom.

Section: PremieresDistributor: Focus FeaturesDirectors: Daniel Roher and Charlie TyrellBuzz: The “Navalny” director teams up with producer Daniel Kwan (“Everything Everywhere All At Once”) on a film that goes deep into the perils and promise of artificial intelligence, all through the lens of Roher debating whether this is a good moment to bring a child into the world.

 










Section: PremieresDistributor: ESPNDirector: Alexandria StapletonBuzz: The director of “Sean Combs: The Reckoning” sits down with Brittany Griner, the basketball star who was famously detained and became the subject of a media and political frenzy as she hoped to secure her freedom. 

Section: PremieresDistributor: ESPNDirectors: Liz Garbus and Elizabeth WolffBuzz: More than a sports doc, this portrait of Billie Jean King looks at the tennis icon's compulsion to hide her sexual orientation and eating disorders.

Section: PremieresDistributor: Searchlight PicturesDirector: Andrew StantonBuzz: Though he's directed plenty on TV, Pixar vet Andrew Stanton is returning to a live-action feature for the first time since “John Carter” dropped way back in 2012. “In the Blink of an Eye” is a triptych set in ancient times, modern day, and in the distant future, exploring how those three eras are connected by hope and the circle of life.

Section: PremieresDistributor: A24Director: Aidan ZamiriBuzz: One of three films starring Charli XCX at the festival, the “brat” pop star plays a version of herself in an exaggerated mockumentary that comments on the idea of modern celebrity. 

 










Section: World DocumentaryDistributor: PBS/FrontlineDirectors: Itab Azzam, Jack MacInnesBuzz: This documentary was filmed over 10 years and follows a Syrian refugee girl who travels to Germany and then back to Syria with her family.

Section: PremieresDistributor: NetflixDirector: Rory KennedyBuzz: Perhaps a documentary for “The Queen's Gambit” fans, this film follows a girl from Hungary who is a chess prodigy trying to break into a male-dominated competition circuit. 

Section: MidnightDistributor: ShudderDirector: Natalie Erika JamesBuzz: Shudder picked up this body horror film from the “Relic” director just before the festival. It stars Midori Francis as a woman who takes part in a bizarre weight loss craze that involves eating human ashes, only to become possessed by demonic forces in the process. 

Section: NEXTDistributor: Latino Public Broadcasting and ITVSDirector: William D. CaballeroBuzz: This animated film that combines a variety of styles, including 2D, 3D, and live-action, is a deeply personal autobiographical documentary from mixed media filmmaker Caballero, who looks back on his career and examines grief through the lens of his Puerto Rican family in North Carolina. Theatrical rights are still available. 

 










Section: PremieresDistributor: Nat GeoDirector: Sara DosaBuzz: Like her Sundance breakout “Fire of Love” before it, “Time and Water” is a more elevated nature documentary and follows an Icelandic writer eulogizing both a glacier and his grandparents.

Section: MidnightDistributor: A24Director: Ian TuasonBuzz: A micro-budget horror movie in the vein of “Paranormal Activity” that first played at Fantasia Fest, the actual producers of “Paranormal Activity” helped give the film a new cut and are hoping for another horror hit.

The Academy has officially gotten back into the content game, with the new initiative led by a familiar face. Jennifer Davidson, who has been at the organization since 2019, and been its communications chief since 2021, has been promoted to the newly expanded role of Chief Marketing, Communications, and Content Officer for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Part of her new responsibilities will be leading the newly established production arm, Academy Studios, which is responsible for organization-wide digital projects and initiatives — from member and industry interviews, videos, livestreams, and podcasts — “that embody the Academy's mission, voice and cultural identity.”

This new development, shared by Academy CEO Bill Kramer, who Davidson will continue to report to, comes on the heels of the Academy announcing that the Oscars are moving to YouTube in 2029. That news came with the implication that the Academy would be expanding its presence on the platform, including giving audiences more access to its private events like the Governors Awards and Oscars Nominees Luncheon.

While this new Academy Studios initiative seems more focused on video, the Academy did recently try its hand at a formal content hub with the digital magazine A.frame, which shuttered in July 2024. Since then, the Academy has continued to produce and publish videos that were mostly distributed via its social channels instead.

In addition to calling the newly promoted Davidson “a dynamic, forward-thinking leader for the Academy,” Kramer, also speaking to the establishment of their new content studio, said that “as we evolve the Academy to reach a larger and more global audience, we are thrilled to elevate her to this vital new role. Jen's creative vision, along with the development of our new Academy Studios production team, will allow us to celebrate filmmakers and filmmaking on a greater scale, discover new ways to showcase our talented members, and continue to promote the exceptional work of our Academy Museum and Academy Collection. Our goal is to highlight to the broadest worldwide audience everything we do year-round.” 

“In this new role, I'm excited to adopt innovative strategies that can celebrate both our industry's greatest storytellers and the remarkable work they've created across disciplines,” said Davidson, who currently oversees marketing and audience development, communications, digital/social and creative brand strategy for all arms of the Academy, including the Academy Foundation, the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures and the Oscars. “The establishment of Academy Studios allows us to preserve film's rich history for future generations, while creating fresh and exciting ways to engage new audiences around cinema. I am thrilled about the opportunity to honor our past while elevating our future.”

EXCLUSIVE: Lisa, the Thai rapper, singer, dancer and actor of Blackpink fame, who's coming off her acting debut in The White Lotus Season 3, is set to reteam with the series' executive producer David Bernad on a new romantic comedy for Netflix, penned by Set It Up‘s Katie Silberman.


	The official logline is under wraps, but sources close to the project said Bernad and Lisa developed the premise on the set of The White Lotus, after bonding over their shared appreciation for Notting Hill, the classic 1999 romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Shortly after, they tapped Silberman, the in-demand comedy writer behind Set it Up and Booksmart, to write the script.

	Bernad will produce through his Middle Child Productions banner, alongside Silberman, who has an exclusive, multi-year creative partnership with the streamer. Alice Kang and Lisa will exec produce.

	Lisa comes to the project amid work on her first major film role in TYGO, a new chapter of Netflix's Extraction universe. 


	Rising to fame as a member of South Korea's Blackpink, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time, Lisa made her solo debut in 2021 with the single album LALISA. She released her debut solo album, Alter Ego, last February, seeing it debut at number seven on the Billboard 200 chart and hit number one on the Billboard Top Album Sales chart. 


	The artist also made her Coachella debut last year, after making her screen debut as Mook, the wellness professional love interest of Tayme Thapthimthong's non-violent Buddhist security guard Gaitok, in The White Lotus Season 3. She is represented by WME, LLOUD and JSSK.

	











	Silberman is known for writing Netflix's Set It Up, one of Netflix's most watched romantic comedies, starring Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell. Additionally, she co-wrote and produced Olivia Wilde's Booksmart, which received WGA and BAFTA nominations for Best Original Screenplay. She is repped by CAA, 42, and Myman Greenspan.


	An Emmy, Golden Globe, Peabody, and PGA-winning producer, Bernad's Middle Child is currently prepping the France-set fourth season of The White Lotus, with the second season of its Emmy-nominated series Jury Duty and Little Brother, a Netflix comedy starring John Cena and Eric André, in post. He is repped by CAA and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern.

Cinema United, the trade org for exhibition, has made public its remarks about the pending Netflix–Warner Bros merger to the Senate antitrust subcommittee, saying, “If Netflix succeeds in acquiring Warner Bros., the results will be economically and culturally catastrophic: fewer theatres, shorter windows, less revenue, fewer jobs across the national and global entertainment industry, and fewer movies for consumers to see in theatres.”


	Cinema United, previously known as National Association of Theatre Owners, submitted a six-page written testimony to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy & Consumer Rights on Tuesday.

	











	While Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told lawmakers on the record the streamer is about a 45-day exclusive theatrical window for movies, many rival studio sources have questioned the streaming boss' intent. If Sarandos is thinking a 45-day window to streaming, that's still rather destructive to the business. When distributors talk about a 45-day window, they mean 45 days until PVOD or sell-through digital — a window that precedes the streaming window. Streaming windows generally are around 90-100 days or more after a movie bows in cinemas.

	In the statement, Cinema United advocated: “We are deeply concerned that this acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix will have a direct and irreversible negative impact on movie theatres around the world. Such an acquisition will further consolidate control over production and distribution of motion pictures in the hands of a single, dominant, global streaming platform in a market that is already highly concentrated. The impact will not only be felt by theatre owners, but by movie fans and surrounding businesses in communities of all sizes.”The trade group extended its concerns of the proposed Warner Bros. merger beyond Netflix, adding: “If Paramount or another major studio ends up displacing Netflix as the buyer, our concerns are no less serious. A combination of Paramount and Warner Bros., for instance, would consolidate as much as 40% of each year's domestic box office in the hands of a single dominant studio.”

	











RELATED: List Of Hollywood & Media Layoffs From Paramount To Warner Bros Discovery To CNN & More“The key to a successful industry overall is having a diverse, robust, and consistent product pipeline that responds to consumer demand. The number of films being produced for theatrical exhibition is slowly returning to pre-2019 levels. However, that growth is threatened by further consolidation. At best, an acquisition of Warner Bros. will stall the growth we have seen in the last four years. More realistically, however, it will result in a significant reduction of theatrical releases,” the Michael O'Leary led cinema org explained. The statement summed up, “We must heed the lessons of the past: further industry consolidation has consistently led to fewer movies being made, and there is no reason whatsoever to believe the outcome here would be any different, particularly given Netflix's stated views of movie theatres over the past decade-plus.”


	Cinema United reps more than 31,000 movie screens across all 50 states and over 30,000 additional screens in 80 countries worldwide.

The theater business is dying and it's not because of this merger.

Neither Paramount nor Netflix can control the awfulness of the current moviegoing experience. Society has deteriorated and now it is just people nonstop on their phone and talking and being obnoxious with zero ramifications.

Paramount would be worse. WB is complimentary to Netflix's streaming business. They want to put movies in theaters. Theater owners need to chill out.

Theater owners need to make the theater going experience better before they keep complaining about everything that happens in the movie business, as per usual for them. Bring back ushers to force people to behave during movies. No phones, no talking, and no bloody children running around or crying. Then people might want to come back to the theaters again.

EXCLUSIVE: Thor and Mad Max star Chris Hemsworth is joining Taron Egerton and Zazie Beetz in New York crime pic Kockroach, from producer Andrew Lazar (American Sniper).


	Hemsworth takes over in the movie from fellow A-lister Channing Tatum who we're told has had to step away due to scheduling conflicts.


	Filming is being lined up for April on the movie, which Lazar has described as in the vein of Goodfellas and Scarface. The synopsis reads: “Kockroach is the story of a mysterious stranger who takes on New York's criminal underworld, transforming himself into a larger-than-life crime boss in a city where power is everything.”

Call it the product of some awards season burnout and the residual impact of an exhausting Sundance, but we're starting to get pretty excited about the possibilities of a good, old-fashioned horror movie. With fun! And sisters! And David Cronenberg in an acting role!

Following their 2019 hit, directing duo Radio Silence (aka Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett) and their Final Girl for the ages, Samara Weaving, are back for “Ready or Not 2: Here I Come.” Familiarity with the original film is a must for this one, as it picks up immediately after the events of “Ready or Not,” in which blushing bride Grace (Weaving) was shocked to discover she had married into a murderous family that loved nothing more than playing deadly games around their sprawling mansion. Poor Grace, she had no idea what the hell she got into when she picked “Hide and Seek” on her wedding night.

 








Related Stories Tracy Letts Hosts a Very Uncomfortable Family Meal with Elle Fanning and Jamie Bell in First ‘Rosebush Pruning' Clip — Watch Madelaine Petsch Stands by ‘The Strangers' Spinoff Needing Three Films to Feel Complete 

But, crucially, Grace did get out of all that (too bad it involved the death of her husband and all her in-laws), and so you can imagine she felt pretty good when it was all over. Alas, with the advent of a sequel, it's clear none of this is actually over. 

Here's the official synopsis courtesy of Searchlight Pictures: “Moments after surviving an all-out attack from the Le Domas family, Grace (Samara Weaving) discovers she's reached the next level of the nightmarish game — and this time with her estranged sister Faith (Kathryn Newton) at her side. Grace has one chance to survive, keep her sister alive, and claim the High Seat of the Council that controls the world. Four rival families are hunting her for the throne, and whoever wins rules it all.”

 










In the film's latest trailer, we get a better sense of the rules of the game and what the prize is: nothing less than world domination. Neat! Along the way, Grace and Faith will go up against a group of “High Council” families that make the Le Domas clan look like amateurs, including turns from Elijah Wood, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Shawn Hatosy, Nestor Carbonell, and Cronenberg himself.

Come for Gellar and Hatosy giddily driving their golf cart to clearly nefarious activities, stay for Carbonell really fucking up that whole “loading a gun” thing.

Check out the new trailer for the film below, which Searchlight Pictures will release in theaters on Friday, March 20.

Melania: Twenty Days to History, Amazon's trumped-up documentary about First Lady Melania Trump, reportedly exceeded box-office expectations, bringing in $7 million when pundits prognosticated torn stubs worth between $1 million and $5 million. And Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel had a field day on Wednesday night with the news.


	Colbert claimed the figures need context. “Seven million dollars would seem like a solid opening, until you realize that's less than 10 percent of the $75 million Amazon spent on the documentary, which includes paying the first lady herself at least $28 million,” he said on The Late Show. “That's enough cash to put a smile on your face … if that were physically possible.” He also had a Melania Trump impersonator attempt to explain the movie.


	Kimmel also questioned a different set of numbers during his Jimmy Kimmel Live! monologue. “As of tonight, Melania has a score of five percent on Rotten Tomatoes from the critics,” he said. “That is very low. To put that in perspective, that is one percent lower than Gigli,” the 2003 Bennifer box-office bomb, which Rolling Stone described as “jaw-droppingly awful.” Counterintuitively, he pointed out that the Popcornmeter (fans' approval rating), is through the roof. “The audience score is 99 percent positive, which is one percent higher than The Godfather,” he said. “And I'm sure Donald J. Corleone had nothing to do with that at all.”

	As far as the money goes, Kimmel joked that the way Amazon is crowing that it's the best nonmusical documentary opening in 14 years was smoke and mirrors. “I think [that] is a fancy way of saying it only lost tens of millions of dollars,” he said.

	











	Joking that it's possible that Republican groups purchased bulk tickets to drive up the numbers (though he showed a group of women who called themselves “the Church Ladies,” who were all dressed alike), Kimmel requested a recount. “Send in Tulsi Gabbard and the FBI. Seize the ticket machines, the popcorn buckets, the box-office receipts at every multiplex in America,” he said. He also blasted Amazon ownerJeff Bezos for firing about a third of The Washington Post's staff after financing Melania.

Savannah Guthrie is the longtime co-anchor of “Today,” and right now, she and her siblings are living through every family's worst nightmare.

The urgent search for their mother, Nancy Guthrie, 84, entered its fifth day this week after authorities said she was taken from her Arizona home “against her will.” Savannah and her siblings released an emotional video appeal, asking anyone involved to provide proof Nancy is alive and saying, “We are ready to listen.”

There are still no suspects, according to CNN. The sheriff's department warned the public against spreading unverified claims as the FBI works alongside the Pima County Sheriff's Department on the investigation. Savannah also revealed that her mother lives in constant pain and needs prescription medication, raising fears as time passes.

On Feb. 1, Savannah's co-anchors read a family statement on air thanking supporters and urging anyone with information to call authorities. The family wrote, “Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom.”

As the Guthries wait for answers, here's what you need to know.

Savannah's dad, Charles Guthrie, died of a heart attack when she was just 16. He worked as a mining engineer in Australia before moving the family to Arizona.

In a 2014 essay, Savannah described him as “a seemingly unlikely mix of qualities,” adding that he could “turn a mundane trip to the post office into a rip-roaring tale.”

She later said losing him changed everything. On “Making Space with Hoda Kotb,” she shared, “I know it changed me and probably changed the whole trajectory of my life.”

Camron Guthrie is Savannah's older brother and a former Air National Guard F-16 pilot.

In 2012, he and Savannah flew together in an F-16 during a 2012 “Today” segment. When Camron retired in 2018, Savannah posted a tribute calling him “the pride of our family,” adding, “He has flown for our country for 26 years.”

After Charles died, Savannah says the family leaned on one another to survive the loss.

“It was such a shock,” she shared on “Today.” “We were just trying to figure out how to become a family of four when we had always been a family of five.”

She later added that while the loss was devastating, it also made her heart “more tender.”

Savannah's sister, Annie Guthrie, is both a creative writer and a jewelry artist.

According to her Arizona Commission on the Arts bio, she teaches creative writing at the University of Arizona Poetry Center, has published work in literary journals, and has written a book on jewelry making. Annie is also a graduate of Warren Wilson College.

Savannah, Camron, and Annie have remained publicly united as they wait for answers about Nancy.

On Wednesday, Feb. 4, Guthrie and her siblings shared a video appeal, urging whoever has their mother to come forward and stressing that the family is willing to communicate, while also demanding proof of life.

Both TMZ and a local CBS affiliate reported receiving ransom notes tied to the case, though authorities have not verified their authenticity.

The FBI is now working alongside Arizona law enforcement as the investigation continues.

Chris Hemsworth was hesitant to reveal his genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease for the sake of his acting career.

“I wondered if I was letting people too far in,” Hemsworth — known for his role as Marvel superhero Thor —  told Variety in an interview published Wednesday. 

“Are they no longer going to believe in the action star or the Marvel character?” He questioned. “And do I want people to know my fears and insecurities to this level?”

Hemsworth, 42, revealed the predisposition in 2022 and has since shared that his grandfather and father were hit with the disease, which has no known cure.

At the time, the actor shared that he has a copy of the gene APOE4 from both parents, making him “eight to 10 times more likely” to battle the progressive disease. 

However, he made clear that he hasn't “handed in [his] resignation.”

“It's not a pre-deterministic gene, but it is a strong indication. Ten years ago, I think it was more thought of as determinant,” he said.

Hemsworth was disappointed with the way the press spun his admission to make it seem like he was destined to be diagnosed with the disease.

“It really kind of pissed me off because it felt like I had been vulnerable with something personal and shared this,” he told Vanity Fair in 2024. 

He continued, “No matter how much I said ‘This is not a death sentence,' the story became that I have dementia and I'm reconsidering life and retiring and so on.”

Hemsworth has been more selective with his acting gigs since his father's heartbreaking diagnosis.

“I'd think, ‘I came from nothing. Who am I to turn down that kind of money?'” he said, referring to the blockbuster films he took on earlier in his career. “Justifying things that weren't the purest creative decision – but I'll be able to pay for my parents' house, or I'll be able to help out my cousins.”

Hemsworth said that his 2025 documentary, “A Road Trip To Remember” — which explores his dad's battle with Alzheimer's — was “so deeply personal.” 

“It was a love letter to my father,” he said. “It empowered him for a period, and stimulated memories that were being taken away from him.”

The Aussie actor revealed that he was making lifestyle changes after learning he is at risk.

“I'm lifting less frequently than I was and I'm incorporating more cardio and endurance workouts which I much prefer than heavy body-building style sessions,” he told Men's Health in 2023.

He also started prioritizing sleep and taking regular ice baths. 

That same year, Hemsworth took a step back from his acting career — but emphasized that he is not retiring.

Teddi Mellencamp said that her stint in the current season of the “Masked Singer” gave her “a little bit of life” amid her ongoing cancer battle.

The “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum, 44, was eliminated from Wednesday's episode of “The Masked Singer,” revealing herself as Calla Lily in the dramatic final moments of the show. 

After her unmasking, Teddi told the judges about how her intense cancer battle didn't stop her from doing the reality series.

“I'm not a singer by trade, clearly, and so that part was challenging for me,” she said. “Also, a big part of my memory has been askew since my brain surgery. So I was a little bit nervous, but I was excited to push myself out of my comfort zone and try something new, and it felt like it gave me a little bit of life.”

Teddi sang Rachel Platten's “Fight Song” and her dad John Mellencamp's “Jack and Diane” during her time on the show.

The clues for her identity included a diamond house key, a nod to her time on “RHOBH,” and the mention that she has a famous family member who is a singer.

“For a while I resented him for not making my life easy,” Teddi, while still disguised as Calla Lily, said about John, 74, during a package on the show. “And there were years we were distant.”

Nothing that the father-daughter duo are now on good terms, she added, “I'm thankful for all he does for me. It made me be tough, strong and always on time for dinner.”

On Thursday's episode of her “Two Ts in a Pod” podcast, Teddi revealed that besides her dad, she didn't tell anyone — not even her three children, whom she shares with estranged husband Edwin Arroyave — that she was on the show.

“Cruz knew within seconds,” she said about her 11-year-old son. “And we were watching ‘Masked Singer,' cause it's their favorite show, and Cruz goes, ‘Mom! Mom! That's you!'”

In an interview with People, Teddi said she wanted to “push myself out of my comfort zone” after going through severe “physical and mental struggles” from her cancer battle.

“So getting out there and doing something new and trying something new was really great for me,” she told the outlet. 

The former Bravoleb came forward with her stage 2 melanoma diagnosis in October 2022.

She underwent more than a dozen surgeries to address the disease — including an emergency procedure in 2025 to remove several tumors in her brain.

Last October, Teddi shared that her cancer was gone.

But when John recently stated that his daughter was “really sick” and “suffering,” Teddi clarified that her cancer hadn't returned.

“No, there's still no trace of cancer,” she said on her podcast last month. “But I'm still considered stage four and I'm still in immunotherapy, so essentially nothing's changed other than I still — I don't feel great … I would hope that I would be feeling better by now, but I really don't.”

Teddi also shared that she's going to therapy to address her difficult cancer journey.

A stacked cast descends upon Berlin this month for the world premiere of Karim Aïnouz‘s lustily awaited, prickly family drama “Rosebush Pruning.”

The ensemble includes Callum Turner, Elle Fanning, Jamie Bell, Riley Keough, Lukas Gage, Tracy Letts, Pamela Anderson, and Elena Anaya — and a new clip shared by Mubi, which is repping sales on the film at the festival, offers a devious taste of the drama. It's scripted by Efthimis Filippou, the co-writer on the more hopeless Yorgos Lanthimos movies like “Kinds of Kindness” and “The Killing of a Sacred Deer.”

 










Here's the official synopsis before we dive into what's going on in the clip: “In an opulent villa underneath the Catalonian sun, American siblings Jack, Ed, Anna, and Robert wallow in isolation and their inherited fortune, eschewing the demands of their blind father, and seeking love and validation through each other and their latest designer clothes. When Jack, the eldest brother and linchpin of this family, announces he is moving in with his girlfriend, Martha, blood ties are severed, and Ed starts to uncover the truth surrounding their mother's death. Generational lies begin to unravel, and the fabric of this family slowly begins to disintegrate.”

Those siblings are played by Turner, Bell, Keough, and Gage, and in the clip below, Letts' character asks his children to describe Martha's (Fanning) physical appearance and “bosom,” and they all proceed to debate about it in ways that quietly humiliate Martha — and treat her like she's not even in the room.

“Rosebush Pruning” is inspired by Marco Bellocchio's 1965 drama “Fists in the Pocket,” the Italian director's debut about siblings mounting an almost family annihilation. Originally, Kristen Stewart and Josh O'Connor were set to star in “Rosebush Pruning” before they were swapped by Keough and Turner due to scheduling conflicts. Filming has been completed for over a year, and “Rosebush” had been expected at multiple festivals ahead of Berlin.

Brazilian director Aïnouz's last film was 2004's sexually charged Cannes premiere; he also directed “Firebrand,” Brazil's 2020 Oscar entry “The Invisible Life of Eurídice Gusmão,” and “Futuro Beach.” 

Other starry films landing at this year's Berlin Film Festival include “Everybody Digs Bill Evans” with Anders Danielsen Lie, “Queen at Sea” with Juliette Binoche, honorary Golden Bear recipient Michelle Yeoh in Sean Baker's short “Sandiwara,” “Rose” with Sandra Hüller, and much more.

EXCLUSIVE: Karim Aïnouz's starry drama Rosebush Pruning world premieres in competition at the Berlin Film Festival this month and Deadline can reveal a first clip giving a taste of the satire about the absurdity of the traditional patriarchal family.


	Set in an opulent villa underneath the Catalonian sun, Jamie Bell, Calum Turner, Riley Keough and Lukas Gage play American siblings Jack, Ed, Anna and Robert. Together, they wallow in isolation and their inherited fortune, eschewing the demands of their blind father (Tracy Letts), and seeking love and validation through each other and their latest designer clothes.

	The clip, released by Mubi on Thursday, reveals the dynamics between the family as the father asks Anna to describe Jack's girlfriend in her presence over dinner, even pressing for details of her “bosom”.  


	The film is a joint production between Mubi, The Match Factory, Kavac Film, Fremantle's The Apartment, Sur Film, Crybaby and Gold Rush Pictures.


Firebrand director Aïnouz is directing from a script written by long-time Yorgos Lanthimos collaborator Efthimis Filippou (Kinds of Kindness, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Lobster), which is inspired by Marco Bellocchio's 1965 drama Fists in the Pocket.


	The adaptation rights were acquired from Bellocchio's company Kavac Film, with the company's CEO Simone Gattoni also producing alongside Viola Fügen and Michael Weber for The Match Factory, Annamaria Morelli for The Apartment, Andreas Wentz for Sur Film and Vladimir Zemtsov for Gold Rush Pictures  


	The Match Factory is also handling worldwide sales.

EXCLUSIVE: Apple TV executive Jay Hunt has been sounded out about becoming the next director general of the BBC.


	Deadline understands that Hunt, the European creative director at Apple TV, has been approached about succeeding Tim Davie, who dramatically resigned in November amid a scandal over a Panorama documentary about Donald Trump.


Sources have consistently told Deadline that Hunt is among the frontrunners for the most powerful job in British media, and we now hear that conversations have taken place. It is not clear if Hunt will participate in formal interviews in the coming weeks.

	The BBC declined to comment on speculation regarding the recruitment process, which is being overseen by chair Samir Shah alongside headhunters at Egon Zehnder. Hunt did not respond to a request for comment.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Davie will step down on April 2, with nations chief Rhodri Talfan Davies becoming interim DG until a permanent successor is appointed. Davie is embarking on a farewell tour, telling employees he will be “out and about meeting teams across the UK.” Davie will preside over a town hall next week, during which he intends to brief staff on “the next stage of our strategy.”


	Many consider Hunt to be the most well-rounded candidate, given her credentials as a former journalist, her familiarity with the BBC, track record of backing hits like Slow Horses and Sherlock, and her experience at one of the world's most influential tech companies.


	Hunt has worked at Apple for the past eight years, her longest spell in an executive post throughout her career. In the past two years, she has balanced this with chairing the British Film Institute. 

	











	Hunt was previously Channel 4's chief creative officer for six years, while her other roles have included running BBC1 and heading up content at Channel 5, the Paramount-owned network. Her spell as a journalist included editing BBC News at Six and senior roles on Newsnight and Panorama.


	Hunt is one of three female frontrunners, with former BBC content boss Charlotte Moore, and ex-Channel 4 CEO Alex Mahon, also considered to be serious contenders. The BBC has never had a female director general, so appointing a woman would be a historic moment for the national broadcaster.


	Moore only left the BBC last year to become CEO of The Crown producer Left Bank Pictures, but many at the UK national broadcaster would welcome her back with open arms. Several people close to Moore said she had ruled herself out, but there is a feeling that she has not completely shut the door on a return to the BBC.


	As for Mahon, sources have said she is “serious” about the director general vacancy, despite only recently leaving Channel 4 to become the boss at Superstruct Entertainment, the festival company backed by private equity giant KKR. There is a view among some at the BBC that she could be the candidate to beat.


	Others are not ruling out a dark horse contender. Other names linked to the BBC job include Jane Turton, boss of The Traitors producer All3Media; Patrick Holland, the Banijay UK chief and former BBC2 boss; Anna Mallett, the former ITN CEO who is now Netflix's vice president of production in Europe; and James Harding, the former BBC News boss now running Tortoise Media, which publishes The Observer.


The Guardian reported last week that CNN boss Mark Thompson had been sounded out about a shock return to the BBC, but had made clear he was committed to the U.S. news network. Another potential candidate, Kevin Bakhurst, director general of Ireland's RTÉ and a former BBC News journalist, told Irish lawmakers in December that he had not applied for the BBC vacancy.


	Davie's successor will inherit an organization wrestling with its place in a media ecosystem dominated by overseas tech giants, as well as battling enemies closer to home, with conservative politicians and media proprietors wishing to see the BBC diminished during charter renewal. There is also the small matter of a looming legal fight with the U.S. president over the botched Panorama edit that triggered Davie's resignation.

Britney Spears called out her family in a post on Instagram on Wednesday night, saying she is “incredibly lucky to even be alive” after their mistreatment. 


	“As people, all we really want is to feel connected to each other and never feel alone … for those of you in your family that have said to help you is to isolate you and make you feel unbelievably left out … they were wrong,” she wrote alongside a photograph of a child holding a parent's hand. “We can forgive as people but u don't ever forget. Yearning and longing for contact is always crucial !!!”


	She added, “I'm incredibly lucky to even be alive with how my family treated me once in my life and now I'm scared of them.”


	The singer reflected on how her family hasn't owned up to their part in her conservatorship. “It's weird how God works in mysterious ways,” she wrote. “My friends, what do you think he is saying today ??? Because to be totally honest with you, no matter what he says, they will never take responsibility for what they did.”

	











	This isn't the first time Spears has posted about her family in recent months. In December, she shared an image of a Christmas tree with a sarcastic comment: “Merry late Christmas to my beautiful family who have never disrespected me, harmed me, ever done anything completely unacceptable or caused unbelievable trauma, the kind you can't fix.” 


	In November, Spears temporarily deactivated her Instagram account after she posted a series of responses to her ex-husband Kevin Federline‘s recent memoir, You Thought You Knew. The tell-all book, released in October, recounts the couple's tumultuous relationship, including their marriage in 2004 and their divorce in 2007. Along with an alarming claim that Spears would watch their children sleep with a knife in her hand , Federline wrote: “Something bad is going to happen if things don't change.” He also claimed she drank while pregnant and did cocaine while breastfeeding.

	Spears discussed her family drama in her own memoir, The Woman in Me, which was released in 2024. The best-selling book contained several bombshell revelations, many of which were related to Spears' controversial conservatorship, which finally ended in 2021. In the book, she said the court-ordered arrangement turned her into “a sort of child-robot,” adding, “I had been so infantilized that I was losing pieces of what made me feel like myself.” 

	











	The singer also wrote about agreeing to the conservatorship so she'd be able to be with her kids (whom she'd lost custody of after her divorce with Kevin Federline); feeling betrayed by her sister Jamie Lynn, who told Spears to “stop fighting” the conservatorship; and learning about the #FreeBritney movement while she was “locked up against my will” in a rehab facility.

Expenses for VFX, editing and sound mixing are not currently eligible on their own for state tax credits — but industry insiders want to change that as their ecosystem is “bleeding out.” 


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


	State Assemblymember Nick Schultz has committed to carrying a bill aimed at creating a standalone postproduction tax incentive in California, a field representative for his office announced at a town hall for Hollywood professionals on Wednesday night.


	Amanda Faissal said that the state representative will soon introduce legislation in a bid to return more editing, sound mixing, VFX and other post work to the state. Though postproduction expenses can qualify for tax credits in California if physical production is also done in the state, it is not currently eligible for incentives on its own — even as other states and countries offer this perk to cost-conscious companies.

	The initiative follows a successful lobbying effort from Hollywood unions and grassroots groups in 2025 to more than double California's film and television tax credit, expanding the program from $330 million to $750 million. Like that effort, it aims to make the state competitive with rivals like New York and Georgia and countries like the U.K. and Australia, which all offer highly competitive postproduction incentives.


	“We're very excited about this announcement, I had butterflies all day thinking about it,” Faissal told the audience of postproduction creatives and executives, without going into detail on the language of the bill.


	Faissal's news drew loud applause during a town hall for the California Post Alliance (CAPA), an organization dedicated to attracting more postproduction work to the state. Like physical production, local postproduction has withered amid increasingly competitive incentives offered by other jurisdictions and studio and streamer cost-cutting.  

	











	Wednesday's event at Evergreen Studios in Burbank was the latest example of the postproduction industry responding to a sharp drop in work over the last few years. Conversation around the issue ballooned after an open letter from Encompass Music Partners and Encompass Creative founder Peter Rotter circulated among insiders in early 2025. The letter, which warned that “the infrastructure of the L.A. recording industry [was] about to fail,” led to a town hall in April 2025. At the event, production insiders raised deep concerns that Los Angeles was becoming another Detroit in that it was losing ground on its signature industry.


	The mood during Wednesday's event was only slightly more hopeful — even as CAPA leaders discussed potential solutions, they detailed the impact that the downturn in work has had on local labor and companies. In a speech opening the event, Rotter said that the slowdown was “killing our community, the heart and soul of it.”


	He added, “Families can't pay their rent on what little work is left. Editors are driving Uber instead of cutting reels. Sound designers are selling gear just to eat. The whole ecosystem is bleeding out and no one's coming back.”


	Two-time Oscar-winning sound designer Karen Baker Landers (MaXXXine, Scream VI) said that she had lost four to five jobs due to California not offering the standalone postproduction credit that other jurisdictions do. Trevanna Post and Trevanna Tracks founder Jennifer Freed, whose company has offices in London and New York as well as in L.A., said that she had witnessed the production exodus on her own balance sheet. “As the studios seek tax incentives and lower overhead, the production map is just being redrawn,” she said.

	











	California's share of U.S. postproduction work declined more than 11 percent between 2010 and 2024, according to data shared by CAPA on Wednesday. During that same period, California sustained a nearly 17 percent decline in payroll employment while the U.S. overall saw a 2.5 percent uptick.


	An early economic model from CVL Economics founding partner Adam Fowler estimated that 4,451 jobs have been lost in the last 15 years in addition to $1.63 billion in annual economic input in California.


	He mentioned the entertainment industry's particularly high retention rate, or how much money spent in motion picture industry stays in the economy — 93 cents in the case of Hollywood. ”As companies leave and the supply chain starts to thin, that retention rate erodes and the multiplier effects weaken for everyone that remains, and that becomes a self-perpetuating cycle,” he warned.


	One of his slides read, ominously: “California built this industry over 100 years. Losing it would take less than a generation.”


	CAPA's solution to this dire situation lies, at least initially, in advocating for the Schultz-sponsored bill. To accomplish that, the group has hired a lobbyist and a publicity firm, one of whose publicists encouraged attendees on Wednesday to post about the event on social media. CAPA also encouraged attendees to join as members and financially support the effort.


	One of the hurdles the group will grapple with in lobbying for Schultz's bill is bringing the often low-key work of editors, composers, sound mixers and others in their cohort to the attention of policymakers. Said CAPA president Marielle Abaunza, “We need to come out of our dark rooms… We need to now take a moment to turn the camera and the light and shine it on us. We now need to tell our stories.”

Lower revenues from motion pictures proved to be a drag on SPE's overall performance in the period October to December 2025. 


							By 

	Abid Rahman


International Editor, Digital


Sony Pictures Entertainment's operating income for its fiscal third quarter (ending December 31, 2025) was down 11 percent to $197 million from $223 million in dollar terms for the comparable period a year before, with Q3 sales down 12 percent to $2.295 billion from $2.619 billion.


	SPE comprises the motion pictures division, television productions and media networks.




	The motion pictures unit (which comprises sales from theatrical, home entertainment and streaming sales) saw Q3 revenue fall 7 percent to $792 million from $1.108 billion, for the comparable period a year before. SPE released five theatrical movies globally in the period, including Soul On Fire, Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc, Nuremberg, SISU: Road to Revenge and Anaconda. In the same period the year before SPE benefitted from the strong box office performance of Venom: The Last Dance, which brought in $478 million in Q3 2024.

	SPE's TV unit saw Q3 revenue reach $718 million, down 10 percent from $797 million in the same period a year earlier. SPE's major streaming television productions from the period included Fox's Doc and Universal Basic Guys and Starz's Outlander: Blood of My Blood. Broadcast staples Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune, and their various spinoffs, as well as ABC's Shark Tank added to the TV unit's revenues.

	Third quarter revenue from media networks (that includes TV channels and digital channels) was up 10 percent to $775 million from $707 million. The company revealed that it ended 2025 with 38 television channels and 535.2 million total subscribers.

	











	Third quarter operating income in the Game & Network Services unit (which includes PlayStation hardware and software sales and services income) grew 19 percent to 140.8 billion yen, primarily driven by a weaker yen and higher software sales. Although revenue for the segment dipped 4 percent in the same period and one cause for concern will be that PlayStation 5 sales were 8 million units down from 9.5 million units a year previously in what is usually the busiest quarter for hardware sales as it includes the run up to Christmas. 


	PlayStation Network monthly active users hit 132 million in Q3, up from 129 million MAUs from the same period the year before. 


	Sony's music division had a stellar third quarter with 13 percent increase in sales (542.3 billion yen from 481.7 billion yen) and a 9 percent increase in operating income (106.4 billion yen from 97.4 billion yen). Sony's best-selling music artists for Q3 2025 were Rosalia (Lux), Pink Floyd (Wish You Were Here), Tyler, The Creator (CHROMAKOPIA), Tate McRae (So Close To What), SZA (SOS), Tame Impala (Deadbeat), Bad Bunny (Debí Tirar Más Fotos), Michael Jackson (Thriller), Mariah Carey (Merry Christmas) and Depeche Mode (Memento Mori: Mexico City / Depeche Mode: M).

Barry Manilow is doing well after surgery, but says he needs more time to recover before appearing on stage. 


	The singer, who was scheduled to begin his Feb. 12-21 residency dates at Westgate Las Vegas, said that he will need to postpone the performances for now. The update arrives after Manilow announced back in December that would undergo surgery to remove a “cancerous spot” on his lung.


	“I'm doing great and recovering very well after my surgery,” Manilow wrote in a statement shared to social media on Wednesday. “I've been getting exercise and spending some time in the studio, which has been fantastic.”


	“With my doctor's guidance and recommendation, however, we have decided to postpone my residency dates at Westgate Las Vegas from February 12-21 so I can stay focused on healing and getting ready for the tour that's kicking off at the end of February,” he continued. “Having a few weeks to rest and prepare is what the doctor ordered!”


	Tickets for the Vegas dates will be refunded. Manilow will return to the Westgate on March 26, 27, and 28, according to a rep for the singer.

	Manilow is still set to launch his arena tour in Tampa, Florida, at the Benchmark International Arena on Feb. 27 and will stop in cities across the country including Nashville, Orlando, Charleston, Portland, and more. The trek will wrap in Duluth, Georgia, at Gas South Arena on April 29.


	His new song, “Once Before I Go,” released in September, hit the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart this week — more than 50 years following his first appearance on the chart with 1974's “Mandy.”

The prolific creator said that despite vowing to never work with his wife of more than 30 years, the adaptation of ‘Margo's Got Money Troubles' for Apple TV proved too good to pass up.


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Michelle Pfeiffer and David E. Kelley have long and enviable Hollywood resumés but those credits have only crossed one time — until now.


	They teamed for the upcoming Apple TV series Margo's Got Money Troubles, which was revealed for the first time on Tuesday with a teaser, first look photos and a panel discussion during the streamer's inaugural press day at Santa Monica's Barker Hangar. The event found Kelley sitting alongside his stars including Pfeiffer, Elle Fanning, Nick Offerman and Thaddea Graham along with Rufi Thorpe, the latter of whom wrote the best-selling novel on which the series is based and is an executive producer of the series.

	The eight-episode Apple Original series, made in partnership with A24, casts Fanning as the title character, a college dropout and aspiring writer who is the daughter of an ex-Hooters waitress (Pfeiffer) and ex-pro wrestler (Offerman). A surprise pregnancy, a mounting pile of bills and no cash to make ends meet leads Margo to make some entrepreneurial choices. Marcia Gay Harden, Greg Kinnear, Michael Angarano, Rico Nasty and Lindsey Normington round out the cast.


	Thorpe had the task of moderating the discussion, and she opened it by describing the series as a “bold and acerbic” take on “the sacrifices we make as mothers and using your goods to get by.” She added that when she wrote the book, she “could not have imagined such a dream cast” embodying the characters who “lived in my head so long.” 

	











	She asked Kelley what drew him to the adaptation, and he said that he fell in the love with the book when he picked it up. “These characters spoke to me when I read the book, and the opportunity to make space for them in my head while adapting was just too exciting to pass up. It's such original storytelling,” said Kelley, who had a relationship with Apple TV after making Presumed Innocent. He described the casting process as an easy one “because everyone fell in love with it.” 


	“I think when you and I first talked, Nick, you had read the book, and that was it. You were in without knowing what we were gonna do to it. Elle owned Margo, I think, before I even picked up a pen. And the actress there in the middle, who I vowed never to work with,” Kelley continued, turning his attention to his Pfeiffer. She quipped, “I'm very difficult.”


	He continued: “When I read the book, I could only see one person playing it, and we're lucky enough that she said yes, the second luckiest yes I've gotten from her.” The first, obviously, being the time he asked her to marry him. The couple wed on Nov. 13, 1993, and before Margo had only shared one other credit on To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday, which Kelley co-wrote (with Michael Brady) and Pfeiffer starred in opposite Peter Gallagher and Claire Danes.


	Beyond the material, it's unclear why they made Margo their first time, but Kelley previously told Entertainment Tonight that they “took a chance” on this project by making it their inaugural collaboration and that it had gone “quite well.” 

	











	During the panel, Pfeiffer offered a lot of praise for her husband's creative talents. “It's built on such strong writing,” she said of the show. “So, all you have to do is really open your mouth and you just have to be smart enough to recognize that it's really good writing. And you don't have to do more than that. And I just think that it's really important to always respect the character that you're playing.” 


	She said that her character, Cheyenne, only appears in about 10 pages of the novel, and “then she disappears,” but it was enough to know that the part was for her. “I said, ‘This is a gem.' I was, literally, ‘sign me up,'” she added.


Margo's Got Money Troubles will premiere globally on Wednesday, April 15, with three episodes, followed by new episodes every Wednesday through May 20.


Wednesday, Feb. 4, 8:30 p.m.: Updated to include their shared credit on To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday.

The actor played the villainous playboy turned Blair Waldorf's devoted partner for six scenes in the original show.

	Could Gossip Girl fans hear the iconic line, “I'm Chuck Bass,” once again? Maybe, because Ed Westwick has revealed that he's down to step into his character's shoes for a spinoff.


	The actor, best known for playing the villainous playboy turned Blair Waldorf's (Leighton Meester) devoted partner, was recently asked by Hits Radio UK if he would reprise Chuck Bass if a spinoff came to fruition.




	“It would be super interesting to see where Chuck Bass is. I just think it would be really hard to get everyone together,” he said. “You know what? I think anything is possible in this world, so yeah, it would be great to know what Chuck is up to these days — for sure!”

Gossip Girl, which ran for six seasons from 2007 to 2012, followed a group of wealthy teens through their scandalous lives as Manhattan's elite and how they betray each other for each other's gain, all while the chaos is narrated by a mysterious, ruthless blogger. In addition to Westwick and Meester, the cast also included Blake Lively, Penn Badgley, Chace Crawford, Kelly Rutherford, Matthew Settle, Taylor Momsen and Jessica Szohr.


	Elsewhere during his interview with Hits Radio UK, Westwick also revealed his favorite scene that he filmed from the show.


	“My favorite scene was when I was at the top of the Empire State Building, but not so much because of filming it,” the Sandokan actor said, referencing when Chuck was waiting for Blair at the top of the famous building during the season three finale. “They let me climb up in the needle of the Empire State Building, which nobody gets to go inside, except like the handyman or something. And it was just really really cool that I got to go up there. I was wearing like a full tux and climbed into this needle.”

	











	He added, “There was that. I mean, there were a million things we had a lot of fun doing. Some of those scenes in the back of the limos were great as well. Super super blessed to have been a part of that show.”


	While no spinoff with the original Gossip Girl cast has been announced, a reboot of the show with a new cast ran for two seasons, from 2021 to 2023.


	Also on Wednesday, Deadline reported that Cecily von Ziegesar, the author behind the book series that inspired the show, was working on a new standalone novel centered on Blair, but set 20 years after the original novels.

Barry Manilow is fit and fine after surgery, but he's pushing back his upcoming concert dates in Las Vegas to focus on the road ahead.


	The pop veteran was initially booked for residency dates at Westgate Las Vegas, from Feb. 12-21, but has scrapped those plans on his “doctor's guidance and recommendation,” he writes in a social post.


	The Grammy winner recently went under the knife after a scan revealed stage one lung cancer. The operation was deemed a success, but he needs more time out.

	“I'm doing great and recovering very well after my surgery,” he writes. “I've been getting exercise and spending some time in the studio, which has been fantastic.”


	With some additional downtime, he continues, “I can stay focused on healing and getting ready for the tour that's kicking off at the end of February. Having a few extra weeks to rest and prepare is what the doctor ordered!”


	No replacement dates have been announced for the postponed Vegas shows, and tickets will be refunded at the point of purchase, reps say. Manilow will return to the Westgate on March 26, 27 and 28, part of a national swing that starts Feb. 27 at Benchmark International Arena in Tampa, FL.


	Despite his health setback, Manilow is in record-breaking form. He extends a chart milestone with his latest release, “Once Before I Go,” which enters Billboard's Adult Contemporary tally (dated Feb. 7) more than half a century — 51 years and three months, to be precise — since he first appeared on the list dated Nov. 7, 1974, with his breakout ballad “Mandy.”

Nicole Curtis had quite an ordeal aboard a tiny plane during her recent travels. The HGTV star shared details of the flight that left her crying and praying, with video showing just how scary it was.

On Feb 1, Curtis took to Instagram to share the details of her dicey flight.

“Not sure what we are going to call this phase I'm in, but I ended up in Central America on a tiny little plane tonight,” she wrote in the caption. “I cried, I prayed, I took the Lord's name in vain.”

Thankfully, she landed safely at her destination.

Curtis noted, “And for the nice people — tell me, what's the craziest thing on your life list? This is tied with the night train across India for me.”

“Was supposed to be on another plane, but I'm horizontal til morning — motion sickness got me,” she added.

Curtis also shared a quick update on the status of “Rehab Addict.” The show started a new season in summer 2025, but fans have been waiting on the final two episodes to air.

“Shows are done — waiting for airdate announcement. (For the people that are gonna throw hate),” she wrote.

In a February 4 Instagram post, the HGTV star checked in with fans with some questions about her show.

“I need immediate information from all of you and your friends (so tag your best buddies in your comment) or send this post out and comment. I'm making life decisions based on your feedback,” she wrote. “I'm listening and more importantly, I'm out here collecting much needed data.”

“1. Did you watch the Wyoming episodes on regular TV, stream them or are you still waiting for me to re-air them? 2. Do you watch HGTV by day or night? Or do you DVR?” she asked.

Curtis continued, “3. What are your thoughts about me showing you my projects that are in other countries ? 😬 and what country would you love to see?”

She concluded the post by asking, “Are you ready for me to be back in your TV ? Let me know; otherwise, I'm chasing another passport stamp ❤️❤️.”

Fans flooded the comments section, with one writing, “Your HGTV show is my most watched. I love the originality you bring back to the homes.”

Another fan noted, “We watch you on HGTV and are waiting for your new season.”

“Can't wait for the rest of Wyoming shows. I am from North Dakota and love the small town build. I only watch on streaming platforms,” one fan commented. “And I would totally watch whatever builds you do … just please don't make us wait so long.”

Another fan shared, “I completely understand the traveling, but I want you back on my TV!!!! With ANYTHING you want to do. 😃”

We've known for about a year at this point about the U.K.'s plan to import Saturday Night Live across the Atlantic, with an official British version going into production under Lorne Michaels' oversight. (It's actually part of a long tradition of countries trying to import SNL, usually to extremely limited success; of the 14 countries that have tried, only a handful—Egypt, Germany, Italy—went any kind of multi-season distance, and only South Korea's version is currently on the air.) Right out the gate, we'd note that the sheer amount of British sketch comedy out there at the moment threatens to make Saturday Night Live less of a unique beast than it is in the States, where its sheer institutional presence and rarity in network TV is probably its most potent marketing tool. Even so, there's a fascinating question lurking at the heart of the plan, one that Sky TV has now officially answered: Which British comedians do you cast to start a brand new Saturday Night Live?

Rather than rattle off a list of credits for the show's just-announced cast—Hammed Animashaun, Ayoade Bamgboye, Larry Dean, Celeste Dring, George Fouracres, Ania Magliano, Annabel Marlow, Al Nash, Jack Shep, Emma Sidi, and Paddy Young—we figured it'd be better to see them in motion, so we've collected clips of as many of the 11 newcomers as we can. We have also, because we are incapable of not doing this, noted which of them have done a season of Taskmaster. (It's Ania Magliano and Emma Sidi, natch.)

First up: Hammed Animashaun, who American audiences might actually know from his role on Prime Video's Wheel Of Time adaptation. (He played the tree guy, Loial.) Here he is (briefly) in his recent U.K. comedy series Black Ops:



Next: Ayoade Bamgboye, who won Best Newcomer at Edingburgh in 2025, here in a sketch for Channel 4's Comedy Playground:



Then we've got Scottish stand-up Larry Dean:



And Celeste Dring, one half of comedy duo Lazy Susan:



George Fouracres, a stand-up best known as one-third of the comedy group Daphne:



There's Ania Magliano, a stand-up, writer, and person we know from Taskmaster:



Annabel Marlow, well-known as a musical comedian:



Al Nash, best known as an online comedy sketch guy:



Jack Shep, who's done a few TV roles but seems to be mostly prominent on TikTok. (Apologies for the lack of embed.)

Emma Sidi, a comedian and stand-up with a focus on character work who is also, yes, a former Taskmaster contestant:



And Paddy Young, a stand-up who was a finalist for the BBC New Comedy Award in 2023:

﻿

Per Variety, Saturday Night Live U.K. is set to debut on March 21. The show will reportedly feature a structure extremely similar to the NBC version, including celebrity hosts and musical guests, Weekend Update, and a variety of sketches.

Savannah Guthrie and her siblings, Annie and Cameron Guthrie, have shared a public plea for the return of their missing mother, Nancy Guthrie, who was last seen on Jan. 31. The 84-year-old woman is believed to have been taken from her home against her will and local authorities reportedly notified the FBI of an alleged ransom note received.


	In a tearful video captioned, “Bring her home,” and posted on Instagram on Wednesday, Feb. 4, Savannah began by thanking supporters “for the prayers for our beloved mom,” adding, “We feel them and we continue to believe that she feels them too.” The Today show host described their mother as “full of kindness and knowledge” with grandchildren that “adore her.”


	“The light is missing from our lives,” Annie continued. “She is our beacon. She holds fast to joy in all of life's circumstances. She chooses joy day after day, despite having already passed through great trials of pain and grief.” Speaking directly to Nancy, she said, “Mama, if you're listening, We need you to come home. We miss you.”

	











	Savannah said that their mother's heart is “fragile” and she lives in “constant pain,” and that she needs her medicine to survive. Savannah also acknowledged that she and her siblings heard reports of an alleged ransom letter and said, “We are ready to talk.” She then addressed the alleged kidnappers: “We live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her, we want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen.”


	Speaking to their mother, she said, “Mommy. If you are hearing this, you are a strong woman. You are God's precious daughter. We believe and know that even in this valley, he is with you. Everyone is looking for you, mommy, everywhere, we will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again.”


	The full content and source of the ransom note, which TMZ reportedly received, has not been shared. The outlet claimed that it included demands for “millions” in cryptocurrency to be paid to a Bitcoin address. The legitimacy of the note has not been verified.

	The missing person report for Nancy describes her as being 5 feet 5 inches, weighing 150 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. 88-CRIME is offering a $2,500 reward for information leading to an arrest or arrests in Nancy's disappearance. The Pima County Sheriff's Department is asking those with potential evidence to submit information via an online tip portal.


	“We speak to you every moment, and we pray without ceasing, and we rejoice in advance for the day that we hold you in our arms again,” Savannah said before ending the video. “We love you mom.”

Celebrities who know and love “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie were gobsmacked by the stunningly raw and vulnerable video she and her siblings — sister Annie and brother Camron — posted on the evening of February 4, 2026. 

Looking understandably haggard and heartbroken, Savannah began their video, reading a written statement that addressed a possible captor and noting they were aware of ransom notes regarding their mom, 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie. Millions have been praying for Nancy's safe return since she disappeared from her home in Tucson, Arizona, overnight on February 1, 2026.

Less than an hour after the post went live, over 18,000 people had commented on the Guthrie family's Instagram post, including her “Today” show colleague Carson Daly, who'd asked viewers earlier in the day to stay positive. 

Many other journalists reached out, too. Savannah's dear friend and former co-anchor Hoda Kotb posted two comments, first writing, “❤️❤️ please❤️❤️🙏🙏” and then “Bring her home.” 

NBC's “Sunday Today” host Willie Geist wrote, “Bring Nancy home. We love you Savannah, Annie, and Cam.”

CNN anchor Sara Sidner chimed in, “Bless you. I'm so so ver sorry for the pain you are going through.”

ABC “World News Tonight” anchor David Muir wrote, “We're with you, Savannah — and your siblings – Please bring Nancy home ❤️”

CBS News reporter Jamie Yuccas commented, “Sending you love and prayers for a safe return. ❤️”

“Good Morning America” reporter Will Ganss wrote, “Praying that the light will soon be restored to your lives, that your mother will return home soundly. Thank you for sharing these words. We are all with you.”

Many other famous friends reached out on Savannah's post within the first hour. Bruce Willis' wife, Emma Heming Willis, was among the first to comment, writing, “Bring her home. We continue to pray for her and your family ❤️” 

“The Morning Show” actress Karen Pittman wrote, “Please please bring Nancy home. Praying for you all. ❤️❤️

Legendary actress Frances Fisher posted, “Pray Mama comes home safe 🙏🏽”

Ross Mathews of “The Drew Barrymore Show” simply commented, “I love you” and actress Alyssa Milano wrote, “Bring her home.”

Best-selling author Kate Bowler shared, “Praying with you and for God's precious child Nancy.”

Reality TV star Savannah Chrisley exclaimed, “BRING HER HOME!!! God will NOT fail your family. I have to believe that. GOD WILL PREVAIL!!! Will never stop praying ❤️”

Tennis legend Billie Jean King commented, “Sending our love and support to your entire family.”

Actress Jennie Garth weighed in, “Please bring her home to her family. Sending all my prayers🙏🏻❤️🪽”

Savannah began the family's video by stating, “On behalf of our family, we want to thank all of you for the prayers for our beloved mom, Nancy. We feel them, and we continue to believe that she feels them too.”

Choking back tears, Savannah said, “The light is missing from our lives,” she said. “Nancy is our mother. We are her children.” 

Savannah called their mom “our heart and our home” through tears, noting, “She is 84 years old. Her health, her heart is fragile.” She also said that Nancy lives in “constant pain” and needs medication to survive. Addressing her mom directly, Savannah added, “Mama, mama, if you're listening, we need you to come home. We miss you.”

She also addressed a possible captor, clearly still unaware of who might have their mom. “We too have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media,” she said. “As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk.” 

Acknowledging the advent of AI technology, she added, “We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen. Please reach out to us.”

The Life of a Showgirl continues with a second music video, following lead single "The Fate of Ophelia."

Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	Four months after the release of The Life of a Showgirl, Taylor Swift has announced a second music video from the project: The “Opalite” music video will arrive on Spotify and Apple Music on Friday morning (Feb. 6).


	The pop star made the announcement on her website, unveiling a countdown clock to 8 a.m. ET on Friday morning. Following the Apple and Spotify premiere, the music video will be available Sunday (Feb. 8) on YouTube.


	“Opalite” will be the second visual unveiled from the project, following a video for lead single “The Fate of Ophelia,” which first arrived as part of Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl in movie theaters before hitting YouTube two days later. Fans will have to wait and see whether the “Opalite” video is the same as the version that was shown during the album's theatrical release party or different.

	











The Life of a Showgirl debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 following its Oct. 3 release and spent a total 12 weeks atop the chart. It moved a single-week record 4.002 million equivalent album units in the United States in its first week, according to Luminate, with “The Fate of Ophelia” debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 that week, followed by “Opalite” at No. 2 — which is so far its peak on the chart.




	Swift's decision to premiere the video first on Spotify and Apple Music follows YouTube's December announcement that it was withdrawing its streaming data from all of Billboard‘s charts. YouTube's withdrawal followed Billboard‘s Dec. 16 announcement of a change to chart methodology that will continue to weigh subscription streams more favorably than ad-supported streams, in a bid to better reflect changing consumer behaviors and the increased revenue derived from streaming in the industry. The change means that paid/subscription streams will be weighted against ad-supported streams at a 1:2.5 ratio, narrowed from the previous 1:3 ratio.


	In addition to the music video, Swift also announced an “Opalite” 7-inch vinyl single available to purchase for only 48 hours on her web store, set to ship on or around Feb. 9.

	R&B singer Chris Brown is facing allegations he cut a songwriter out of credit and compensation on his two songs “Monalisa” and “Sensational.”


	In a new lawsuit filed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, Steve Chokpelle claims he was at Brown's Los Angeles home with Sean Kingston in 2020 when Brown asked him to compose lyrics for “Monalisa,” a track purportedly released on June 4, 2021. Though the lawsuit doesn't mention it, a 2022 “Monalisa” remix from Nigerian musicians Lojay and Sarz that also featured Brown eventually peaked at Number Eight on Billboard's U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart.


	In his complaint, Chokpelle also alleges he penned the lyrics for the follow-up track “Sensational” in 2021, and that after Brown heard a demo, he decided to cut it himself. According to Chokpelle, Brown recorded, mixed, and mastered his own version featuring Lojay, which landed on Brown's 2023 album 11:11. The track, which listed Kingston and Lojay as co-authors, climbed to Number One on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart and peaked at Number 71 on the Hot 100. The lawsuit alleges “Sensational” generated more than $1 million in revenue, but Chokpelle says he didn't see a dime.

	











	Chokpelle claims Brown deprived him of proper credit for the songs and “his properly entitled compensation flowing from his role as author/owner of the lyrics.” He's now asking for a court order declaring him an author and copyright owner of the two songs, and seeking damages from Brown, Kingston, Sony Music Entertainment, and Universal Music Publishing Group.

	Attempts to reach reps for the defendants were not immediately successful.


	“Defendants sustained a tremendous benefit, and shall continue to receive tremendous benefit, by earnings millions in revenues, acclaim, accolades, and goodwill, from the commercial exploitation of ‘Monalisa' and ‘Sensational,'” the 13-page lawsuit filed by Chokpelle and his lawyer Simon J. Rosen, reads. “Chokpelle is entitled to a full, discrete accounting of all revenues earned by [Brown] from the commercial exploitation of the subject songs, from inception through current, and ongoing into the future.”

"She walked past me and I froze," Manon tells Jimmy Fallon of her Cyrus encounter at the Grammys.


	It's been a mind-blowing few days for KATSEYE, as they made their way from performing at Sunday's 2026 Grammy Awards to making their late-night debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon — and Billboard has exclusive photos and details from their Wednesday night (Feb. 4) sit-down.


Billboard was in the building for KATSEYE's first time ever on NBC's The Tonight Show, and the Grammys were fresh in their minds as they discussed who they were most starstruck by; Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, Bad Bunny, ROSÉ and Miley Cyrus all made their list, with Manon adding of Cyrus: “She walked past me and I froze.”

	











	They were also asked about whether new music is on the horizon, with Megan confirming that there is but adding, “We don't have a date yet.”


	Finally, they chatted about starring alongside Hailee Steinfeld, Danny McBride and Keegan-Michael Key in a Super Bowl commercial for State Farm, which arrived in part online this week and features the global girl group dancing to McBride and Key's new take on Bon Jovi's “Livin' on a Prayer.” Lara joked that her dad is “finally proud of me” because she's in a Super Bowl commercial, and the ladies left the couch to re-create their dance from the ad (as featured in the top photo).

	











	Also on Wednesday's show: Nick Jonas performs “Gut Punch” from his new solo album Sunday Best, arriving on Friday, and Ethan Hawke discusses his Oscar-nominated role in Blue Moon.


	Tune in to catch KATSEYE on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT tonight on NBC and streaming next day on Peacock.

Savannah Guthrie and her siblings, Annie and Camron, are begging for their mother Nancy's safe return after her mysterious disappearance.

“Bring her home,” the journalist captioned an Instagram video shared on Wednesday night.

“We want to thank all of you for the prayers for our beloved mom, Nancy. We feel them and we continue to believe that she feels them too,” an emotional Savannah said in the clip, reading from a prepared statement.

“Our mom is a kind, faithful, loyal, fiercely loving woman of goodness and light. She's funny, spunky, and clever. She has grandchildren that adore her and crowd around her, and cuddle her with kisses,” the siblings' message continued.

“She loves fun and adventure. She is a devoted friend. She is full of kindness and knowledge. Talk to her, and you'll see.” 

Annie echoed her sister's sentiments, adding that the “light is missing” from their family's lives without their mother. 

“Nancy is our mother. We are her children, she is our beacon. She holds fast to joy in all of life's circumstances. She chooses joy day after day. Despite having already passed through great trials of pain and grief,” she said, as Savannah tearfully held her head down.

“We are always going to be merely human. Just normal human people who need our mom. Mama, mama if you're listening, We need you to come home. We miss you.”

Savannah continued to read from her note as she pleaded with her mother's alleged captor for proof that she is alive.

“Our mom is our heart, and our home. She is 84 years old. Her health, her heart is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive, she needs it not to suffer. We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk,” Savannah said.

Addressing the purported kidnapper, she added: “However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know — without a doubt — that she is alive, and that you have her. We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen.”

The former “Today” show host then sent a message directly to Nancy, asking her to “please reach out” to their family. 

“Mommy, if you are hearing this, you are a strong woman. You are God's precious daughter, Nancy. We believe and know that even in this valley, he is with you,” she said.

“Everyone is looking for you, Mommy — everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again. We speak to you every moment and we pray without ceasing. And we will rejoice in advance that the day we will hold you in our arms again. We love you, mom,” Savannah closed before her siblings echoed her last sentence in their closing statements.

Nancy was last seen on Saturday at around 9:30 p.m. She was reportedly dropped off at her Catalina Foothills home after having dinner with family members.

On Monday, the Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed that Nancy's home was being treated as a crime scene.

Authorities initially believed Annie was the last person to see their matriarch before she went missing. After which, FBI agents paid Annie's home in Arizona a visit on Tuesday amid the continued investigation.

However, authorities told The Post that Annie's husband, Tommaso Cioni, was the last person who saw Nancy alive when he drove her back to her home at around 9:45 p.m. after she had dinner with him and his wife.

The Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed they have yet to identify a suspect or person of interest in an X statement on Wednesday.

Bella Hadid was reportedly pulled over by police just moments before on-again off-again boyfriend Adan Banuelos was arrested for public intoxication. 

According to a police report obtained by TMZ, deputies pulled over the model in the parking lot of Gator's Cantina in Weatherford, Texas in the early morning hours of Saturday, when Banuelos came toward them.

“I immediately noted that Adan's speech was slurred and his eyes were bloodshot and glassy,” the arresting officer alleged in the report.

The report also noted an “odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath” as Banuelos explained that he was worried about Hadid.

Per the report, Banuelos claimed Hadid went back into the bar because she left her phone there, and he “followed her,” adding that he “cared for her.”

Authorities wrote in their report that as they spoke with Banuelos, his white truck continued to run while a dog, which he claimed was Hadid's, was still inside.

Banuelos reportedly consented to a field sobriety test after confessing to consuming “four” beers that day — which led to his arrest.

The report stated that Banuelos was taken into custody as a precaution against him “possibly driving a vehicle or posing a danger to himself or others.”

“I released Adan's property and his vehicle to his girlfriend, who was identified as Isabella Hadid, at his request,” the report read, per the outlet. 

The professional cowboy was subsequently transported to Parker County jail, where he was questioned — and according to the report, he strenuously denied having driven to the bar and refused to give a name for who did.

The horseman, 36, reportedly told authorities that “he was at home with a friend when Isabella came home and then left again to go back to the bar.”

“Adan said that he and his friend got into the truck and drove after Isabella, and when they arrived at the bar, his friend went inside, and Adan walked over to the traffic stop.”

A rep for Hadid, 29, did not immediately return Page Six's request for comment on Wednesday. 

Page Six confirmed on Saturday that Banuelos had been arrested for public intoxication, following TMZ's initial report. He was released the same day after paying a minor bond of $386.

Page Six confirmed earlier last week that he and Hadid had split after two years of dating, with a source calling their relationship “tumultuous.”

Breakup rumors first emerged in June 2025, but died down after the athlete shared an Instagram birthday wish for Hadid in October, writing in part, “Love you, baby. I'll keep reminding you every day just how much.”

A source told Page Six earlier this week that the pair's difficulties may come down to differing lifestyles. 

“She's the daughter of Mohamed and Yolanda Hadid,” a source told us of the reality star and real estate titan. “It's such a different way of growing up.”

Britney Spears candidly admitted that she's “lucky to be alive” after surviving the way her family treated her. 

“As people, all we really want is to feel connected to each other and never feel alone,” the pop star wrote via Instagram Wednesday.

“For those of you in your family that have (sic) said to help you is to isolate you and make you feel unbelievably left out … they were wrong. We can forgive as people but u don't ever forget.”

“Yearning and longing for contact is always crucial !!!” Spears, 44, continued. “I'm incredibly lucky to even be alive with how my family treated me once in my life and now I'm scared of them.”

The “Toxic” songstress explained that “it's weird how God works in mysterious ways,' adding, “My friends, what do you think he is saying today ???”

“Because to be totally honest with you, no matter what he says, they will never take responsibility for what they did.”

The hitmaker concluded that she hadn't “danced in a month,” saying, “I broke my toe twice!”

A rep for Britney wasn't immediately available to Page Six for comment.

Britney was entangled in a 13-year conservatorship under her father, Jamie Spears, from 2008 to 2021, giving him control over her finances, medical decisions and personal and professional proceedings.

Before her conservatorship ended, she testified against her father, claiming that he forced her to embark on her 2018 “Piece of Me” tour and Las Vegas residency.

The Grammy winner claimed Jamie drugged her with a “very strong” drug known as lithium when she wasn't cooperating during rehearsals for her residency.

Britney also stated Jamie forced her into rehab and threatened her not to see her kids — Sean Preston Federline and Jayden James Federline — if she didn't cooperate.

Additionally, the “Circus” singer shared she was required to be on birth control and prohibited from getting married or having another baby.

Britney vulnerably opened up about her conservatorship in her 2023 memoir, “The Woman in Me,” claiming that her sole purpose was “for no other reason than to help [her family's] cash flow.”

Court filings showed Jamie awarded himself around $6 million throughout the years of Britney's conservatorship.

Britney remains estranged from Jamie, with an insider telling Us Weekly in September that there was no chance of reconciling despite the latter's health issues.

However, she's worked on “rebuilding” her bond with her mom, Lynn Spears, over the years, though the source told the outlet their relationship is “very fragile” with communication “every few weeks.”

As for Britney and her sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, their relationship has reportedly been on the mend following their famous feud in 2022.

The “Criminal” singer is closest to her brother, Bryan Spears, who moved in with her shortly after her split from ex-husband Sam Asghari in August 2023.

An independent theater in Lake Oswego, Oregon, just a few miles south of Portland, is reporting that the Amazon corporation does not, in fact, have a sense of humor when it comes to its new, very expensive Brett Ratner documentary Melania. Per the Lake Oswego Review, Jordan Perry, general manager for the small city's Lake Theater & Cafe, is claiming that Amazon has yanked the movie out of theaters after he advertised the booking with taglines like “To defeat your enemy. You must know them. Melania,” and the slightly less confrontational, “Does Melania wear Prada? Find out on Friday!”

Perry wrote about the decision on the theater's Instagram—which, we can't help but note in passing, is also filled with hand-drawn movie posters that are pretty kick-ass—noting that the theater “Got a call that the higher ups (i.e., at Amazon) were upset with how our marquee marketed their movie (i.e., Melania), that, per them, Sunday would be its last day here.” Joking “please don't cancel my Prime” and suggesting that devoted Amazon fans will have to “show your support at Whole Foods instead,” Perry noted both in the Instagram post and in a separate blog post that he also got quite a bit of pushback from the theater's fans for screening the documentary at all. Titling the post “Why I, Jordan, Got Melania Here,” Perry wrote that, “Mostly, I thought doing so would be funny.” But also, “Financially, the film marketplace this week and next were a desert… So, to fill a screen, why not get this inexplicable vanity piece from the current president's wife? I mean, it just seems so weird that it even exists (who wants a movie about Melania lol?), and wouldn't it then be exponentially weirder, to the point of being funny, to show it here, at your obviously anti-establishment, occasionally troublemaking, neighborhood cinema?”

Perry suggests that the theater may be on Amazon's “black list” for a while, possibly impacting the release of upcoming films like Project Hail Mary. (He also notes that the film made the company about $196 during its truncated run, writing, “Jeff Bezos won't notice the $196. He wouldn't notice $1,960, though someone on his team noticed our marquee.”)

Anyway: “Wuthering Heights” starts 2/12.”

Bizarre footage appears to show three strange lights in the sky maintaining a consistent 'formation'.

The video was released by the US Department of War, formerly the Department of Defence, and sees the lights moving over the Persian Gulf.

Although it has only just been released, the footage was originally taken back on August 23, 2012, and was shot by an MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the US Air Force.

The drone captured the minute-long video just after 6pm local time, while using infrared sensors.

UFO sightings continue to be a source of mystery, with many people believing them to be evidence of 'alien life' visiting Earth.

In this case, what's interesting about the lights was the way they appeared to hold their 'formation', maintaining a clear triangle shape between the three points of light.

This continued except for one moment when one of the lights seemed to drop back slightly.

The footage was analyzed in detail on the WEAPONIZED podcast, which is hosted by Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp.

In an episode from January 30, they looked at the strange footage.

Corbell suggested that one light was flying in a 'playful' way, saying: "These objects appear to be aware and intelligent of one another, and they're keeping equidistant as they fly.

"But all of a sudden you see one make this playful little move as if it drops back in the formation, and then comes forward again."

Debating the credibility of the footage, Knapp suggested that its military source makes it more reliable.

"This is a military recorded sensor-generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO, like one big triangular craft with dots on each of the three ends. And clearly, you watch this, and that's not what it is," said Knapp.

Corbell explained that the footage was desingated 'UAP', which is the official Air Force designation that stands for 'Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena', and not actually the classic 'UFO'.

"Your government has labeled this UAP, and you were never supposed to see this footage," Corbell claimed.

Analyzing the movement, he said: "You see a break in that formation, and a pretty distinct and interesting movement.

"Our department of defence, or department of war now, said that this is a formation."

Knapp added: "That's clearly not one craft with three points of light on the corners."

The video was reportedly part of an archive of material which had been designated as 'non human' but not something like an animal or other regular encounter.

The feature, which is launching worldwide sales at the upcoming European Film Market in Berlin, has Thunder Road and Seven Bucks Productions amongst its producers. 


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


Karen Gillan, Josh Hutcherson, and Clive Owen have signed to star in Blasphemous, a supernatural thriller that will mark the directorial debut of Luke Piotrowski, the genre screenwriter behind Hellraiser and She Rides Shotgun.


	North.Five.Six., the finance, sales and distribution group founded by Michael Rothstein and Sam Hall and whose slate includes the upcoming movies Regretting You and Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die, and CAA Media Finance are launching worldwide sales at the upcoming European Film Market in Berlin. The filmmakers are hoping to get production underway in New York this August.

	The project comes armed with a cavalcade of production companies and involves heavyweights Thunder Road, the company behind the John Wick franchise, as well as Dwayne Johnson-front facing Seven Bucks Productions, among others.




			Popular on THR		







	Piotrowski wrote the script, which appeared on the 2023 Black List, the ranking of popular unproduced Hollywood scripts. According to Thursday's announcement, Blasphemous is characterized as a mix of The Exorcist and Training, centering on two clerics – a rookie priest (Hutcherson) and his devout mentor (Owen) who must transport a possessed young woman (Gillan) to a secure location for an exorcism. All hell breaks loose when she unexpectedly escapes, putting their lives on the line and their faith to the ultimate test.

	











	Producing are former Sony executive Scott Strauss via his recently-formed banner Badlands, Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee for Thunder Road, and Johnson, Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia for Seven Bucks. Gillan is also producing with her partner at Red Riot Pictures, Jess Biddle.


	Rothstein, Hall, and Warren Goz will executive produce on behalf of North.Five.Six. Kimberly Bialek will oversee for Seven Bucks.


	“Blasphemous is one of the best scripts the collective producer group has ever read,” Strauss said in a statement. “It's a one-of-a-kind genre ride that features sharp dialogue, compelling characters, and powerful ideas.”


	Gillan is currently filming the latest instalment of the Jumanji franchise, which is also starring Johnson. She will then segue to shooting Chad Stahelski and Amazon's remake of Highlander.


	Hutcherson is the star of two franchises, The Hunger Games and Five Night's at Freddy's, with the latter's second instalment released this past December.


	Owen last starred as a villain in Daisy Ridley action movie Cleaner and starred as detective Sam Spade in AMC's mini series Monsieur Spade.


	Gillan is repped by UTA, Maison 2, Linden Entertainment, and Jackoway Austen while Hutcherson is repped by Gersh, TFC Management, and Hansen Jacobson. Owen is repped by CAA and Hirsch Wallerstein while Piotrowski is repped by Redefine Entertainment.

New Epstein Files reveal Jeffrey Epstein's fascination with psychic abilities, including paying a Hong Kong academic $20,000 to research mind-reading and “special powers,” alongside plans to rebrand his private island.

Amid the chaos around the newly released documents in the Epstein Files, it has been revealed that a Hong Kong-based academic had a relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The duo said to have an interest in "psychic activities" and mind-reading. It has been reported that there were conversations of a collaboration to "rebrand" the island of the American financer.

The emails in the documents showed Epstein being interested in an academic's pursuit of finding people with so-called special abilities, such as mind-reading. As the discussion continued, Epstein ended up giving the Hong Kong academic tens of thousands of US dollars. In the 3 million pages of freshly released documents, around 1000 are about the academic who was working at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University at the time.

The documents showed that the academic started talking to the sex offender in 2011. He received a sum of $20,000 for a research project the same year that was related to artificial intelligence. Emails indicate the pair finally met in person in 2015.

It was also found that the e documents show that the pair also shared a strong personal relationship that involved multiple in-person meetings at Epstein's Manhattan residence.

Moreover, in a series of emails in 2017, he academic, proposed a number of venues to Epstein for a meet-up. “Is your island out of commission?” the scholar asked, without specifying a name. In the same email, the academic sent Epstein the name of a group he said “organise[d] events and are looking for an island to collaborate with”.

“Could be a good rebrand for your island,” the academic said.

Another set of emails from 2017 shows the academic introducing Epstein to Lydia Laurenson, an author who previously detailed a meeting with the financier at his Manhattan residence. In one meeting with the financier, the author claimed he brought out a group of “barely legal” women. In an email from 2017, there was mention of an experiment the academic organised involving a self-proclaimed “psychokinesis master” who claimed to have the ability to “manipulate [electrical] current from a distance”.

For centuries, communities across Russia, Finland, and parts of Eastern Europe dropped small live frogs into fresh milk to stop it from spoiling. It sounds bizarre, almost like a superstition passed down through generations, but the surprising part is this: science now suggests the practice may actually have had real antimicrobial benefits.

Before refrigeration, milk spoiled fast, especially in humid or warm regions. Families relied on whatever tricks they had: plunging containers into cold wells, storing milk in clay pots, or adding natural substances such as birch charcoal. Among these methods was the eye-catching frog technique. Farmers believed frogs kept the milk “alive” longer, preventing it from turning sour before the next morning's meal.

While many assumed this was merely rural folklore, the explanation behind it is much more grounded in chemistry and biology.

Amphibians are little Creatures With Powerful Chemistry. Amphibians, especially European brown frogs, naturally secrete bioactive compounds from their skin to protect themselves from bacteria and fungi in marshy habitats. These secretions contain:

Modern research, including studies published by Russian scientists in the last decade, found that secretions from certain frog species effectively inhibit the growth of harmful microbes, including those responsible for milk spoilage. In simpler terms, when a frog sat in the milk, tiny amounts of these protective compounds leached into the liquid, slowing bacterial growth. It was never sterilised milk, but it bought valuable hours of freshness in a world without iceboxes.

When scientists tested frog secretions, they discovered that they worked against pathogens like E. coli, Staphylococcus, and other spoilage bacteria. Some peptides were as potent as man-made antibiotics. They were especially effective in liquid environments, like milk. This doesn't make ancient villagers biochemists, of course. They were simply observing what worked. Over time, the method stuck because it delivered results, even if no one understood why.

The frog-in-milk story is a window into pre-refrigeration life, when food preservation was a daily struggle. It shows how early innovations often came from trial, error, and the natural world around us. But there's a deeper health angle too, that, modern medicine studies amphibian peptides as natural antibiotic candidates, especially at a time when antibiotic resistance is becoming a global crisis. The very frogs once used to keep milk fresh may help shape tomorrow's medical tools.

We now have safe, reliable refrigeration and food safety standards. While the science is fascinating, dropping a frog into any food today risks contamination, toxins, or pathogens. The traditional method belongs firmly to history. Still, this old practice carries a strange, provocative lesson: nature often held solutions long before humans understood them, sometimes in places as unexpected as the skin of a tiny marsh frog.

Oops, something went wrong

Tuttle Capital has launched the UFO Disclosure ETF (UFOD), an actively managed fund investing in companies linked to possible non-human intelligence technologies.

The fund launches after former Bank of England analyst Helen McCaw warned on January 18 that UFO-related news could shock markets, and cause big price swings and sudden moves into "safe" assets.

UFOD invests mainly in aerospace and defense, advanced materials, and energy companies, which could benefit should new UFO/UAP (Unidentified Flying Object/Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) information lead governments and markets to change how they spend and invest.

Riverside, Connecticut--(Newsfile Corp. - February 5, 2026) - Tuttle Capital Management, a pioneer in thematic exchange-traded funds (ETFs), today announced the launch of the Tuttle Capital UFO Disclosure ETF (CBOE: UFOD). The fund seeks capital growth by investing in companies positioned to benefit from the disclosure, confirmation, or commercialization of advanced non-human technologies.

"Markets react to new information about wars, pandemics, regulation, and technology shocks," said Matthew Tuttle, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. "UAP disclosure could reshape budgets, priorities, and potentially entire industries. We could be in the very early days of an evolution that could have a significant impact on the global economy and on markets, similar to the likes of the Internet boom and the AI revolution. This new fund provides a disciplined, rules-aware way for investors to navigate that uncertainty, and the potential of UAP."

The launch follows fresh warnings from former Bank of England senior analyst Helen McCaw, who has urged central banks to prepare for potential financial instability in the wake of disclosure. McCaw argues that an announcement could trigger an "ontological shock" for markets, driving extreme price swings, abrupt flights to perceived safe-haven assets, and a sudden loss of confidence in existing valuations.

A Focused "UFO Tech" Mandate with Profound Implications

UFOD seeks to provide investors with a targeted way to express a theme at the intersection of defense, space, and unconventional technology. This thematic approach emphasizes industries that may experience substantial disruption or growth, including:

Aerospace & Defense: Companies involved in the analysis of recovered materials or UAP reporting.

Principal Risks

As with all funds, a shareholder is subject to the risk that his or her investment could lose money. The Fund is not a complete investment program and is designed for inclusion in a diversified investment portfolio. The principal risks affecting shareholders' investments in the Fund are set forth below. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any government agency. The principal risks described herein pertain to direct risks of making an investment in the Fund and/or risks of the issuers in which the Fund invests.

Speculative Nature Risk. Government confirmation or denial of advanced alien technology is uncertain, and rumored breakthroughs might never materialize. This entire theme is highly speculative and subject to rumor cycles.

Equity Securities Risk. Since it purchases equity securities, the Fund is subject to the risk that stock prices will fall over short or extended periods of time. Historically, the equity markets have moved in cycles, and the value of the Fund's equity securities may fluctuate from day to day. Individual companies may report poor results or be negatively affected by industry and/or economic trends and developments. The prices of securities issued by such companies may suffer a decline in response. These factors contribute to price volatility, which is a principal risk of investing in the Fund.

Other Investment Companies Risk. To the extent that the Fund invests in other ETFs or investment companies, the value of an investment in the Fund is based on the performance of the underlying funds in which the Fund invests and the allocation of its assets among those ETFs or investment companies. The underlying ETFs and investment companies may change their investment goals, policies or practices and there can be no assurance that the underlying ETFs or investment companies will achieve their respective investment goals. Because the Fund invests in ETFs and other investment companies, shareholders indirectly bear a proportionate share of the expenses charged by the underlying funds in which it invests which impacts the Fund's performance. The principal risks of an investment in the Fund include the principal risks of investing in the underlying ETFs and investment companies.The Fund is exposed to the risks of the underlying ETFs and investment companies in which it invests in direct proportion to the amount of assets the Fund allocates to each underlying fund. One underlying fund may buy the same security that another underlying fund is selling. You would indirectly bear the costs of both trades. In addition, you may receive taxable gains from portfolio transactions by the underlying funds, as well as taxable gains from the Fund's transactions in shares of the underlying funds. The Fund's ability to achieve its investment goal depends, in part, upon the- Adviser's skill in selecting an optimal mix of underlying funds.Sector Risk. To the extent the Fund invests more heavily in particular sectors of the economy, its performance will be especially sensitive to developments that significantly affect those sectors.

Technology Sector Risk. The market prices of technology-related securities tend to exhibit a greater degree of market risk and sharp price fluctuations than other types of securities. These securities may fall in and out of favor with investors rapidly, which may cause sudden selling and dramatically lower market prices. Technology securities may be affected by intense competition, obsolescence of existing technology, general economic conditions and government regulation and may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Technology companies may experience dramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for qualified personnel. These companies are also heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely impact a company's profitability. A small number of companies represent a large portion of the technology industry. In addition, a rising interest rate environment tends to negatively affect technology companies, those technology companies seeking to finance expansion would have increased borrowing costs, which may negatively impact earnings. Technology companies having high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in their market prices.

   23:06 EST 04 Feb 2026, updated  08:42 EST 05 Feb 2026    By CHRIS MELORE, US ASSISTANT SCIENCE EDITOR  

New video from a US military drone has captured what UFO investigators are calling a formation of mysterious orbs flying over one of the most contentious regions in the world. 

Jeremy Corbell, investigative journalist, documentary filmmaker, and co-host of the WEAPONIZED Podcast, revealed footage this week allegedly obtained from intelligence sources that captured three objects flying over the Persian Gulf on August 23, 2012.

The minute-long recording was taken by an MQ-9 Reaper drone being operated by the US Air Force while it was using its infrared sensors just after 6pm local time. 

According to Corbell and podcast co-host George Knapp, the Pentagon described these three lights as 'orbs' flying in formation instead of coming from one triangular-shaped object.

In the video, one of the lights could be seen suddenly dropping back behind the other two, before seemingly being slingshot forward to lead the group.

Corbell added that the orbs appeared to be flying in an almost 'playful' manner and were intelligently coordinated, maintaining equal distances without any visible wings, tails, fins, or engine exhaust of any kind.

He pointed out that the leaked recording clearly showed unidentified flying objects displaying one of the 'five observable' behaviors often linked to UFOs - unusual flight movements that defy basic physics.

In this case, the one orb moving between the other two exhibited clear signs of instant acceleration without any visible thrust, something human aircraft haven't publicly shown an ability to do.

In a breakdown of the sighting, Corbell noted that the US Department of War officially designated the orbs as 'UAP,' which stands for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and is the new term for UFOs.

The video was reportedly placed in a separate archive specifically for evidence of non-human craft or objects that clearly weren't birds, balloons, or other explainable items.

The WEAPONIZED Podcast hosts added that the credibility of the sighting was indisputable, since the footage was taken by the military, using technology that accumulates more data than a standard camera or an everyday person's smartphone.

'This is a military recorded sensor-generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO, like one big triangular craft with dots on each of the three ends. And clearly, you watch this, and that's not what it is,' Knapp said in the January 30 episode.

'Your government has labeled this UAP, and you were never supposed to see this footage,' Corbell added.

The two men noted that the area where this recording was made, between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has become a hotspot for UAP activity in recent years, with personnel on US Navy vessels in the region reporting multiple encounters with bright objects in the sky.

In one incident allegedly recounted to Corbell, an unknown object flooded the bridge of a Navy ship with extremely intense light, so bright that a commanding officer claimed she raised her hand to shield her eyes, but she couldn't see her own hand in front of her face.

In another incident recently revealed during a bombshell hearing in Washington, military drone footage captured the moment a Hellfire missile struck and merely bounced off the hull of a UFO flying over the nearby country of Yemen.

Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri produced the shocking, never-before-seen footage from October 30, 2024 during the congressional UAP hearing with a group of military whistleblowers last year.

The black-and-white video captured the 100-pound class air-to-ground precision weapon bouncing off the mysterious orb, which continued traveling at extreme speed off the coast of Yemen, roughly 1,000 miles away from the Persian Gulf.

Witness Jeffrey Nuccetelli, a former Air Force military police officer for 16 years, called the Hellfire video 'exceptional evidence' of the existence of UFOs.

'I imagine there are members of Congress that would like to see it, who I don't even know if they've asked to see the repository of UAP videos that we've mentioned to them in the past,' Knapp said.

'But it must be frustrating for them to know that this kind of stuff exists and they're not allowed to poke into it or get a glimpse of it at all.'

Officially, the US government and the Pentagon have declared that there has never been any physical evidence recovered that proves UFOs or extraterrestrial beings exist.

The podcast hosts noted that ARRO, the Pentagon department in charge of reviewing all UAP incidents, has released very few videos showing clear UFO sightings, despite whistleblower footage continuing to be leaked to the public.

Military drone footage has captured what UFO researchers describe as a formation of mysterious orbs flying over one of the world's most volatile regions.

Investigative journalist and WEAPONIZED Podcast co-host Jeremy Corbell unveiled the recording allegedly sourced from intelligence contacts, showing three objects traversing the Persian Gulf.

The one-minute clip was recorded by an MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the US Air Force using infrared sensors shortly after 6pm local time. Corbell and podcast co-host George Knapp explained the Pentagon categorized the three lights as "orbs" flying in formation rather than originating from a single triangular craft. The footage shows one light abruptly falling behind the other two before appearing to slingshot forward and assume the lead position.

Corbell and Knapp observed the orbs appeared to fly in an almost "playful" manner with intelligent coordination, maintaining equal spacing without any visible wings, tails, fins or engine exhaust. The podcast hosts emphasized the leaked recording demonstrated UFOs exhibiting one of the "five observable" behaviors commonly associated with unidentified aerial phenomena - unusual flight patterns that defy conventional physics. The orb moving between the others showed clear signs of instant acceleration without visible thrust, a capability human aircraft have not publicly demonstrated.

Corbell's analysis revealed the US Department of War formally designated the orbs as "UAP" - Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, the current official terminology for UFOs. The video was reportedly filed in a dedicated archive containing evidence of non-human craft or objects definitively ruled out as birds, balloons or other explainable phenomena.

The WEAPONIZED Podcast hosts stressed the August 23, 2012 sighting's credibility remains indisputable given the military origin of the footage and the advanced technology capable of collecting far more data than standard cameras or smartphone devices. Knapp stated in the January 30 episode: "This is a military recorded sensor generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO, like one big triangular craft with dots on each of the three ends. And clearly, you watch this, and that's not what it is." Corbell added: "Your government has labeled this UAP and you were never supposed to see this footage."

The recording location between Saudi Arabia and Iran has become a hotspot for UAP activity in recent years, with US Navy vessel personnel reporting numerous encounters with luminous objects. One incident allegedly described to Corbell involved an unknown object flooding a Navy ship's bridge with extraordinarily intense light, so powerful that a commanding officer raised her hand to shield her eyes but could not see her own hand before her face.



Another recently disclosed incident during a Washington hearing featured military drone footage capturing a Hellfire missile striking and merely ricocheting off a UFO flying over Yemen. Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison presented the shocking previously unseen footage from October 30, 2024 during last year's congressional UAP hearing with military whistleblowers.

The black-and-white recording showed the 100-pound class air-to-ground precision weapon bouncing off the mysterious orb, which continued traveling at extreme velocity off Yemen's coast roughly 1,000 miles from the Persian Gulf. Jeffrey Nuccetelli, a former Air Force military police officer with 16 years service, described the Hellfire video as "exceptional evidence" of UFO existence.

There's something inherently invasive about horror that travels through headphones—sound that bypasses the room and goes straight into your skull. That's the pressure point A24 leans into with the official trailer for “undertone,” Ian Tuason's feature debut (and an established sci-fi author) that weaponizes the intimacy of listening: a popular paranormal podcast host starts receiving terrifying recordings from an anonymous source, and they don't stay contained to the show.

The setup is elegantly nasty. Per the film's logline, the host of a hit spooky podcast becomes haunted by the mysterious audio files sent her way—recordings that escalate into something genuinely threatening. And in Fantasia's more detailed description of the premise, the story centers on Evy, a skeptic co-hosting a paranormal podcast while caring for her dying mother, when an email delivers a batch of unsettling files that begin to bleed into her already-fragile reality.

Nina Kiri (The Handmaid's Tale, per Fantasia) leads the film, alongside Adam DiMarco, Michèle Duquet, Keana Lyn Bastidas, and Jeff Yung. The feature is written and directed by Tuason, with Dan Slater and Cody Calahan producing.

A world first has taken place, and it's incredible – an ‘alien message' has been received from Mars, and successfully decoded. But don't worry, the Martians aren't coming. 

The Sign in Space project dates back to 2023, with the simulation message sent down to Earth, and global participation was needed to successfully interpret it.

After the event was livestreamed, one clever duo successfully cracked the code 

The project grabbed worldwide attention as people tried to figure out the true meaning.

ET phone home. No, quite literally. 

Clever scientists and artists have made it possible for Earth to receive an alien message from Mars as part of a simulation in a huge project. 

Spearheaded by Daniela de Paulis, the Sign in Space project is in collaboration between the SETI Institute, the European Space Agency, the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, and the Green Bank Observatory to make the magic happen.

The supposed first-ever alien message from Mars was transmitted as a simulation of a message and was made possible by an ESA spacecraft. 

The extraterrestrial message, which was a simulation of a radio wave, was transmitted towards our planet by the Trace Gas Orbiter.

“Receiving a message from an extraterrestrial civilization would be a profoundly transformational experience for all humankind,” said visionary artist Daniela de Paulis.

“A Sign in Space offers the unprecedented opportunity to tangibly rehearse and prepare for this scenario through global collaboration, fostering an open-ended search for meaning across all cultures and disciplines.”

Well, the message was transmitted on 4 May 2023 as a radio signal, and thousands of participants attempted to decode the message.

One day, a father and daughter team cracked the true meaning. 

The duo, known only as ‘John and Sarah,' as they wished to remain anonymous, figured out the hidden meaning successfully. 

The pair worked out that it was an image of five amino acids, presented in a universal organic diagram displaying molecular notation. 

This was also joined by single pixel points located among the transmitted clusters and diagrams.

“My decoded message is a simple image with five amino acids displayed in a universal (hopefully) organ.

“The decoded image is only visible for one frame lasting about 1/10th of a second, but I can pause and manually step as well as reverse my CA engine,” said John.

So, the message was successfully cracked, but the project is an onoing exploration topic.

For those wanting to get involved, you can submit your own theories to the project online.

EXCLUSIVE: Singapore's Mokster Films is to launch sales on upcoming Taiwanese supernatural horror feature The Damp at the European Film Market (EFM) next week.

The feature is written and directed by Fu Tien-yu, a Taiwanese filmmaker who was honoured with Tokyo's Kurosawa Akira Award in 2024. Production is due to start this March in Taiwan, with a theatrical release planned for 2027.

Set at an all-girls school in a perpetually damp mountain region, the story follows an introverted teenager who discovers that several students had died in the nearby river months earlier, a scandal that the school attempts to erase. However, the dead students return through moisture and humidity, which becomes the medium through which their ghostly presence exists, turning themselves into an unavoidable invasive force against the living.

The script was written by Fu with veteran screenwriter Yang Qian-ling, whose credits include Lo Chi-leung's The Vanished Murderer and Nick Cheung's Keeper Of Darkness.

It is an Asobi production, with Steve Wang as producer who will also handle the theatrical distribution in Taiwan through his company Activator. The Taipei-based company previously handled the distribution of Detention and the marketing and promotion of Incantation, both among the highest-grossing Taiwanese horror titles of all time.

Director Fu is also producing along with Jeff Yeh, line producer of 2024's biggest Taiwanese film Gatao: Like Father Like Son, and Angie Chen.

This horror film is a departure for director Fu, who is better known for drama.

Fu said of her move into horror: “It grows naturally out of my drama work, which has always focused on everyday emotions. Horror allows those feelings especially fear and emotional pressure in women's lives to surface in a more immediate and visceral way. I want to create a horror film where fear accumulates rather than strikes.”

Fu made her directorial feature debut with Somewhere I Have Never Travelled in 2009, while 2012's The Happy Life Of Debbie was named best mini-series/TV movie at the Golden Bell Awards. Her most recent feature is 2023's Day Off, which won critical acclaim and prizes at Osaka Asian Film Festival, Udine's Far East Film Festival, Taipei Film Festival and Golden Horse Awards.

In 2024, she was awarded the Kurosawa Akira Award by Tokyo International Film Festival to recognise her continuing the tradition of the Taiwan New Cinema from the 1980s. She is only the second Taiwanese filmmaker to receive this award, after auteur Hou Hsiao-hsien.
