                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Major stock indexes and bitcoin fell Thursday amid broad risk-off sentiment, as investors weighed the latest Big Tech earnings and downbeat labor data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, benchmark S&P 500, and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average were down a respective 0.8%, 0.7% and 0.6% in recent trading, with the Dow shedding 300 points. The Nasdaq was on pace for its worst week since last April. Yesterday, technology shares led the Nasdaq and S&P 500 lower for a second straight session as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped 17%, while the Dow ended higher. AMD shares were down nearly 4% further in recent trading. In addition, U.S. employers announced more than 108,000 layoffs in January, per Challenger, Gray & Christmas data, their highest level for that month since 2009. Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) fell 3% Thursday, a day after the Google parent posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter results but said its 2026 capex would be between $175 billion and $185 billion, roughly double its 2025 level. Investors have been concerned about companies' AI spending in recent months. Qualcomm (QCOM) stock sank 7% after its current-quarter forecasts came up short of analysts' estimates, which executives attributed to the global memory shortage. In other post-earnings moves, shares of Peloton Interactive (PTON) plummeted 23%, Estee Lauder (EL) retreated 22%, Snap (SNAP) sank 10%, and Shell (SHEL) declined 4.5%. Investors are eagerly anticipating results after the close today from Amazon (AMZN), whose shares fell 3.5% to lead Dow decliners. Bitcoin continued its descent, falling below $67,000—its lowest level since Donald Trump was re-elected U.S. president on Nov. 5, 2024 and recently trading around $66,700. Shares of bitcoin treasury firm Strategy (MSTR) sank 13% to pace Nasdaq decliners ahead of its earnings after markets close today. The yield on the 10-year Treasury—which impacts interest rates on a variety of consumer loans including mortgages—fell to roughly 4.22% from Wednesday's close of 4.28%. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. benchmark, fell 2.4% to $63.60 a barrel. Layoff announcements were up and job openings down this winter as the job market's hiring freeze deepened, according to two barometers of the job market Thursday.The number of job openings fell to 6.5 million in December from 6.9 million in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday. Another red flag popped up in consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas's layoff report for January, which showed companies announced 108,000 job cuts, the most for any January since 2009, and the fewest hires for that month since the firm began tracking hires that year. "The labor market spent much of 2025 bending, but not breaking—and ended the year perilously close to a definitive breaking point," Cory Stahle, senior economist at job site Indeed, wrote in a commentary. The layoff rate remained low, suggesting that employers have not turned to large-scale cuts yet, but the risks of that are growing, several economists said. Google Says Spending Could Double This Year Amid Its AI Push. Alphabet (GOOGL) shares slumped Thursday after the Google and YouTube parent laid out massive spending plans to support its AI ambitions. The shares were down over 5% in recent trading, after the company forecast $175 billion to $185 billion in capital expenditures this year as it builds out its AI infrastructure, roughly double the $91.45 billion Alphabet spent in 2025. Analysts from JPMorgan, Citi, and Wedbush lifted their price targets following Wednesday's earnings report, given what they viewed as strong signals of AI demand. "We acknowledge the concern around investments," Citi analysts wrote. "But given clear AI demand signals, we believe Google should be investing in product and in alleviating capacity challenges." Consumer Staples Is Only S&P 500 Sector in Green Today Four declined by more than 2%, with the Consumer Discretionary Sector down nearly 3%. Hershey (HSY) advanced 8% to pace consumer staples after the chocolate giant reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and issued a rosy 2026 outlook. Costco Wholesale (COST) and Coca-Cola (KO) also were among the top gainers in the sector, up nearly 2% and 1.5%, respectively. Fed officials held the central bank's key interest rate steady at their most recent meeting last month, after cutting it by a quarter-point at the previous three meetings to boost the job market. Concerns about inflation kept them from cutting the rate again, several Fed members said this week. The fed funds rate influences borrowing costs on all kinds of loans. This week, Fed officials continued to mull whether inflation or the threat of joblessness posed the biggest risk to the central bank's dual mandate to keep prices stable and employment high, and how much they should cut interest rates in the months ahead, if at all. "While we've made a lot of progress on inflation, it still remains above our target," Thomas Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said in a speech in South Carolina on Tuesday, according to prepared remarks. Qualcomm's Disappointing Outlook Stokes Worries About a Global Memory Shortage. Qualcomm's stock is getting hammered amid worries about a worsening memory shortage. Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) plunged over 9% in recent trading after the chipmaker gave a disappointing outlook for the current quarter, and pointed to a tightening supply of memory components that's impacting the smartphone market. Qualcomm, which makes processors that are used in smartphones, laptops, and cars, said it expects a weaker smartphone market in the short term as companies navigate a global memory shortage that's expected to drive phone and laptop prices higher. The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization—at about $1.39 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap—recently changed hands at prices not seen since late 2024, dropping below $70,000 apiece. The price hasn't been cut in half since its record highs of around $125,000, recorded last fall, but the retreat is nevertheless severe. The latest round of defections from bitcoin has come as investors have lately moved away from risk assets and, in some cases, shifted portfolio allocations toward more defensive plays. Bulls still talk about bitcoin's long-term potential—not just to recover, but to post the kind of parabolic returns it long saw. One of those may fuel one or both of those narratives later today: Big bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR), previously known as MicroStrategy, is set to report quarterly results after today's close. Ciena will be replacing Dayforce after it was acquired and taken private by Thoma Bravo in a deal that closed Wednesday. In addition, S&P SmallCap 600 component Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (ARWR) on Monday will replace Ciena in the S&P MidCap 400, while ADT (ADT) will replace Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals in the S&P SmallCap 600. Bessent faced a mixture of supportive and critical questions from lawmakers during his testimony. Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from New York, pointed out that the economy has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs every month since Trump imposed sweeping import taxes on most U.S. trading partners last year. Bessent said a slew of factories have broken ground in response to the tariffs, which are intended to tip the scales in favor of domestic manufacturing over imports. Those factories will take some time to get up and running, he said. Peloton Interactive (PTON) reported weaker-than-estimated results for its holiday quarter. Its current-quarter and full-year projections aren't so hot, either. Peloton shares sank 9% in premarket trading Thursday after the connected fitness company posted less revenue and a wider loss than analysts were expecting. The New York-based firm reported a fiscal 2026 second-quarter loss of 9 cents per shares on revenue that slipped 3% year-over-year to $656.5 million. For the current quarter and full year, Peloton sees revenue of $624 million and a range of $2.40 billion to $2.44 billion, respectively. Visible Alpha consensus is for $637 million and $2.48 billion, respectively. Amazon, UPS and Other Major Companies Are Making Big Job Cuts. The labor market limped into 2026, and big layoff announcements in recent weeks have added fresh anxiety to the fragile jobs picture. Amazon.com (AMZN) said it plans to eliminate about 16,000 corporate roles, while United Parcel Service (UPS) announced 30,000 new job cuts, following an even larger reduction last year. Chemical manufacturing company Dow (DOW) slashed 4,500 jobs, or roughly 12% of its workforce, while Home Depot (HD) and Nike (NKE) each cut hundreds more. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 71% of Americans worry artificial intelligence could permanently replace their job. With AI frequently cited in corporate earnings calls and layoff announcements, it's easy to connect the dots. But when economists and labor researchers dig into the data, a more complicated—and far less AI-driven picture—emerges. Stock Futures Little Changed as Investors Assess Tech Earnings Futures contracts connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.1%.</p>

BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), the world's largest Ethereum-focused treasury company is now sitting on nearly $8 billion in paper losses after ether ETH$1,953.56 fell below $2,000 on Thursday.

The firm, helmed by well-followed Wall Street bull Thomas Lee, accumulated 4.29 million ETH at an estimated cost of $16.4 billion, according to data from DropStab. That stash is now worth just $8.4 billion at current prices. 

BMNR stock fell another 9% Thursday to its lowest point since the company pivoted to an Ethereum strategy. It has now tumbled 88% from its July peak, as investor concern grows on the firm's ETH exposure and collapsing prices.

Despite the sharp drawdown, BitMine is under no immediate pressure to liquidate its assets. Unlike many other digital asset treasuries, the company used equity issuance — and not borrowed funds — to fund its ether purchase spree and other investments.

The firm also holds $538 million in cash and has begun generating income from staking more than 2.9 million ETH, according to its Monday update.

"There is no pressure to sell any ETH at these levels, because there are not debt covenants or other restrictions/provisions," Thomas Lee said in a statement, "BitMine is in a position to ride out crypto volatility while earning recurring income and staking rewards."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoins bore the brunt of market stress over the past 24 hours as a sharp leverage unwind triggered widespread liquidations across major tokens. The liquidations wiped out more than $1.4 billion in positions and exposing heavy long-side positioning among traders. Data from Coinglass shows that the sell-off accelerated rapidly. Over a full 24-hour period, total liquidations stood at approximately $1.44 billion. While Bitcoin's decline provided broader market pressure, liquidation data suggests that altcoins absorbed a disproportionate share of the forced unwinding. Ethereum led losses among major tokens, recording more than $120 million in liquidations within the last hour alone, as leveraged long positions were flushed across multiple exchanges. On a 24-hour basis, long liquidations dominated across major trading venues, with platforms such as Binance, Bybit, Hyperliquid, OKX, and Gate all recording significantly higher long-side losses than short-side liquidations. The pattern points to a coordinated unwind rather than isolated exchange-specific events. Beyond headline figures, the pace of liquidations has become a key concern. In several instances, liquidation spikes occurred within narrow time windows, amplifying downside momentum as forced selling fed into falling prices. Such rapid cascades often exacerbate volatility, particularly in altcoins where order books tend to be thinner and leverage usage higher than in Bitcoin markets. Historical liquidation data over the past 90 days shows similar episodes coinciding with abrupt market corrections. This type of leverage reset is a short-term stabilizing force, albeit one that often comes at the cost of sharp price drawdowns. With a significant portion of leveraged longs already cleared, near-term price action may stabilize if selling pressure eases. However, continued volatility remains a risk should broader market weakness persist or if traders attempt to re-enter positions too aggressively. Trading, buying or selling cryptocurrencies should be considered a high-risk investment and every reader is advised to do their own research before making any decisions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A leaked pitch to reshape Ethereum's leadership exposed deep divisions over politics, power and ether's static price US crypto developer Danny Ryan submitted a proposal in November 2024 to Vitalik Buterin, the founder and symbolic leader of Ethereum, a prominent blockchain powering the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. The EF could now “exercise a stronger voice” without compromising its ethos of decentralization, Ryan said – and he was open to leading that charge if appointed as the foundation's new executive director. Ryan told the Guardian that he could see how political tides were changing “overnight”, which informed his proposal. In part, his thesis drew from personal experience: He'd been served by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2024, only to have the case summarily dropped, which he suspects was a pragmatic move to avoid alienating the tech sector during Joe Biden's re-election campaign. By November, with Donald Trump poised to return to the White House as the self-appointed “crypto president”, Ryan could identify “a massive American-shaped opportunity”. Trump's re-election was heavily bankrolled by crypto companies and advocacy groups; the sector had established lucrative ties to the Trump family, and expected a slate of policy changes in its favor. A second Trump administration was likely to bolster the crypto industry's ability to expand into the traditional financial sector, and vice versa, further buoying up Ethereum's prospects. Despite strong winds at the industry's back, the value of Ethereum's proprietary cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), is down 20% from one year ago, part of a widespread slump in crypto's value. The price has remained almost unchanged since November 2024, when Ryan made his pitch, which is the same as it was in 2022, an asset at risk of depreciating in a world of high risk. Ether is the world's second largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization hovering around $400bn. Founded in 2013 by programmer Buterin, ether is also the largest cryptocurrency to have a known leader. Following Ethereum's launch, Buterin and others established the EF as a non-profit tasked with cultivating the Ethereum ecosystem – a centralized, neutral entity designed to grow a decentralized technological movement – and writing grants to ecosystem participants in line with that mission; the EF holds more than $600m worth of ETH in treasury. The two most prominent ideological camps within Ethereum follow this rule of thumb. On one end is Ethereum's traditional and more libertarian ideological base, the “Cypherpunks”, who see privacy, decentralized protocols and freedom from state power as tools for individual freedom. That included Aya Miyaguchi, the organization's longtime executive director and a steward of Ethereum's traditional ideological core. Eric Conner, a veteran Ethereum developer, suggested “it's revolt time” if the foundation failed to appoint Ryan as its new executive director. Some social media users posted death threats against Miyaguchi, which incensed Buterin. Some Ethereum community members had been calling for leadership change at the EF over the course of 2024 – long before Ryan's strategic meetings with EF leadership. Many pragmatists thought the foundation was not proactive enough in growing Ethereum's adoption, including among financial institutions. Others blamed Miyaguchi for Ether's relatively static price, as ETH had not skyrocketed in value the way bitcoin and other coins had with Trump's rise. Paul Brody, who leads blockchain initiatives at Ernst & Young and is the chairman of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a coalition of large businesses adopting Ethereum-based technology, said that, while critiques against Miyaguchi were “tinged with misogyny”, calling for a leadership change because of Ethereum's static price resembles standard investor discontents. In January 2025, Buterin responded to this community pressure, framing the threats levied against Miyaguchi as “pure evil”. The former EF employee told the Guardian that EF management organized a foundation-wide retreat “in order to force” Buterin into naming a new executive director quickly, as Buterin “couldn't really make up his mind”, and Miyaguchi had wanted to step back “for a while”. Another former EF employee, likewise speaking on the condition of anonymity, similarly noted that Buterin's tweets were a departure from his typical “cosplaying” that he didn't control Ethereum. Buterin and Miyaguchi have a close relationship, the former employee alleged, which informed Buterin's reluctance to find Miyaguchi's replacement more expediently, the source hypothesized. They claimed Buterin “isn't over” the rejection of his work visa by US authorities in 2012 and remains “resolutely” against EF staff talking to US politicians. The former employee suspected this disfavor counted against Ryan, an American. The EF's new leaders were brought on specifically with a “mandate of being more open, communicating more, and [being] responsible to the business world”, which is home to “builders focused on real-world use cases”, Stańczak told the Guardian in November. The EF now operates a landing page designed for institutions interested in understanding and potentially adopting Ethereum technology. The foundation's growth and clear hierarchy also depart from its longstanding decentralized ethos; during her time as executive director, Miyaguchi had called for the EF to “subtract” in size and power over time. “In this sense, [the foundation] has become more important than ever. Ryan emphasized in an interview that he has “the utmost respect for Aya Miyaguchi”. The public leak of their discussions around the EF's future led to “a lot of toxicity” that “threw off” their dialogue, he added. Buterin and Ryan decided to amicably “close the door” on their discussions by January 2025. Connected to other Wall Street-facing Ethereum evangelists by senior EF leadership, Ryan announced in February 2025 that he was co-founding Etherealize, an EF-aligned organization building and marketing Ethereum-based products for traditional financial institutions. Etherealize frequently exercises a strong voice for Ethereum as it does the rounds on Capitol Hill and Wall Street. Vivek Raman, a co-founder of Etherealize, said Ethereum-focused sales cycles with large financial institutions once spanned years and involved frequent rejection, but are now accelerating, a sign Wall Street is warming to cryptocurrency. Major firms like JP Morgan, Fidelity and BlackRock are seeking to offer financial products issued on blockchains, in a process called “tokenization”, he said, predicting that a wave of these products will enter the market in 2026 after December 2025 launches. However, ether, like other major cryptocurrencies, is still crawling back from a sudden drop in value.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, announced Thursday it is cutting 25% of its workforce and exiting operations in the UK, EU and Australia as part of a major restructuring. The move comes as Bitcoin dropped below $70,000 Thursday morning, erasing gains made since its $69,000 all-time high in late 2021. In its “Gemini 2.0” update, the company emphasized that smaller, AI-augmented teams are now more effective and aligned with its evolving mission. The news comes as Gemini confirmed it will shut down its NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway on February 23, following a prolonged decline in NFT trading volumes. Users have been instructed to withdraw their assets before the shutdown, though NFT support will continue through Gemini Wallet. The announcement coincided with fresh pressure on crypto markets. Gemini stock, which debuted in September 2025, fell nearly 7% on Thursday, extending losses to nearly 80% from its IPO price and marking a new all-time low. Gemini said narrowing its geographic footprint and product focus would help lower expenses and accelerate its path to profitability.

The move comes as Bitcoin dropped below $70,000 Thursday morning, erasing gains made since its $69,000 all-time high in late 2021. In its “Gemini 2.0” update, the company emphasized that smaller, AI-augmented teams are now more effective and aligned with its evolving mission. The news comes as Gemini confirmed it will shut down its NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway on February 23, following a prolonged decline in NFT trading volumes. Users have been instructed to withdraw their assets before the shutdown, though NFT support will continue through Gemini Wallet. The announcement coincided with fresh pressure on crypto markets. Gemini stock, which debuted in September 2025, fell nearly 7% on Thursday, extending losses to nearly 80% from its IPO price and marking a new all-time low. Gemini said narrowing its geographic footprint and product focus would help lower expenses and accelerate its path to profitability.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ICO's action comes amid mounting international scrutiny of Grok's image-generation capabilities, which critics say have been exploited to produce “deepfakes” and other visuals manipulated without individuals' consent. The regulator emphasized that failures in appropriate protections could leave people vulnerable to serious, immediate harm — particularly when children are involved. On January 7, 2026, the watchdog publicly confirmed it had contacted XIUC and X.AI to urgently request information about reported issues with Grok's outputs and the data governance measures supporting them. This action also runs alongside a separate probe by the UK's online safety regulator, Ofcom, which is examining whether the platform has complied with the Online Safety Act — including obligations to protect users from illegal or harmful content, such as non-consensual intimate images. Regulators in the European Union and other jurisdictions have also begun their own reviews into Grok's functionality and potential harms, sparking a wave of concern about AI content governance. Read: EU Opens Probe into Grok Image Manipulation and X's Recommender System The ICO's investigation underscores a growing regulatory focus on AI accountability, especially around generative models that can manipulate or create fabricated representations of real people. Europeans tend to be stricter about safeguarding personal details, shaped by years of GDPR-driven awareness. While American consumers focus on convenience, Europeans are more attuned to privacy. In the context of mounting scrutiny of X, it's worth noting that participants in our survey – conducted from June to September 2025 polling more than 7,000 internet users across seven countries – expressed skepticism regarding X's conduit on privacy and security, with 52% naming it a “least trusted” player. As European regulators assess whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent misuse of Grok's image-manipulation capabilities, companies offering similar AI technologies will likely face mounting pressure to implement strong guardrails.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several states have passed laws regulating these machines, which officials say are increasingly being used to scam consumers. Legislation letting cryptocurrency into public pension investments — and imposing new limitations on crypto ATM operations — has crossed the halfway point at the Indiana Statehouse and is expected to advance to the Senate floor next week. Senate lawmakers heard testimony Wednesday on a package of House digital currency bills but didn't yet vote them out of the Insurance and Financial Institutions Committee. The panel's head, Sen. Scott Baldwin, called that decision a “tactical pause” to refine the proposals and ensure they conform with his pending reorganization of consumer lending laws. One, House Bill 1042, would allow members of certain public pension plans to choose self-directed brokerage accounts offering crypto investment options. Other provisions would block state agencies — besides the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions — from banning a digital mining business' operations, restricting crypto transactions for legal services or taking custody of digital wallets using certain technology. Local governments, meanwhile, wouldn't be able to stop digital mining firms including data centers from operating in industrial-zoned areas — or prevent individual Hoosiers from mining crypto in their homes. “These ATMs have become a powerful tool for scammers to prey on seniors and people in crisis,” Rep. Wendy McNamara, the bill's author. “These victims often believe they're paying a bill, helping a loved one or protecting their savings — when, in reality, they're being manipulated into sending money to criminals.” Other provisions step up security amid widespread scam complaints. “We are currently living in a ‘scamdemic,'” said Sgt. Nathan VanCleave, who works on the Evansville Police Department's financial crimes unit. The city recorded 35 crypto ATM scam cases last year, totaling more than $400,000 in losses. “This is where we come into play,” VanCleave said. “We have to pass legislation that will protect our citizens.” Evansville has passed its own ordinance requiring signage, receipts and a phone number on the machine — “so you can call somebody to cry with you after you've lost all of your money” — but seeks statewide legislation. But crypto ATM operators said the measure would drive them out of business in Indiana. They would have to verify a customer's identity before accepting payment, and couldn't charge transaction fees of more than 10% of the transaction's value. Larry Lipka, a general counsel for CoinFlip, told lawmakers the 10% cap was too low. The company's average transaction fee rate across its 100-plus Indiana kiosks is between 17% and 19%. So, we're only earning the transaction fee,” he said. The firm also has to pay for armed guards to pick up the cash deposited, which gets more expensive for kiosks located in remote areas. He pushed back on the limits for customer transaction amounts, saying, “Why should someone using a product for two months, two years, five years be limited in the amount that they want to buy? That is anti-American and anti-freedom.” CoinFlip instead suggested brief limits for newcomers. “A person who's been using a product for days or weeks or months knows what they're doing, and they should not be given a refund of the full amount when we can't recover that crypto once it's sent,” Lipka said. He noted federal regulations only require refunds for unauthorized transactions — like stolen credit cards or hacked bank accounts — but that scam victims have authorized their losses, even if it was done under duress.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin sank below $67,000 on Thursday as investor confidence continued to falter in the asset once hailed as "digital gold" and a unique store of value. Digital assets, including bitcoin, have fallen deeper into the red as investors re-assess the practical utility of a token that has been championed not only as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainties but also as an alternative to fiat currencies and traditional safe-havens such as gold. That hasn't panned out lately, since bitcoin peaked just north of $126,000 in early October. The cryptocurrency is down 20% this week alone. "This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing," Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure  said Wednesday in a note to clients. Growing investor caution comes as many of the sensationalized claims about bitcoin have failed to materialize. The token has largely traded in the same direction as other risk-on assets, such as stocks,  particularly during recent geopolitical and macroeconomic flare ups in Venezuela, the Middle East and Europe, and its adoption as a form of payment for goods and services has been minimal. Bitcoin is down nearly 30% over the past year, while gold has surged 68% in the same period. Ether has pulled back 23% this week, on track for its worst week since November 2022, when it slumped 24%. Some traders have suggested $70,000 is a key level to watch and a break below that could trigger further declines for bitcoin. James Butterfill, head of research at Coinshares, said $70,000 is shaping up as a "key psychological level," adding that "if we fail to hold it, a move toward" the $60,000 to $65,000 range "becomes quite likely." The State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF dropped 2.8% Wednesday, one day after losing 2.2%. Meanwhile, precious metals continue to be volatile too, with silver plunging again on Thursday and gold under pressure. Forced liquidations — when traders' positions are automatically sold as bitcoin hits a set price — continue to weigh on markets. As of Thursday, more than $2 billion in long and short positions in cryptocurrencies have been liquidated this week, according to data from Coinglass. Bitcoin has been on a steady decline for more than three months, and is now more than 45% below its October high. Other cryptocurrencies, including ether and XRP, have fallen even more. "[The] straight line bull run that a lot of people expected hasn't really materialized yet. Bitcoin isn't trading on hype anymore, the story has lost a bit of that plot, it is trading on pure liquidity and capital flows," Maja Vujinovic, CEO of digital assets at FG Nexus, told CNBC's "Worldwide Exchange." While many in the crypto market have previously credited large institutional investors with supporting the price of bitcoin, now it is those same participants who appear to be selling. "Institutional demand has reversed materially," CryptoQuant said in a report on Wednesday. U.S. exchange-traded funds, which purchased 46,000 bitcoin this time last year, are net sellers in 2026, CryptoQuant said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The broader crypto market came under heavy pressure today as a sharp wave of crypto liquidations ripped through leveraged positions, dragging Bitcoin, Ethereum, and major altcoins lower within hours. Today's market selloff triggered over $700 million crypto positions liquidated over the past 24 hours, with long positions accounting for the clear majority of losses. Ethereum followed closely, with roughly $208 million in ETH positions liquidated as price dropped near $2,100. XRP and other large-cap altcoins contributed the remainder, as cascading stops were triggered across derivatives markets. The liquidation skew was heavily long-biased, signaling a mechanical leverage reset rather than panic-driven selling. In short, today's move reflects leverage flushing out of the system, not a mass exit by long-term holders. Bitcoin's decline accelerated after BTC lost key intraday support and slipped nearly 5% to the $71,000 zone, triggering a sharp liquidation cascade across futures markets. Liquidation data shows roughly $409 million worth of Bitcoin positions were force-closed during the move, with long traders accounting for the overwhelming majority. As Bitcoin price broke below short-term support levels near the mid-$74K range, liquidation clusters stacked around $73K and $72K were rapidly cleared. This forced selling amplified downside momentum, dragging price swiftly toward $71K before bids began to stabilize. In classic fashion, futures markets led the decline, while spot liquidity lagged behind. For now, Bitcoin's ability to hold above the $70K–$71K region will be closely watched. A failure to stabilize around $70k could expose deeper downside, while consolidation here may signal that the bulk of forced selling has already played out. Ethereum Price Drops to $2100 as Leverage Reset Mirrors Bitcoin Data indicates approximately $208 million in Ethereum futures positions were liquidated, again dominated by long-side losses. Instead, it reflected a broader deleveraging event as traders reduced exposure across majors once Bitcoin broke lower. From here, Ethereum's short-term outlook hinges on whether $2,000 can hold as a stabilization zone. A sustained failure below this level would keep pressure on the downside, while consolidation could allow volatility to compress as leverage resets. The $700M liquidation wave acted as a reset mechanism, forcing out crowded bullish positions without triggering mass spot exits. However, until Bitcoin and Ethereum reclaim broken supports, volatility is likely to remain elevated. History shows that how price behaves after leverage resets often defines the next major trend. A sharp $700 million liquidation wave triggered a cascade of forced selling in leveraged futures markets, rapidly pulling down Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoin prices within hours. It means traders who bet on prices rising using borrowed funds were forced to sell as prices fell, triggering more automatic sell orders and accelerating the downturn in a short-term cascade.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The next phase of the Data (Use and Access) Act (DUAA) implementation has commenced today, 5 February 2026. This means that most of the remaining data protection provisions of the Act have come into force, except for the requirement for organisations to have a complaints procedure which is due to commence on 19 June 2026 and some ICO governance provisions which will follow at a later date. Businesses can take the opportunities the reforms offer to grow and innovate products and services whilst continuing to maintain good standards of protection for people's personal information. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) have outlined the provisions on their website. Our guidance on subject access requests (SARs) is ready to use and for law enforcement bodies, Part 3 codes of conduct has been updated. Details of upcoming consultations and final guidance timescales are set out in Our plans for new and updated guidance. The Act provides the ICO with new powers, including the ability to compel witnesses to attend interviews, request technical reports, and issue fines of up to £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR). We have published more information on those powers and how we are regulating as the DUAA comes into force. Organisations can find out more about the Act and what the changes mean for them on our website or sign up to the ICO newsletter and e-shots.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The remarks highlight a broader policy stance that favors private-sector innovation in digital finance rather than direct government involvement in issuing digital currency. Bessent's comments come at a time when central banks around the world are accelerating exploration of CBDCs as part of efforts to modernize payment systems. According to the Treasury Secretary, current payment networks, commercial banking infrastructure, and regulated stablecoin development already provide effective pathways for digital financial services without the need for a government-issued digital currency. Concerns over privacy and government oversight have also shaped opposition to a U.S. CBDC. Critics of central bank digital currencies have warned that direct government control over digital payment infrastructure could raise risks related to financial surveillance and transaction monitoring. The Treasury's stance also signals a shift toward greater reliance on regulated stablecoins as an alternative mechanism for expanding digital dollar usage. The decision to rule out a U.S. CBDC contrasts with ongoing initiatives in other major economies. These developments highlight differing approaches among global financial powers regarding how digital currencies should be integrated into national monetary systems. Supporters of CBDCs argue that government-issued digital currencies could improve payment efficiency, strengthen financial inclusion, and enhance monetary policy tools. The Treasury has indicated that regulatory clarity for stablecoins and other blockchain-based financial products may serve as a more practical pathway for digital asset integration within the U.S. financial system. The policy position also carries geopolitical implications as global competition intensifies around digital currency infrastructure. While other nations continue to explore CBDCs as tools for economic modernization, U.S. officials appear confident that the existing dollar ecosystem, supported by private-sector innovation and deep capital markets, remains sufficient to maintain international leadership. Bessent's stance signals that, while research into digital currency technologies may continue, the United States is unlikely to pursue a government-issued CBDC in the near term. Instead, policymakers appear focused on fostering a regulated environment that allows private digital finance initiatives to drive the next phase of financial innovation.</p>
