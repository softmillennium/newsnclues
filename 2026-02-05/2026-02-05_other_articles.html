                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bizarre footage appears to show three strange lights in the sky maintaining a consistent 'formation'. Although it has only just been released, the footage was originally taken back on August 23, 2012, and was shot by an MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the US Air Force. UFO sightings continue to be a source of mystery, with many people believing them to be evidence of 'alien life' visiting Earth. In this case, what's interesting about the lights was the way they appeared to hold their 'formation', maintaining a clear triangle shape between the three points of light. The footage was analyzed in detail on the WEAPONIZED podcast, which is hosted by Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp. In an episode from January 30, they looked at the strange footage. Corbell suggested that one light was flying in a 'playful' way, saying: "These objects appear to be aware and intelligent of one another, and they're keeping equidistant as they fly. "But all of a sudden you see one make this playful little move as if it drops back in the formation, and then comes forward again." "This is a military recorded sensor-generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO, like one big triangular craft with dots on each of the three ends. "Your government has labeled this UAP, and you were never supposed to see this footage," Corbell claimed. Analyzing the movement, he said: "You see a break in that formation, and a pretty distinct and interesting movement. Knapp added: "That's clearly not one craft with three points of light on the corners." The video was reportedly part of an archive of material which had been designated as 'non human' but not something like an animal or other regular encounter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Epstein Files reveal Jeffrey Epstein's fascination with psychic abilities, including paying a Hong Kong academic $20,000 to research mind-reading and “special powers,” alongside plans to rebrand his private island. The duo said to have an interest in "psychic activities" and mind-reading. It has been reported that there were conversations of a collaboration to "rebrand" the island of the American financer. The emails in the documents showed Epstein being interested in an academic's pursuit of finding people with so-called special abilities, such as mind-reading. As the discussion continued, Epstein ended up giving the Hong Kong academic tens of thousands of US dollars. He received a sum of $20,000 for a research project the same year that was related to artificial intelligence. “Is your island out of commission?” the scholar asked, without specifying a name. “Could be a good rebrand for your island,” the academic said. Another set of emails from 2017 shows the academic introducing Epstein to Lydia Laurenson, an author who previously detailed a meeting with the financier at his Manhattan residence. In one meeting with the financier, the author claimed he brought out a group of “barely legal” women. In an email from 2017, there was mention of an experiment the academic organised involving a self-proclaimed “psychokinesis master” who claimed to have the ability to “manipulate [electrical] current from a distance”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For centuries, communities across Russia, Finland, and parts of Eastern Europe dropped small live frogs into fresh milk to stop it from spoiling. It sounds bizarre, almost like a superstition passed down through generations, but the surprising part is this: science now suggests the practice may actually have had real antimicrobial benefits. Before refrigeration, milk spoiled fast, especially in humid or warm regions. Families relied on whatever tricks they had: plunging containers into cold wells, storing milk in clay pots, or adding natural substances such as birch charcoal. While many assumed this was merely rural folklore, the explanation behind it is much more grounded in chemistry and biology. Modern research, including studies published by Russian scientists in the last decade, found that secretions from certain frog species effectively inhibit the growth of harmful microbes, including those responsible for milk spoilage. Over time, the method stuck because it delivered results, even if no one understood why. It shows how early innovations often came from trial, error, and the natural world around us. The very frogs once used to keep milk fresh may help shape tomorrow's medical tools. We now have safe, reliable refrigeration and food safety standards. While the science is fascinating, dropping a frog into any food today risks contamination, toxins, or pathogens. Still, this old practice carries a strange, provocative lesson: nature often held solutions long before humans understood them, sometimes in places as unexpected as the skin of a tiny marsh frog.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tuttle Capital has launched the UFO Disclosure ETF (UFOD), an actively managed fund investing in companies linked to possible non-human intelligence technologies. The fund launches after former Bank of England analyst Helen McCaw warned on January 18 that UFO-related news could shock markets, and cause big price swings and sudden moves into "safe" assets. Riverside, Connecticut--(Newsfile Corp. - February 5, 2026) - Tuttle Capital Management, a pioneer in thematic exchange-traded funds (ETFs), today announced the launch of the Tuttle Capital UFO Disclosure ETF (CBOE: UFOD). The fund seeks capital growth by investing in companies positioned to benefit from the disclosure, confirmation, or commercialization of advanced non-human technologies. "Markets react to new information about wars, pandemics, regulation, and technology shocks," said Matthew Tuttle, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. "UAP disclosure could reshape budgets, priorities, and potentially entire industries. This new fund provides a disciplined, rules-aware way for investors to navigate that uncertainty, and the potential of UAP." The launch follows fresh warnings from former Bank of England senior analyst Helen McCaw, who has urged central banks to prepare for potential financial instability in the wake of disclosure. McCaw argues that an announcement could trigger an "ontological shock" for markets, driving extreme price swings, abrupt flights to perceived safe-haven assets, and a sudden loss of confidence in existing valuations. UFOD seeks to provide investors with a targeted way to express a theme at the intersection of defense, space, and unconventional technology. This thematic approach emphasizes industries that may experience substantial disruption or growth, including: Aerospace & Defense: Companies involved in the analysis of recovered materials or UAP reporting. Advanced Materials: Firms developing new alloys or compounds that might be derived from reverse-engineering efforts. The strategy is actively managed, allowing the portfolio team discretion to tilt toward companies better aligned with evolving disclosures, policy priorities, and commercialization opportunities. "We believe that the eventual disclosure or confirmation of non-human intelligence (NHI) technologies could have profound and far-reaching implications across multiple industries," said Tuttle. "With increased reporting requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and ongoing Congressional hearings, we are witnessing a shift in government transparency. UFOD is designed to capture the potential economic disruption that may result from these historic advancements." - Matthew TuttleTo learn more about UFOD and the rest of Tuttle Capital's suite of funds, schedule a quick call with a Tuttle Capital team member here. Tuttle Capital Management is an industry leader in offering thematic ETFs that allow investors to capitalize on shifting market dynamics. The firm is known for its active management approach and ability to construct portfolios around emerging trends. For more information about UFOD, including the prospectus and fund materials, please visit http://thetruthisoutthereufod.com/. As with all funds, a shareholder is subject to the risk that his or her investment could lose money. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any government agency. Government confirmation or denial of advanced alien technology is uncertain, and rumored breakthroughs might never materialize. This entire theme is highly speculative and subject to rumor cycles. Since it purchases equity securities, the Fund is subject to the risk that stock prices will fall over short or extended periods of time. Individual companies may report poor results or be negatively affected by industry and/or economic trends and developments. The prices of securities issued by such companies may suffer a decline in response. These factors contribute to price volatility, which is a principal risk of investing in the Fund. You would indirectly bear the costs of both trades. The Fund's ability to achieve its investment goal depends, in part, upon the- Adviser's skill in selecting an optimal mix of underlying funds.Sector Risk. These securities may fall in and out of favor with investors rapidly, which may cause sudden selling and dramatically lower market prices. Technology securities may be affected by intense competition, obsolescence of existing technology, general economic conditions and government regulation and may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. These companies are also heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely impact a company's profitability. In addition, a rising interest rate environment tends to negatively affect technology companies, those technology companies seeking to finance expansion would have increased borrowing costs, which may negatively impact earnings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New video from a US military drone has captured what UFO investigators are calling a formation of mysterious orbs flying over one of the most contentious regions in the world. Jeremy Corbell, investigative journalist, documentary filmmaker, and co-host of the WEAPONIZED Podcast, revealed footage this week allegedly obtained from intelligence sources that captured three objects flying over the Persian Gulf on August 23, 2012. The minute-long recording was taken by an MQ-9 Reaper drone being operated by the US Air Force while it was using its infrared sensors just after 6pm local time. According to Corbell and podcast co-host George Knapp, the Pentagon described these three lights as 'orbs' flying in formation instead of coming from one triangular-shaped object. Corbell added that the orbs appeared to be flying in an almost 'playful' manner and were intelligently coordinated, maintaining equal distances without any visible wings, tails, fins, or engine exhaust of any kind. He pointed out that the leaked recording clearly showed unidentified flying objects displaying one of the 'five observable' behaviors often linked to UFOs - unusual flight movements that defy basic physics. In this case, the one orb moving between the other two exhibited clear signs of instant acceleration without any visible thrust, something human aircraft haven't publicly shown an ability to do. The video was reportedly placed in a separate archive specifically for evidence of non-human craft or objects that clearly weren't birds, balloons, or other explainable items. 'This is a military recorded sensor-generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO, like one big triangular craft with dots on each of the three ends. In another incident recently revealed during a bombshell hearing in Washington, military drone footage captured the moment a Hellfire missile struck and merely bounced off the hull of a UFO flying over the nearby country of Yemen. Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri produced the shocking, never-before-seen footage from October 30, 2024 during the congressional UAP hearing with a group of military whistleblowers last year. Witness Jeffrey Nuccetelli, a former Air Force military police officer for 16 years, called the Hellfire video 'exceptional evidence' of the existence of UFOs. 'I imagine there are members of Congress that would like to see it, who I don't even know if they've asked to see the repository of UAP videos that we've mentioned to them in the past,' Knapp said. Officially, the US government and the Pentagon have declared that there has never been any physical evidence recovered that proves UFOs or extraterrestrial beings exist.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Military drone footage has captured what UFO researchers describe as a formation of mysterious orbs flying over one of the world's most volatile regions. Investigative journalist and WEAPONIZED Podcast co-host Jeremy Corbell unveiled the recording allegedly sourced from intelligence contacts, showing three objects traversing the Persian Gulf. The one-minute clip was recorded by an MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the US Air Force using infrared sensors shortly after 6pm local time. Corbell and podcast co-host George Knapp explained the Pentagon categorized the three lights as "orbs" flying in formation rather than originating from a single triangular craft. Corbell and Knapp observed the orbs appeared to fly in an almost "playful" manner with intelligent coordination, maintaining equal spacing without any visible wings, tails, fins or engine exhaust. The orb moving between the others showed clear signs of instant acceleration without visible thrust, a capability human aircraft have not publicly demonstrated. The video was reportedly filed in a dedicated archive containing evidence of non-human craft or objects definitively ruled out as birds, balloons or other explainable phenomena. Knapp stated in the January 30 episode: "This is a military recorded sensor generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO, like one big triangular craft with dots on each of the three ends. The recording location between Saudi Arabia and Iran has become a hotspot for UAP activity in recent years, with US Navy vessel personnel reporting numerous encounters with luminous objects. One incident allegedly described to Corbell involved an unknown object flooding a Navy ship's bridge with extraordinarily intense light, so powerful that a commanding officer raised her hand to shield her eyes but could not see her own hand before her face. Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison presented the shocking previously unseen footage from October 30, 2024 during last year's congressional UAP hearing with military whistleblowers. Jeffrey Nuccetelli, a former Air Force military police officer with 16 years service, described the Hellfire video as "exceptional evidence" of UFO existence. Knapp said: "I imagine there's members of Congress that would like to see it, who I don't even know if they've asked to see the repository of UAP videos that we've mentioned to them in the past. But it must be frustrating for them to know that this kind of stuff exists and they're not allowed to poke into it or get get a glimpse of it at all." The US government and Pentagon have officially declared no physical evidence has ever been recovered proving UFOs or extraterrestrial beings exist.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last updated on Feb 05, 2026 at 9:36 PM (UTC+4) Edited by Emma Matthews Clever scientists and artists have made it possible for Earth to receive an alien message from Mars as part of a simulation in a huge project. The supposed first-ever alien message from Mars was transmitted as a simulation of a message and was made possible by an ESA spacecraft. The extraterrestrial message, which was a simulation of a radio wave, was transmitted towards our planet by the Trace Gas Orbiter. “Receiving a message from an extraterrestrial civilization would be a profoundly transformational experience for all humankind,” said visionary artist Daniela de Paulis. “A Sign in Space offers the unprecedented opportunity to tangibly rehearse and prepare for this scenario through global collaboration, fostering an open-ended search for meaning across all cultures and disciplines.” One day, a father and daughter team cracked the true meaning. The duo, known only as ‘John and Sarah,' as they wished to remain anonymous, figured out the hidden meaning successfully. The pair worked out that it was an image of five amino acids, presented in a universal organic diagram displaying molecular notation. This was also joined by single pixel points located among the transmitted clusters and diagrams. “The decoded image is only visible for one frame lasting about 1/10th of a second, but I can pause and manually step as well as reverse my CA engine,” said John.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Singapore's Mokster Films is to launch sales on upcoming Taiwanese supernatural horror feature The Damp at the European Film Market (EFM) next week. The feature is written and directed by Fu Tien-yu, a Taiwanese filmmaker who was honoured with Tokyo's Kurosawa Akira Award in 2024. Production is due to start this March in Taiwan, with a theatrical release planned for 2027. Set at an all-girls school in a perpetually damp mountain region, the story follows an introverted teenager who discovers that several students had died in the nearby river months earlier, a scandal that the school attempts to erase. The script was written by Fu with veteran screenwriter Yang Qian-ling, whose credits include Lo Chi-leung's The Vanished Murderer and Nick Cheung's Keeper Of Darkness. It is an Asobi production, with Steve Wang as producer who will also handle the theatrical distribution in Taiwan through his company Activator. Director Fu is also producing along with Jeff Yeh, line producer of 2024's biggest Taiwanese film Gatao: Like Father Like Son, and Angie Chen. I want to create a horror film where fear accumulates rather than strikes.” Fu made her directorial feature debut with Somewhere I Have Never Travelled in 2009, while 2012's The Happy Life Of Debbie was named best mini-series/TV movie at the Golden Bell Awards. She is only the second Taiwanese filmmaker to receive this award, after auteur Hou Hsiao-hsien. EXCLUSIVE: Film is the directorial debut of US comedian and actor John Early. EXCLUSIVE: The darkly comic film is directed by Sarmad Sultan Khoosat. The festival will now run from May 4-9 2026, moving out of its traditional October date. Tuttle also shares some highlights from this year's diverse lineup of titles.
