                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ekaterina Alexandrova ended Alexandra Eala's run at the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Open in straight sets in the quarterfinals, while Sara Bejlek delivered a flawless performance to reach her first tour-level semifinal. 2 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova was well-prepared for the challenge that Alexandra Eala -- and the fervent Filipino diaspora crowd -- would pose in the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Open quarterfinals. It showed, as she notched a 6-3, 6-3 win in 1 hour and 30 minutes to reach her first semifinal of 2026. Abu Dhabi: Scores | Draws | Order of play "I saw the last match," Alexandrova said in her on-court interview, referring to Eala's remarkable comeback from 4-0 down in the third set -- saving a match point -- the previous day against Aliaksandra Sasnovich. So I enjoyed my time on the court, and I'm happy I could finish in two sets because it was really difficult in the end." Despite the scoreline, the contest remained tense throughout, largely owing to Alexandrova playing her best tennis to gain a lead, but Eala playing her best tennis with her back to the wall. Alexandrova's superior firepower -- she struck 33 winners to Eala's 15 -- enabled her to break first in both sets. But both times, Eala upped her intensity whenever she was behind, searching for a potential turning point. The gulf in quality between the two players' serves was crucial -- despite landing 70% of her first serves, Eala won just 45% of those points (fewer than the 53% she won behind her second delivery). Alexandrova, by contrast, won 70% of her first-serve points. That proved to be the case in the final game of the first set, in which Alexandrova saved four break points before converting her first set point with a simple one-two punch. At 3-3 in the second set, having had her lead pegged back, Alexandrova again found a returning level that was too hot for Eala to handle. Earlier, an all-qualifier quarterfinal saw 20-year-old Sara Bejlek deliver a flawless performance to defeat Sonay Kartal 6-0, 6-2 in just 63 minutes and advance to her first semifinal on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz. Ekaterina Alexandrova ended Alexandra Eala's run at the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Open in straight sets in the quarterfinals, while Sara Bejlek delivered a flawless performance to reach her first tour-level semifinal.</p>

She wore a pro-Ukraine shirt to her Australian Open press conference and refused to shake the hand of opponent Anna Bondar after her second-round win in Cluj-Napoca, citing Bondar's participation in a Russian government-sanctioned exhibition tournament in 2022. “It's kind of a celebration of the game for me,” said the 91st-ranked Oliynykova, who is projected to move up 20 spots in the WTA rankings because of this result.
