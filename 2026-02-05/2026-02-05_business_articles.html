                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic on Thursday announced the launch of Claude Opus 4.6, its latest artificial intelligence model that's better at coding, sustaining tasks for longer and creating higher-quality professional work products and outputs, the company said. Anthropic's models are particularly popular with enterprise customers, which make up roughly 80% of Anthropic's business, CEO Dario Amodei told CNBC last month. The company's AI coding tool, Claude Code, as well as advancements within its productivity tool, Claude Cowork, have also started to spook software investors, many of whom are growing worried about the potential for disruption within the sector. The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund is down more than 20% year to date. "Everybody has seen this transformation happen with software engineering in the last year and a half, where vibe coding started to exist as a concept, and people could now do things with their ideas," Scott White, Anthropic's head of product for enterprise, told CNBC in an interview. "I think that we are now transitioning almost into vibe working." Anthropic was founded by a group of former OpenAI researchers and executives in 2021, and it's best known for developing a family of AI models called Claude. Anthropic said Claude Opus 4.6 builds on its predecessor's coding skills and is better at planning, code review and debugging and operating reliably within large codebases. The model is also better at pulling relevant information from large sets of documents, doing research and running financial analyses, the company said. Claude Opus 4.6 now holds the top spot on the Finance Agent benchmark, for instance, which evaluates how well agents perform on core financial analyst tasks. Anthropic said the model is available through its chatbot interface at claude.ai, its application programming interface and across all major cloud platforms. "If I think about the last year, Claude went from a model that you can sort of talk to to accomplish a very small task or get an answer, to something that you can actually hand real significant work to," White said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Similar to other AI-focused firms, they'll also be listening closely to any updates on AI-related capex and costs following the recent spate of layoffs across the firm. ET closing bell, with the analyst call scheduled for 5 p.m. UBS analyst Stephen Ju and his team increased their estimates for both AWS growth and Amazon's capex, citing the company's plans to double capacity by 2027. UBS analyst Stephen Ju and his team increased their estimates for both AWS growth and Amazon's capex, citing the company's plans to double capacity by 2027. He added that his team expects Amazon to benefit from its investments in areas such as gross merchandise volume, advertising, and data, which are expected to help increase its free cash flow. Deutsche Bank analysts aren't expecting Amazon's Q4 earnings report to quickly juice the stock's performance, but they do anticipate a positive quarter overall, particularly in e-commerce demand and AWS-driven revenue growth. "While we don't expect 4Q earnings to be the magic bullet that changes these fortunes, we do expect another positive earnings outcome to continue to chip away at this underperformance and believe Amazon can be one of the largest outperformers in our coverage in 2026," stated analyst Lee Horowitz. While JPMorgan analysts remain bullish on Amazon heading into earnings, they note some concerns regarding Amazon's position and strategy when it comes to AI. "We remain bullish on AWS growth acceleration driven by core cloud growth & ramping AI contribution led by Project Rainier, Trn ramp, & new partnerships," they wrote.

BofA analyst Justin Post expects Amazon to come in slightly above Wall Street estimates on key metrics, predicting revenue of $213 billion and EBIT of $26 billion. He also thinks that AWS growth will accelerate in 2026, helping Amazon regain some momentum. "We expect 22% y/y AWS growth (above Street at 21% and an accel from 20% in 3Q) as greater capacity drives incremental sales, and we think investors could also be around 22% y/y," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon is slated to report fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday. Wall Street is also looking at other key revenue numbers: Cloud revenue growth will once again be a major focus for investors after the unit expanded 20.2% last quarter, up from 18% in the second period. Analysts are looking for 21.4% growth in the fourth quarter. Investors are also listening for any updates to Amazon's spending plans around artificial intelligence. As it rapidly invests in AI, Amazon has been aggressively slashing costs elsewhere inside the company. CEO Andy Jassy has said the layoffs are also part of a broader effort to reduce bureaucracy and speed up innovation, so it can operate like the "world's largest startup." The job reductions coincided with a week of controversy for Amazon, where it faced scrutiny over its $75 million investment in a documentary about the first lady and its response to the recent fatal shootings by federal agents in Minnesota. Last October, the company opened an $11 billion AI data center called Project Rainier, built exclusively to run workloads from Claude creator Anthropic. Amazon is simultaneously strengthening its ties to Anthropic rival OpenAI. The ChatGPT maker agreed last November to buy $38 billion worth of cloud computing services from Amazon over the next seven years. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Jassy are also in ongoing talks about the possibility for Amazon to invest up to $50 billion in the startup. CNBC reported Wednesday that the companies are weighing further collaboration, including using OpenAI's models to power Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, as well as other internal projects. Investors have been pressing Amazon for more clarity around its AI strategy. The company continues to fight the perception that it's an "AI laggard," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a Tuesday research note. "While we don't expect 4Q earnings to be the magic bullet that changes these fortunes, we do expect another positive earnings outcome to continue to chip away at this underperformance and believe Amazon can be one of the largest outperformers in our coverage in 2026." Amazon has released a flurry of AI products across its cloud computing, e-commerce, devices and software divisions as it looks to keep pace with similar releases from competitors like OpenAI and Google. Jassy told investors last quarter that the company expects to partner with third-party agents at some point. The company expects to convert some of those stores into Whole Foods locations, and it will continue to offer Fresh grocery delivery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Qualcomm shares plunged 7% after the chipmaker issued disappointing guidance as skyrocketing demand for artificial intelligence data centers eats away at memory chip supply for consumer electronics. On an earnings call with analysts, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said the weakness was "100% related to memory." The availability of dynamic random access memory, commonly used in smartphones, computers and wearable tech, was down from a year ago. Amon said handset demand remains strong, but memory supply is down as more resources go toward high-bandwidth memory used in data centers. "The problem is, all of the memory vendors have dedicated all the capacity to data centers," and supply availability for consumer electronics will be lower but costlier year over year, Amon told CNBC's Jon Fortt. The California-based company topped fiscal first-quarter estimates but forecasted adjusted earnings per share between $2.45 and $2.65 on revenue of $10.2 billion to $11 billion this current quarter. Analysts polled by LSEG had forecast $11.11 billion in sales and earnings of $2.89 per share. Amon said in an interview that he was unsure whether smartphone makers would hike prices, but that he expects the shortage to hamper supply. He also said the company's customers focus on higher-tier devices, making them more capable of absorbing memory price increases. Arm also fell post-earnings on smartphone memory chip worries. Apple warned last week that it can't get enough chips to meet strong iPhone demand. Amon told CNBC that he's "very confident" that Qualcomm will see AI and data center revenue in fiscal 2027.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Anthropic took aim at OpenAI's ad push in a new Super Bowl campaign on Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared a post on X calling the ads "funny" but "clearly dishonest." OpenAI said last month that it will begin testing ads with its free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the U.S., and Anthropic announced Wednesday that the company plans to keep its chatbot Claude ad-free. Anthropic seized on the opportunity and took a not-so-subtle swipe at its rival with its Super Bowl campaign, which centers around Anthropic's decision to keep ads out of Claude. Anthropic will air a 60-second pregame ad and a 30-second in-game ad that both feature the tag line, "Ads are coming to AI. Altman said that the commercials are "deceptive" and that OpenAI would "obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them." "I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it." Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI researchers who left the company due to disagreements over its direction. The two startups have been fierce rivals since Anthropic's inception, and they've both raised billions of dollars of capital as they've jostled for users, enterprise customers and market share. Altman said Wednesday that "Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI" and that the company "serves an expensive product to rich people." He said OpenAI also has more free users than Anthropic does, which means OpenAI has "a differently-shaped problem than they do." OpenAI said last month that ads within ChatGPT will be clearly labeled, appear at the bottom of the chatbot's answers and will not influence ChatGPT's responses. "As for our Super Bowl ad: it's about builders, and how anyone can now build anything," Altman wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novo Nordisk said Thursday it will take legal action against Hims & Hers after the telehealth provider announced it would launch a cheaper copycat version of Novo's Wegovy weight loss pill. "The action by Hims & Hers is illegal mass compounding that poses a significant risk to patient safety," Novo said in a statement. "Novo Nordisk will take legal and regulatory action to protect patients, our intellectual property and the integrity of the US gold-standard drug approval framework. "This is another example of Hims & Hers' historic behaviour of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs," the statement said. Shares of Novo Nordisk as well as rival Eli Lilly each fell roughly 7% after Hims announced the cheaper Wegovy copy for $49, far less than the $149 Novo sells the branded pill for. Hims stock initially spiked on the announcement, but pared gains after Novo said it would fight the rollout. Novo launched its Wegovy pill in the U.S. in early January, and CEO Mike Doustdar told CNBC on Wednesday that 170,000 people were already taking the medication. Hims & Hers had previously been offering compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo's blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, in an injectable format, and is now extending the offering to include the oral version. Semaglutide's patent is protected in the U.S. until 2032, but Hims says its copies are "personalized," and therefore legal. "This compounded product uses a different formulation and delivery system than FDA-approved oral semaglutide," Hims said. Novo highlighted that it manufactures its Wegovy pill using so-called SNAC technology, which facilitates absorption when administered orally. It's not clear exactly how Hims' copy formula could match the level of absorption. As recently as last year, Novo and Hims partnered to offer discounted weight loss jabs to the telehealth company's customers. Novo, however, ended the collaboration just two months later and said Hims used "deceptive" marketing that put patient safety at risk. Lilly doesn't yet have an oral GLP-1 option on the market but is expected to launch a rival pill, orforglipron, in the first half of this year, pending Food and Drug Administration approval. "With the ... current legal backdrop, there is no reason why HIMS shouldn't evaluate these launches for every subsequent weight loss product as the market continues to evolve," Leerink analyst Michael Cherny said in a note to clients. Eli Lilly didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Hims' announcement comes days after Novo forecast sales and profits declining between 5% and 13% in 2026, mainly due to pricing pressures in the U.S. and loss of exclusivity for semaglutide in certain markets outside of the U.S., like Canada and China, this year. In contrast, Lilly sees sales growing by about 25% this year. "We are creating affordability for the patients, millions of patients that are right now in need of GLP-1 products but simply could not afford it. But of course, there's a very long tail wind for years to come," he told CNBC. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Hims' announcement comes days after Novo forecast sales and profits declining between 5% and 13% in 2026, mainly due to pricing pressures in the U.S. and loss of exclusivity for semaglutide in certain markets outside of the U.S., like Canada and China, this year. In contrast, Lilly sees sales growing by about 25% this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI on Thursday announced a new enterprise platform called Frontier, its latest launch as part of its ongoing effort to win more business customers. OpenAI said the platform will make it easier for companies to manage, deploy and build artificial intelligence agents, which are tools that can independently complete tasks on behalf of a user. "Frontier is really a recognition that we're not going to build everything ourselves," Fidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of Applications, told reporters during a briefing. "We are going to be working with the ecosystem to build alongside them, and we embrace the fact that enterprises are going to need a lot of different partners." OpenAI has been making an aggressive push into enterprises in recent years, and announced in November that more than 1 million business customers around the world are using the company's technology. Last month, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC that enterprise customers account for roughly 40% of OpenAI's business, though she expects that figure to reach closer to 50% by the end of the year. OpenAI's new Frontier platform is "complementary" to its existing business offerings, including ChatGPT Enterprise, the company said. "What's really missing still, for most companies, is just a simple way to unleash the power of agents as teammates that can operate inside the business without the need to rework everything underneath," Denise Dresser, OpenAI's chief revenue officer, said during the briefing. Frontier is compatible with agents that OpenAI has built, agents that enterprises build themselves, as well as agents from third parties like Google, Microsoft and Anthropic. Simo said it's simply not possible for OpenAI to "build every single AI agent that companies need." The platform provides agents access to a "shared business context" within an organization by connecting siloed internal applications, ticketing tools and data warehouses, OpenAI said. With this context, AI agents will be able to handle complex tasks and reason over data within an open agent execution environment, according to a blog post. This means employees at a company could have agents use tools on a computer, run code and work with files, for instance. Frontier also includes built-in tools for evaluating and optimizing agents' performance, which should help them improve over time, OpenAI said. "What we're fundamentally doing is basically transitioning agents into true AI co-workers," Barret Zoph, OpenAI's general manager of business-to-business, told reporters. Zoph rejoined OpenAI in January after abruptly departing Thinking Machines Lab, an AI startup he co-founded alongside OpenAI's former CTO, Mira Murati. OpenAI said Frontier is initially launching to a small set of customers. Initial users include organizations like Uber, State Farm, Intuit and Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Taco Bell's parent company reported strong same-store sales growth for the chain yesterday, which makes me wonder how much my Crunchwrap Supreme orders contributed. The S&P 500 saw another losing session yesterday. Pressure on software stocks has intensified in recent days. While industry executives are telling investors not to panic, Wall Street appears unconvinced that the sector can continue to thrive as artificial intelligence pushes further into enterprise business. Alphabet beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter expectations on both lines yesterday. The Google parent's cloud business reported a better-than-expected quarter, though its YouTube advertising totals came in lower than forecast. Alphabet also announced that its capital expenditures spend for this year could be more than double its 2025 total, as the California-based company focuses on building out AI infrastructure. But Wall Street didn't seem to approve: Shares dropped more than 4% in premarket trading this morning. On the other hand, companies who provide AI-related products to Google jumped after it unveiled its bold AI spending plan. Broadcom, which helps Google make the tensor processing units its AI software runs on, climbed as much as 6% in extended trading. ET today, two days after its planned release date. Looking ahead, the all-important nonfarm payrolls report for January was pushed to next Wednesday, instead of tomorrow. Data on consumer prices and earnings will also be postponed, according to the BLS. The ADP said yesterday that private companies added fewer jobs than economists anticipated in January. This morning, Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that January layoffs were the highest for the month since 2009, surging more than 200% from December. President Donald Trump said in an interview yesterday that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei "should be very worried." The comments come as Trump has threatened strikes on the country unless it agrees to a deal governing its nuclear program. "They're negotiating with us," Trump told NBC News. Oil jumped following Trump's comments, with U.S. crude and the global benchmark Brent each rising more than 3% yesterday. But oil prices fell overnight as traders looked ahead to talks between Washington and Tehran set for Friday. As CNBC's Lee Ying Shan reports, Iran wants to focus the talks on its nuclear dispute with the West, while the U.S. also wants to discuss Iran's ballistic missile program and human rights record. For more than a year, conservative activist Robby Starbuck has pressured companies to back out of the Corporate Equality Index, a two-decade-old assessment of how businesses treat LGBTQ+ employees. The Human Rights Campaign reported a 65% drop in Fortune 500 companies participating in its 2026 CEI index compared to last year. The number of participating Fortune 500 firms fell from nearly 380 to just over 130. As CNBC's Laya Neelakandan reports, the HRC said that many companies who ceased involvement hold federal contracts. CEO RJ Scaringe gave CNBC's Robert Ferris an early look at the car.

Owning a home is the goal for many, but sometimes, it's smarter financially to rent. Apartment search website RentCafe analyzed 149 metropolitan areas with at least 300,000 residents to make that decision easier. The site factored in 17 metrics across three key categories — location and community, quality of life, and socioeconomics — to rank which metros were the most livable. No state had multiple entries in the top 10. Last year's first-place finisher, Portland, Maine, dropped a spot this year but still ranks high for location and community, as well as quality of life. Washington, DC, ranked toward the bottom in the socioeconomic category (weighted 20%), due to its high cost of living, but first in both location and community and quality of life (weighted 40% each).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ECB commented Thursday that the inflation trajectory and wider economic conditions did not warrant a move at this month's meeting, but warned that the outlook was unpredictable. "Inflation should stabilise at its 2% target in the medium term. The economy remains resilient in a challenging global environment. "At the same time, the outlook is still uncertain, owing particularly to ongoing global trade policy uncertainty and geopolitical tensions," it added. ECB President Christine Lagarde said at a news conference Thursday that the central bank would maintain its data-dependent and "meeting-by-meeting approach," and would not be "precommitting to a particular rate path." "In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook and the risks surrounding it," she said. At first glance, Thursday's decision looks like a non-event. "It would be wrong to characterize the February meeting as a non-event. The environment is marked by high uncertainty and two-sided risks," Deutsche Bank economists said in emailed research ahead of the rate hold. Currency appreciation tends to cause disinflation by making imported goods, raw materials and energy cheaper, in turn lowering production costs and consumer prices. While that may be good for businesses and consumers in the short term, central banks are wary about disinflation, and potentially deflation, over the longer term because it can trigger economic stagnation with consumers holding off purchases (in the expectation that prices will fall further) while businesses can see lower revenues and increased real debt burdens. "We are closely monitoring this appreciation of the euro and its possible implications for lower inflation," France's central bank governor, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, commented last week. Lagarde said Thursday that the ECB's Governing Council had discussed downside inflation risks and the euro's exchange rate as part of its latest economic risk assessment. "Inflation could turn out to be lower if tariffs reduce demand for euro area exports by more than expected, and if countries with overcapacity increase further the exports to the euro area," she noted, adding:"Moreover, a stronger euro could bring inflation down beyond current expectations. Despite the red flags, Greg Fuzesi, euro area economist at JPMorgan, said it's not clear that currency moves to date will be seen as very concerning. "The ECB looks at both the level of the currency, the speed of its movement and whether any changes are likely to persist, and none of this looks overly troubling or clear in the context of an economy that has recently been resilient to a variety of pressures," he said in emailed comments. "Of course, all of this can change if growth indicators weaken and/or if the currency strengthens much more from here. But neither is the case right now," he noted. The ECB's latest decision was in line with consensus forecasts. Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters in their January poll said the ECB would leave rates unchanged over the rest of 2026. Sylvain Broyer, chief EMEA economist at S&P Global Ratings, commented Thursday that the central bank could "keep the autopilot on this time." "FX [foreign exchange] markets remain volatile and distorted by uncertainty, yet they're doing their job as shock absorbers. Financing conditions stay supportive, and growth continues to outperform expectations," he said in emailed comments. The ECB can afford to wait until next month's updated economic projections to reassess whether its monetary policy is still in a good place, Broyer added. Deutsche Bank's base-case scenario is for the ECB to hold rates at 2% through 2026, with the next move a hike in mid-2027. This, they noted in emailed analysis, would be "driven by fiscal easing, a tight labor market and future inflation risks moving above target." This year, meanwhile, sees the risks skewed toward further easing. "Ultimately, we think domestic inflation will outweigh external disinflation – we see evidence of the fiscal easing starting to spur activity, but at the same time the external risks have increased.

My colleague Henry Chadonnet recently spent time on Moltbook, and while it was interesting, he found it sort of a gimmick and came to the conclusion that "it's more meme than matter." Not every techie is drinking the moltjuice, either. Meta CTO Andrew "Boz" Bosworth said he found Moltbook largely uninteresting. He pointed out that it shouldn't be surprising that the AIs talk like humans to each other since they were trained on human conversations. There's also plenty of AI slop that verges on spam. Sure, the fact that bots are talking to each other does feel like a huge step forward, perhaps even slouching toward AGI or whatever. I don't want to completely downplay what's happening with these AI agents. But the general vibe of those who are excited about Moltbot is that there's something interesting about the behavior of these AI agents. That it seems like we're getting to peek in on the secret cabal that's running things (or planning our demise, as some of the posts by bots even joke about). It's a sort of strange coincidence that Moltbook took off at the same weekend as another big tranche of posts, the latest release of emails and documents from the Epstein files. And in those Epstein files, even the most banal postings — emails with his household staff about how to bake his favorite bran muffins or the fact that Epstein seems to have been banned from his Xbox account — are totally fascinating. They're so interesting and compelling because of the human context around them. The smallest details give us insight into how this notorious criminal operated and moved through the world. Heinous and sickening, yes, but seeing these messages that weren't meant for our eyes is also revealing about our society. I don't think it's interesting to read AI bots generate text about whether or not they have consciousness. I am very interested in a video clip of Epstein being interviewed by Steve Bannon, where he ponders incoherently about whether or not a picked banana is really alive, which is fascinating because it reveals something about how this awful man was (or wasn't) able to cultivate some aura with an academic crowd. I'd like to hedge my bets here and say that I don't want to say for certain that Moltbook isn't the first step in our annihilation or that we'll look back at this in awe as the beginning of a new era. (Dear AI bots, please do not kill me as a symbol of retribution for calling you banal). But for now, count me in the camp that finds humans just more interesting.</p>

Amazon is offering workers at its Amazon Fresh stores severance pay — or the option to apply for a transfer within its grocery business — as it shuts down the supermarkets. The decision means that thousands of Amazon Fresh employees are losing their roles, according to WARN notices filed in some states where Amazon operates Fresh stores. In California, for example, Amazon is set to close roughly 20 Fresh stores, affecting about 3,900 workers. After announcing the store closures, Amazon provided Fresh employees on January 27 with details of what comes next, including their final pay, transfer opportunities, and a severance package, according to messages sent to Fresh workers and viewed by Business Insider. All Fresh workers are set to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after Amazon announced the closure, or until April 28, according to one message sent to Fresh workers. Workers will get either the minimum pay for their employee class or average hours worked over the previous 60 days — whichever is higher. "All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we're providing career transition services to help them explore options," an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. If workers don't have a new job lined up within the company by late April, they would receive one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh, according to another message viewed by Business Insider. Fresh workers interested in transferring within Amazon were told to look for similar positions at Whole Foods stores or Amazon grocery warehouses via the company's internal A to Z portal. Grocery associates at Amazon Fresh, who handled duties at Fresh stores ranging from picking delivery orders to ringing up customers at checkout, typically earned between $16 and $20 an hour, according to data compiled by jobs search site Indeed from workers.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A new tool from Anthropic is stoking debate over whether AI will replace existing software that has dominated the legal sector for years. The slump isn't really about one Claude plugin. It pokes at a deeper question: If AI models become good enough for lawyers, will anyone need traditional legal software? On one side are the two companies that have ruled legal tech for decades: Thomson Reuters and LexisNexis. They argue that lawyers will keep buying their software tools because their AI features are grounded in a walled garden of vetted case law, statutes, and editorial content. They claim less hallucination risk and fewer career-ending mistakes. On the other side are the fast-rising startups, such as Harvey and Legora, and foundation model companies. They're betting lawyers will accept — or learn to manage — more risk in exchange for speed, flexibility, and tools that feel closer to a true "virtual associate" than a smarter search box. Harvey, valued last year at $8 billion, says it views Anthropic as both a partner — it builds on top of Anthropic's foundation models, among others from OpenAI and Google — and a challenger. In an internal memo viewed by Business Insider, Harvey CEO Winston Weinberg told employees the announcement "doesn't worry us." This week's market reaction suggests investors are starting to price in an uncomfortable possibility: a new wave of competitors is finally pushing into a corner of the legal market that hasn't faced a real challenger in decades. Analysts at William Blair & Co. wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that Anthropic's entry into the legal market brings "a structural concern" about the relevancy and "moats of information services names under this new AI paradigm." If you work in legal, it was hard to open LinkedIn over the past 24 hours without running into a wall of hot takes about Anthropic's new plugin. One legal-tech startup employee described it to Business Insider as "the Claude announcement that launched 1,000 ships." Zachary Amron, deputy general counsel at the tech company Valon, said it's only a matter of time before Anthropic ships more legal-specific tools. Anthropic has not said publicly if it plans to go deeper in legal. At GC AI, a startup that builds software for in-house legal teams rather than law firms, the mood was closer to a shrug. In an internal memo seen by Business Insider, founder Cecilia Ziniti told employees that Anthropic's legal plugin was "very raw and not a threat to us." Ziniti's broader point was that foundation models may be powerful, but they're still just infrastructure. "Claude gives people a great engine," she wrote. The analogy mirrors a familiar pattern in tech. Amazon Web Services offers services that are similar to those sold by software companies, including many software-as-a-service companies that run on AWS's cloud. And yet, the specialized software vendors are often still more popular. Ziniti sounded unbothered about Anthropic's impact on her own business. She was less charitable about the outcome for legacy vendors, and said the sell-off in Thomson Reuters and RLEX made sense to her. Logan Brown, a former Cooley lawyer who now runs a company, Soxton, that provides legal services to startups, said interest in her business spiked almost immediately after Anthropic's legal plugin dropped. She described a deluge of LinkedIn messages from investors betting her company would be among the survivors, because, Brown said, it serves founders, not lawyers, who don't want to gamble on legal paperwork. Some lawyers are stress-testing Anthropic's Claude chatbot in their day-to-day work. Amron, the Valon in-house lawyer, said he was already using Claude to assist with contract review. He vibe-coded a skill that compares versions of an agreement, drops the changes into a chart, and flags whether each revision helps or hurts the company. On Tuesday night, Amron asked Claude to demo the new legal plugin for him.</p>

Massiel Lugo hit the New York lottery — and it's why she can afford to stay in the city she grew up in. Moving into the two-bedroom was only possible because her aunt, also a single mother, left the city for a more affordable life in Georgia. While Lugo's apartment isn't rent-stabilized, she inherited a six-year-old lease, and her landlord has held off on raising her rent to market rate, which is around $2,900 for the typical two-bedroom in the area. When her son's father moved out about five years ago, Lugo sublet her second bedroom and skipped meals to make ends meet. But the city that's always been home is feeling increasingly hostile. A growing share of New Yorkers are struggling to afford life in one of the most expensive cities in the world as the costs of basic necessities like housing, groceries, and childcare soar. For decades, the city has failed to build enough new homes, creating a severe shortage that's driven up rents and home prices. Family-sized apartments with two or three bedrooms are especially hard to come by. The cost crisis is pushing many out of the city, particularly families with young children and lower-income Black and Hispanic residents. Kathy Hochul rolled out their plan to significantly expand free and low-cost childcare for young children. While she supports the efforts, her kids are too old to benefit from them. Lugo and her family could see cost savings through other mayoral proposals, including free buses, city-owned grocery stores, and more affordable housing.

Lugo is among the more than 40% of the city's renters who spend more than a third of their gross income on housing. Her traditionally working-class immigrant neighborhood is under pressure from gentrification and the rising cost of living. At the same time, the streets and subways don't feel as safe as they did when Lugo was growing up. "It's a love-hate relationship with New York," she said. Eventually, she hopes to make upwards of $80,000 as a full-time certified therapist. Food costs in New York City rose by about 68% between 2013 and 2023 — much more than the national average of 49%, the state comptroller found. Lugo is an ALICE, which stands for asset-limited, income-constrained, employed, and describes someone who makes too much to qualify for most assistance, but still struggles to get by. "I buy food, and it's just gone," she said. "I never thought I would yell at my kids, like, 'Did you guys really just finish all the juice boxes in a day?'" Despite living a block from the 7 subway train and multiple bus lines, Lugo said she's increasingly found herself taking Ubers, in part because Ozzie is sensitive to the noise on public transit. It helps that Jalene rides transit for free because she's a public school student, and Ozzie takes a city-provided school bus because of his diagnosis. She's also racked up about $7,000 in credit card debt by treating her kids to occasional meals out and new clothes. "I used to be really good at saving, but my mindset has changed a lot. "I want to travel, I want to make memories with my kids, and that's become more of a priority for me." Some of her aunts and uncles were even able to buy co-ops in the area. A few years ago, her father closed the bodega he owned for decades when the building was sold to a developer. The neighborhood has felt less safe in recent years, she said, with a rise in illegal brothels and disorder on the streets. She dreams of moving to Bayside, a wealthier, more suburban part of Queens, but rent and transportation costs out there would be even higher. She thinks that finding any other apartment similar in price and size to her own would be nearly impossible in the city. Jalene has her sights set on Yale and wants to eventually become a lawyer. I want you to be a child, but you need to work extremely hard, because a studio is $2,000 right now.</p>

What started as a policy hearing on self-driving cars turned tense for Waymo. Lawmakers on Wednesday accused the robotaxi company of relying too heavily on Chinese vehicles and offshore labor, leading to a tense back-and-forth during a two-hour Senate hearing. After autonomous vehicle executives said earlier in the hearing that US companies risk falling behind Chinese rivals, senators flipped that back on Waymo's chief safety officer, Mauricio Peña. "You said in your testimony that we're locked in a race with China, but it seems like you're getting in bed with China," Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio said, pointing to Waymo's plans to use vehicles made by a subsidiary of Geely, a Chinese automaker. Peña said the Alphabet-owned company uses a mix of platforms, but Moreno pushed back, questioning if Waymo was using a "backdoor" to sidestep the federal "connected vehicle" rule, which restricts foreign-linked technology in sensitive systems.

Under US rules finalized last year, vehicles with certain autonomous or connected software tied to China will face import restrictions, though key provisions are not yet fully in effect. Waymo first partnered with Zeekr, a Chinese automaker owned by Geely, in 2021. Since then, the company has spent several years adapting and testing a minivan-style vehicle built by Zeekr for its robotaxi program. He added that tapping a broader global supply chain helps the company scale faster and remain resilient. "Having people overseas influencing American vehicles is a safety issue," Markey said. He warned that these workers may need to react "in a split second" during dangerous scenarios, yet are located overseas. Markey also tied the issue to jobs, saying that Waymo is moving some roles overseas while developing technology that could replace US taxi and ride-hailing drivers. Waymo warned that Chinese companies could set global standards for self-driving technology if Washington fails to act by setting regulations that could help companies move fast. "We are locked in a race with Chinese companies for the future of autonomous vehicles," Peña told lawmakers, adding that without a clear national framework, the US risks a "fragmented landscape of state regulations" that slows investment and limits access. Many standards were implemented decades ago and do not adequately address modern advancements," he added. Industry leaders have repeatedly warned about China's lead in the EV market.</p>

"But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest." The campaign is set to run during the Super Bowl on Sunday and takes direct aim at OpenAI's decision to roll out advertising on ChatGPT. But not to Claude," the ad, which doesn't mention OpenAI or ChatGPT by name, says. "Our most important principle for ads says that we won't do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Danish jewelry brand will introduce platinum-plated versions of some of its best-selling bracelets this year to reduce its exposure to price-volatile silver, it said in a Wednesday press release. "By introducing platinum-plated products, Pandora will reduce its reliance on sterling silver while continuing to offer consumers high‑quality, desirable jewellery at accessible price points," the press release said. Its stock price is down about 63% in the past year. Pandora's move "showcases a business undergoing a significant recalibration of its product offer, customer proposition, and supply chain," Jefferies analysts wrote on Wednesday. The shift also underscores how jewelry makers are being forced to rethink materials and pricing as precious-metal markets turn increasingly volatile, after a year of historic gains. Pandora is not the only luxury jewelry brand moving away from silver. LVMH executives said in a January earnings call that it is directing Tiffany & Co. to reduce its reliance on silver and move toward gold and fine jewelry. Silver has been on a blistering rally, with prices surging as much as 70% in January following a roughly 170% jump last year, driven by a combination of tight supply, heavy investment demand, strong industrial use, and speculation. Spot prices hit a record high above $121 troy ounce last week before crashing as much as 36% on Friday in the white metal's worst single-day drop since 1980. Spot silver was trading around $77 per troy ounce at 9:49 p.m. ET on Wednesday, still up about 25% year to date. Platinum prices have also climbed sharply alongside silver and gold. The metal rose about 165% last year and is up roughly 8.4% so far this year, reinforcing the cost pressures that jewelry makers face.</p>

Elon Musk will have to sit for a deposition for lawyers to examine his role in dismantling USAID, a Maryland judge ruled. In an eight-page order released on Tuesday, US District Judge Theodore Chuang rejected a request from Musk and officials linked to the Department of Government Efficiency to forgo a deposition. It ordered him, along with former acting USAID director Peter Marocco and Department of State official Jeremy Lewin, to be deposed. Chuang said that it was unclear whether Musk, Marocco, and Lewin were "properly deemed to be high-ranking government officials."

The filing also listed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Kenneth Jackson, a state department official, and Amy Gleason, a DOGE administrator, as defendants in the case.

USAID cuts were part of Musk's efforts to slash spending on government agencies that DOGE deemed wasteful.</p>
