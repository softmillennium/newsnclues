Many will be looking for homes, but if this year is anything like last year, it may take some time for those sales to close. We'll be tracking all of them as they come in. Section: PremieresDistributor: AppleDirectors: Amir Bar-LevDate Acquired: Feb. 5Buzz: In terms of pure visceral thrills, it's hard to beat a good mountain climbing documentary. Bar-Lev has an extensive track record of delivering documentary hits about a wide range of topics, so the tech giant is likely hoping that it has the next “Free Solo” on its hands. Related Stories Harry Melling Always Wanted to Be a Character Actor — but He's About to Be a Leading Man ‘Ready or Not 2: Here I Come' New Trailer: Let Radio Silence Explain the Rules of a New Game Section: PremieresDistributor: NeonDirectors: William and David GreavesDate Acquired: Feb. 5Buzz: Few nonfiction films at Sundance generated more buzz than “Once Upon a Time in Harlem,” William Greaves' posthumous collection of conversations from a 1974 cocktail party of Harlem Renaissance luminaries that was assembled by his son David. The film is a vital historical artifact, and the fact that it hails from a legendary documentarian only adds to its prestige. Dramatic CompetitionDistributor: Sony Pictures ClassicsDirectors: Stephanie AhnDate Acquired: Jan. 30Buzz: In its second acquisition in two days, Sony Pictures Classics picked up another set of worldwide rights to yet another U.S. “Bedford Park” is also the directorial debut of Ahn, and it's a drama about a woman (Moon Choi) struggling between her loyalty to her Korean immigrant family and her own American identity, as a child raised in New Jersey. When her mother gets into a car accident, it leads to a fateful meeting with Eli (Son Sukku), an ex-wrestler battling his own fractured past. Dramatic CompetitionDistributor: Sony Pictures ClassicsDirectors: Josef Kubota WladykaDate Acquired: Jan. 29 Buzz: One of the buzzier competition titles at Sundance not because of its star power but because of its playful title and crowd pleasing sentiment, one that earned a standing ovation for director Josef Kubota Wladyka and his mother on whom the film is based, the real Ha-Chan. Shot in Japan, Rinko Kikuchi stars in “Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!” as a woman who leaves the Japanese ballroom dance scene after tragedy strikes, only to be lured back onto the dance floor after developing an infatuation for a new instructor. It also stars Alberto Guerra, Alejandro Edda, Yoh Yoshida, and Damián Alcázar. Section: PremieresDistributor: A24Directors: Olivia WildeDate Acquired: Jan. 27 Buzz: This was a true, old-fashioned, late night bidding war between multiple interested buyers that ended up being a 72-hour, marathon competition. IndieWire hears that Neon, Black Bear, Netflix, Searchlight, and Focus Features — and even Warner Bros. at the 11th hour — were all in the mix for what was Olivia Wilde's third feature as a director. Others may have bid more, but Wilde was determined to get a theatrical deal. Section: MidnightDistributor: NeonDirector: Adrian ChiarellaDate Acquired: Jan. 27 Buzz: A queer, coming-of-age horror movie? “Leviticus” is about two teenage boys who have to fight off a violent entity capable of taking the form of the other. The film plays on the real-life horrors of conversion therapy and stars Joe Bird, Stacy Clausen, Jeremy Blewitt, Ewen Leslie, Davida McKenzie, Nicholas Hope, Zahra Newman, and Mia Wasikowska. The film's unique genre premise from writer/director Adrian Chiarella, his feature debut, was good enough for Neon to jump on worldwide rights in a seven-figure deal, as well as the first sale of the festival, an otherwise slow affair thus far, though one that has sparked an early bidding war for at least one other title. Section: PremieresDistributor: Focus FeaturesDirectors: Daniel Roher and Charlie TyrellBuzz: The “Navalny” director teams up with producer Daniel Kwan (“Everything Everywhere All At Once”) on a film that goes deep into the perils and promise of artificial intelligence, all through the lens of Roher debating whether this is a good moment to bring a child into the world. Section: PremieresDistributor: ESPNDirectors: Liz Garbus and Elizabeth WolffBuzz: More than a sports doc, this portrait of Billie Jean King looks at the tennis icon's compulsion to hide her sexual orientation and eating disorders. Section: PremieresDistributor: Searchlight PicturesDirector: Andrew StantonBuzz: Though he's directed plenty on TV, Pixar vet Andrew Stanton is returning to a live-action feature for the first time since “John Carter” dropped way back in 2012. Section: PremieresDistributor: A24Director: Aidan ZamiriBuzz: One of three films starring Charli XCX at the festival, the “brat” pop star plays a version of herself in an exaggerated mockumentary that comments on the idea of modern celebrity. Section: World DocumentaryDistributor: PBS/FrontlineDirectors: Itab Azzam, Jack MacInnesBuzz: This documentary was filmed over 10 years and follows a Syrian refugee girl who travels to Germany and then back to Syria with her family. It stars Midori Francis as a woman who takes part in a bizarre weight loss craze that involves eating human ashes, only to become possessed by demonic forces in the process. Section: NEXTDistributor: Latino Public Broadcasting and ITVSDirector: William D. CaballeroBuzz: This animated film that combines a variety of styles, including 2D, 3D, and live-action, is a deeply personal autobiographical documentary from mixed media filmmaker Caballero, who looks back on his career and examines grief through the lens of his Puerto Rican family in North Carolina. Section: PremieresDistributor: Nat GeoDirector: Sara DosaBuzz: Like her Sundance breakout “Fire of Love” before it, “Time and Water” is a more elevated nature documentary and follows an Icelandic writer eulogizing both a glacier and his grandparents. Section: MidnightDistributor: A24Director: Ian TuasonBuzz: A micro-budget horror movie in the vein of “Paranormal Activity” that first played at Fantasia Fest, the actual producers of “Paranormal Activity” helped give the film a new cut and are hoping for another horror hit.

Jennifer Davidson, who has been at the organization since 2019, and been its communications chief since 2021, has been promoted to the newly expanded role of Chief Marketing, Communications, and Content Officer for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Related Stories Harry Melling Always Wanted to Be a Character Actor — but He's About to Be a Leading Man ‘Ready or Not 2: Here I Come' New Trailer: Let Radio Silence Explain the Rules of a New Game This new development, shared by Academy CEO Bill Kramer, who Davidson will continue to report to, comes on the heels of the Academy announcing that the Oscars are moving to YouTube in 2029. While this new Academy Studios initiative seems more focused on video, the Academy did recently try its hand at a formal content hub with the digital magazine A.frame, which shuttered in July 2024. Since then, the Academy has continued to produce and publish videos that were mostly distributed via its social channels instead. Jen's creative vision, along with the development of our new Academy Studios production team, will allow us to celebrate filmmakers and filmmaking on a greater scale, discover new ways to showcase our talented members, and continue to promote the exceptional work of our Academy Museum and Academy Collection. “In this new role, I'm excited to adopt innovative strategies that can celebrate both our industry's greatest storytellers and the remarkable work they've created across disciplines,” said Davidson, who currently oversees marketing and audience development, communications, digital/social and creative brand strategy for all arms of the Academy, including the Academy Foundation, the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures and the Oscars. “The establishment of Academy Studios allows us to preserve film's rich history for future generations, while creating fresh and exciting ways to engage new audiences around cinema.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Lisa, the Thai rapper, singer, dancer and actor of Blackpink fame, who's coming off her acting debut in The White Lotus Season 3, is set to reteam with the series' executive producer David Bernad on a new romantic comedy for Netflix, penned by Set It Up‘s Katie Silberman. Shortly after, they tapped Silberman, the in-demand comedy writer behind Set it Up and Booksmart, to write the script. Theater Owners Call Pending Netflix-Warner Bros Merger "Catastrophic" In Statement To Senate Lawmakers Paramount CEO David Ellison Takes Dig At "Monopolistic" Netflix In Open Letter To UK Creatives About Warner Deal Bernad will produce through his Middle Child Productions banner, alongside Silberman, who has an exclusive, multi-year creative partnership with the streamer. Lisa comes to the project amid work on her first major film role in TYGO, a new chapter of Netflix's Extraction universe. She released her debut solo album, Alter Ego, last February, seeing it debut at number seven on the Billboard 200 chart and hit number one on the Billboard Top Album Sales chart. The artist also made her Coachella debut last year, after making her screen debut as Mook, the wellness professional love interest of Tayme Thapthimthong's non-violent Buddhist security guard Gaitok, in The White Lotus Season 3. She is represented by WME, LLOUD and JSSK. Silberman is known for writing Netflix's Set It Up, one of Netflix's most watched romantic comedies, starring Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell. She is repped by CAA, 42, and Myman Greenspan. An Emmy, Golden Globe, Peabody, and PGA-winning producer, Bernad's Middle Child is currently prepping the France-set fourth season of The White Lotus, with the second season of its Emmy-nominated series Jury Duty and Little Brother, a Netflix comedy starring John Cena and Eric André, in post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cinema United, the trade org for exhibition, has made public its remarks about the pending Netflix–Warner Bros merger to the Senate antitrust subcommittee, saying, “If Netflix succeeds in acquiring Warner Bros., the results will be economically and culturally catastrophic: fewer theatres, shorter windows, less revenue, fewer jobs across the national and global entertainment industry, and fewer movies for consumers to see in theatres.” Cinema United, previously known as National Association of Theatre Owners, submitted a six-page written testimony to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy & Consumer Rights on Tuesday. While Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told lawmakers on the record the streamer is about a 45-day exclusive theatrical window for movies, many rival studio sources have questioned the streaming boss' intent. Streaming windows generally are around 90-100 days or more after a movie bows in cinemas. RELATED: Netflix Attacked For Having “Wokest Content In The History Of The World” By MAGA Senators At WB Deal Hearing In the statement, Cinema United advocated: “We are deeply concerned that this acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix will have a direct and irreversible negative impact on movie theatres around the world. Such an acquisition will further consolidate control over production and distribution of motion pictures in the hands of a single, dominant, global streaming platform in a market that is already highly concentrated. The impact will not only be felt by theatre owners, but by movie fans and surrounding businesses in communities of all sizes.”The trade group extended its concerns of the proposed Warner Bros. merger beyond Netflix, adding: “If Paramount or another major studio ends up displacing Netflix as the buyer, our concerns are no less serious. The number of films being produced for theatrical exhibition is slowly returning to pre-2019 levels. However, that growth is threatened by further consolidation. At best, an acquisition of Warner Bros. will stall the growth we have seen in the last four years. More realistically, however, it will result in a significant reduction of theatrical releases,” the Michael O'Leary led cinema org explained. The statement summed up, “We must heed the lessons of the past: further industry consolidation has consistently led to fewer movies being made, and there is no reason whatsoever to believe the outcome here would be any different, particularly given Netflix's stated views of movie theatres over the past decade-plus.” RELATED: Donald Trump Now Says He “Shouldn't Be Involved” In DOJ Review Of A Netflix Or Paramount Acquisition Of Warner Bros. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. The theater business is dying and it's not because of this merger. WB is complimentary to Netflix's streaming business. They want to put movies in theaters. Theater owners need to make the theater going experience better before they keep complaining about everything that happens in the movie business, as per usual for them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Melania: Twenty Days to History, Amazon's trumped-up documentary about First Lady Melania Trump, reportedly exceeded box-office expectations, bringing in $7 million when pundits prognosticated torn stubs worth between $1 million and $5 million. “Seven million dollars would seem like a solid opening, until you realize that's less than 10 percent of the $75 million Amazon spent on the documentary, which includes paying the first lady herself at least $28 million,” he said on The Late Show. “That's enough cash to put a smile on your face … if that were physically possible.” He also had a Melania Trump impersonator attempt to explain the movie. “As of tonight, Melania has a score of five percent on Rotten Tomatoes from the critics,” he said. To put that in perspective, that is one percent lower than Gigli,” the 2003 Bennifer box-office bomb, which Rolling Stone described as “jaw-droppingly awful.” Counterintuitively, he pointed out that the Popcornmeter (fans' approval rating), is through the roof. “And I'm sure Donald J.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The urgent search for their mother, Nancy Guthrie, 84, entered its fifth day this week after authorities said she was taken from her Arizona home “against her will.” Savannah and her siblings released an emotional video appeal, asking anyone involved to provide proof Nancy is alive and saying, “We are ready to listen.” Savannah also revealed that her mother lives in constant pain and needs prescription medication, raising fears as time passes. As the Guthries wait for answers, here's what you need to know. Savannah's dad, Charles Guthrie, died of a heart attack when she was just 16. He worked as a mining engineer in Australia before moving the family to Arizona. Camron Guthrie is Savannah's older brother and a former Air National Guard F-16 pilot. When Camron retired in 2018, Savannah posted a tribute calling him “the pride of our family,” adding, “He has flown for our country for 26 years.” She later added that while the loss was devastating, it also made her heart “more tender.” According to her Arizona Commission on the Arts bio, she teaches creative writing at the University of Arizona Poetry Center, has published work in literary journals, and has written a book on jewelry making. Annie is also a graduate of Warren Wilson College. Savannah, Camron, and Annie have remained publicly united as they wait for answers about Nancy. On Wednesday, Feb. 4, Guthrie and her siblings shared a video appeal, urging whoever has their mother to come forward and stressing that the family is willing to communicate, while also demanding proof of life. Both TMZ and a local CBS affiliate reported receiving ransom notes tied to the case, though authorities have not verified their authenticity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chris Hemsworth was hesitant to reveal his genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease for the sake of his acting career. “I wondered if I was letting people too far in,” Hemsworth — known for his role as Marvel superhero Thor —  told Variety in an interview published Wednesday. Hemsworth, 42, revealed the predisposition in 2022 and has since shared that his grandfather and father were hit with the disease, which has no known cure. Ten years ago, I think it was more thought of as determinant,” he said. “It really kind of pissed me off because it felt like I had been vulnerable with something personal and shared this,” he told Vanity Fair in 2024. He continued, “No matter how much I said ‘This is not a death sentence,' the story became that I have dementia and I'm reconsidering life and retiring and so on.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Who am I to turn down that kind of money? “Justifying things that weren't the purest creative decision – but I'll be able to pay for my parents' house, or I'll be able to help out my cousins.” Hemsworth said that his 2025 documentary, “A Road Trip To Remember” — which explores his dad's battle with Alzheimer's — was “so deeply personal.” “It was a love letter to my father,” he said. He also started prioritizing sleep and taking regular ice baths. That same year, Hemsworth took a step back from his acting career — but emphasized that he is not retiring.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I'm not a singer by trade, clearly, and so that part was challenging for me,” she said. So I was a little bit nervous, but I was excited to push myself out of my comfort zone and try something new, and it felt like it gave me a little bit of life.” Teddi sang Rachel Platten's “Fight Song” and her dad John Mellencamp's “Jack and Diane” during her time on the show. “For a while I resented him for not making my life easy,” Teddi, while still disguised as Calla Lily, said about John, 74, during a package on the show. It made me be tough, strong and always on time for dinner.” On Thursday's episode of her “Two Ts in a Pod” podcast, Teddi revealed that besides her dad, she didn't tell anyone — not even her three children, whom she shares with estranged husband Edwin Arroyave — that she was on the show. “Cruz knew within seconds,” she said about her 11-year-old son. In an interview with People, Teddi said she wanted to “push myself out of my comfort zone” after going through severe “physical and mental struggles” from her cancer battle. “So getting out there and doing something new and trying something new was really great for me,” she told the outlet. The former Bravoleb came forward with her stage 2 melanoma diagnosis in October 2022. She underwent more than a dozen surgeries to address the disease — including an emergency procedure in 2025 to remove several tumors in her brain. Last October, Teddi shared that her cancer was gone. But when John recently stated that his daughter was “really sick” and “suffering,” Teddi clarified that her cancer hadn't returned.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britney Spears called out her family in a post on Instagram on Wednesday night, saying she is “incredibly lucky to even be alive” after their mistreatment. “As people, all we really want is to feel connected to each other and never feel alone … for those of you in your family that have said to help you is to isolate you and make you feel unbelievably left out … they were wrong,” she wrote alongside a photograph of a child holding a parent's hand. “We can forgive as people but u don't ever forget. She added, “I'm incredibly lucky to even be alive with how my family treated me once in my life and now I'm scared of them.” This isn't the first time Spears has posted about her family in recent months. In December, she shared an image of a Christmas tree with a sarcastic comment: “Merry late Christmas to my beautiful family who have never disrespected me, harmed me, ever done anything completely unacceptable or caused unbelievable trauma, the kind you can't fix.” In November, Spears temporarily deactivated her Instagram account after she posted a series of responses to her ex-husband Kevin Federline‘s recent memoir, You Thought You Knew. Along with an alarming claim that Spears would watch their children sleep with a knife in her hand , Federline wrote: “Something bad is going to happen if things don't change.” He also claimed she drank while pregnant and did cocaine while breastfeeding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Expenses for VFX, editing and sound mixing are not currently eligible on their own for state tax credits — but industry insiders want to change that as their ecosystem is “bleeding out.” Amanda Faissal said that the state representative will soon introduce legislation in a bid to return more editing, sound mixing, VFX and other post work to the state. Though postproduction expenses can qualify for tax credits in California if physical production is also done in the state, it is not currently eligible for incentives on its own — even as other states and countries offer this perk to cost-conscious companies. Christopher Nolan Wants to Know Where All the Hollywood Jobs Are, Too Ahead of High-Profile Negotiations, Writers Guild West's Own Staff Union Authorizes Strike The initiative follows a successful lobbying effort from Hollywood unions and grassroots groups in 2025 to more than double California's film and television tax credit, expanding the program from $330 million to $750 million. Faissal's news drew loud applause during a town hall for the California Post Alliance (CAPA), an organization dedicated to attracting more postproduction work to the state. Conversation around the issue ballooned after an open letter from Encompass Music Partners and Encompass Creative founder Peter Rotter circulated among insiders in early 2025. At the event, production insiders raised deep concerns that Los Angeles was becoming another Detroit in that it was losing ground on its signature industry. He added, “Families can't pay their rent on what little work is left. The whole ecosystem is bleeding out and no one's coming back.” Two-time Oscar-winning sound designer Karen Baker Landers (MaXXXine, Scream VI) said that she had lost four to five jobs due to California not offering the standalone postproduction credit that other jurisdictions do. Trevanna Post and Trevanna Tracks founder Jennifer Freed, whose company has offices in London and New York as well as in L.A., said that she had witnessed the production exodus on her own balance sheet. California's share of U.S. postproduction work declined more than 11 percent between 2010 and 2024, according to data shared by CAPA on Wednesday. One of his slides read, ominously: “California built this industry over 100 years. CAPA's solution to this dire situation lies, at least initially, in advocating for the Schultz-sponsored bill. To accomplish that, the group has hired a lobbyist and a publicity firm, one of whose publicists encouraged attendees on Wednesday to post about the event on social media. CAPA also encouraged attendees to join as members and financially support the effort. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sony Pictures Entertainment's operating income for its fiscal third quarter (ending December 31, 2025) was down 11 percent to $197 million from $223 million in dollar terms for the comparable period a year before, with Q3 sales down 12 percent to $2.295 billion from $2.619 billion. SPE comprises the motion pictures division, television productions and media networks. The motion pictures unit (which comprises sales from theatrical, home entertainment and streaming sales) saw Q3 revenue fall 7 percent to $792 million from $1.108 billion, for the comparable period a year before. SPE released five theatrical movies globally in the period, including Soul On Fire, Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc, Nuremberg, SISU: Road to Revenge and Anaconda. Beatles Movies Drop Closer Look at Paul Mescal, Harris Dickinson, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan as Fab Four SPE's major streaming television productions from the period included Fox's Doc and Universal Basic Guys and Starz's Outlander: Blood of My Blood. The company revealed that it ended 2025 with 38 television channels and 535.2 million total subscribers. Third quarter operating income in the Game & Network Services unit (which includes PlayStation hardware and software sales and services income) grew 19 percent to 140.8 billion yen, primarily driven by a weaker yen and higher software sales. Although revenue for the segment dipped 4 percent in the same period and one cause for concern will be that PlayStation 5 sales were 8 million units down from 9.5 million units a year previously in what is usually the busiest quarter for hardware sales as it includes the run up to Christmas. Sony's best-selling music artists for Q3 2025 were Rosalia (Lux), Pink Floyd (Wish You Were Here), Tyler, The Creator (CHROMAKOPIA), Tate McRae (So Close To What), SZA (SOS), Tame Impala (Deadbeat), Bad Bunny (Debí Tirar Más Fotos), Michael Jackson (Thriller), Mariah Carey (Merry Christmas) and Depeche Mode (Memento Mori: Mexico City / Depeche Mode: M).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We've known for about a year at this point about the U.K.'s plan to import Saturday Night Live across the Atlantic, with an official British version going into production under Lorne Michaels' oversight. Even so, there's a fascinating question lurking at the heart of the plan, one that Sky TV has now officially answered: Which British comedians do you cast to start a brand new Saturday Night Live? Rather than rattle off a list of credits for the show's just-announced cast—Hammed Animashaun, Ayoade Bamgboye, Larry Dean, Celeste Dring, George Fouracres, Ania Magliano, Annabel Marlow, Al Nash, Jack Shep, Emma Sidi, and Paddy Young—we figured it'd be better to see them in motion, so we've collected clips of as many of the 11 newcomers as we can. First up: Hammed Animashaun, who American audiences might actually know from his role on Prime Video's Wheel Of Time adaptation. Here he is (briefly) in his recent U.K. comedy series Black Ops: George Fouracres, a stand-up best known as one-third of the comedy group Daphne: There's Ania Magliano, a stand-up, writer, and person we know from Taskmaster: Jack Shep, who's done a few TV roles but seems to be mostly prominent on TikTok. Per Variety, Saturday Night Live U.K. is set to debut on March 21. The show will reportedly feature a structure extremely similar to the NBC version, including celebrity hosts and musical guests, Weekend Update, and a variety of sketches.</p>

The Life of a Showgirl debuted at No. It moved a single-week record 4.002 million equivalent album units in the United States in its first week, according to Luminate, with “The Fate of Ophelia” debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 that week, followed by “Opalite” at No. 2 — which is so far its peak on the chart. Swift's decision to premiere the video first on Spotify and Apple Music follows YouTube's December announcement that it was withdrawing its streaming data from all of Billboard‘s charts. YouTube's withdrawal followed Billboard‘s Dec. 16 announcement of a change to chart methodology that will continue to weigh subscription streams more favorably than ad-supported streams, in a bid to better reflect changing consumer behaviors and the increased revenue derived from streaming in the industry. The change means that paid/subscription streams will be weighted against ad-supported streams at a 1:2.5 ratio, narrowed from the previous 1:3 ratio.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Savannah Guthrie and her siblings, Annie and Camron, are begging for their mother Nancy's safe return after her mysterious disappearance. “Bring her home,” the journalist captioned an Instagram video shared on Wednesday night. “We want to thank all of you for the prayers for our beloved mom, Nancy. We feel them and we continue to believe that she feels them too,” an emotional Savannah said in the clip, reading from a prepared statement. “Our mom is a kind, faithful, loyal, fiercely loving woman of goodness and light. She is full of kindness and knowledge. Talk to her, and you'll see.” Annie echoed her sister's sentiments, adding that the “light is missing” from their family's lives without their mother. We are her children, she is our beacon. She holds fast to joy in all of life's circumstances. Despite having already passed through great trials of pain and grief,” she said, as Savannah tearfully held her head down. “We are always going to be merely human. Just normal human people who need our mom. Start your day with Page Six Daily. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Savannah continued to read from her note as she pleaded with her mother's alleged captor for proof that she is alive. We are ready to talk,” Savannah said. Addressing the purported kidnapper, she added: “However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know — without a doubt — that she is alive, and that you have her. You are God's precious daughter, Nancy. We believe and know that even in this valley, he is with you,” she said. “Everyone is looking for you, Mommy — everywhere. Your children will not rest until we are together again. And we will rejoice in advance that the day we will hold you in our arms again. We love you, mom,” Savannah closed before her siblings echoed her last sentence in their closing statements. Nancy was last seen on Saturday at around 9:30 p.m. She was reportedly dropped off at her Catalina Foothills home after having dinner with family members. On Monday, the Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed that Nancy's home was being treated as a crime scene. Authorities initially believed Annie was the last person to see their matriarch before she went missing. After which, FBI agents paid Annie's home in Arizona a visit on Tuesday amid the continued investigation. However, authorities told The Post that Annie's husband, Tommaso Cioni, was the last person who saw Nancy alive when he drove her back to her home at around 9:45 p.m. after she had dinner with him and his wife. The Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed they have yet to identify a suspect or person of interest in an X statement on Wednesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An independent theater in Lake Oswego, Oregon, just a few miles south of Portland, is reporting that the Amazon corporation does not, in fact, have a sense of humor when it comes to its new, very expensive Brett Ratner documentary Melania. Per the Lake Oswego Review, Jordan Perry, general manager for the small city's Lake Theater & Cafe, is claiming that Amazon has yanked the movie out of theaters after he advertised the booking with taglines like “To defeat your enemy. Perry wrote about the decision on the theater's Instagram—which, we can't help but note in passing, is also filled with hand-drawn movie posters that are pretty kick-ass—noting that the theater “Got a call that the higher ups (i.e., at Amazon) were upset with how our marquee marketed their movie (i.e., Melania), that, per them, Sunday would be its last day here.” Joking “please don't cancel my Prime” and suggesting that devoted Amazon fans will have to “show your support at Whole Foods instead,” Perry noted both in the Instagram post and in a separate blog post that he also got quite a bit of pushback from the theater's fans for screening the documentary at all. Titling the post “Why I, Jordan, Got Melania Here,” Perry wrote that, “Mostly, I thought doing so would be funny.” But also, “Financially, the film marketplace this week and next were a desert… So, to fill a screen, why not get this inexplicable vanity piece from the current president's wife? I mean, it just seems so weird that it even exists (who wants a movie about Melania lol? ), and wouldn't it then be exponentially weirder, to the point of being funny, to show it here, at your obviously anti-establishment, occasionally troublemaking, neighborhood cinema?” Perry suggests that the theater may be on Amazon's “black list” for a while, possibly impacting the release of upcoming films like Project Hail Mary. (He also notes that the film made the company about $196 during its truncated run, writing, “Jeff Bezos won't notice the $196. He wouldn't notice $1,960, though someone on his team noticed our marquee.”) Recommended for You1Fallout's season-two finale wastes its shot2The Todd Haynes film that Joaquin Phoenix nearly killed is officially back on3Hijack finally finds its rhythm4Collect a universe of points in the board game Point Galaxy5Congress claims Netflix makes "the wokest content in the history of the world"</p>
