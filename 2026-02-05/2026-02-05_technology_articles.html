                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of Earth's most dangerous glaciers has claimed a victim: a suite of instruments that became trapped deep within the ice. A team of researchers from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) was working to place instruments beneath Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier to understand how the ice was melting from below. “Fieldwork in Antarctica always comes with risk,” Keith Makinson, BAS oceanographer and drilling engineer, said in a statement. “You have a very small window in which everything has to come together. While this outcome is deeply disappointing, the data we did recover are scientifically valuable and will help shape future efforts.” That's enough to flood low-lying cities and displace millions of people. The giant mass of ice is largely unstable, and very little is known about the warming waters that flow beneath the glacier that cause it to melt from below. To peek at what's going on underneath the glacier, the team used hot water to create holes in the ice and began lowering a suite of instruments to collect data. The borehole was approximately 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) deep and around 11 inches (30 cm) wide and needed to be continuously maintained to prevent it from refreezing. The researchers then attempted to lower a mooring system, which was meant to remain within the ice for one to two years and transmit data through a satellite. “Failure is always an option when you are pushing at the limits of scientific exploration,” Peter Davis, BAS oceanographer and member of the drilling team, said in a statement. “We know heat beneath Thwaites Glacier is driving ice loss. These observations are an important step forward, even though we are disappointed the full deployment could not be achieved.” This was the team's second attempt to deploy a suite of instruments beneath Thwaites Glacier. “This is not the end,” chief scientist and professor Won Sang Lee of South Korea said in a statement. What we have learned here strengthens the case for returning.” Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Could those fans also band together as a collective ownership force? That's the vision of Arrived, a Seattle-based tech startup that is typically associated with helping everyday investors gain a stake in rental homes. Fans can use the website, which is not affiliated with the Seahawks or NFL, to share their hypothetical investment amount and learn more. “We built our [home] platform around a $100 minimum investment and making that very accessible. We'd love to do the same with this,” Arrived co-founder and CEO Ryan Frazier told GeekWire. Arrived would put together a special purpose investment vehicle where it would collect fan investment through its platform and then serve as a single private equity investor in the Seahawks. Frazier pictures bringing together 100,000 or more fans to help Arrived's fund get closer to a stake of between 3% and 10% — especially considering rising franchise values and the expectation that the Seahawks could fetch as much as $8 billion. “I really see this model working well where there's a lead owner and then other minority investors that can help provide a more stable capital base.” Frazier has been aware for years of the wishes of late Seahawks owner and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen when it comes to selling the team, as has been done with other Allen assets. But reports from ESPN and The Wall Street Journal last weekend claimed that a sale could happen sooner rather than later. Established as a publicly held, non-profit corporation in 1923, the team is currently owned by over 538,000 shareholders who collectively hold more than 5 million shares. Private equity owners that take stakes in NFL franchises aren't allowed to have voting power. NFL.com columnist Judy Battista noted in 2024 that “it is not going to be like flipping real estate.” “We'd want the shares to be participating in appreciation alongside other shareholders,” Frazier said. “We see this as an equity stake and getting exposure to value growth.” Three teams — the Bills, Dolphins and Chargers — have added private equity investors so far. Frazier said it's inevitable that the model will spread as team valuations continue to grow across sports leagues and there's a greater need for minority investors. Frazier, who came to Seattle from Arkansas in 2014, and Arrived co-founder Alejandro Chouza, who came from Mexico around 2010, both moved during a surge in success and popularity for the Seahawks. Founded in 2019, Arrived (formerly Arrived Homes) lets people buy fractional shares of single-family rental homes and vacation rentals for as little as $100. It's pitched as an alternative way to gain exposure to real estate without taking on a full mortgage or managing a property. Investors can buy shares in individual homes or pooled funds through the Arrived website. The company, which employs 51, declined to share its current valuation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The January 2025 ransomware attack, which knocked out Conduent's operations for several days, is now known to affect at least 15.4 million people in Texas alone, accounting for about half of the state's population. Conduent said in October that 4 million people across the state were affected. Another 10.5 million people are affected across Oregon, per the state's attorney general. Conduent has also notified hundreds of thousands of people across Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and other states, according to data breach notifications seen by TechCrunch. The company says its technology and operational support services reach more than 100 million people in the United States across various government healthcare programs. When contacted with several questions about the data breach, Conduent spokesperson Sean Collins provided a boilerplate statement that did not address the questions, nor did they answer if Conduent knows how many individuals are affected by the cyberattack. In a later SEC filing, the company said that the stolen data sets “contained a significant number of individuals' personal information associated with our clients' end-users,” referring to its corporate and government customers. Conduent also said it is continuing to notify individuals whose data was stolen in the breach, and plans to conclude alerting individuals by early 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An AI lab called Fundamental emerged from stealth on Thursday, offering a new foundation model to solve an old problem: how to draw insights from the huge quantities of structured data produced by enterprises. “While LLMs have been great at working with unstructured data, like text, audio, video, and code, they don't work well with structured data like tables,” CEO Jeremy Fraenkel told TechCrunch. The company is emerging from stealth with $255 million in funding at a $1.2 billion valuation. The bulk of it comes from the recent $225 million Series A round led by Oak HC/FT, Valor Equity Partners, Battery Ventures, and Salesforce Ventures; Hetz Ventures also participated in the Series A, with angel funding from Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Brex co-founder Henrique Dubugras, and Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel. Fundamental calls it a foundation model because it goes through the normal steps of pre-training and fine-tuning, but the result is something profoundly different from what a client would get when partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic. Those differences are important because Fundamental is chasing a use-case where contemporary AI models often falter. Because Transformer-based AI models can only process data that's within their context window, they often have trouble reasoning over extremely large datasets — analyzing a spreadsheet with billions of rows, for instance. As Fraenkel sees it, that's a huge opportunity for Fundamental. Using Nexus, the company can bring contemporary techniques to Big Data analysis, offering something more powerful and flexible than the algorithms that are currently in use. “And on each one of those use cases, you get better performance than what you would otherwise be able to do with an army of data scientists.” Hear from 250+ tech leaders, dive into 200+ sessions, and explore 300+ startups building what's next.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Newsletter platform Substack has confirmed a data breach in an email to users. The company said that in October, an “unauthorized third party” accessed user data, including email addresses, phone numbers, and other unspecified “internal metadata.” Substack specified that more sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, passwords, and other financial information, was unaffected. In an email sent to users, Substack chief executive Chris Best said that the company identified the issue in February that allowed someone to access its systems. “I'm reaching out to let you know about a security incident that resulted in the email address and phone number from your Substack account being shared without your permission,” said Best in the email to users. The company said that it doesn't have any evidence that users' data is being misused, but did not say what technical means, such as logs, it has to detect evidence of abuse. However, the company asked users to take caution with emails and texts without any particular indicators or direction. On its website, Substack says that its site has more than 50 million active subscriptions, including 5 million paid subscriptions — a milestone it reached last March. In July 2025, the company raised $100 million in Series C funding led by BOND and The Chernin Group (TCG) with participation from a16z, Klutch Sports Group CEO Rich Paul, and Skims co-founder Jens Grede.

Given its proximity to the problem, you might expect that ASRock would have already put out a statement about it. In an official statement published on its website's "News" section, ASRock says it is "closely monitoring recent discussions regarding the performance and behavior of AMD Ryzen™ 9000 series processors on ASRock AMD platforms." No mention of exactly what the issues are, and no specific mention of Ryzen 9 or X3D processors, either — simply, 'we heard there's a problem, and we're looking into it.' This echoes a similar statement from ASUS recently, and MSI has also released remarks on the issue. In most reports, these chips normally get so hot that they leave scorch marks on the CPU and socket. Well, they don't normally fail at all, but you understand. We don't want to overstate the frequency of this issue; at the time of writing, there are around 350 reports, which sounds like a lot until you consider both that reports are not the same as verified, root-caused failures, and also the hundreds of thousands of Socket AM5 CPUs that are out there. The "burnt CPUs" issue initially plagued the Ryzen 7000 series processors way back in 2023, and last year, it was frequently framed as an issue specifically affecting AMD's "X3D" gaming processors with 3D V-Cache. While the pictures of burned processors and melted CPU sockets are certainly evocative, it's not really clear that this problem is indicative of any kind of design flaw or reproducible fault in the processors or the motherboards. Hardware YouTubers Gamers Nexus have put quite a few hours into trying to intentionally cause this kind of failure, and their efforts have largely been in vain, even when using a motherboard that was known to have already killed a processor once. Who's actually at fault in that case is difficult to say, but AMD is replacing CPUs that die in this manner under its standard warranty, so it's hard to find fault there, anyway. ASRock says it is "working in seamless coordination with AMD continuously to further validate system performance across a wide range of hardware configurations, while optimizing BIOS and enhancing overall system stability." While some users see the company silently shipping BIOS updates that modify voltage behavior and power profiles as an admission of guilt, it's just as likely that ASRock wants to minimize the amount of support requests it has to field and the number of processors AMD has to replace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Exorcist: Martyr has added another huge name to its cast. Plus, get a very early look at season 9 of Rick & Morty. A new report from The InSneider alleges that a return to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is a high priority for newly installed CEO and President team Josh D'Amaro and Dana Walden, with the next project purportedly combining prior plans for a Margot Robbie-led female spinoff and a mainline Pirates film to create a new film that will feature Robbie's character and the young son of Jack Sparrow. Bloody-Disgusting reports Sophia Wilde is attached to star in Soon You Will Be Gone and Possibly Eaten, a sci-fi thriller based on the short story by Nick Antosca (Channel Zero) from director Egor Abramenko. Written for the screen by Luke Piotrowski and Ben Collins (Hellraiser 2022, The Night House), the story concerns Rob and Sabile, “a young engaged couple who head to a secluded mountain resort to take their vows and step into the new chapter of their shared lives. What was planned as a joyous wedding attended by family members takes a different turn when unexpected guests crash the ceremony.” Deadline also has word Chiwetel Ejiofor has joined the cast of The Exorcist: Martyr in a currently undisclosed role. Speaking with GamesRadar+, Chris Hemsworth stated it was “pretty cool” when Chris Evans' Steve Rogers unexpectedly returns on a motorbike in Avengers: Doomsday. It was pretty cool when [Chris] Evans comes up on the motorbike, and because no one knew he was going to be in the film, and then there he is. You know, who knows, there might be things I'm already doing that are…I'm around. Variety reports the new Faces of Death has been acquired by IFC and Shudder. Deadline reports filming has begun on Rule of Three, the intended first part of a new horror trilogy starring Thomasin McKenzie, Chloe East, Jimmi Simpson, Sutton Foster, Tom Everett Scott, and Bilal Hasna.

As Tesla begins its sudden pivot from an EV firm to a robotics and AI company, it's building out the supply chain it will need to reach its lofty goals of affordable humanoid robots that are manufactured at a rapid pace. But the scale of its production ambitions means it will need to rely heavily on the supply of raw materials, components, and manufacturing labor from China, as SCMP reports. It also sources many of the batteries for its vehicles from Chinese suppliers, and uses lots of raw materials in vehicle production sourced from China. China is also a major buyer of its vehicles, with over a third of all its sales in 2025 coming from China. From America's side, the economic muscle came from its access to cutting-edge graphics cards and other chips used for AI training and inference. China's strength came from its manufacturing industry and access to raw materials, often termed "rare earths." Although both are necessary for the AI industry to flourish, the ratio is much more lopsided when it comes to robotics. The "brain" of a humanoid robot will always demand impressive processing power and benefit from advanced AI software; the robots themselves demand an awful lot of critical materials. Many of those materials are mostly found in China. While Chinese manufacturing and supply dominance affects all industries that produce just about everything, the scale of critical materials and manufacturing know-how necessary for next-generation robotics makes companies like Tesla incredibly dependent on the country. In short, they need a lot of stuff to make them, and a lot of that stuff comes primarily from China. Although key materials like Beryllium and Boron have strong supply chains within the U.S., China dominates the global supply of critical materials like Gallium (94%! ), Zinc, Neodymium, Molybdenum, Indium, and Praseodymium, to name just a few. “With about 50 to 70 per cent of manufacturing and core component production expertise residing in China, we expect Chinese players to take on greater roles in the global humanoid robot supply chain,” said Cheng Xin, a partner at US consultancy Bain & Co. “In some core components … they accounted for at least 55 per cent of the global humanoid robot bill of materials (BOM).” China has enormous control over the supply of almost everything Tesla needs to build its next generation of humanoid robots. In April last year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk complained that a Chinese block on exporting "rare-earth magnets" had impacted production of the Tesla Optimus robot. The American government is aware of this chokepoint in its supply of such critical materials - many of which are also important for national security and the production of cutting-edge silicon - and is attempting to develop a new stockpile to provide a buffer against China's dominance. But even that $12 billion investment would only amount to a 60-day reserve, and its focus is on providing the necessary materials for civilian needs. In such a scenario where access to raw materials was cut off, Tesla would be forced to compete with many other firms and organizations that need those same materials. Even beyond the risk of mercurial leadership threatening trade relations, China also has its own domestic humanoid robotics industry to consider. There are over 100 Chinese companies currently working on designs, and Chinese officials are making moves to centralize their development to accelerate progress and cut down on parallel research. Chinese companies are already shipping consumer-grade robots, with over 13,000 deployed in 2025 alone. Just as BYD has overtaken Tesla in the EV space, China seems almost destined to get a huge head start in humanoid robotics over Western companies like Tesla. It already has more units in the world, its production is already higher, its access to key technologies and raw materials is better, and on tap. That's not something Tesla or other Western robotics firms can match. And if China ever needed to slow down the competition, it could turn the tap off for those same supplies that are much harder to find anywhere else. Even if that didn't halt progression elsewhere, it would have a huge effect on pricing. Jon Martindale is a contributing writer for Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Spotify users face yet another price hike, book lovers have some exciting developments to look forward to that could help cushion the blow. The company also introduced two features designed to make the audiobook experience smoother and more flexible, including a new tool called “Page Match” that lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook. Additionally, “Audiobook Recaps”—a previously iOS-only feature—is coming to Android devices in the spring. ​Spotify's decision to sell physical books through its app positions it as a competitor to major booksellers, including Amazon and Barnes & Noble. The company also recognizes that many readers still value physical books, and by offering both print and digital formats, Spotify is trying to turn itself into a one-stop shop for book lovers. Spotify has partnered with Bookshop.org on the new offering, an online marketplace that supports local, independent bookstores. This partnership is great news for indie booksellers, as every purchase made via Spotify will directly benefit local book communities. The ability to purchase physical books will roll out this spring and appear on audiobook pages in the app as a button labeled “Add to your bookshelf at home.” Clicking it takes users to Bookshop's website, which handles the pricing, inventory, and shipping. To bridge the gap between formats, Spotify is also launching a feature called Page Match, which is currently available to premium subscribers and will roll out to all audiobook users by late February. The feature was initially spotted by Android Authority last month. There are now more than 500,000 titles on the platform. Plus, more than half of Spotify's 281 million premium subscribers have engaged with an audiobook. Spotify is expected to release its fourth-quarter earnings results February 10.

Building on the latter, Digital Foundry discovered that both DLSS 4.5 Presets M and L are capable of reconstructing ray-traced reflections almost perfectly (depending on the game), as long as in-game denoisers are turned off.Digital Foundry saw this behavior in Crysis 3 and Silent Hill 2, where DLSS 4.5 produced noticeably better ray-traced image quality with each game's denoiser turned off compared to with them turned on. Boiling and image noise are problems that ray-traced effects naturally produce. However, one caveat with these filters is that they generally do not produce a perfect image. NVIDIA introduced DLSS Ray Reconstruction to help solve this problem, and Ray Reconstruction itself generally provides better image quality with AI, compared to the capabilities of traditional denoisers. NVIDIA has tuned the transformer model of its DLSS upscaler so well that it alone can remove the aforementioned artifacts that ray tracing effects generate naturally. Also, DLSS 4.5 is doing this without Ray Reconstruction — since Ray Reconstruction has not yet been updated to support the newer DLSS 4.5 model.If Nvidia can fully leverage this feature and improve it, we could very well see it stop supporting Ray Reconstruction (or, rename it and bake it into the upscaler portion of DLSS instead, at a future date). This would simplify DLSS and make life potentially easier for developers to incorporate DLSS into ray tracing games, as they would not need to worry about Ray Reconstruction integration. However, this will all depend on how effective DLSS 4.5 is at denoising. Digital Foundry is the only outlet we've seen so far that's covered this behavior in-depth, and it has only covered it in just two titles. There could be issues with DLSS 4.5's denoising capabilities in other ray tracing games and/or effects that we are not aware of at this point. This is critical since not all ray-tracing games officially allow gamers to disable a game's built-in denoiser.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Western Digital this week outlined its near-term and mid-term plans to increase hard drive capacities to around 60TB and beyond with optimizations that significantly increase HDD performance for the AI and cloud era. In addition, the company outlined its longer-term vision for hard disk drives' evolution that includes a new laser technology for heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), new platters with higher areal density, and HDD assemblies with up to 14 platters. As a result, WD will be able to offer drives beyond 140 TB in the 2030s. Western Digital plans to volume produce its inaugural commercial hard drives featuring HAMR technology next year, with capacities rising from 40TB (CMR) or 44TB (SMR) in late 2026, with production ramping in 2027. These drives will use the company's proven 11-platter platform with high-density media as well as HAMR heads with edge-emitting lasers that heat iron-platinum alloy (FePt) on top of platters to its Curie temperature — the point at which its magnetic properties change — and reducing its magnetic coercivity before writing data. These edge-emitting lasers are efficient enough to make HAMR possible, but are mechanically and optically constrained, according to Ahmed Shihab, chief product officer at Western Digital. These lasers waste part of the generated light and are physically tall. That height forces additional spacing between platters, while optical losses limit how much thermal energy can be delivered to the media — both factors directly restrict areal density scaling. More importantly, edge-emitting HAMR lasers are made with low yields as they rely on mechanical cleaving, precision optical alignment, and thermal screening, which prevents wafer-level testing. "Everybody in the industry, us included, use what is called an edge-emitting laser," Shibab said. The light produced sometimes is wasted, so they waste a bit of energy that could be better used elsewhere. They're quite tall, so we have to make sure the platters are some distance apart from each other. To remove these limitations, Western Digital spent six years developing a patented vertical-emitting laser. This change enables two parallel advances: higher areal density (up from today's four terabytes per platter all the way to 10 TBs per platter) as well as a thinner head assembly that allows more disks to be packed into the same 3.5-inch drive. Furthermore, Western Digital's new vertical laser is made using a lithography process and can be tested on a wafer independently of the head, so the company also expects meaningfully higher manufacturing yields. Alongside its new vertical laser technology, Western Digital is also working on an HDD platform capable of housing up to 14 platters, another part of the equation enabling the company to increase the capacity of its hard drives significantly over the next 10 years or so. The 12-platter platform will first be used with 60TB ePMR drives in 2028. While Western Digital does not disclose how many platters the company's 60TB HAMR HDD will use, it says that its ePMR and HAMR drives will use the same platform, which suggests that HAMR products will also use generally the same design. Which is perhaps why Shihab carefully frames the new vertical laser technology not as a one-time capacity boost, but as a structural reset of HAMR's scaling curve that will aggressively grow starting in 2028 and is expected to enable 100TB HDDs in 2029 ~ 2030. In fact, once the vertical laser technology reaches its apex with granular media, sometime in the 2030s, Western Digital will be able to offer drives with an up to 140 TB capacity. Interestingly, but Western Digital's dual-actuator Dual Pivot HDDs that promise to double both bandwidth and sequential I/O IOPS performance also enter the scene at a 60TB capacity, though the company is tight-lipped whether these hard drives use ePMR or HAMR recording technology. "Dual Pivot technology helps customers focus their software effort on improving more performance for AI versus having to deal with how the hard drives work," Western Digital's chief product officer said. "We will introduce this at the 60 TB mark. […] So we are starting to put High Bandwidth drive technology in our customers hands today [and] my biggest problem is finding them enough material so they can start testing. After that 140 TB milestone (which is pretty contingent), the company will have to move on to ordered granular (OG) and eventually bit patterned media (BPM), which is when HDD disks will be patterned using highly sophisticated etching, nanoimprint lithography, e-beam lithography, or even photolithography. Excess energy can disturb neighboring bits, while insufficient energy prevents reliable writes, which is why somewhere along the line, HDD makers will have to invent next-generation laser designs that will combine heating performance with extreme precision.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So what happens to that machine when you put it inside a box and fling it far beyond the safety of our planet's atmosphere? This, in vastly oversimplified terms, is the question that biomedical researchers at NASA have been asking for decades. These scientists study the health impacts of spaceflight to develop methods that protect astronauts' bodies and minds, using ground research facilities, analog environments, and the International Space Station to conduct cutting-edge studies. Now that NASA is finally sending humans back to the Moon, these scientists are preparing for the research opportunity of a lifetime. The Artemis 2 mission will send NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen farther from Earth than any human has gone before. During their 10-day flight around the Moon, they will encounter high levels of space radiation and reach a maximum distance of 250,000 miles from Earth. “I often talk about the most complicated system on this vehicle is going to be the human,” Steven Platts, chief scientist of the Human Research Program at NASA's Johnson Space Center, told Gizmodo. If Platts and his colleagues have learned anything from their decades of research, it's that spaceflight puts a lot of strain on the human body. He explained that there are five primary health hazards associated with spaceflight: radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, gravity (or lack thereof), and hostile, confined environments. These hazards manifest differently depending on the mission profile, Platts said. The Artemis 2 crew will spend a far shorter period of time in microgravity than astronauts on standard ISS missions, for example. Still, 10 days is long enough to trigger certain physiological changes, such as fluid shifts and vestibular disruption. When it comes to radiation, the Artemis 2 astronauts will get a much higher daily dose than those aboard the ISS. The Orion spacecraft—which will carry the Artemis 2 astronauts on this journey—is designed to shield its crew from most of this radiation, but measuring how much breaks through and how human cells and DNA respond to it is crucial. Orion is equipped with thousands of sensors that will measure radiation levels inside the spacecraft. Each crew member will also carry a sensor called a Crew Active Dosimeter in their pockets to closely monitor their exposure levels. Artemis 2 will investigate this in several different ways. During this mission, crew members will act as both researchers and test subjects, gathering data that will help NASA build interventions, protocols, and preventative measures to protect astronaut health. One study, called ARCHeR (Artemis Research for Crew Health and Readiness), will investigate how the deep space environment affects sleep, stress, cognition, and teamwork, all of which are key to astronaut health and performance. Participating crew members will wear wristbands that continuously monitor their movement and sleep patterns throughout the mission. While in flight, they will blot their saliva onto a special type of paper in pocket-sized booklets, eliminating the need for a wet-sample refrigeration system on board the Orion spacecraft. Saliva is an excellent indicator of human health, as it contains a rich mixture of biomarkers that signal immune system function. Measuring how this stress hormone fluctuates over the course of the mission will be critical, as stress is linked to many of the adverse health outcomes of spaceflight, he explained. They will be the first astronauts in deep space to participate in the Spaceflight Standard Measures study, which has been collecting blood, urine, and saliva samples from astronauts aboard the ISS and elsewhere since 2018. These samples help researchers evaluate astronauts' nutritional status, cardiovascular health, and immunological function. Short for “A Virtual Astronaut Tissue Analog Response,” AVATAR involves USB-sized “organ chips” that contain living human cells cultured inside microscopic, fluid-filled channels. These chips are designed to simulate the structure, function, and physiological responses of human organs. “The chip will function essentially like our bone marrow does,” Platts explained. “If I'm going to fly in two years, [NASA] can fly a tissue chip of me—my avatar—ahead of time and then bring it back and see what's going to happen so that they can design the countermeasures for me, for my personal use.” Artemis 2 will be the first mission to fly with this biotechnology. Together, these studies will produce a wealth of data, helping to pave the way for NASA's return to the lunar surface and extend humanity's reach deeper into the solar system. “It's just amazing how many things we're going to be able to find out just from this one mission,” Platts said.

SSA told the court that all DOGE access to personally identifiable information (PII) was revoked by March 24, 2025.That turned out to be false: a DOGE member ran PII searches the morning of March 24, stopping only around 9:30 a.m.; access was not fully cut until about noon.2) Sent SSA data to a DOGE official outside SSA.On March 3, 2025, an SSA DOGE member emailed an encrypted file believed to contain names and addresses of ~1,000 people to Steve Davis, a senior advisor to the U.S. DOGE organization (and a DOL employee).The file likely contained data derived from SSA systems of record.It is unknown whether Davis received the password or accessed it.3) Was given PII access during the TRO even though this was barred.One DOGE member was granted access to 10 PII databases from March 26 to April 2 (never used, but still improper).Another received a call-center profile that could access PII from April 9 to June 11; whether PII was viewed is unknown.4) Had broader systems access than the court was told. SSA discovered additional access that had not been disclosed earlier, including:Systems containing SSA employee records.Systems controlling building/IT badge access.Shared workspaces that could pool sensitive data.A data-visualization tool that could reach PII.Additional data-warehouse schemas.5) Engaged in partisan election-related work inside SSA.In March 2025, a political advocacy group asked two DOGE members to analyze state voter rolls to try to overturn election results.One DOGE member signed a “Voter Data Agreement” as an SSA employee with that group on March 24, without agency approval.SSA later referred this conduct to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel for possible Hatch Act violations.6) Used an unapproved third-party server to share SSA data.From March 7–17, 2025, DOGE members used Cloudflare links to transfer data.Cloudflare is not authorized for SSA data storage; SSA still does not know what data were sent or whether it remains on that server.

Like always, the left's problem is that their proposed solutions read like they were written by teenagers, based on emotions and dismissive of the reasons why their supposed “enemies” disagree with them.Most Americans would support having ICE operate perhaps even entirely with nonlethal weapons. That would be a smart thing to push for! But the party line is instead “Abolish ICE.” And of course nobody (who isn't pro-open-borders) trusts that there's any Democratic plan besides look-the-other-way and maybe amnesty.

Yet now it's getting undone for seemingly no reason. But I hope that there would actually be one, so please enlighten me and the other commenters. This makes a great talking point, but those immigrants eventually assimilated into the culture, and also importantly, they were specifically allowed to come because the US needed more people in order to power its economy. This was badly needed 100 years ago.Today most illegal immigrants are uneducated and are either working in the unofficial economy or in service-sector jobs, which depresses wages for everyone with low education. We don't need every restaurant to have an unending stream of desperately poor would-be busboys and dishwashers, or for Uber to have a stream of poor drivers. Or for rich people to have an ample supply of housekeepers paid in cash. All that does is keep wages in the toilet for working people.But about open borders, why are so many Latin American countries such bad places to live that so many of their people want to come to the US? Open borders just means anyone can walk right in and bring all of their problems with them, not to mention their drug and human trafficking operations and the criminal gangs that operate them. We already have enough of that as it is.No Western country can stay civilized with open borders. Anyone with half a brain can see how it is going in the UK and France, where they are only a bit more "open borders" than the US has been.

Merely for illustration, a single example: https://abc7.com/post/protests-expected-socal-part-nationwid...> Protesters were seen carrying flags, signs and spraying graffiti on nearby property, including on the U.S. Courthouse sign where it read "No one is illegal on stolen land". Courthouse sign where it read "No one is illegal on stolen land". This is completely orthogonal to the conversation, but I think you misunderstood that slogan. It does not mean “immigration rules must not be enforced”.It means differentiating between a potentially illegal action (illegal entry/overstaying) and the person itself. You never talk about an illegal driver, or an illegal drinker, but people talk about illegal immigrants, with the implication that the person itself is illegal.It's subtle but it's a step towards dehumanizing a person, or making infractions to their rights “count less” in the public eye.

I think the present-day recommended term is probably just "immigrant" right? So basically we should call them the same thing we call the people who waited years for their turn and proved that they had a positive contribution to make to our society. You are either misinformed, willfully ignorant or lying, and I've had it with this discussion style.Yes, people who use "no one is illegal" do also say "no more borders". Because we're looking for people saying borders should be completely opened. An example of people saying something else is irrelevant.> Yes, people who use "no one is illegal" do also say "no more borders".Ok but the conversation is about people saying the latter. > Yes, people who use "no one is illegal" do also say "no more borders".Ok but the conversation is about people saying the latter. > Here a UK exampleWhich British parties are active in the United States?> Another example, also showing this is an older movementThe claim was that "the left" has no response to emigration issues beyond "open all borders" and that this was the policy of "one party."

The grandparent post accurately captured what I have understood people to mean by "no one is illegal" -- it is meant to protest a dehumanizing way to describe a class of people. Don't you guys remind us about Obama being "the deporter in chief" every time you are given the occasion ? Obama and Biden, famously, deported more people than Trump. Is this "no immigration enforcement" party in the room with us right now? Given the present tide of things, however, I think there's no amount of course-correction back toward the left that would prove excessive. My opinion on this will change as soon as the tide does, and e.g. a leftist president endorses indiscriminate murder of ICE agents, or something equally egregious to what we're seeing in the opposite direction.In a more ideological sense, though, I tend to despise the left/right continuum and think it is unhelpful for analysis.

There are qualitative differences between both political geoups, so grouping them together as a single horseshoe is 'unhelpful for analysis'.That said, you cant fully rule out leftist led atrocities aswell and maybe thats the reason why the right is escalating in violent rhetoric, they want this as a self fullfilling prophecy to justify more violence.When Kirk was shot, all the "this needs to stop" commentary, as if it was an organized mass phenomenon, was sending shivers down my spine. We all know how the far right envisions stopping this 'mass' violence.

I'm not aware of legislation introduced by the democrats, either when they were in power or today, that proposed anything resembling this. There are individual congresspeople calling for ICE to be abolished (which is not the same as having no immigration enforcement) but leadership within the democrats is very clear that they support extremely minor reforms like making ICE agents wear masks less frequently. This is considerably more minor than disarming ICE agents, which you claim would have nationwide support. If I want what I believe is a reasonable policy and the enforcers of that policy start doing the worst job ever, it is my duty to call them out, not to call out the opposing side for mostly imaginary reasons.Abolish ICE is not a unreasonable take. If the agents working in this agency have become some ultra politicized paramilitary, it makes sense to abolish it and create a new agency altogether. If the agents working in this agency have become some ultra politicized paramilitary, it makes sense to abolish it and create a new agency altogether. It was aggressive, it was inhumane, and immigrants were killed despite a massive effort by people from "the left" to feed and clothe people who were detained in open fields or between two border fences without any care being provided by the US agencies detaining them.Maybe you are right that nobody who is right-leaning trusts that the US democratic party isn't pro border enforcement and anti immigration, but that's based purely on lies and propaganda. It's using immigration as a pretext to build an unaccountable group of thugs that disappear people into camps, murder political opponents and surveil the populace (as seen in OP). It's recruiting primarily from far-right militias, regularizing them into a paramilitary force of the regime.There is no justifiable reason to have them terrorize an entire city like they have been doing in Minneapolis.The brownshirts needed to be abolished in the 1920s, a pinky-swear they wouldn't do the thing they were designed to do wouldn't have been enough.The same applies to their modern equivalent.

It's fine to make reasonable sounding comments but for the love of God, a bit honesty wouldn't kill you. Or the 'you aren't doing anything illegal but the masked government agents don't like it so they are going to use your biometrics to harass you in whatever ways the feds can make your life more difficult' laws? Doesn't address ICE saying on the street they are adding people using biometrics to a database for targeted federal harassment (without any conviction violating the Constitution, if you are, you know, concerned about our nation's HIGHEST laws). You're awfully full of invective for someone that doesn't care. As for escalation, perhaps look to officer-involved shootings that were totally unnecessary and whose entire proximate cause was the same kind of hysteria-driven emotional dysregulation you're exhibiting here.I'm getting what I voted for, and to be honest, it's a breath of fresh air.

Consumer pays $1.10 for a can of coke, $0.10 of that goes to ad-tech, the consumer watches some coke ads, ad-tech pays $0.05 to the publisher and the consumer receives $0.05 in benefits in the form of "free ad-supported content" (which they already paid $0.10 for).The only way for consumers to avoid this is to just stop spending money with any brand that advertises online, which is completely unrealistic and a much taller ask than asking employees to give up their deal with the devil (and work for just about anyone else except big tech).

You can't buy a car or any smartphones you've ever heard of, you won't find an ISP that doesn't advertise online, and good luck finding a decent job without supporting ad-tech. A big chain like kroger, for example, is spending around 10 to 100M.

If the goal is to decrease money going into advertisement budgets, then the best thing you can do is buy store brand when possible. Even if both products are ultimately made from Nestle corp, the cheaper store brand will send less money into Nestle's pockets which means less money for advertising.That's what I mean by "avoiding nationally branded products". A package of "signature frozen peas" will taste just as good as the "birds eye green peas" without sending money to a major company (Looks like all the major companies have spun off their frozen food departments, but at one time this was a Nestle brand.

An easy way to make some poor schlemiel creating a miserable report with user location data during his sprint into a greedy bastard that is just enriching his bank account out of the suffering of plenty. You guys seem to need collective action and civil disobedience.Then again.. maybe the will for collective action comes only after the repossessions... Expecting individuals to take the burden for decisions way beyond their control is silly. It takes immense fortitude to threaten the well being of those dear to you based on principle, when the only outcome is your own suffering (the company will likely find another employee right away anyway).

Just the State- and it does not care about your religion or sexual preferences. You do realize this is what most criminals of the world just so happen to say as well, right?Where is the line? At the time I was still paying rent and needed employment to keep my visa. I also had little savings, and an ill parent that depended on me. I certainly couldn't take the principled stance of "fuck this, I'm out".My point is that if you are in the position to take a principled stance, good for you. Maybe you already own your home, maybe you had time to accumulate savings, maybe you can do a few interviews and land a less evil job even in the current market (and perhaps a pay cut won't be a massive blow in you life). All that is awesome, but also a position of relative privilege.Prescribing principled stance as universal without recognizing this is just cruelty though.

There's even the argument to be made that if no legislation exists, even if you're anti X, you might get incentivized to build a company for X just so it's not a fan of X at the helm of the top company for X.Blaming it on the employees is pointless.

You're basically saying "There isnt anything inherently wrong about working for the 4th Reich" Not all LEOs are brown shirts, In my experience, few are, but they give the lot a bad rap.Treating LEOs uniformly as evil is just counterproductive Treating LEOs uniformly as evil is just counterproductive No one becomes a cop because they want to be nice and help vulnerable people. Being a cop involves exerting violence towards people who are vulnerable and desperate, and to become one you have to be fine with this. Some would say that this alone is enough to deem a person ethically dubious.Even if one would accept the premise that society requires some degree of organised violence towards its members, one would also have to handle the question of accountability. Reasonably this violence should be accountable in relation to the victims of it, and police institutions inherently are not.I think that we should also note that the other person above used "childishly" to denote something negative, apparently they don't think of kids as the light of the world and childish as something fun and inspiring.

Perhaps the conflict is that you just want to make people who work in ad tech feel bad, and don't care whether or not they enable ICE? But then we don't have much to talk about and I'm not sure what you hope to gain from being here. To me opposing ICE is very important - I think tobacco companies are pretty bad too, but if ICE sent out a request for cartons of cigarettes I'd shovel praise on them for declining. Yes—and one of the tools we have for that is shunning.If enough of us who are appalled and disgusted by the state of things, and the people who willingly lend themselves to creating said state, make our disgust with those people known, it can lead to some of them choosing to act differently, because they care about being thought well of by their fellow techies.

And just like I detest those that fall for the money I have insane respect for those that stand up. I would argue that whatever is happening now is part of the revenge of the nerds once the nerds remain unsatisfied despite the material possessions they acquired as software ate the world.People deeply disconnected from the real world, seeing numbers and thinking with numbers without understanding the underlying realities of those numbers is a trait of any low touch system that developers and other IT professionals operate within.Just yesterday apparently when asked Trump said "it's just two people" that were executed by ICE and steered the conversation when he was pushed to elaborate.Probably from tech perspective ICE is incredibly well working, in tech world you can take away the livelihood of thousands of people by a single line of a code that changes an algorithm that bans someone or re-sorts the search results.

The recent tragedies are indeed thoroughly depressing for all of us, but we shouldn't let our emotional reactions destroy our ability to reason and think objectively about history and statistics.

Don't be narrow minded, we need broad thinking not simplistic pathos driven dogmas and references to nazis. History doesn't repeat but we're teetering on the edge of a large-scale horrific rhyme.

We built a vast surveillance network under the guise of servings ads and making money, and lost track of how this power could be abused by an entity not aligned with our own values. For example, we all stood by when we let Twitter and other US-based social media become the main way politicians communicate with the public. This has, in my opinion, had disastrous consequences on how they communicate and actively blocks politicians from achieving consensus.This is to say that you don't need to have actively worked on something. However, I think a lot of people in tech could and did see those consequences coming and were pretty vocal about it. I don't want to seem accusatory here and I don't mean it harshly, but maybe you just didn't see the folks who have talked about problems like this.We also as individuals [without billions] have fairly limited capacity to directly act against these things. I donate a fair bit to the EFF for instance and I've sent outreach to representatives multiple times over the years for specific bills and when its possible I vote against surveillance.

I donate a fair bit to the EFF for instance and I've sent outreach to representatives multiple times over the years for specific bills and when its possible I vote against surveillance. I don't necessarily mean to berate the public, but rather the politicians, who saw that they could use social media/big tech for their own personal gain, and the media, who went along with the narrative that putting all our public communication into privately owned platforms was good for democracy. And maybe our own governments and institutions (speaking from a EU perspective) for dropping the ball in protecting us.I think Evgeny Morozov's 2010-ish writing was prophetic in this regard. I think Evgeny Morozov's 2010-ish writing was prophetic in this regard. There are also articles from 2011 where political commenters noted how the Obama campaign broke new ground using targeted Facebook advertisement and outreach, and how EU politicians could learn from it. The many smaller, but in total larger donations given to Obama was contrasted with Hillary Clinton who had larger individual donations but less in total, and the commenters attributed this to the use of Facebook and finding and meeting a younger audience on those online platforms.People thought that targeted advertisement was a good thing and politicians looked on the techniques from that election and saw the potential for power. It was mostly just those privacy advocates, free software advocates and security experts that expressed doubt and warned about the dangers.

This user is still on twitter and actively promoting their handle there I'm totally fine stopping at minimizing my culpability. We can't seriously believe that this agency has any sense of respect for privacy right? While trying to degoogling, removing most proprietary software and use sandboxing for everything that's still needed as proprietary, you would often hear that stupid pro-surveillance thesis: "oh, what's wrong in someone trying to show you relevant things in the internet to buy by your interests? That giving someone's leverage over youself is a ticking bomb until the actually scary people will use it as an advantage. That's humanity 101.Same about non-encrypted emails, cloud AI providers, SMS/real-identity based auth and 2fa, telemetry. The industry is full of trash and has to be revived from VC garbage.

There has been a few news articles (and court cases) where this question has been raised and it is not strict true. Employee actions are only actions for which the employee has been given as an task as part of their employment and role. When this end up in court, the role description and employee contract becomes very important.A clear case example is when a doctor is looking up data on a patient. Downloading patient records from people who they are not the doctor for can be criminal and not just a breech of hospital policy, especially if they sell or transfer the data.

At work we have stopped buying new American services, but there's been very little reduction of existing use. ICE is using biometrics on people who have not broken any law, then saying the federal government will be doing whatever it can in its power to penalize those people now that they have been identified as doing... absolutely nothing illegal but stuff the impedes ICE's ability to operate in secret (among other things a violate of those people's due process rights).We don't do the whole 'secret police' thing in the USA, and we tend to get angry when the Government violates our Constitutional rights. Not sure how much of the heavy lifting is your "if" and the qualifier does, but I hope it's just sarcasm.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google's AI assistant Gemini App now has more than 750 million monthly active users, CEO Sundar Pichai said at parent company Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call. That's roughly 100 million more users than the 650 million monthly active users the company reported in its third-quarter earnings report. “We are also seeing significantly higher engagement per user, especially since the launch of Gemini 3,” Pichai said. “[Gemini 3] has seen the fastest adoption of any model in our history.” AI enthusiasts praised the capabilities of the model far and wide on social media, with even some long-time ChatGPT fanboys like Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff admitting to converting to Gemini. AI benchmarking firm LMArena's cofounder Wei-Lin Chiang even called the release “more than a leaderboard shuffle.” Gemini 3 was so well-received that only a couple of weeks later, OpenAI leadership declared “code red” at the company. Even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose company has significant business with OpenAI, reportedly raised worries over the competition Google now poses to OpenAI's market dominance. Despite the huge jump in users for Gemini, there might still be a long way to go until it can suprpass ChatGPT to become the chatbot leader. OpenAI doesn't report regular data on ChatGPT active users, but a The Information report from December claimed that ChatGPT was nearing 900 million users weekly at the time. With high-profile launches like Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro, Google has been able to save its once-battered AI reputation following the failed launch of Gemini image generation in early 2024. “I think we are in a very, very relentless innovation cadence, and I think we are confident about maintaining that momentum as we go through '26,” Pichai said in the earnings call. Executives shared that they are planning to double capital expenditures in 2026, with the majority going towards AI. Apple recently tapped Gemini to power its AI revamp of Siri that is set to launch later this year, and Samsung announced last month that it was planning to double the amount of its Gemini-infused mobile devices. You might also want to start preparing to have your Gemini chats plagued by ads, but that might still be further on the horizon. The Google-pilled ChromeOS may die so that ‘Aluminum' will live.

I was especially annoyed by recruiters that couldn't do math. I guess the place is crawling with 35-year-olds with 30 years of experience.As it turned out, I ended up giving up, and just retiring. I had the means, but wanted to keep working for at least another decade. I was especially interested in helping small companies get on their feet, as my particular skillset would have been almost ideal for that, and my “nest egg” gave me a pretty good risk tolerance, along with a willingness to take a lower base.Turns out that these were the exact companies that didn't want me, though.Also turned out that I really loved being retired. In fact, I actively resist pursuing a paycheck, as I don't want to deal with knuckleheads, anymore.I just had to have my hand forced.

Having experience usually means that you've acquired a holistic view of software development. Wait for them to call back in a couple of years. Wait for them to call back in a couple of years. Ironically, the only people who have social permission to do that are extremely expensive Big Name outside consultants. Who will then do one of two things: either speak to the staff, collate what they have to say, and launder it back to the boss; or produce a thinly veiled adaptation of whatever business book the CEO last read in an airport. Usually those kind of companies won't hire old employees, while at the same time will gladly pay for consulting knowledge to solve their problems.Also while product companies tend to hire folks that the very last thing they worked on checks all bullet points on the HR job ad, agencies will gladly throw people at a problem regardless of the skills list, as long as the team learns to swimm fast enough.

I did a few years at a company which was "product development consultancy", and this aspect of it was really enjoyable. We got a set of diverse challenges through the door, often "virtual startups" (CEO hiring consultants rather than staff in order to do v1 of a product). The company was basically a single room, and we had two senior guys (the founders) to review work and support us. Plus one "smartest guy in the room" who served as mathematician fire-support for things like signal processing or the rare actual DS&A problem. Also the bit about companies with more older workers performing better, and the bit about older people often losing jobs due to layoffs, sound like they could also fit together as high firm performance permitting long tenure rather than having to show only that experienced employees cause higher firm performance (although of course the examples demonstrate the latter via other means, so it can't be that it doesn't happen at all). This  reads more like marketing copy for the author's consulting firm than any serious research.They “help forward-thinking leaders and organisations see aging not as decline, but as a driver of innovation, resilience, and growth.” They “help forward-thinking leaders and organisations see aging not as decline, but as a driver of innovation, resilience, and growth.” even LLM get this basic shit wrong lmao.sorry a bit unrelated but considering the specific topic this tagline is suppose to address its really triggering. i cant beleive marketing ppl still dont realize that you dont sell something by say 'oh its not actually a turd its delicious'. even LLM get this basic shit wrong lmao.sorry a bit unrelated but considering the specific topic this tagline is suppose to address its really triggering. even LLM get this basic shit wrong lmao.sorry a bit unrelated but considering the specific topic this tagline is suppose to address its really triggering. sorry a bit unrelated but considering the specific topic this tagline is suppose to address its really triggering. I work in academia and the breadth of knowledge on how to get things done by the older workers in a bureaucracy is just astonishing. For some reason they always seem to be privately owned by one person rather than publicly traded or owned by a corporation. As an IC, all of my designs just simply work without any drama. What happens in this scenario is that as soon as they learn what they needed to learn from me I am usually out. Also there seems to be some concept of drama and running around like a chicken with your head cut off is "fun" and I am a buzz kill in this situation.As a manager I spend a lot of my time just making sure that everybody is set up for success as nobody seems to be able to advocate for themselves. In these roles I am retained as long as I wish.Smart doesn't equal knowledgeable and smart doesn't equal efficient.

Push back, tell me why I'm wrong or why we should do it differently (with reasons and data, of course). Those are the best team members.I currently manage an engineering team and all my team members are awesome, but the older ones are better at being informedly opinionated, which is very important. I currently manage an engineering team and all my team members are awesome, but the older ones are better at being informedly opinionated, which is very important. and most of the companies are still 100% top down with no talk back and everyone being a yes man. I still spot problems and “push back”, but I have the experience now to know how to get people to listen and not just write me off as an annoying prima donna. Being older is just part of the formula. Being good is another part, and having a good relationship with the company and coworkers, is just as important. That comes from longevity in the job, and also, a sense of security.Companies love to have workers that are constantly afraid they'll lose their jobs. Companies love to have workers that are constantly afraid they'll lose their jobs. There's a lot of negative stuff, said about older employees. Nevermind that work has become significantly more precarious, the cost of living higher, the wages lower.Ageism is just a dick move in general. It's gotten to the point where job candidates in their 30s and early 40s are dropping work history and education to appear as if they're in their 20s to potential employers - and even considering plastic surgery[1]. It's gotten completely out of control, but I'm quite glad to see more of my peers and younger colleagues taking a firm stance against it in any form.As long as the work gets done, everything else is irrelevant.

Stereotyping just gets your ass into legal trouble, and the easiest solution is to just not do it in the first place. But more often than not, the greybeards are super good team members in ways that the younger employees can't hope to compete with, because all that experience has taught them a ton about what works and what doesn't. But rather than trying to harness that valuable knowledge, companies shoot themselves in the foot by ignoring it. I've been pretty successful but my advice is almost always ignored. People with deep industry knowledge who were trained up to be decent programmers (middling, but serious, consistent, and quality focused), setting the direction. Those domain experts were working with young dumbasses who would burn 60+ hour weeks to make sales deadlines and keep current with ever shifting platform tech that breaks all the time. SMEs baked into the core development loop, DDD-made-flesh essentially, with cheaper more junior devs supporting scale for less money and maximizing the SMEs vision/contributions.It's an obvious and effective strategy. But it also hints that society doesn't need most of the labor for the system to still function. There's a vast continuum between grossly-unequal homeless everywhere like many corrupt, third-world countries with masked, paramilitary disappearance squads and a large, happy middle-class paid well that can afford to buy things, take vacations, and enjoy life where corruption is lesser. How does a society that allows not working function? How does it defend itself against attacking societies? The current allocation of who does and who does not have to work and how much they have to work is suboptimal, and one of the reasons for societal decay.>And the 2nd question looks like American propaganda where if you don't spend trillions and trillions on defense, the Chinese, Russian, whatever boogeyman will get you.There are multiple examples of the Chinese, Russian, Americans, and other boogeymen "getting" others in my short lifetime of 40 years.Either way, there's highly undesirable work that has to be done for many societies, whether it be cleaning sewers, farming in humid, hot weather, and educating one's self for 30 years just to do surgery at 2AM, and clean up the fluids and mess of that surgery. If only some people have to do that and not others, it obviously brings up questions of fairness, so the fair alternative is everyone has to work for a certain quality of life (which is not currently true for those with >$x assets). >And the 2nd question looks like American propaganda where if you don't spend trillions and trillions on defense, the Chinese, Russian, whatever boogeyman will get you.There are multiple examples of the Chinese, Russian, Americans, and other boogeymen "getting" others in my short lifetime of 40 years.Either way, there's highly undesirable work that has to be done for many societies, whether it be cleaning sewers, farming in humid, hot weather, and educating one's self for 30 years just to do surgery at 2AM, and clean up the fluids and mess of that surgery.

Giving a safe, inclusive place where old people can still be productive and feel like they matter is important.I think the article is correct in that older people can still be productive even at 60+ and it's a pity that we let them retire. Retiring is not the most healthy option for people! I think the article is correct in that older people can still be productive even at 60+ and it's a pity that we let them retire. Retiring is not the most healthy option for people! "Science moves forward one funeral at a time" - Max Planck I think the idea of making physical workplaces better accessible for older people also benefits the young as well. So many companies just assume “oh hey our factory workers/laborers are strong dudes they can handle XYZ repetitive task no problem.”But really, you're just making everyone less productive.I also think that companies underestimate the quality loss they get when they refuse to cultivate an environment that employees who have the wisdom of older age and perhaps more options to go elsewhere will tolerate.9/9/6 burnout shops chase away families with kids and older employees who know the value of time and bias themselves toward inexperience, working harder not smarter, and a general lack of diversity in life experience.

For example, I spent the better half of a Sunday making my Nespresso machine easier to use. I made a similar holder for some disposable coffee cups. “You're so lazy you can't just open the drawer?”, and other similar sentiments were repeated.Life is about friction and incentives. Make the good things easier to do (put vegetables in nice containers in an easy-to-see part of the fridge) and the bad things harder to do (charge your phone in another room to avoid using it in bed).This is all to say, however much willpower you think you have in a day, you have less than that. And you should spend your time building a life where the tired, exhausted version of you can do great things. Design a business effectively, and lazy/tired/stressed employees will still be able to contribute.

I had a reluctance to change because I didn't really see the point, it looked like Markdown, and who cares if Typst compiles faster, how much time is really spent compiling? I had a watch script set up to start recompiling on a change and it worked well enough.But eventually I decided to give it a try, and it sort of changed my entire perspective. Large LaTeX compilations could take upwards a minute, which doesn't sound that long, but similar documents could compile in milliseconds, from scratch, and it also supports incremental compilation. It was categorically faster and it wasn't really any harder than Markdown and if you use the Latin Modern font it doesn't look significantly different than LaTeX. I make my documents look nicer, make sure that the spacing look nicer, have better-placed page breaks, move text around more frequently to make my writing flow a bit nicer and better. I keep Evince open to the right, tmux with Neovim and `typst watch` on the left and my changes automatically load instantly, and as such I end up making my documents nicer.I still use LaTeX for stuff that has a lot of math formatting, but for everything else I use Typst and I find myself doing a lot more as a result. Also I almost never like the way that documents end up looking with MS Word.

What experience an older person has greatly varies, and this experience could be very useful or useless, depending on what the person has done in life.Unfortunately there is one experience/wisdom which almost all people learn with age, and that is being a knave. Just as our bodies and our minds generally deteriorate with age, so does the soul and the moral fibre - unfortunately. And employers aren't too keen to deal with such persons.But things might also be changing. The people aging right now are of a higher quality than the current generation of old.Also, many times your best employees will be old people.
