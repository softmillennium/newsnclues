            Marco Rubio now has one less critical role to worry about in the Trump administration.
    


            After nearly a year as acting archivist of the United States, Rubio's tenure has ended.
    


            Rubio's term expired with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which limits the time an acting officer can remain in the position.
    


            The National Archives and Records Administration's general counsel confirmed in a statement to CNN that Rubio was no longer serving as acting archivist.
    


            “Prior to the conclusion of his tenure, and to the extent permitted by law, Secretary Rubio delegated the authority to perform the functions of the Archivist to James Byron, who continues to serve as Senior Advisor to the Archivist,” Matt Dummermuth, general counsel for the National Archives and Records Administration, added in the statement.
    


            Rubio has worn several hats over the course of President Donald Trump's second term.
    


            Along with becoming the first person since Henry Kissinger to serve as secretary of state and national security adviser simultaneously, Rubio has been tasked with helping to run the transition of the Venezuelan government after the US ousted Nicolás Maduro – an operation in which Rubio played a key role.
    


            The former US senator from Florida was also the point man on shuttering the US Agency for International Development. Rubio posted on social media in August that he would give that job to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought.
    


            Trump, who used to criticize Rubio and call him “Little Marco,” named Rubio to the role of archivist last February after the surprise dismissal of Colleen Shogan, a Joe Biden appointee and the first woman to hold the post.
    


            The National Archives preserves US government records, including paper documents, photographs, maps, films and computer records. The Federal News Network was first to report that Rubio is no longer acting archivist.
    


            At a State Department event Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance joked about the many hats Rubio wears.
    


            “When he asked me to come and speak today, I said, man, this is your building; why don't you come and give a speech? And he said, well, because I've got five jobs and you've only got one,” Vance said. “And so, I figured I might as well do Marco a solid, since he's also the archivist and the official White House florist and has a number of other jobs in addition to Secretary of State.”
    


            Other members of the administration have poked fun at Rubio's multiple jobs. During the first cabinet meeting of the year, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin joked that Rubio should help him in the administration's efforts to rebuild homes impacted by the California wildfires.
    


            “Mr. President, your great secretary of state was looking for another job,” Zeldin said, before the room erupted with laughter.
    


            Byron, who is performing the functions of archivist, was picked by Trump to serve as the senior adviser to the archivist in February, with the president saying that he would “manage the National Archives on a day-to-day basis, while we continue our search for a full-time Archivist.” Byron is the president and CEO of the Richard Nixon Foundation.

            In a speech at the World Economic Forum last month, Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Union's executive body, repeatedly stressed the bloc's need for “independence.”
    


            She was speaking against a backdrop of threats by US President Donald Trump to either invade or extort the sale of Greenland – a sovereign territory of Denmark – and punish with tariffs several European countries opposing his plans. It was a watershed for a region that has traditionally opted for cautious diplomacy over confrontation with the White House.
    


            Trump's threats may have evaporated, but the feeling in Europe that it should become less dependent on the United States for its trade, its energy and its technology, has not. However, loosening those connections would be extremely difficult and come with enormous costs, analysts told CNN.
    


Trump's latest TACO moment puts his increasingly erratic temperament in the spotlight



            “You'd be trying to unravel and unpack several centuries of ever-deepening social, historical, institutional, economic, financial ties,” said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics.
    


            Still, Europe cannot afford complacency as it faces the prospect that Washington's volatile, winner-takes-all approach to its allies may outlast Trump – and that its dependencies on the United States could become its vulnerabilities.
    


            “I think there's a kind of fundamental element of distrust now, or concern about what might come (after Trump),” Shearing said.
    


            But the outsized role played by the United States in Europe's economy would make a hard split unrealistic and potentially ruinous for the region as it currently stands. Here's why.
    


            Deepening trade ties with other countries is an important way Europe could become less reliant on the United States. Already this year, the EU has inked trade agreements with India and four South American countries – a bloc referred to as Mercosur – after decades of negotiations.
    


            Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro research at ING, said the deals appear to be a step toward decoupling from Washington but that “neither Mercosur nor India will be able in the next decade to take over the role… that the US holds in European trade.”
    


            According to the EU Council, the EU and US have the largest bilateral trade and investment relationship in the world. The value of goods and services exchanged between them topped €1.68 trillion ($2 trillion) in 2024, representing almost 30% of the global total.
    


            The United States is also the biggest export market for EU goods, which include cars and pharmaceutical products, the Council said. Germany – the bloc's largest economy and a major exporter of autos – likewise counts the US as its top trading partner.
    


            Yet Europe needs the US far more that it is needed by Washington, said Brzeski. “Europe has always been export-oriented. Europe doesn't have enough (of its) own resources,” while the United States generally has a more “insulated, autonomous” economy, he added.
    


            Europe lacks the kind of mega tech companies that abound in the US, making it reliant on American firms for its digital services.
    


            “The internet in Europe is essentially a US construct, a US system. And Europe doesn't really have a competitor to any of that,” said Shearing at Capital Economics.
    


            The bloc's most valuable tech firm, Dutch chipmaker ASML, has a market capitalization roughly three times smaller than Tesla, the least valuable of the US's so-called Magnificent Seven – a group of tech giants whose performance has recently driven the US stock market.
    


            French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu said last week that government officials will ditch Zoom and other US-owned video conferencing tools and begin using French-owned software. The decision is intended partly to reduce “dependencies on non-European actors,” Lecornu wrote in a letter to ministers shared by a minister on X.
    


            Brzeski at ING said Europe would need to invest enormous sums to catch up with US providers of digital services, cloud infrastructure and data centers. “So, bluntly, (it needs) to have a kind of European version of (the Magnificent) Seven,” he said.
    


            Europe is still untangling itself from its long-held reliance on Russian oil and natural gas flows – a dependence that became a strategic weakness following Moscow's full-scale assault on Ukraine in 2022.
    


            The bloc ramped up imports of liquefied natural gas from the United States to plug the hole left by Russian supplies, leaving it less vulnerable to Moscow's weaponization of its energy. Russia was the EU's top supplier before the war, accounting for 40% of its gas demand.
    


            But Trump's habit of weaponizing US trade by imposing tariffs to extract concessions from allies has changed the risk calculus. The president has already used energy as leverage in trade negotiations with the EU, winning a commitment from Brussels last summer to buy $750 billion worth of US energy products.
    


            American LNG imports accounted for almost a quarter of the EU's gas demand last year, up from 6% in 2021, according to data from Wood Mackenzie.
    


            “It's obviously not a dependency similar to the one Europe had with Russia… but it's still a considerable dependence,” Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president of gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie, told CNN.
    


            Still, the share of American LNG in the European energy mix is expected to increase over the next few years as domestic gas production in Norway – currently the bloc's largest supplier – declines, according to Di Odoardo.
    


            But truly weaponizing US energy would require the participation of private US companies, he added. These firms are bound to long-term supply contracts with European buyers, with legal and financial interests to fulfill their terms.
    


            Unlike gas transported via pipelines, however, LNG from one supplier can be easily swapped with that from another. “It's a wise policy to diversify supply rather than being reliant on any single supplier… (it) is what every sensible government should be doing,” said Di Odoardo.

Live Updates


• Trump remarks: During a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, President Donald Trump said Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard went to Fulton County, Georgia, to probe alleged ballot irregularities at Attorney General Pam Bondi's “insistence.” He also attacked Democrats over their opposition to voter ID laws.
    


• Funding fight: Senate Republican leader John Thune said that lawmakers aren't “anywhere close” on a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security, as Democrats have demanded a list of reforms for ICE.
    


• Ukraine talks: The US is reestablishing high-level military communication with Russia after it was suspended in 2021, following the second day of trilateral talks among Ukraine, Russia and the US.
    


• Immigration crackdown: Trump's border czar Tom Homan said DHS will immediately withdraw 700 personnel from Minnesota, leaving about 2,000 officers on the ground. Trump said the fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis “should not have happened.”



            America's affordability challenges and the next leader of the Federal Reserve were a sticking point in a heated exchange between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
    

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) pressed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about rising US grocery prices after President Trump continues to falsely say that grocery prices are falling.


            In today's congressional hearing, Warren referred to recent comments from President Donald Trump where he referred to affordability as a “hoax.” Bessent pushed back against Warren, saying, “It may be a bit nuanced for you, but what President Trump is referring to is the media saying that the affordability crisis was generated by this administration, when it was you and President Biden.”
    


            Warren then pressed Bessent over whether grocery prices dropped last year. He said that “numerous grocery prices have gone down.”
    


                    “Under Donald Trump, families are paying more and more for groceries,” Warren said. “So, if you're just going to insult people by denying the facts that are out there and tell people they're doing great when they're struggling, I think that's just another way to say you don't have a plan to bring down these prices.”
                





The numbers: While two dozen grocery items did see lower prices in 2025, including eggs and potatoes, the vast majority (80%) of the grocery items monitored by the government's Consumer Price Index continued to rise, with overall inflation at 2.7% for the year.
    


            Talks intended to end the Ukraine war concluded Thursday in an agreement to reopen a military communication channel between the US and Russia, President Donald Trump's top foreign envoy said, though so far no resolution to the conflict appears at hand.
    


            Steve Witkoff, who led the US delegation in the two-day trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi, said the discussions were “constructive and focused on how to create the conditions for a durable peace.”
    


            “The delegations had wide-ranging discussions on the remaining open issues including methods to implement a ceasefire and monitor the cessation of military activities,” he wrote in a statement on social media.
    


            The re-establishment of high-level military dialogue between the US and Russia could point to normalizing relations between the two countries. Washington and Moscow cut off military-to-military communication in the days ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago.
    


            “This channel of communication was suspended prior to the onset of this conflict and is crucial to achieving and maintaining peace,” Witkoff said, adding it would be led on the US side by General Alexus Grynkewich, commander of US European Command.
    


            He also noted a prisoner exchange agreed to by both sides, the first in several months.
    


            “The delegations agreed to report back to their respective capitals and to continue trilateral discussions in the coming weeks,” he wrote.
    


            We're staying across the latest news on the Trump administration as congressional leaders race against the clock to reach a deal funding the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune said today that lawmakers aren't “anywhere close” on a deal and has criticized Democrats' proposal for Immigration and Customs Enforcement reforms. Still, Thune says there is room for negotiation.
    


            Meanwhile, President Donald Trump praised his spy chief Tulsi Gabbard today for her role in investigating what he claimed was “international cheating” in US elections. Gabbard has faced questions over her involvement in the controversial search of a Georgia elections office.
    


If you're joining us, here's a roundup of today's other top headlines: 



CNN's Tami Luhby, Alejandra Jaramillo, Kaanita Iyer, Holmes Lybrand, Veronica Stracqualursi, Alicia Wallace, Sana Noor Haq, Victoria Butenko, Anna Chernova, Svitlana Vlasova and Lauren Kent contributed to this report.



            GOP Sen. Josh Hawley accused Democrats of not negotiating in good faith as a deadline to avert a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, which includes crucial disaster relief and airport security agencies, rapidly approaches.
    


            “They haven't even reached out to begin negotiations,” Hawley told CNN on Thursday as Sen. Katie Britt, a Republican appropriator leading talks, says she has yet to make contact with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democratic leaders.
    


            “What the Democrats want is they want to get rid of ICE. They can't do that. They don't have the votes for that. They want to defund it. They don't have the votes to do that. So what they want to do now is essentially tie ICE up and also CBP, so they can't really work,” Hawley said, adding, “That's good for nobody, except for criminals. And I am not going to help them do that.”
    


            The Missouri Republican urged lawmakers to pass the bipartisan appropriations bill that had already been negotiated by Congress, which would fund agencies like the TSA, FEMA and Coast Guard through the fiscal year.
    


            “We spent months negotiating this bill with the Democrats. So if they are serious, they'll pass this bill that they negotiated,” he continued.
    


Sen. Katie Britt, the lead GOP negotiator in the Senate on reforms to the Department of Homeland Security, blasted Democrats today for being “insincere,” saying she has yet to have a serious conversation with her Democratic counterparts a week before the deadline for a funding deal.
    


            “They've put out tweets, they held press conferences, but yet we heard nothing,” Britt told CNN. “So last night, after our attempts to have that conversation, we then, yet again, see a list of demands grow from three to 10 without any communication.”
    


            She added: “That is not the way good faith negotiations begin or end.”
    


Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican who has been central to major bipartisan negotiations like gun reform, said he does not believe this negotiation will end with DHS reforms, and instead will result in a one-year continuing resolution for the agency.
    


            Cornyn said Democrats are holding funding “hostage” over “what I would consider ridiculous demands on the administration.”
    


            “It's a non-serious demand,” Cornyn said of the Democrats' list from last night. “This is really more of a political stunt. It is not about funding ICE, it is about the midterm elections and their attempt to try and capitalize on the public's concerns about the some of the actions in Minnesota.”
    


            Cornyn said a hold out of DHS funding will have a more significant impact on TSA, FEMA and the Coast Guard than it will Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection, given that President Donald Trump's signature law from last year injected ICE and CBP with plenty of cash to fund their actions for the next fiscal year — even if Congress doesn't give them a penny more.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune blasted a Democratic list of proposed changes to Immigration and Customs Enforcement practices, saying, “There's a bunch of stuff in there that's a non-starter and they know it.”
    


            But he also signaled there are a few items that he thinks there is “room to negotiate on” and “deal space.”
    


            On the demand ICE agents not wear masks, he said that “all that does is set them up to get doxxed. There's just a bunch of stuff in there that's a non-starter and they know it. Now maybe they had to put it in there to satisfy Moveon.org or some of their special, you know, left wing special interest groups.”
    


            “There are a few things that actually there's probably some room to negotiate on. But a lot of that stuff, obviously just wasn't serious,” he added.
    


                    “It seems like they are posturing themselves in such a way that, you know, would make any sort of a middle ground virtually impossible to find, at least right now,” Thune said. “There's some room in there, you know, to negotiate. I think there's some things that could get done, but, you know, you have to have people at the table to do that. And as of right now, there's only one side of the table that's filled.”
                





            Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama is Thune's point person for the talks, but Thune said she's “reached out multiple times now to Sen. Schumer or whomever he wants to negotiate on his behalf. And it's been crickets.”
    


            Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the DHS appropriations subcommittee, which Britt chairs, said Wednesday afternoon he had not heard from Republicans to begin talks and said it's incumbent on them to reach out since they are in the majority
    


            Britt was spotted by CNN going into the Senate minority leader's office suite Wednesday, but it wasn't clear if she spoke to anyone.
    


            Thune added that it's “pretty clearly” Congress will need to pass another short-term government funding bill due to the nearing deadline and he'd probably file a bill Monday.
    


            If DHS shuts down, he will cancel a recess planned the week after next. A lot of senators in both parties are planning to attend the Munich Security Conference.
    


            “If we're we get to the end of next week and we're shutdown posture, I think that the idea of people going on trips, no matter how justified or well-intended they are, seems like they ought to be a non-starter,” he said.
    


            Senate Republican leader John Thune on Thursday said that lawmakers aren't “anywhere close” on a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security, with a short timeframe for negotiations before funding expires next Friday.
    


            “As of right now, we aren't anywhere close to having any sort of agreement that would enable us to fund the Department of Homeland Security, and so Mr. President, I would hope that the Democrats will come to the table,” he said on the Senate floor.
    


            Democrats are demanding several reforms to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, some of which Republicans have already rejected – like unmasking federal agents and requiring judicial warrants – a sign that the two sides are far apart on the issue.
    


            Thune said Senate GOP negotiators had reached out to Democrats yesterday for talks with them and the White House.
    


            “But that is not right now, even in the realm of possibility, Mr. President, because they're not engaging. We've got a now one week and one day timeframe in which to do this, which is entirely unrealistic,” Thune said on the Senate floor.
    


            Thune also insisted that “this is not a blank check situation where Republicans just agree to a list of Democrat demands.” He called for a “serious discussion” about the “climate of harassment” federal immigration officials have faced and to address the “issue of cooperation between local and federal law enforcement”
    


            “If, for some reason, the Department of Homeland Security ends up in a shutdown. It is going to be totally on them. They will own it,” he said.
    


            In its latest effort to weaken the federal workforce, the Trump administration issued a rule today that would shift an estimated 50,000 senior career staffers into a new category that would make them easier to fire.
    


            The controversial rule allows agencies to reclassify federal employees involved in policy into at-will positions that don't provide the same job protections that other career workers have. It will affect an estimated 2% of the federal workforce.
    


            The Trump administration made it clear in the rule why it created the new category, called Schedule Policy/Career.
    


                    “Agency supervisors report great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct,” it said. The new category “will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.”
                





            The rule stems from an executive order President Donald Trump signed his first day in office last year. It revives a similar executive order that Trump signed shortly before the 2020 election that created a category for federal employees involved in policy, known as Schedule F. Former President Joe Biden quickly reversed that earlier order and finalized a new rule in 2024 that further bolstered protections for career federal workers.
    


Reaction: The new rule, which rescinds the 2024 rule, quickly drew promises of a lawsuit from a coalition of more than 30 unions, advocacy groups and others, which had already sued over the 2025 executive order.
    


            The measure “allows the government to bypass existing civil service laws, strips employees of earned protections, and opens the door to politically motivated firings and hirings, which have already occurred since President Trump took office,” Democracy Forward, which is representing the organizations, said in a statement.
    


            The Wall Street Journal first reported on the rule being issued.
    


            President Donald Trump on Thursday said his Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard recently went to Fulton County, Georgia, to probe alleged ballot irregularities at Attorney General Pam Bondi's “insistence.”
    


            The president's public praise for his spy chief for her role in investigating “international cheating” into US elections comes as she has faced questions over her involvement in the controversial elections office search.
    


                    “We have our director of national and international intelligence,” Trump said at the morning's National Prayer Breakfast, adding: “She took a lot of heat because she went at Pam's insistence. She went in and she looked at votes, that want to be checked out, from Georgia.”
                





            Trump said the review was carried out at Bondi's direction, recounting how members of the media questioned the move.
    


                    “The media asked, ‘Why is she doing it? Right, Pam?'” Trump said, answering his own question: “Because Pam wanted her to do it, and you know why, because she's smart.”
                





            The president went on to praise both officials for their work.
    


            “She's done a fantastic job and Pam has done a fantastic job and we appreciate, both,” Trump said.
    


            The president's comments come after his director of national intelligence received intense criticism after she was present during the FBI search of the elections office in Georgia last week.
    


            Trump's remarks also come a day after he said “I don't know” when asked why Gabbard joined the FBI agents there.
    


Here's what a GOP congressman told CNN's John Berman earlier when asked about Gabbard: 



            President Donald Trump is launching a new direct-to-consumer prescription drug platform Thursday evening, advancing an initiative central to his efforts to alleviate Americans' affordability concerns.
    


            The website, dubbed TrumpRx, will allow cash-paying patients to directly purchase from drugmakers certain medicines at discounted prices negotiated by the Trump administration.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt touted the 7 p.m. announcement on X, saying the president will be joined by Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and National Design Studio director Joe Gebbia.
    


            Trump has touted the drug pricing push as a major step toward lowering Americans' health costs, securing deals with at least 16 pharmaceutical companies to list certain products on the TrumpRx portal.
    


            But the announcements did not provide many details on the drugs that would be available or their pricing. And it remains to be seen whether direct-to-consumer purchases will result in lower drug costs for patients willing to forgo insurance and pay cash.
    


            It could make certain medicines — particularly obesity medications that are not widely covered by job-based policies — more affordable, experts say. But many consumers could ultimately pay less if they go through their insurance.
    


            While welcoming foreign leaders at the National Prayer Breakfast, President Donald Trump singled out El Salvador President Nayib Bukele for being a “great ally,” calling him “one of my favorite people.”
    


            Trump added: “He has been so incredible. He has been such a great ally of this country.”
    


            Bukele spoke earlier at the prayer breakfast.
    


For context: The Trump administration has sent hundreds of deported migrants to El Salvador, including dozens to the country's notorious mega-prison, the Center for Terrorism Confinement, known as Cecot.
    


            Trump addressed El Salvador's prisons during his remarks, saying that Bukele “operates rather large prisons … and they do a very humane job but they're very strong prisons.”
    


            Former Cecot detainees told CNN that for months at the mega-prison, they were beaten by prison guards, shot with pellets, deprived of adequate medical care and denied any due process.

            After opening his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast by musing about making it to heaven, President Donald Trump shifted his focus to a more earthly preoccupation: his narrow House majority.
    


            Trump railed against Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie for his constant opposition to key pieces of legislation, calling the Republican lawmaker a “moron” and complaining that he'd vote against almost any bill put on the House floor.
    


            “He's an automatic ‘no' no matter what,” he said. “This guy named Thomas Massie, there's something wrong with him.”
    


            Trump also mocked Massie's chances of reelection in a race where the president has vowed to boost his primary opponent.
    


            The renewed attacks on Massie came as Trump credited Speaker Mike Johnson for navigating the GOP's slim majority in the House to pass major elements of his agenda.
    


            Trump also attacked Democrats in the early moments of his speech over their opposition to imposing strict nationwide voter ID laws, while questioning “how a person of faith can vote for a Democrat.”
    


            The president later repeated his false claims that he won the popular vote in 2016 and that his subsequent 2020 election loss to former President Joe Biden was “rigged.”
    


                    “I had to win it, needed it for my own ego,” Trump said of his failed 2020 bid, noting he finally triumphed four years later. “Now I really have a big ego though. Beating these lunatics was incredible, what a great feeling.”
                





            President Donald Trump said today he believes he will likely make it to heaven as he spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast.
    


            “I really think I probably should make it,” Trump said of his chances of entering heaven. “I mean, I'm not a perfect candidate but I did a hell of a lot of good for perfect people.”
    


            The president addressed past comments that had sparked headlines and scrutiny, saying earlier remarks suggesting he was not “heaven-bound” were made in jest.
    


            Trump said he often chooses to be “sarcastic with the media,” arguing that “they write your words,” and mocking coverage that followed his earlier comments, adding he was “just having fun.”
    


            The president's remarks come after he told reporters aboard Air Force One in October of last year, “I don't think there's anything going to get me in heaven,” while traveling to Israel.
    


            President Donald Trump is now delivering remarks at the annual National Prayer Breakfast.
    


            A number of House and Senate lawmakers are also in attendance at the event, which is being held at the Washington Hilton Hotel.
    


            The celebration, first held in 1953, used to include the breakfast, along with a separate congressional event. This year, however, it is taking place as a single gathering to continue “a tradition of fellowship and unified prayer,” according to the White House.
    


            The US said it agreed to resume high-level inter-military communication with Russia nearly five years after communication was suspended.
    


            “Maintaining dialogue between militaries is an important factor in global stability and peace, which can only be achieved through strength, and provides a means for increased transparency and de-escalation,” US European Command said in a statement. “This channel will provide a consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace.”
    


            Communication between the two militaries was suspended in 2021, a few months before the Russia-Ukraine war began, according to the release.
    


            The agreement comes following the first known trilateral talks between the US, Ukraine and Russia since the war began. They took place in Abu Dhabi last month.
    


            President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner represented the US in the talks.
    


            According to the release, the US European Command commander also met with “senior Russian and Ukrainian military officials.”

            The DC National Guard deployed by President Donald Trump in the capital as part of his federal surge is on track to spend more than Washington's police force on an annual basis, according to a new report from Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee.
    


            The Guard mission is due to cost $602 million on an annual basis, the report found, compared to $599 million for the 2026 Metropolitan Police Department budget.
    


            The report also details what National Guard members have done in the city and warns that the deployment “blurs the distinction between the military and civilian law enforcement.”
    


            Local officials, including DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, have long complained that MPD's budget is too small and that the department has lacked the necessary funding to increase the number of officers on the force, which is currently hundreds short of its target size.
    


            Trump and his administration have touted the significant decline in murder rates in the city, which dropped 32% in 2025 compared to 2024, which saw a matching 32% decline from the year before.
    


            The report says that National Guard representatives told Senate staff that the Guard is “a lousy tool for fixing gun crime,” one of the big issues facing the district, and that the National Guard is not deployed in Southeast DC, which suffers from the highest rates of violent crime in the district.
    


            According to the report, the National Guard has kept some numbers on this effort in DC — including 44 uses of Narcan, preventing a stabbing and helping to deliver a baby. Guard members have also packed “6,030 pounds of food, painted 270 feet of fence, and pruned 65 trees.”
    


            Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clashed over the Trump administration's policies impacting affordability and the economy during testimony in front of the House Financial Services Committee on Capitol Hill yesterday.

            The second day of trilateral talks among Ukraine, Russia and the US have ended in the Emirati capital of Abu Dhabi, the Ukrainian negotiation team told CNN.
    


            Ukraine and Russia have each returned 157 prisoners of war to the other side, according to Russian state news agency TASS and US envoy Steve Witkoff.
    


            This marks the first such exchange in four months, as the last time Russia and Ukraine swapped prisoners was in October 2025.
    


            Russia's state-owned military TV channel Zvezda said that in addition to the released combatants, three Russian citizens who are residents of the Kursk region were also returned home. It added that the United Arab Emirates and United States provided mediation for the swap, and the returned Russian military personnel are currently in Belarus.
    


                    “This outcome was achieved from peace talks that have been detailed and productive. While significant work remains, steps like this demonstrate that sustained diplomatic engagement is delivering tangible results and advancing efforts to end the war in Ukraine,” US special envoy Witkoff said in a post on X.
                





            Ukrainian presidential chief of staff Kyrylo Budanov, in a comment to a Ukrainian news agency, said “negotiations were truly constructive.”
    


            “I am grateful to the US and the UAE for their high-quality organization and mediation,” Budanov, who was part of the Ukrainian negotiation team at the talks in Abu Dhabi, told RBC-Ukraine.

            House and Senate Democratic leaders yesterday said Republicans shouldn't expect them to back a full-year spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security if “dramatic changes” aren't made to ICE, drawing a firm line as funding for the agency is set to expire next Friday.
    


                    “We're ready to sit down and negotiate … But it's got to be strong. It's got to be tough. It's got rein in ICE in very serious ways and end the violence,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said at a news conference alongside House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.
                





            Schumer said that Democrats hope to have legislation “within the next 24 hours” outlining their proposals.
    


            Already, House Speaker Mike Johnson has rejected two key Democratic demands: banning agents from wearing face masks and requiring judicial search warrants for immigration enforcement operations.
    


            The two Democratic leaders listed a series of reforms the party is demanding for DHS before they'd support a full-year appropriations bill:
    


            Schumer and Jeffries later sent a detailed list of 10 demands to GOP leaders.
    


            The list also includes putting “a reasonable use of force policy” into law, requiring DHS to prohibit its officers from conducting stops based on racial profiling, as well as preserving the ability of state and local governments to investigate and prosecute potential crimes. Large-scale operations outside of targeted immigration enforcement would also require the consent of states and localities.
    


            Jeffries and Schumer are also calling on the Trump administration to “fully” wind down the surge in Minnesota and remove DHS Secretary Kristi Noem from her post.

Bill Gates has apologized for his ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, saying he was “foolish” to spend time with him.

In an interview with 9 News Australia released on Wednesday, the billionaire Microsoft co-founder denied allegations raised in newly unsealed US Department of Justice records concerning his dealings with Epstein.

The DOJ published the final tranche of documents related to Epstein, including his personal emails, last week. Some alleged that Gates had extramarital “sex with Russian girls” arranged via Epstein's trafficking network and sought medication to treat a sexually transmitted infection afterward.

Some documents suggest Gates may have leveraged Epstein's network for health-related influence, with DOJ files citing meetings in which healthcare issues were discussed.

In the interview, Gates insisted he only had “a number of dinners” with Epstein focused on fundraising for global health initiatives linked to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

“The focus was always – he knew a lot of very rich people and he was saying he could get them to give money to global health,” Gates said, claiming the talks led to nothing. “In retrospect, that was a dead end… I was foolish to spend time with him.”

Gates denied visiting Epstein's private island or having any connections with women through Epstein's network.

“It had nothing to do with that kind of behavior,” he said, dismissing the STD-related allegations as false. “Every minute I spent with him, I regret and I apologize that I did that.”

Gates did not say what healthcare-related issues he discussed with Epstein.

Melinda Gates, who divorced Bill Gates in 2021, told NPR this week that the latest document release caused “unbelievable sadness,” particularly for the young girls abused by Epstein. She previously said her former husband's association with Epstein was among the factors that led to divorce.

Gates was not the only high-profile figure named in the latest release of Epstein-related documents, which also reference US President Donald Trump, former US President Bill Clinton, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, among others. All have denied having deep ties to Epstein.

Clinton, who has acknowledged flying on Epstein's private jet in the early 2000s but denied wrongdoing, agreed this week to testify before the House Oversight Committee alongside his wife, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as part of its investigation into Epstein.

Poland's attempt to change the narrative on the Jeffrey Epstein scandal by announcing a planned probe into the alleged Moscow links of the late convicted sex offender will not succeed, Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, has said.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a government meeting on Tuesday that “more and more leads, more and more information, and more and more commentary in the global press all relate to the suspicion that this unprecedented pedophilia scandal was co-organized by Russian intelligence services.” Warsaw must investigate allegations of Epstein working for Moscow because they are “serious… for the security of the Polish state” and could mean that Russia possesses “compromising materials against many leaders still active today,” he claimed.

In a post on X on Wednesday, Dmitriev rejected Tusk's accusations, arguing that through them “the exposed liberal cabal is desperately trying to change the narrative.” 

“But people have awakened, see through the lies & fake news to the Truth: the Satanic Liberal West, hidden decision-making and influence networks, double standards, dirty media tricks have all been exposed,” he wrote.

The envoy also attached to his post a screenshot from an Epstein email from 2014, in which he told Ariane de Rothschild, the head of the Swiss private banking firm Edmond de Rothschild Group, that the “ukraine upheaval should provide many opportunites , many [sic].” The exchange happened a few months after a violent Western-backed coup in Kiev in which democratically elected President Viktor Yanukovich was deposed.

In a later message, Dmitriev joked that Moscow should launch its own “investigation into whether Polish PM Tusk is actually a secret brother or son of Epstein” as, according to the envoy, the two have a lot of similarities in their looks.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that he couldn't seriously comment on claims of Epstein's alleged ties with Russia. “One would want to make a lot jokes about such suggestions, but let's not waste our time,” he told journalists.

Last week, the US Department of Justice released the final batch of over 3 million pages, 2,000 videos, and 180,000 images related to Epstein, who died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. They revealed that the disgraced financier maintained ties with prominent figures in politics, finance, academia and business, including former US President Bill Clinton and billionaires Bill Gates and Elon Musk, before and after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to prostitution charges.

In first-of-its-kind complaint, state accused four fossil fuel majors and US oil lobbying group of climate disinformation

Amid rising concern about global heating and soaring energy costs, Michigan has sued big oil for allegedly fueling both crises – a move experts have hailed as groundbreaking.

In a first-of-its-kind complaint, the state's attorney general, Dana Nessel, accused four fossil fuel majors and the top US oil lobbying group last month of acting as a “cartel” to stifle the growth of renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs), while suppressing information about the dangers of the climate crisis. The conduct, the lawsuit alleged, violates federal and state antitrust laws.

The companies' “collusion” drove up Michigan utility costs and slowed the transition away from gas-powered cars, according to the filing. Absent the industry's efforts to repress clean technology, EVs “would be a common sight in every neighborhood – rolling off assembly lines in Flint, parked in driveways in Dearborn, charging outside grocery stores in Grand Rapids, and running quietly down Woodward Avenue”, it said.

Electricity costs in Michigan have surged, with average residential rates increasing by nearly 120% in the last two decades. And though electric car adoption is increasing, EVs and hybrids accounted for less than 4% of total registered vehicles statewide last year.

“Michigan is facing an energy affordability crisis as our home energy costs skyrocket and consumers are left without affordable options for transportation,” Nessel said in a statement. “These out-of-control costs are not the result of natural economic inflation, but due to the greed of these corporations who prioritized their own profit and marketplace dominance over competition and consumer savings.”

Michigan's case specifically targets BP, Shell, Chevron and Exxon Mobil, as well as the largest US oil lobby group, the American Petroleum Institute (API).

“This is yet another legally incoherent effort to regulate by lawsuit,” an ExxonMobil spokesperson said. “It won't reduce emissions, it won't help consumers and it won't stand up to the law.”

Ryan Meyers, general counsel for the API, said: “These baseless lawsuits are a coordinated campaign against an industry that powers everyday life, drives America's economy and is actively reducing emissions. We continue to believe that energy policy belongs in Congress, not a patchwork of courtrooms.”

BP declined to comment on the pending litigation. The Guardian has contacted all defendants for comment.

The oil industry has long attempted to have lawsuits voided by saying they are pre-empted by policies, but plaintiffs say climate accountability lawsuits focus on business practices and the distribution of misleading information, not emissions regulations.

The 126-page lawsuit was brought by Nessel's office alongside Sher Edling – a California-based law firm which is representing a slew of municipalities in climate accountability litigation – and two other firms, DiCello Levitt and Hausfeld, which have also handled climate complaints and are based in Chicago and Washington DC, respectively.

The new challenge accuses the defendants of engaging in a vast “conspiracy”, starting almost 50 years ago when a 1979 Exxon internal report predicted the world would see catastrophic global heating without a massive shift to renewable energy.

“Rather than compete as leading producers of renewable energy products, the defendants and their co-conspirators conspired to suppress their own output of renewable energy, and restrain output by others,” the lawsuit said.

To do so, the firms used an array of tactics, including employing patent lawsuits to stop their competitors, hiding information about fossil fuels' dangers and the viability of renewables, using trade associations to coordinate “market-wide efforts” to skew investments toward oil and gas, and even hiring hackers to “surveil, intimidate and disrupt” journalists and activists, it claimed.

“Michigan's groundbreaking case reveals how the big oil cartel conspired to deny Americans cleaner and cheaper energy choices and make life less affordable by keeping consumers hooked on their dirty fossil fuel products,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, a non-profit which tracks and supports climate litigation.

With the challenge, Michigan joins 10 other states and about 60 subnational governments that have sued big oil for alleged climate deception in recent years. Together, the cases represent jurisdictions that are home to more than a quarter of the US population.

Nessel first announced plans to launch climate accountability litigation in 2024, stating concerns with the cost of climate damages in her state. The 23 January filing came despite attempts to thwart climate accountability litigation from the Trump administration. Last year, the Department of Justice took the unusual step of suing Michigan and Hawaii over the states' plans to file such cases; despite the attack, Hawaii filed its lawsuit the following day.

In a blow to the Trump administration, one day after Michigan filed its lawsuit, a federal judge tossed out the justice department's filing against the state.

But the oil industry and its allies are continuing their attempts to kill off climate accountability lawsuits. The fossil fuel industry is lobbying Congress to obtain immunity from climate-focused litigation and policies, and last month the API listed defeating climate accountability lawsuits as a top priority for 2026.

The sector and its allies have also been pushing the supreme court to weigh in on the legitimacy of climate lawsuits. Soon, the high court is expected to decide if it will hear arguments over a petition by Exxon Mobil and energy giant Suncor seeking to end a lawsuit brought by the city and county of Boulder, Colorado.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Office of Personnel Management says reclassification will allow agencies to quickly remove employees who ‘obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives'

The Trump administration moved Thursday to issue a rule that would make it easier to fire tens of thousands of federal workers. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said it was reclassifying certain career civil service roles so agencies can “quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives”.

Traditionally, only political appointees – roughly 4,000 positions – can be dismissed “at will”.

Under the new rule, many nonpartisan roles would be shifted into a category called “Schedule Policy/Career,” effectively treating them as political appointees. That reclassification could allow the administration to remove employees it views as disloyal. The rule – set to be published in the Federal Register on Friday – also states that “personal or political loyalty tests as a condition of employment” are prohibited.

Critics argue the change would open the door to politically motivated purges. “We have successfully fought this kind of power grab before, and we will fight this again. We will return to court to stop this unlawful rule and will use every legal tool available to hold this administration accountable to the people,” said Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward.

The largest union representing federal workers called the rule “a direct assault on a professional, nonpartisan, merit-based civil service.” In a statement, American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) president Everett Kelley said OPM is “rebranding career public servants as ‘policy' employees, silencing whistleblowers, and replacing competent professionals with political flunkies without any neutral, independent protections against politicization and arbitrary abuse of power.”

Trump briefly enacted a similar change at the end of his first term through an executive order known as “Schedule F,” which Joe Biden rescinded upon taking office in 2021. Stripping civil service protections has also been a central plank of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 blueprint.

In a statement Thursday, anticipating the rule's release, OPM director Scott Kupor said the reclassification would bring “much-needed accountability to career policy-influencing positions in the Federal government.”

Donald Trump has said that Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi had his “total endorsement” ahead of a legislative election in Japan on Sunday, adding that they would meet on 19 March at the White House.

“Prime Minister Takaichi is someone who deserves powerful recognition for the job she and her Coalition are doing,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

“Therefore, as President of the United States of America, it is my Honor to give a Complete and Total Endorsement of her, and what her highly respected Coalition is representing.”

Takaichi is widely expected to win in the snap election this Sunday.

On the morning of 21 January, Israeli authorities left eight Palestinian men at a West Bank checkpoint. Disoriented and cold, they were dressed in prison-issued tracksuits and carried their few belongings in plastic bags.

Hours earlier, they had been sitting with their wrists and ankles shackled on the plush leather seats of a private jet owned by the Florida property tycoon Gil Dezer, a longtime business partner of Donald Trump.

Dezer is also a Trump donor, friend of Donald Trump Jr and member of the Miami branch of Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.

His sleek Gulfstream jet – which he has called “my little rocket ship” – was used to transport the men from an airport near a notorious removal centre in Arizona to Tel Aviv. The jet made three refuelling stops en route: in New Jersey, Ireland and Bulgaria.

A Guardian investigation has established the flight was part of a secretive and politically sensitive US government operation to deport Palestinians arrested by ICE to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

One of those deported on the January flight was Maher Awad, a 24-year-old originally from the West Bank, who had lived in the US for nearly a decade. Speaking to the Guardian in the town of Rammun, Maher shared photos of his girlfriend and newborn son in Michigan.

“They dropped us off like animals on the side of the road,” Awad said. “We went to a local house, we knocked on the door, we were like: ‘Please help us out.'”

US job openings dropped to the lowest level in more than five years in December and data for the prior month was revised lower amid a softening in labor market conditions at the end of 2025.

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, decreased by 386,000 to 6.542m by the last day of December, the lowest level since September 2020, the labor department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, today.

Data for November was revised down to show 6.928m job openings instead of the previously reported 7.146m. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 7.20m unfilled jobs. Hiring increased by 172,000 positions to a still-low 5.293m in December.

The data came as other numbers showed a larger-than-expected increase in Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a stable labor market.

Here's the full story:

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has said that further US sanctions against Russia depend on talks aimed at ending its nearly four-year-old war in Ukraine, Reuters reports.

Bessent, who participated in talks with Russian officials and Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in Miami on 31 January, said he would consider sanctions against Russia's shadow fleet.

“We will see where the peace talks go,” Bessent said, noting that the Trump administration's sanctions against Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil had helped bring Russia to the negotiating table in the peace talks.

The largest union representing federal workers called the rule “a direct assault on a professional, nonpartisan, merit-based civil service.” In a statement, American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) president Everett Kelley said OPM is “rebranding career public servants as ‘policy' employees, silencing whistleblowers, and replacing competent professionals with political flunkies without any neutral, independent protections against politicization and arbitrary abuse of power.”

Trump briefly enacted a similar change at the end of his first term through an executive order known as “Schedule F,” which Joe Biden rescinded upon taking office in 2021. Stripping civil service protections has also been a central plank of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 blueprint.

In a statement Thursday, anticipating the rule's release, OPM director Scott Kupor said the reclassification would bring “much-needed accountability to career policy-influencing positions in the Federal government.”

At least two cases of measles have been confirmed at a major immigration detention center for children and their parents in Texas as cases of the dangerous virus in South Carolina, Arizona, Utah and other US states continue growing and alarming experts.

In January alone, the US saw 25% of the total confirmed in all of last year, and the outbreak shows no sign of slowing as federal officials stay silent on vaccination.

The vast majority of patients are not vaccinated, but there have been no national campaigns announced or recent statements from leaders such as Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Last year, Kennedy positioned measles vaccines as a personal choice and recommended unproven treatments for the highly contagious illness.

The measles outbreak is “frightening” and “very worrisome”, said Jason Bowling, professor of infectious diseases at UT Health San Antonio and director of hospital epidemiology at University Health.

“I unfortunately do not see this slowing down across the United States,” said Anna-Kathryn Burch, division director of pediatric infectious diseases at Prisma Health Children's hospital in the Midlands in South Carolina. What's happening in South Carolina could happen anywhere the vaccination rate dips too low, Burch said. “It's not a matter of if, but more likely when.”

The Dilley family detention center in south Texas, one of two immigration facilities for children in the US, reported two measles cases on Friday. “We are aware of the cases and are assisting by providing doses of measles vaccine as requested by ICE,” said Chris Van Deusen, director of media relations at the Texas department of state health services, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Amid the various winding comments throughout Trump's speech today, he said that the Department of Education will officially issue its new guidance to protect the right to prayer in public schools today.

“Now the Democrats will sue us, but we'll win it,” Trump said, eliciting some laughs from the audience at the National Prayer Breakfast. “They'll sue us. They sue us for everything. I'm the most sued human being in history.”

The president is now rattling off a number of states who, he says, have cooperated with federal law enforcement. But has now launched into a tirade on Minnesota.

“They won't work with us,” Trump said, while claiming that he would be able to drive crime down further without the “horrible governor and this horrible fake mayor Frey”.

Trump announced there will be a national prayer event on the National Mall on 17 May. “We're going to rededicate America as one nation under God,” Trump added.

During his speech today, Trump praised Tulsi Gabbard – the director of national intelligence – for her role in the FBI's search of the Fulton county election offices in Georgia last week. Here agents seized almost 700 boxes of 2020 election documentation.

“She took a lot of heat two days ago because she went in at Pam's insistence,” the president said. “They say, ‘why is she doing it'… because Pam [the attorney general] wanted her to do it. And you know why? Because she's smart.”

Earlier this week, the Guardian reported that Gabbard is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump's approval, working separately from the justice department investigation.

“Her position has to do with international,” Trump added today.

He went further:

They've been saying ‘Russia, Russia, Russia has been screwing our elections'. OK, so let's assume Russia had something to do with it. They said, ‘no, no, Russia didn't'… so now they're saying Russia had nothing to do with it. Because if I say Russia, that it's perfectly fine. But you could add China and about five other countries.

Trump's meandered during his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast today. He's denigrated Thomas Massie, the Republican congressman and his frequent target who co-sponsored legislation to release the full tranche of Epstein files, and voted against the most recent funding bill package that the president signed into law on Tuesday. “There's something wrong with him,” Trump said. “ They love voting ‘no'. They think it's good politically.”

The president also touted the military operation in Venezuela, which resulted in the capture of the now deposed leader Nicolás Maduro. “We're getting along fantastically with leadership,” Trump said of the interrim president Delcy Rodriguez.

One note, ahead of the president's address today, we heard from Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador, and a noted Trump ally.

Bukele has worked closely with the Trump administration to accept flights of undocumented immigrants, who they allege are convicted criminals, and hold them in El Salvador's mega-prison, known as CECOT.

Bukele has described himself as the “world's coolest dictator” and has overseen one of the largest crackdowns on crime in his country. Critics have branded him an authoritarian leader, that has done away with due process.

Today he called the gangs that he's worked to eliminate from El Salvador as “satanic”.

“Some of those gangs are here in the United States,” he added. “If God did this for El Salvador he can do this for countries all over the world.”

Donald Trump is in Washington today. As we noted earlier, we'll hear from the president shortly when he attends the National Prayer Breakfast.

Later today we'll also hear from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when she holds a 1pm ET briefing for reporters.

Mass layoffs at the Washington Post have prompted backlash from employees, who have been on “edge” for weeks over the future of the publication.

On Wednesday the publication announced it would be laying off one-third of its workforce, and would be scaling back coverage of sport and foreign news.

“This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world's greatest news organizations,” the Post's celebrated former editor-in-chief Marty Baron said in a statement.

The Guardian's Jeremy Barr reports that staffers at the Post have been worried for weeks about the rumoured cuts, which the publication would not confirm or deny. “It's an absolute bloodbath,” said one employee, not authorized to speak publicly.

During a morning meeting announcing the changes, the editor in chief, Matt Murray, told employees that the Post was undergoing a “strategic reset” to better position the publication for the future, according to several employees who were on the call.

Murray acknowledged that the Post had struggled to reach “customers” and talked about the need to compete in a crowded media marketplace. “Today, the Washington Post is taking a number of actions across the company to secure our future,” he said, according to an audio recording of the meeting.

The affected employees include Caroline O'Donovan, who primarily covers Amazon, the company founded by the Post owner, Jeff Bezos. Other staffers, including the sports journalist Neil Greenberg, have also announced that they were affected.

President Donald Trump is set to attend and deliver remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast later today, a spokesperson from the White House confirmed.

The event is held annually in Washington DC on the first Thursday of every February. It aims to bring together leaders in political, social and business sectors from around the country to an event that merges prayer and networking.

“Today, President Trump will unite our country through the power of prayer at the 74th National Prayer Breakfast,” a White House spokesperson said.

“President Trump has made unprecedented strides to protect our God-given rights and has delivered on his promise to reverse Joe Biden's divisive policies that weaponized the federal government against men and women of faith. President Trump has secured major victories for religious freedom – from defending innocent life to restoring biological truth and protecting parents' fundamental rights.”

Fox News reports that the president first attended the National Prayer Breakfast in 2017 and returned last year, using his remarks to pledge action against what he called anti-Christian bias tied to the Biden administration.

“While I'm in the White House, we will protect Christians in our schools, in our military, in our government, in our workplaces, hospitals and in our public squares, and we will bring our country back together as one nation under God, with liberty and justice for all,” he said during last year's event.

According to the outlet, other notable attenders set to appear at the 2026 event include house speaker Mike Johnson and attorney general Pam Bondi.

Donald Trump said the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis were both sad incidents that “should not have happened,” but nobody feels worse about both shootings than ICE agents.

“He was not an angel, and she was not an angel,” Trump said of Pretti and Good in a new interview with NBC News. “Still, I'm not happy with what happened there. Nobody can be happy, and ICE wasn't happy either.

“But I'm always going to be with our great people of law enforcement,” he continued. “We have to back them. If we don't back them, we don't have a country.”

This comes as the White House border czar, Tom Homan, says 700 federal agents will leave Minnesota. In the interview, Trump suggested using a “softer touch” in carrying out his aggressive immigration crackdown.

However, Chuck Schumer, the US Senate minority leader, said the reduction of 700 agents wasn't enough. “ICE's abuses go beyond the headlines. Residents are afraid to go to schools, to grocery stores, to even step outside. Agents are patrolling the streets like a military operation,” he said. “All of ICE needs to leave Minneapolis now.”

Owner of local cinema says Amazon is upset at way they marketed movie as some in US say healthy ticket sales are not reflected by empty seats

An independent cinema in Oregon has claimed Amazon pulled screenings of their documentary about Melania Trump in protest at the cinema's marketing strategy.

As reported by local newspaper the Lake Oswego Review, the general manager of the Lake Theater & Cafe has claimed the corporation cancelled future screenings of Brett Ratner's authorised study of the first lady after being alerted to promotional pushes such as: “To defeat your enemy. You must know them. Melania” and “Does Melania wear Prada? Find out on Friday!”

Writing on the cinema's Instagram, Jordan Perry said: “Got a call that the higher ups (ie, at Amazon) were upset with how our marquee marketed their movie (ie, Melania), that, per them, Sunday would be its last day here.”

Perry added that he hoped Amazon wouldn't cancel his Prime membership and directed devoted Amazon fans to “show your support at Whole Foods instead”. The cinema owner also addressed those who had criticised his decision to show the film in the first place.

In a post titled Why I, Jordan, Got Melania Here,” Perry wrote that his overriding instinct was that the programming “would be funny”. There was also a financial imperative, he added: “The film marketplace this week and next were a desert … So, to fill a screen, why not get this inexplicable vanity piece from the current president's wife? I mean, it just seems so weird that it even exists (who wants a movie about Melania lol?), and wouldn't it then be exponentially weirder, to the point of being funny, to show it here, at your obviously anti-establishment, occasionally troublemaking, neighbourhood cinema?”

Amazon's cancellation of the film in the Oregon cinema comes as some in the US have flagged the incongruity of healthy ticket sales and apparently empty cinemas.

The film took $7m (£5.1m) over its opening weekend domestically and opened at No 3 in the US box office charts. The Daily Beast reports that there have been accusations of “fake tickets sales” to boost the box office totals.

Citing the Substack of industry pundit Tom Brueggemann, the article claims: “Industry sources say there were signs that blocks of tickets were purchased for the weekend, then distributed to senior citizen homes, Republican activitists, other interested parties for free to help boost audiences.”

Meanwhile Puck reporter Matthew Belloni said Amazon and cinema chains AMC and Regal told him that they “did not experience unusual block purchases of tickets” for the film, while adding “the theatre chains might not necessarily know, of course”.

Exit reports from weekend screenings in the US suggested that “older white women” were the demographic most responsible for propelling it to success.

In the UK, where Melania opened across 155 screens, takings were considerably softer. The film opened at No 29 in the UK charts, for a weekend screen average of £212.

The US takings for the film currently account for some 98.8% of its overall total, with Melania's native Slovenia proving the best-performing international territory. Overall, the film opened in 26 countries globally last Friday, after the South African release was abruptly cancelled the day before, with local distributors citing “the current climate” and “recent developments”.

In the UK, some industry insiders questioned whether the unusually wide rollout of the film could be an indication of “four-walling”: the release strategy by which distributors pay cinemas to screen the movie.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The last remaining nuclear arms pact between Russia and the US expired yesterday, removing any caps on the two largest atomic arsenals for the first time in more than a half-century.

The termination of the New START Treaty could set the stage for what many fear could be an unconstrained nuclear arms race.

Russian President Vladimir Putin last year declared readiness to stick to the treaty's limits for another year if Washington follows suit, but US President Donald Trump has been noncommittal about extending it. He has indicated that he wants China to be a part of it — a push Beijing has rebuffed.

Putin discussed the pact's expiration with Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) on Wednesday, Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov said, adding that Washington has not responded to his proposed extension.

Russia “will act in a balanced and responsible manner based on thorough analysis of the security situation,” Ushakov said.

The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that “under the current circumstances, we assume that the parties to the New START Treaty are no longer bound by any obligations or symmetrical declarations within the context of the Treaty, including its core provisions, and are fundamentally free to choose their next steps.”

New START, signed in 2010 by then-US president Barack Obama and then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev restricted each side to no more than 1,550 nuclear warheads on no more than 700 missiles and bombers — deployed and ready for use. It was originally supposed to expire in 2021, but was extended for five more years.

The pact envisioned sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance, although they stopped in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and never resumed.

In February 2023, Putin suspended Moscow's participation, saying Russia could not allow US inspections of its nuclear sites at a time when Washington and its NATO allies have openly declared Moscow's defeat in Ukraine as their goal. At the same time, the Kremlin emphasized it was not withdrawing from the pact altogether, pledging to respect its caps on nuclear weapons.

The pact's expiration would be destabilizing and could fuel nuclear proliferation, Putin said.

New START followed a long succession of US-Russian nuclear arms reduction pacts. Those have been terminated, as well.

Trump has indicated he would like to keep limits on nuclear weapons, but wants to involve China in a potential new treaty.

“I actually feel strongly that if we're going to do it, I think China should be a member of the extension,” Trump said.

Beijing has balked at any restrictions on its smaller, but growing nuclear arsenal, while urging the US to resume nuclear talks with Russia.

“China's nuclear forces are not at all on the same scale as those of the US and Russia, and thus China will not participate in nuclear disarmament negotiations at the current stage,” Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lin Jian (林劍) said.

China regrets the expiration of the treaty, calls on the US to resume nuclear dialogue with Russia soon and positively views Moscow's suggestion that the two sides continue observing the core limits of the treaty for now, he said.

Italy are finally heading to the World Cup — just not in the sport most people might expect.

Amid dark times for the country's storied, but ailing soccer team, some salvation comes in the form of the Azzurri's unheralded cricketers after their first-ever qualification for a global tournament.

Add Italy to cricketing superpowers like India, Australia, England and South Africa competing at the T20 World Cup starting tomorrow.

“Just to be there and playing is the end of 45 years of hard work,” Italian Cricket Federation CEO Luca Bruno Malaspina said.

That is a reference to the formation of the sport's national federation in 1980, but cricket in Italy dates back much further than that — to the late 19th century when it was played by expatriated British textile workers.

Genoa, Italy's oldest soccer club founded in 1893, were — and still are — called Genoa Cricket and Football Club. The original name of AC Milan, the seven-time European champions, when they were founded in 1899 by an Englishman, Herbert Kilpin, was Milan Football and Cricket Club.

More than a century later, there might not be any grass cricket pitches in Italy, but there are about 4,000 registered men's players, about 80 clubs in a two-tier league system and a burgeoning national team filled with players who have Italian heritage or who are first or second-generation immigrants from Asia.

For example, captain Wayne Madsen is a South African who qualifies because of his Italian grandmother, while bowler Crishan Kalugamage is a Sri Lankan who moved to Italy when he was 15. Wicketkeeper Marcus Campopiano was born in England and has an Italian father.

The 15-man World Cup squad contains two sets of Australian brothers with Italian family connections: Harry and Benjamin Manenti, and Anthony and Justin Mosca.

“The quality and the numbers are going up,” said Bruno Malaspina, who also praised the largely overseas-born coaching and backroom staff for changing mindsets and raising expectations.

The head coach is former Canada cricketer John Davison, who was raised in Australia and played first-class cricket there before becoming a star for Canada's national team. Former Ireland batter Kevin O'Brien is an assistant coach.

Italy qualified for the expanded 20-team World Cup via European regional qualifying, finishing second to the Netherlands, and last week beat Ireland for their first-ever win over a full member of the International Cricket Council.

Contrast the national team's progress in cricket to the regression of their soccer team.

Four-time World Cup winners, Italy missed out on qualification for soccer's biggest tournament in 2018 and 2022 after losing unexpectedly in the playoffs. The Italians are back in the playoffs again in their bid to reach the upcoming World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico.

Bruno Malaspina believes it is a chance for cricket to “capitalize” on Italy's shortcomings in soccer.

The World Cup “is a good way to open up cricket to Italians,” he said in a video call. “We are not talking only about money ... but visibility in the Italian sport organization, because they are learning now that cricket is an important sport. There are big numbers all around the world.”

The lack of cricket infrastructure in the country is a major obstacle for progress — Italy currently “hosts” its international games in nations such as the Netherlands and England — but he said the federation is working hard to improve the “very, very poor” cricket grounds and fund at least one turf pitch that can be the spiritual home of Italian cricket.

“The problem is money and the bureaucratic things you have to do in Italy,” he said.

In the short term, Italian cricket is ready to enjoy its landmark moment. The team are in Group C at the World Cup staged jointly by India and Sri Lanka, and would meet Scotland, Nepal, England and the West Indies.

It is the match Italy is least likely to win — against England — that stands out.

“For the players and people involved with cricket, it's the top of our story: Playing against England. I'm not talking about the result. It's not about result, the gap is too much,” Bruno Malaspina said. “But England is ... what can I say? England is cricket.”



                                                                                Nottingham Forest FC are to go into the Europa League play-off round after a 4-0 win over Ferencvaros TC on Thursday, while Celtic FC secured their place in the knockout phase with a victory over FC Utrecht.
Aston Villa FC finished second in the league phase after recovering from two goals down to beat FC Red Bull Salzburg 3-2 with their spot in the last 16 already assured.
Forest stood an outside chance of climbing into the top eight going into the final round of matches, but needed to beat Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros and rely on other results going their way.

Italy has thwarted a series of Russian cyberattacks targeting the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, the Italian minister of foreign affairs said on Wednesday.

The attacks were “on foreign ministry offices, starting with Washington, and also some Winter Olympics sites, including hotels in Cortina,” Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Antonio Tajani said.

His office said the attacks had affected about 120 sites, including Italy's embassy in Washington, but had since been “effectively neutralized.”

A Russian hacker group claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said was in response to the Italian government's support for Ukraine.

“The pro-Ukrainian course of the Italian government leads to the fact that support for Ukrainian terrorists is punishable by our DDoS [distributed denial-of-service] missiles on Web sites,” a Telegram channel purporting to represent the group Noname057 wrote on the app.

DDoS attacks halt access to a Web site by overloading its servers with traffic.

The group said it had attacked the Web sites of several hotels in Cortina d'Ampezzo, one of the towns hosting events for the Games. Access to one of them remained blocked on Wednesday afternoon.

Italy has deployed about 6,000 police plus nearly 2,000 military personnel across the Games area, which stretches across half a dozen sites from Milan to the Dolomites.

Bomb disposal experts, snipers, anti-terrorism units and skiing police officers are among those deployed.

The Italian Ministry of Defense is also providing 170 vehicles plus radars, drones and aircraft.

Security is particularly focused on Milan, where political leaders including US Vice President J.D. Vance are expected for today's opening ceremony.

The issue has become a fraught topic after it emerged that agents from the controversial US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would be present.

Italian Minister of the Interior Matteo Piantedosi said ICE agents would not be patrolling the streets of Milan.

ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) arm would operate within US diplomatic missions only, “are not operational agents” and “have no executive function,” he said.

It was standard for countries to send security officials to the Olympics, with Italy having sent them to Paris for the 2024 Games, Piantedosi said.

“ICE does not and will never be able to carry out operational police activities on our national territory,” he said.

The HSI investigates global threats, and is separate from the department carrying out the US immigration crackdown that has sparked widespread protests.

US Ambassador to Italy Tilman Fertitta said the HSI would be “strictly advisory and intelligence-based, with no patrolling or enforcement involvement.”

“At the Olympics, HSI criminal investigators will contribute their expertise by providing intelligence on transnational criminal threats, with a focus on cybercrimes and national security threats,” he said.

VAGUE: 
                                        The criteria of the amnesty remain unclear, but it would cover political violence from 1999 to today, and those convicted of murder or drug trafficking would not qualify                                        Venezuelan Acting President Delcy Rodriguez on Friday announced an amnesty bill that could lead to the release of hundreds of prisoners, including opposition leaders, journalists and human rights activists detained for political reasons.

Both cases accuse Duterte of misusing public funds during her term as education secretary, while one revives allegations that she threatened to assassinate former ally Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
The filings come on the same day that a committee in the House of Representatives was to begin hearings into impeachment complaints against Marcos, accused of corruption tied to a spiraling scandal over bogus flood control projects.

From red-robed Buddhist monks in the snowy Himalayas, to political exiles in megacities across South Asia, to refugees in Australia, Europe and North America, voting takes place in 27 countries — but not China.
“Elections ... show that the struggle for Tibet's freedom and independence continues from generation to generation,” said candidate Gyaltsen Chokye, 33, who is based in the Indian hill-town of Dharamsala, headquarters of the government-in-exile, the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA).

Russia's flagship liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminal, Yamal LNG, exported a total of 1,690,517 metric tons of LNG to European markets last month, accounting for an 8% increase compared to January 2025, German environmental NGO Urgewald found in a report published Feb. 4. 

The report follows an agreement reached in December 2025 by EU countries to ban Russian gas imports beginning Jan. 1, 2028, with LNG imports set to be prohibited at the start of 2027.

Despite the scheduled prohibition, the European Union remains the biggest importer of Russian LNG. In 2025, EU member states imported a total of 7.2 billion euros ($8.4 billion) worth of LNG.

Urgewald, citing data from global trade tracking website Kpler, reported that of the 25 Yamal LNG cargos delivered abroad in January, 23 of the loads were delivered to European ports — with the remaining deliveries destined for China.

Amid the continued imports, sanctions campaigners, including Urgewald, have called on restricting British and French Arc7 LNG carriers from delivering imports to European port, suggesting that restrictions would ""significantly curb Russia's ability to sustain LNG exports during winter operations."" 

""Sanctioning and restricting these vessels would directly cut off Putin's Arctic LNG revenues and close one of the most important remaining energy loopholes funding the Kremlin's war,"" Sebastian Rötters, a sanctions campaign at Urgewald, said in a statement.

Gas and oil exports have played a crucial role in helping Russia fund its all-out war against Ukraine, which is soon to hit its fourth-year anniversary.

While the Yamal LNG project does not account for all of Russia's LNG exports to Europe, the terminal, a non-sanctioned venture based in northwestern Siberia on the Yamal Peninsula, serves as Russia's key export hub to Europe. Of the 19.7 million metric tons of LNG exports from Yamal, over 15 million tons — or 76.1% — are shipped to European ports.

In 2025, France served as the largest importer of Russian LNG from Yamal LNG, accounting for nearly 42% — or 6.3 million tons — of all imports, according to Urgewald. While another 4.2 million tons of LNG delivered to Belgium's Zeebrugge terminal.

The news comes amid growing Western pressure against Russian LNG trade. The EU on Jan. 26 gave final approval to a decision to ban imports of LNG from Russia by early 2027, with pipeline gas imports to be prohibited later the same year.

Among the proposals in the EU's planned 20th sanctions package against Russia is a complete maritime services ban on Russia. While the proposal has not been finalized, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told reporters that the bloc aims to impose the sanctions package on Feb. 24, he day marking the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Barrick's Pueblo Viejo gold mine in Cotui, Dominican Republic, one of three assets the new spun-off company will hold joint venture interests in, shown in 2013.Ricardo Rojas/Reuters

Barrick Mining Corp. ABX-T is moving forward with plans to spin out its North American assets into a new publicly listed company and also named Mark Hill as its permanent chief executive officer, providing some certainty around its future following an intense period of leadership turmoil.

The miner has operated in a chaotic environment for the past six months. Former CEO Mark Bristow was ousted in September, with Mr. Hill, a two-decade company veteran, appointed as interim CEO in the wake. Two months later, Barrick's lead independent director resigned – only six months after joining the board of directors – and several other senior executives also left the company, including Barrick's chief financial officer.

Opinion: For Barrick's mess, board chair John Thornton deserves as much blame as the ousted CEO

Yet through it all, Barrick's share price has soared after years of underperformance. The price of gold has risen sharply, boosting Barrick's bottom line, and the miner also announced a new discovery in Nevada.

Amid the turmoil, activist investor Elliott Investment Management L.P. amassed a large stake in Barrick and started pushing a split into two companies – one that would own Barrick's lower-risk mines in the Americas and another that would hold higher-risk properties in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

On Thursday, Mr. Hill was named permanent CEO, and the miner also said it would move forward with plans to pursue the split. The board concluded that an IPO of the company's North America assets “represents the best path for maximizing value for Barrick's shareholders,” the company said in a statement.

The new publicly listed company will hold joint venture interests in: Nevada Gold Mines, Barrick's operating assets in Nevada; Pueblo Viejo, its operating mine in the Dominican Republic; and Barrick's recently announced Fourmile gold discovery in Nevada, which looks to be a new world-class gold deposit.

Barrick will keep its African assets, which includes the Loulo-Gounkoto complex in Mali that has caused problems for the miner of late, as well as assets such as the undeveloped Reko Diq copper-gold project in Pakistan. After the IPO, Barrick will continue to hold a “significant controlling interest” in the newly created company.

Because of this structure, a major question for investors will be whether the spin out changes all that much.

Barrick also announced a new dividend policy on Thursday that is likely to boost its quarterly payout to shareholders. The company will now target paying out 50 per cent of its free cash flow, with the goal of returning more cash to shareholders.

The miner also reported another death. Barrick had already disclosed a fatal injury in Tanzania in October, and on Thursday the company said another person died at its project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in December.

Barrick's shares fell six per cent in early morning trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The S&P/TSX Capped Gold Index was down 4.5 per cent, largely because of falling gold prices Thursday.

Many of us have common recurring dreams, from falling to being chased to botching that presentation. Often, we're quick to dismiss them. But research suggests dreams play a meaningful role in our mental health and wellbeing. 

As Karen van Kampen writes in her new book, The Brain Never Sleeps, “There is no sharp divide between waking and dreaming life. When we are asleep, our dreams are as real to us as waking experiences. They have the power to influence what we think, feel and do.” The Globe and Mail spoke with van Kampen about the healing power of dreams – and what happens when we start paying attention to them.

Supplied

Your father opened a sleep lab when you were nine. How did that shape your interest in dreams?

When my dad opened his first sleep lab, he practiced hooking up electrodes on me at our kitchen table, with our German shepherds running around. Later, I'd nap in the lab while he tested equipment. It was so much fun being there; in my mind, it felt like a cross between a hotel and a government facility tracking secrets. Years later, I read a study suggesting we're as dream-deprived as we are sleep-deprived. That really turned me onto the question of why dreams matter and how they impact our health and wellbeing.

In simple terms, why do we dream?

One theory is that dreams help consolidate memory and improve learning. Another is that they allow us to prepare for life's threats or difficulties, like losing your phone or having a difficult conversation. A third idea is that they help us process difficult emotions, almost like an overnight therapy.

During COVID-19, many people reported vivid or disturbing dreams. What did those reveal?

A large portion of dreams reflect our waking life. During COVID, we were living with constant uncertainty and trying to come to terms with this new invisible threat. That anxiety appeared in dreams as bugs or as something seeping through windows and doors that couldn't keep danger out. Health care workers dreamed of being unable to protect patients. What struck me was how a shared fear became deeply personal in dreams.

Karen van Kampen recommends keeping a pen and paper by your bedside to record what you remember of your dreams.Supplied

You write that people who dream about anxieties cope better afterward. Why?

Research by [the late psychologist] Rosalind Cartwright, sometimes called the “queen of dreams,” found that people who dreamed about their divorce coped better a year later. Similar findings show that students who have exam-stress dreams tend to perform better. The idea is that dreaming helps us engage with difficulty, so we're better equipped during the day. 

What surprised you most while researching the book?

Anesthesia dreams. At certain levels of anesthesia, people enter a calm, peaceful state where they revisit difficult experiences without fear. Some described these dreams as transformative; they woke up with this different way of thinking. I was also surprised by research into dream engineering, the idea that we can try and shape and guide our dreams. 

What does dream engineering look like in practice?

It can be as simple as setting an intention. When you fall asleep with something on your mind, there's a chance that you'll dream about the topic you've incubated. For the book, I tried my own ad hoc dream experiment at home. I was having a nap and focused on a tree while falling asleep. There's a phase at sleep onset researchers call a creative sweet spot, when you're relaxed but still aware. I could hear kids playing outside my window, jumping through the sprinkler, while my thoughts became dreamlike. I looked at it like a creative brainstorming session. 

Many people say they don't dream at all. Are they right?

Probably not. Most people who say they don't dream simply aren't waking during or right after a dream, so they don't remember it. But they're still gaining the benefits.

Are recurring dreams – such as falling– meaningful?

They're common because they reflect common experiences. Work-stress dreams – like when you're giving a presentation and your slides are blank – make sense because we spend so much time at work. Falling dreams are often linked to helplessness. What matters most is the emotional theme and what's happening in waking life.

How can people work with their dreams?

Keep a pen and paper by your bedside and write down whatever you remember, even fragments. You could also make a voice recording. Dreams are a kind of highlight reel of what's weighing on us. Nightmares are especially important. Many people try to ignore them, but they can affect mental health and even create fear around falling asleep. One way to combat nightmares is through imagery rehearsal therapy, where you rescript a nightmare's ending while awake and then practice the new version.

If readers take away one thing from your book, what should it be?

Dreams are an alternate realm of thought that runs alongside waking life. You don't have to pay attention to them. But if you do, they can offer insight and creativity. We spend a third of our lives asleep, much of it dreaming. That's a lot of mental life to ignore.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Germany news: Merz on Gulf tour talks arms deals in Doha","https://www.dw.com/en/germany-news-merz-on-gulf-tour-talks-arms-deals-in-doha/live-75812212","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 08:17:16 GMT","

Chancellor Friedrich Merz is on a three-day visit to the Gulf region as Germany seeks closer partnerships on business, energy and security. DW has the latest.

Here's DW's coverage of the latest news from Germany on Thursday, February 5. 

In Qatar on Thursday, Chancellor Friedrich Merz signaled Germany would be willing to increase arms exports to countries like Qatar and Saudi Arabia as ""reliable cooperation partners.""

Merz is on a three day tour of Gulf states along with the CEOs of German energy company Uniper, and Diehl Defense, among others, to explore potential oil, gas and arms deals as part of a push to attract more business to Germany as US tariff policies, and high energy prices in Europe, put pressure on the economy.

Speaking to reporters in Doha, Merz said Germany would work ""more intensively in arms cooperation than in recent years"" with partners in the Gulf region.

Merz added Germany aims to import more liquefied natural gas from Qatar.

""This is in our mutual interest, ‍because we want to ensure that the world becomes safer, and it will only ​become ​safer if we are able to defend ourselves,"" he told journalists.

The chancellor emphasized that Germany would not be exporting arms without oversight.

""This does not mean that we will now supply all arms to all countries completely unchecked. Each case will still be reviewed individually,"" he said, adding that Germany had already begun loosening its restrictive arms export policy last year, including with the export of Eurofighter jets to Saudi Arabia.

Previous German governments have held back on exporting arms to autocratically governed Gulf states, citing human rights concerns and regional conflicts like the war in Yemen. Saudi Arabia had been subject to a years-long arms export ban.

Residents in the city of Darmstadt, located south of Frankfurt, were advised to windows and doors closed Thursday morning as firefighters worked putting out a blaze at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research.

Firefighters and officials at the center said the fire caused extensive damage to the property, but no one was injured. 

The GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research in the Wixhausen district of Darmstadt is known for its ion accelerator facility. It is used for experiments to gain insights into the structure of matter and the evolution of the universe.

A spokesperson said a short circuit occurred during preparations to power up the facility at a transformer station, involving its high-voltage power supply. 

A new accelerator complex is under construction at the site. The center said this project was not directly affected by the fire, but added that the full extent of the damage had yet to be determined.

Firefighting operations are expected to continue into Thursday evening, with approximately 160 emergency personnel from Darmstadt and the surrounding region deployed to the scene.

Police investigators are scheduled to begin a probe into the cause of the fire once the area is declared safe.

The fire department said no hazardous substances have been detected in the air so far.

Speaking in the Qatari capital Doha on Thursday, German Chancellor Merz called on Iran to ""truly enter talks"" on ending its nuclear program ahead of a planned meeting with US envoys.

""Talks will therefore be intensified in the next hours,"" Merz said, adding that Germany was ""coordinating closely"" with the US.

""The concern about a military escalation in the region is great,"" Merz said, while calling on Tehran to end  ""aggression"" and ""spare countries like Qatar, Jordan and Israel from further military threats.""

Tensions are running high after US President Donald Trump last month repeatedly threatened Tehran's leadership with military strikes, partly in response to a brutal crackdown against demonstrators during recent mass protests.

On Wednesday, before embarking on his first trip to the Gulf region, Merz said Germany was ""ready to increase the pressure on Tehran.""

On Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi criticized Merz on X, accusing him of ""political naivety"" and having a ""distasteful character.""

""It is therefore doubly regrettable that an individual such as Mr. Merz now represents Germany on the world stage,"" Araghchi said, while calling Germany an ""engine of regression.""

""I have seen this tweet and can only say it seems to be a sign of great nervousness and insecurity,"" Merz said in response.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh for more than two hours on Wednesday, with members of the German delegation telling DPA news agency on Thursday morning that the talks were ""warm and open"" and that Merz wants to take ties with Saudi Arabia to a ""new level.""

The sit-down with the crown prince kicked off Merz's three-day tour of the Gulf region, where the chancellor hopes to build partnerships centered on security, energy and infrastructure.

Merz's delegation said the talks with the crown prince covered energy, defense, AI, and geopolitical concerns like tensions in Iran and Syria.

The visit to the Gulf region comes as Germany seeks to diversify its partnerships away from China, and a mercurial US under President Donald Trump.

Germany is also eyeing access to energy supplies like liquefied natural gas and hydrogen, as Russian oil and gas remain taboo with Moscow continuing its war in Ukraine.

Other areas that could create jobs include defense cooperation and investment from wealthy Gulf states in Germany, which currently has the highest unemployment rate seen in 12 years.

On Thursday, after meeting Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Than in Doha, Merz said ""In a time of global economic upheaval, geopolitical uncertainties and technological transformation, Germany and Qatar are consciously focusing on dialogue diversification and investments in the future.""

Ahead of the trip, Merz had said he would raise human rights concerns while visiting with the Saudi crown prince, while also admitting that the issue no longer played as prominent a role in relations as it has in the past.

Saudi Arabia is notorious for its treatment of women and a draconian justice system. In 2018, the brutal murder and dismemberment of Saudi journalist and crown prince critic Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Turkey shocked the world. Western intelligence agencies like the CIA asses Khashoggi was killed at the behest of the crown prince, who has denied all involvement. According to Human Rights Watch, Saudi Arabia carried out a record number of 356 executions in 2025.

Reuters news agency reported Thursday that Merz said he had discussed human rights, but ""these are issues that play ​a role in discussions behind closed doors,"" he told journalists.

Russia has expelled a German diplomat in what it called a symmetrical response to Germany's decision in January to expel a Russian diplomat over suspected spying.

Russia's Foreign Ministry said it had declared a staff member of the German embassy in Moscow persona non grata. It said the move was a ""symmetrical reaction"" after Berlin expelled a Russian diplomat on January 22.

Moscow accused Germany of bearing ""full responsibility for the new escalation in bilateral relations"" and dismissed the spying allegation as ""unfounded,"" saying Berlin had developed a ""spy mania.""

Germany said in January it expelled a Russian diplomat who was suspected of acting as a contact in an espionage case. A German-Ukrainian woman had previously been arrested on suspicion of spying for Russia.

A large power outage has struck parts of Stuttgart, police have said, leaving some traffic lights out and prompting officers to regulate traffic at major intersections.

Police said patrols were dispatched after signals failed across parts of the city, adding that the cause was not yet known.

A fire service spokesperson said there were several callouts triggered by fire alarm systems, but no active fire incidents so far. The fire brigade itself was also affected by the outage and was still assessing the situation.

Internet service temporarily went down in many offices, while grid operators initially could not provide details.

Passengers also reported disruptions to Stuttgart's city rail network. One witness told German news agency DPA she was on a train that stopped for several minutes, with an announcement saying there was a power outage and service would resume shortly.

Deutsche Bahn said S-Bahn and regional rail services were not affected.

Stuttgart has a population of about 600,000 and is the capital of the German state of Baden-Württemberg.

The number of marriages in Germany in 2024 was the lowest since record-keeping began in 1950, data released Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis).

Just under half of Germany's adult population was married at the end of 2024, and a total of 349,200 marriages were registered during the year, data showed. 

The numbers continue a trend seen for years in Germany. Thirty years ago, Around 60% of the adult population was married. 

The data also shows people are marrying at a later age, with the average age of first marriage rising by 6 years over the past three decades. For women in 2024 the average age was 32.9, and for men, 35.3 years old. 

However, marriage rates in Germany remain slightly above the EU average, when measured per capita. 

The most recent Eurostat data from 2023 cited by DPA news agency showed Germany recorded 4.3 marriages per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with an EU average of 4. 

Romania had the highest rate in the EU at 5.8, while Italy and Slovenia came in last at 3.1 and 3.0, respectively.

New industrial orders jumped 7.8% month on month in December, according to preliminary numbers released Thursday by Germany's Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) on Thursday.

The increase in orders is the largest seen since December 2023, and was far higher than estimates by analysts surveyed by Reuters news agency, who had expected a pullback on average of 2.2%.

Germany's economy has been stuck in a protracted slump over high energy costs, a manufacturing slump and lagging demand from China. After taking office last year, Chancellor Friedrich Merz loosened Germany's public spending rules to finance investments in defense and infrastructure.

Thomas Gitzel, chief economist at VP Bank, told the DPA news agency that German industry is ""on the verge of an upswing,"" adding that the increase in orders was likely driven by the defense sector.

According to Destatis, the gains in industrial orders were driven mainly by metal products manufacturing and mechanical engineering. Orders for electronic and optical products also rose.

Sebastian Dullien, scientific director at the Hans-Böckler-Foundation's Macroeconomic Policy Institute (IMK), told Reuters that in the coming months, defense orders are likely to lead to a further increase in order intake.

""In December, the German Bundestag approved defense procurement worth around €50 billion, which is now gradually being implemented,"" he said.

""However, the recovery is no longer driven solely by public contracts and large orders. Orders from abroad also rose sharply, as did orders beyond the large contracts. This shows that fiscal policy stimulus is likely to be able to trigger a broader recovery,"" he added.

However, in Germany's crucial automotive sector, the statistics showed incoming orders fell by 6.3% month-on-month.

Germany is also facing its highest unemployment rate in 12 years, with over 3 million people out of work, according to numbers released last month by the Federal Employment Agency (BA).

Merz's Gulf states tour is a manifestation of how global power is shifting.

The German chancellor is here with a mission to attract more investment from the rich Gulf states to Germany and to secure LNG suppliers as an alternative for the United States. 

Nobody here will openly criticize US President Donald Trump's administration, as all sides seem to fear his wrath, which could lead to yet more tariffs or other erratic moves in an already explosive security environment in the Gulf region. 

But when Merz promises, and his partners here praise the reliability of relations with Germany, they speak of creating alternative alliances, not working against but around the US.

Departures were suspended at Berlin Brandenburg Airport on Thursday morning after freezing rain prevented aircraft from being de-iced, an airport spokesperson said.

""Due to weather conditions, no take-offs are currently possible. Please check the flight status with your airline,"" an update on the airport website said.

Passengers were told to expect flight cancellations and significant delays. It said disruptions could remain in place until weather conditions improve.

The recent cold spell in Germany has resulted in widespread travel chaos, particularly on trains.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Thursday that Berlin wants to deepen cooperation with Australia on critical raw materials, while pushing for the swift conclusion of a free trade agreement between the European Union and Australia.

After his talks with Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, Wadephul said in Canberra that Germany is keen to expand partnerships on strategically important minerals.

""Your country is an important partner for us in diversifying our supply chains,"" Wadephul said.

""Many critical raw materials such as lithium are extracted here and we are very interested in further expanding our cooperation in the raw materials sector, especially in strategically important minerals.""

Australia has the world's largest hard-rock lithium mine, which supplies around 20% of the world's output. It is also home to huge deposits of rare earths  such as neodymium and terbium.

Wadephul also urged swift progress on a long-delayed free trade agreement between the EU and Australia.

Both Wong and Wadephul hoped a deal could be reached soon, to which the German minister said, ""Preferably before the end of this year.""

He added that both the EU and Australia would benefit from an agreement dismantling ""all trade barriers.""

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz began his three-day Gulf tour late on Wednesday with Saudi Arabia, as Europe's largest economy seeks to diversify trade, energy and security partnerships.

Merz and a business delegation met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before traveling to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The trip concludes on Friday.

Ahead of his trip, Merz said the Gulf could also help Germany ""diversify our oil and gas supply chains"" as Berlin aims to cut down reliance on US liquefied natural gas (LNG).

""We need such partnerships more than ever at a time when major powers increasingly determine politics,"" the German chancellor said.

Germany has deep ties with Gulf nations, including defense exports, infrastructure projects, and investments in German corporations such as Volkswagen to Deutsche Bank.

Merz's visit also comes amid heightened regional tensions regarding Iran.

The chancellor said he would raise human rights concerns during his Saudi tour, while also admitting that the issue no longer played as prominent a role in relations as in the past. 

Hi! Welcome to our coverage of the most important news from Germany.  

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is on a three-day Gulf tour beginning with Saudi Arabia and then traveling to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul in Australia endorsed deepening Berlin's partnership with Canberra on critical raw materials.

With the New START pact now expired, the US and Russia face no limits on their nuclear weapon stockpiles for the first time in decades. The UN warns the risk of nuclear use is now at its highest in decades.

The threat of a renewed global nuclear arms race came a little closer to reality as the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia expired at midnight GMT on Thursday.

The New START pact and its predecessors had for decades imposed limits on the world's two largest nuclear arsenals.

It lapsed at midnight GMT or 7 p.m. EST, according to the United Nations, without an agreement to extend it.

The US and Russia, the world's two largest nuclear powers, will now no longer be bound by upper limits for their strategic nuclear arsenals.

Russia, however, pledged to act responsibly while warning it would take ""decisive"" measures if its security were threatened, the Foreign Ministry in Moscow said on Wednesday.

Washington has not announced plans to adhere to the treaty's limits beyond the deadline.

New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), signed in 2010, capped both the US and Russia at 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads.

Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin had floated the proposal for a one-year extension. In October, US President Donald Trump said that sounded ""like a good idea,"" but there were no subsequent negotiations.

Trump has insisted that he wants any future arms control agreement to include China, an idea Beijing rejects and Moscow considers unnecessary.

In a video call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Putin discussed the expiration of the nuclear arms treaty and reiterated Moscow's commitment to ""act in a balanced and responsible manner"" while remaining ""open to searching for ways of negotiations to ensure strategic stability,"" according to the Kremlin.

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that Trump would decide on the treaty later, but added that ""it's impossible to do something that doesn't include China, because of their vast and rapidly growing stockpile.""

On Thursday, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul also called on China to show ""restraint"" in weapons development while saying future arms control efforts need to include Beijing.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday rang the alarm bells over the treaty's expiration, calling it a ""grave moment for international peace and security."" He implored both countries to return to negotiations without delay at a time when ""the risk of a nuclear weapon being used is the highest in decades.""

Earlier, Pope Leo XIV also called for the de-escalation from a new arms race and said during his weekly general audience, ""I urge you not to abandon this instrument without seeking to ensure that it is followed up in a concrete and effective manner.""

Marco Rubio warned Labour over the appointment of Lord Mandelson as ambassador to the United States.

In comments understood to have been relayed to Downing Street, the US secretary of state is believed to have expressed deep unease about the peer's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and links to China.

One well-placed source told The Telegraph there was a unanimous view of “what are you doing?” in the White House.

It will prompt further questions over the Prime Minister's judgment in appointing Lord Mandelson as US ambassador. Sir Keir Starmer is fighting for his political future, as is Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff, who has been blamed for proposing Lord Mandelson as ambassador to the US.

The Labour peer was handed the role at the end of 2024 and lasted nine months before he was sacked when the extent of his friendship with Epstein was made public.

Over the past week, further disclosures about Lord Mandelson's connections to the convicted paedophile have been made public.

Emails show Epstein sent Lord Mandelson $75,000 in three payments in 2003 and 2004, as well as paying $4,000 a month to the peer's husband through a standing order.

Other evidence shows he sent sensitive government information to Epstein when he was Gordon Brown's business secretary, including plans for a multibillion-pound EU bailout, Mr Brown's resignation and the potential sale of government land and property.

Fresh photos have also emerged of Mandelson in the Epstein files, which the US department of justice released, including images of him in his underwear. The extent of the friendship raises questions about Epstein's influence over Mandelson and whether he was potentially at risk of blackmail.

Polish prime minister Donald Tusk said on Tuesday his government would examine Epstein's links with Russian intelligence services.

On Wednesday, Sir Keir admitted that he was aware that Lord Mandelson had continued his relationship with Epstein after the financier's conviction, but still made him US ambassador.

Lord Glasman, a Labour peer, said he had both privately and publicly warned Sir Keir not to appoint Lord Mandelson.

It is understood the peer relayed his personal concerns, and those of leading figures in the White House, to Sir Keir, but these fell on deaf ears.

He told GB News: “It was so obvious when we were there [in Washington]. People were just walking up to me with their phones, showing me those photographs [of Mandelson with Epstein].

“What he's done is terrible. He has leaked government secrets, he put pressure on government ministers on behalf of foreigners.”

Sir Keir is also facing pressure from his backbenchers to dismiss Mr McSweeney over the scandal.

Karl Turner, the Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull East, said Mr McSweeney had done a “terrible” job advising the Prime Minister.

He told Times Radio: “If the PM decides he has to be surrounded by advisers who give him shoddy advice, the reality of that is the Prime Minister is going to have to make a decision about his future at some point soon.

“If McSweeney is still in 10 Downing Street, the PM is up against it.”

Paula Barker, the MP for Liverpool Wavetree, told the BBC: “I do think that there are serious questions to be answered by his team and certainly – as we know only too well – when your chief of staff becomes the story, then often it's time for them to go.”

Recommended

On Wednesday, a revolt by Labour MPs forced Sir Keir to hand control over the release of the files relating to Lord Mandelson's appointment to Parliament's intelligence and security committee.

The files were set to be released by the Prime Minister's most senior civil servant. But in a severe blow to Sir Keir's authority, Downing Street was forced to hand the process to the committee after Angela Rayner, his former deputy, and senior Labour MPs insisted No 10 should not decide what material is published.

It was the latest climbdown by Sir Keir after several Labour rebellions and more than a dozen about-turns during his time in government.

“We are becoming the people that we always knew that we needed to be,” says Minneapolis organizer Andrew Fahlstrom.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

“Our days are riding on the learning edge of a whirlwind — crisis management, harm mitigation, helping everyone come to terms with new conditions and new impossible choices that they're faced with,” says Minneapolis organizer Andrew Fahlstrom. In this episode of Movement Memos, Fahlstrom and local organizers Jordan and Susan Raffo talk with host Kelly Hayes about community defense in Minneapolis, the social fabric of collective care under federal occupation, and how people around the country should be gearing up for the long struggle ahead.

Note: This a rush transcript and has been lightly edited for clarity. Copy may not be in its final form.

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity, and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today we are talking about the federal occupation of Minneapolis, where three people have been shot by federal agents – two fatally – and thousands of immigrants have been detained. We'll be hearing from writer and healing justice practitioner Susan Raffo; Andrew Fahlstrom, a rapid response organizer with Defend the 612; and Jordan, an immigrant organizer whose works includes digital security and mutual aid.

In the Twin Cities and surrounding areas, we have seen an escalation of fascist violence that reflects the race war fantasies of men like White House adviser Stephen Miller, who would see immigrants and their defenders ground under. However, Minneapolis is also the heart of another arc of escalation — a mass activation of care and community defense and resistance that signals hope for us all. 

Last week, some observers welcomed news that Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino was reassigned out of Minneapolis. The move followed the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents and a wave of public backlash. The conversation you're about to hear was recorded the day after Pretti's death, prior to the announcement about Bovino's departure. Unfortunately, the issues we discuss here — the violence, the lack of accountability, and the urgent need for steady, strategic responses from movements and communities — remain as relevant in Minneapolis today as they were the day after Pretti's killing. Activists on the ground in Minneapolis have described Bovino as a “sadist” and a “fascist abuser,” whose departure has been felt on a personal level, but note the character and intensity of their struggle has not changed in the wake of his departure. Brutal attacks on their communities are ongoing, while ICE attacks in other states continue to escalate as well.

This is a time to be strategic, and to learn all we can from each other, because all of our communities need to prepare for the kind of state violence that Minneapolis is facing right now.

[musical interlude]

KH:  Jordan, Raffo, Andrew, welcome to “Movement Memos.”

Susan Raffo: Good to be here.

Jordan: Thanks for having us.

Andrew: It's good to be here.

KH: To help frame this conversation for our audience, can each of you take a moment to introduce yourself and tell us a bit about the organizing work you're involved with?

Jordan: So my name is Jordan. I'm an Ethiopian Eritrean immigrant from my mother and my father's side. I am a transplant to Minnesota. I came here a few years ago. At this point, I feel like it's my second home. I'm a two-culture kid in that way, but my family has been immigrating to Minnesota, but also the U.S. since the '70s, the late '70s and early '80s. 

My work, I feel like right now it's shaped as a community organizer in 2026, but a lot of my work focuses on relationship building, setting up care infrastructures, capacity building, political education work. And most recently in the last three, four years, a lot of tech justice work with the heightened surveillance and just AI or production work. Yeah, that's me. Nice to be here.

SR: I am Susan Raffo. I go by Raffo. I do a lot of my work through REP [Relationships Evolving Possibilities], which is a project that emerged in 2020 during the uprising. We do a lot of work around collective safety, both through political education and skills building.

In the moment that we're in right now in the Twin Cities, there's a lot of work that I'm doing that is about connecting people to care. So what are the things that we need that are going to make us sustainable for the long-term, recognizing that this is not stopping tomorrow. That includes everything from dealing with shock trauma, to grief circles, to supporting people who are doing on-the-ground work or frontline work in different ways. And that's how I'm showing up in this conversation.

Andrew: My name's Andrew. I have lived in Minnesota for almost 45 years now. And the work that I'm involved in, in this moment, besides parenting a teenager, trying to be in a healthy partnership, and live through occupation, has been in supporting the multitudes of community defense structures that have been blossoming and growing across Minneapolis, across the Twin Cities, across the entire state, inspiring each other, inspiring the country, inspiring the world.

And so that looks like being part of Defend the 612, which is a sort of entry point for people to get involved in their neighborhood work, whether that's the local school patrols or their block groups, block captains, or the other patrols and monitoring that's going on right now in the city of Minneapolis. And so I've been spending my time in that in addition to trying to live a life, have a day job, and survive under the conditions that Minneapolis is facing in this moment. 

KH: Thank you all so much for being here and for making time during an incredibly difficult moment. We're recording this conversation the day after Alex Pretti was shot and killed in the street by a federal agent in Minneapolis. As organizers and community members in this city, I know you're all carrying a lot right now, so I want to begin by asking: how are you holding up?

SR: This is Raffo. The other two people on this call are people who are quite beloved to me. And I can feel in our voices and in the feel that we share the way that there's a heaviness, and I don't want to speak for Jordan and Andrew, but I know these two folks really well. I feel it in my own body.

So coming into this call, I had shared that I was excited, because in this moment there's not a lot of space to just pause and reflect. And so I've been looking forward to that really straight up to listen to Jordan and Andrew as much as have time for my own, but I can feel it in my own body. There's a tightness. My heart feels really heavy. I feel it between us. So thank you for naming that and starting it because, of course, it's going to shape whatever we talk about today.

KH: Thanks, Raffo. Jordan, how are you feeling?

Jordan: Yeah, I definitely resonate with the heaviness. There's this public escalation of the nervous system, but also there is so much like, “Okay, what is the strategy? How do we move?” And so I think we're all holding a lot of that, but also I think sleep has been one of the hardest things that has been hard to come by. And so that's where I am.

Andrew: Yeah, to be perfectly honest, I haven't processed yesterday. I was on Nicollet Avenue not too long after the assassination of Alex Pretti with the crowds, with the people on the lines of Border Patrol and ICE agents, of anger at another killing in our neighborhood with the Minneapolis Police Department, Hennepin County Sheriff's coming to support the presence of ICE after they killed another one of our neighbors. And I took a face full of pepper spray and the clouds of tear gas went for blocks.

So there's both the physical trauma and the community trauma of so many people who are activated in this moment and so many people that want our conditions to change, the collective conditions that we're living under. And so many of us searching for the moves and the processes and the togetherness and the hope that it can change and the hope that we can be part of that change and the fear that we may not be able to do all of the things that we want to see happen.

So I'm just sitting here with the enormity of that and the questions of what's next, of where do we move together and how do we move? Yeah. So there's some sadness, there's some inspiration, there's this line of courage that's impossible to let go of because so many of us are holding it in this moment that even if you let go of it for a day or a week, it's just always there because so many of us are holding it together. That's how I'm arriving.

KH: Thank you all for your vulnerability and for helping our listeners understand what it means to live inside this moment in Minneapolis. Andrew, your words about that line of courage really resonated. Many of us felt a similar bond and sense of connection in our work here in Chicago during Midway Blitz, and I think a lot of us now feel that kinship with our siblings in struggle in Minneapolis. 

To give our listeners some context, can you describe the arc of escalation you've seen in Minneapolis and the surrounding area? How did the current crisis take shape?

Jordan: I think the first point of escalation for me that I witnessed at least in Minneapolis was in October. There was a low-key arrest of, I think, four individuals from Central America. And neighbors definitely got in the way and investigated what went on. But to me, nothing is really isolated in the situation. Everything is a test to see how folks will respond, how neighbors will show up. And so they've been doing this test, honestly, for a while. I think the Twin Cities in general is a punk city and people resist. And I think people just know their neighbors a lot more than any place I've ever been in my life. I live in South Minneapolis in an area where it's hugely, hugely immigrant and a lot of brown and Black people, but a lot of people that are not brown and Black people that know their neighbors pretty well.

In Minnesota winter, even if it's negative-something [degrees], people are biking, people are walking, people are walking their dogs. People with kids and stuff usually are out playing in the snow, or when people shovel the snow, people are out in my neighborhood, so I think just the absence of people and the fact that the street is so empty except the people that are doing patrolling or they're doing watch or legal observer, you don't see as many people. When you go to the stores, it's a lot more emptier because there's this lingering fear and heaviness and grief that people don't know what to do with.

I think the scale and the type of crisis is not necessarily new to me. I have a lot of family that has witnessed genocide in large ways, so even just talking about it, they're like, “This is so familiar. This tastes so familiar. This feels so familiar.”

Andrew: Where to begin? Where do we start? I was actually talking with Raffo a few days ago about the Dakota conflict of 1862. Some people call it the Dakota Uprising or the Dakota War when the peoples who lived on this land rose up against the armies of the day in this place that we live. And sort of like the lineage of this place we call Minnesota, it doesn't seem like an accident that the American Indian Movement was born on the streets of South Minneapolis, and the lines of continuity and connection between the ways our peoples came together when George Floyd was assassinated at 38th and Chicago, and what it meant for us to have to be our own fire department, be our own community protection services during that time when the police disappeared, when the fire department wasn't responding on the streets.

We have escalated our togetherness and our community in the face of so many things. December 1st, all of a sudden, there were ICE everywhere in our neighborhoods. And the way I found out about that was a Subaru with an Uber light had taken two parents from a car and left a young child outside of a school in South Minneapolis in the cold. And from there, it has been, I think, 55 days of ramping up an escalation. And in a similar way, we thought it was bad the first four weeks, and then the next thousand came, and then the next thousand came.

And we know that they're coming because we have been so organized. There have been so many people who already know their neighbors who are looking out and caring for each other, and we know they're coming because they have been resourced by billions of dollars and that we are a testing ground and they'll be coming for so many other places as they staff up their troops and their paramilitaries.

So it seems iterative and we learn and we practice and we try and we move with love and togetherness and more violence comes and we try to maneuver and they learn and we learn and they learn. It feels like we're in this dance that can't or won't continue forever, but I don't know how long it will go on. I would say, the escalation that I'm most grateful for has been the escalation of truth and vision of what's being seen because of the courage of my neighbors.

SR: I'm totally going to pick up on that. And I actually want to use the word “exaltation” instead of “escalation.” And that sounds really silly, but it's like I want to exalt for a second. There's a story out there which is not untrue when you hear it in our voices about how we know our neighbors in the cities. And I know I just recently spent a bunch of time in other parts of the U.S. and really noticed how there is a neighborliness in Minneapolis that I don't always find in other cities that I spend time in. And that doesn't mean that the neighborliness didn't have a hell of a lot of gaps before. So many gaps. That didn't mean that we all talked to each other all the time.

During the uprising in 2020, we had massive fights about abolition, and there was a whole liberal sway of our community that really struggled with abolition. And in particular, I would say the fact that this was abolitionist organizing around the murder of a Black man. And so this is a different moment that builds on that. All of that organizing is there, absolutely, that has been said, but there's something that's happening with that organizing, which feels in … Kelly, you and I talked about this a little bit when we were talking about this podcast, is it feels like this dance between emergence and strategy is that there is something about this moment. And I think part of it is the story. To even call this moment “the story” makes me shudder, but the image is the story, the what is here, what it means to love our neighbors, all of those pieces. People are gathering around that on their own in a way that, in 2020, it was sometimes harder to get people to gather. And so there's stuff where people are stepping forward.

I feel like every moment I keep hearing about a whole other sway, and what's really different about this is that 2020 felt like this was … I don't believe in “left” and “right” really that much anymore, but still for using that language, it was like a far-left narrative about abolition in a very specific kind of way, and there were boundaries around who was in and who was not. This moment, I keep seeing the circle widening. I keep seeing people who are stepping across gaps, stepping across separation, stepping across disconnections in ways that I've not seen before. And as a 60-year-old person who's been in movement since I was 16, I've also not lived through it in this way before. So it is an escalation of what? Of neighborliness, of moral something. I don't even know at this point how to talk about it, except that there is something that is emergent at the same time as there are things that are structurally organized.

And Andrew and I were talking, again, as Andrew referred to a couple days ago about what are the ways to communicate some of this to other cities that are in the process — hello, Maine — and other places that are facing it as both Jordan and Andrew just said, that this is other places. What are the pieces of this that are translatable? What are the pieces that are specific? That's some of the stuff that I've been thinking about a lot as everybody who's in Minnesota right now is getting a lot of phone calls from people who are in other places who are wanting to prepare and sorting through what is specific to hear, what is not, what can be replicated feels like it's getting into that emergence and strategy structure and the difference between them.

KH: Thank you all so much for that. I really hear you, Raffo, on the question of what's specific to a place and what's useful to share — and how we give away what's useful. We did a lot of that kind of thinking here in Chicago as well.

And I think there's something really powerful, amid the horror of how different cities have been attacked, about the way we keep reaching for each other. When Chicago was targeted, people in LA and D.C. were incredibly generous in talking with us about their experiences. Near the end of Midway Blitz, when ICE was beginning to pivot to other cities, there was a lot of communication between Chicago activists and folks in those cities.

When you talk about people showing up who you wouldn't ordinarily expect — which is something we definitely experienced here as well, a sort of broadening of the “we” in struggle — I think that's also reflected in the way that people are reaching across geographies to help each other. I think our sense of who “we” are is broadening in our own cities, and from city to city, as this movement grows. And I think that's so hopeful.

Now, I want to talk a bit about the day-to-day experience of this struggle. From one day to the next, what does the work look like for you right now — as much as you're able to share safely.

Jordan, would you like to start? 

Jordan: Sure. I think that day-to-day is different. Every day is different. I think one of the things is digital security is a big thing that has come up a lot. And so just being very, very curious and attentive around how we would communicate with each other also has been something that I've been working on. How are we communicating? How is our conversations, our information being tracked and surveilled in different ways? 

Then around midday, we do some supply drop-offs if people need them, usually people that are not able to leave their houses. And if there's any mutual aid need, there is a group that I'm a part of. We do just mutual aid pods and we just support people in that way, like food. If there's any pharmacy pickup, there's a lot of people that are not able to go out even for, not necessarily for documentation reasons, but because of mental health stuff or they're just fearful of being outside at this moment. So there's also some of those folks that just need some of that support.

And I also actually have some off times where I just don't do any sort of rapid response, and that is because of longevity and sustainability reasons. I have off-time for two hours in the middle of the day, I just don't do that. I'm off the clock, and that is because I saw a lot of burnout in myself in 2020, too, when I was on the go, go, go. I also saw myself doing that in 2018. And so I'm just learning from other folks that are much older than me, that is probably not the most sustainable way to do this.

Another thing that I've been working on for a few weeks is trying to organize a safe house for people that just need a place to stay. Another thing that we were thinking about is the risk assessment of all of this, the people that are facilitating this whole thing for the people that are hosting and setting up the safe houses, but also the people that are being hosted, what is the default risk and just some of the repercussions around that. So I have a lot of beloveds and generous people that are like, “We are willing to do this,” but also, we are in this learning phase because I've never done this.

And so it's just a matter of figuring out how to find alternative ways of keeping people physically safe as a retreat moment while things are adjusting and moving as they need to. So it's just a lot of that. And there's also a lot of digital security work because how are we conducting ourselves even when we're doing that, as well? 

KH: Thank you, Jordan. I deeply appreciate the work you're doing. Andrew?

Andrew: Our days are riding on the learning edge of a whirlwind — crisis management, harm mitigation, helping everyone come to terms with new conditions and new impossible choices that they're faced with. So that might look like helping folks think through plans, transportation plans, connecting folks who want to give rides with those that need rides or that need groceries that want to support on that. 

It looks like helping other people tell their stories, the millions of stories that are happening and the intense scrutiny of the press as we are once again in the national spotlight, navigating the risk of saying your name and attaching yourself in a time when there's immense right-wing interest and pressure and danger on people's lives just for appearing in the media, just for telling their story. It has looked like trying to get a two-year-old baby returned who was taken two blocks from my house and then just breaking down crying when I heard that she was on a flight home. And it really looks like in these moments of activity, taking time with the so many loved ones and beloveds who are doing so much and on whose back, so much of this moves to just hold each other and cry and feel as much as possible, as much as we can let ourselves in the middle of emergency, feel the beauty and feel the terror of this time.

SR: I'll say a little thing about my days. They're really a mix of what are the things that people need right this second? What is the short-term strategy that's available and what's the long-term strategy that's available? And it goes between those. So a lot of immediate … Some definitely mutual aid rapid response, but also just a lot of care work. Somebody who's about to crack, who's holding more than they can. So that's immediate. And then the short term is I've really been looking to reach out to people while this is a very emergent moment and it is, there are also multiple bodies who are holding a lot because they are organizers, they are positioned, they've built things that have caught fire and been reaching a lot doing safety planning and safety planning, not just digital sec and just basic safety planning, but also that part of safety planning that is about sustainability. We actually need you to be okay for the next five months to a year. And so we need to be in that right now. So I'm doing a lot of reaching out. This is based on 35, 40 years of relationship in the cities of reaching out to folks to sort of help get that in place.

And then other things that are, as you know from Chicago, as Minneapolis as the city's experienced during the uprising is because there's a lot nationally that's resting on what happens here. There's also a lot of places where there's local national partnerships that are happening that are a little bit more mid- and long-term strategy. And that's everything from care networks, grief rituals, supporting faith-based folks to continue organizing and doing direct action.

So again, involved in a lot of those pieces that are long-term strategy. And as they both said, every day is different. And then I think the way the three of us grieve and hold this is, every single person holds this is different. I'll have a day where I'll say to my partner, “I love you so much. You need to not be in the house today because I need to grieve really loudly and really messily and not have anybody around. So I just need two or three hours. Just leave and then come back and I'll be able to grieve with you.”

So I think we're all noticing moment by moment. And I'll say one of the things I feel fierce about is supporting those beloveds who are holding so much. Everybody is holding so much. It's amazing. And there are some people who are pivotal holding so much, is that they get the chance to break. Because we know that from the uprising from all the different places that usually the folks who are holding lots aren't the ones who go and ask for care until it's super late. Thank God for everybody who goes to those care circles. So awesome. But I'm feeling a particular ferocity about those who are leading us in 101 non-hierarchical, highly relational, deeply humble ways.

KH: Thank you so much for that, Raffo. What you're saying makes me think about how seriously I saw people taking trauma, and the need for healing spaces, here in Chicago, during Midway Blitz, and how important that felt. It honestly felt like a really important sign of progress in our movements, and it was definitely needed. I am grateful to everyone who organized somatic healing and PTSD prevention workshops, and to the folks who attend Understory, the spiritual and emotional support group for activists that I've co-facilitated for the last couple of years. I don't know how I would have navigated those months without that wonderful group of people. So, I am so grateful to everyone who is organizing space for healing, and everyone who is taking seriously the need to participate in those spaces, because this is all part of how we're going to survive together — and as Mariame [Kaba] says, we can only survive together. 

Now, I want to circle back to something that came up earlier in our conversation: the legacy of the 2020 uprisings. We've heard a lot about how the protests following the murder of George Floyd created networks that have been reactivated during the current crisis. Can you talk a bit about the connections between 2020 and this moment, including the uprisings and the mutual aid that sprung up during that time and other organizing legacies or traditions that you feel have been important?

Jordan: Yeah, I can go first. I kept going back to the word “rigor.” Rigor, rigor. So I met a lot of my political home during the 2020 uprisings. 

I think that spring and summer of 2020 built a lot of my organizing toolbox around this thing of longevity and rigor. And I think we're seeing, I feel like the ripples of that now because I think Andrew said this and Raffo said this too, neighbors are showing up that we've never seen show up before. It's almost like a given. It's very default. They're like, “Of course we're going to show up.” There's a lot of Know Your Rights that Andrew actually leads. I feel like y'all, I've been hearing a lot of people showing up over 600, 500 people just showing up. And to me, that's incredible. That's a blueprint of, of course I'm going to show up.

People also started, I think, craving community. There was this like, “Let's not outsource our safety so much to these elected officials that we have no relationships with, but let's actually rely on each other.” And that was a lot of what I heard actually from REP. That was a language that came from REP in the early days of, how do we not outsource our safety to someone we have no relationship with? And to me, neighbors seems like the most very basic answer.

I think in crisis, seeing people not even blink twice and just show up. When people were being dismissed at Roosevelt High School, which had a tear gas situation about a week and a half [ago], people were out there. People were out there doing patrolling beforehand. And then when the actual kidnapping and just fearmongering was happening, people were still there. People just showed up because they knew that something was going to go down.

So just even the mere fact of people just showing up, and I think that is all a ripple and a blueprint of 2020. And also, I think people just even being able to reach out without knowing who is going to reach back in is such something that I've also seen a lot. People saying like, “We're about to have a dismissal at this school. We're not sure who's around. Can you send a few folks?” It's incredible just people just show up even at the schools that their kids are not going to, but they just show up because they're like, “This is something that I must do because I live in Corcoran, I live in Phillips.” And so that's something that I've witnessed is I definitely think it's built up definitely pre-2020, but 2020 for me was a moment of, it cemented a lot of that, I think, structure of care.

Andrew: Yeah. This isn't baby's first uprising in Minneapolis and we have had some chances to practice over time. And I think in the tradition of the American Indian Movement, the AIM patrols that would patrol South Minneapolis, now we have rapid response ICE watch patrols that are out on the streets of South Minneapolis.

In 2020, during the height of things, the Minneapolis Fire Department and Police Department would not respond to any 911 calls in South Minneapolis. And so the neighborhoods came together in one of our main parks and we chose our geographies and we said, “These are your neighbors. Go back to your blocks and say, ‘This is the plan.'” And then there was a group of people who were committed to breaking the curfew and saying, “Hey, if there is an emergency, this is how you contact us and we will come to you.”

And then REP, which I know Susan has been part of and co-founded, added that and then continued it. And there was a phone line where we have a sense of we do call each other when there's emergencies, we do turn out. And now, here we are in another state of emergency and the need for community togetherness. And there's sort of like this muscle memory and practice that of course we would do this. Of course, we would come together and just do this ourselves because we know that that is the only thing that we can count on in this moment is whatever we put into motion.

And in the same way, we're not confused. The initial story, official story, of George Floyd being killed was he suffered a medical emergency. No one is confused that the first thing is a lie. No one is confused if the Vances and the Stephen Millers and the Trumps and the Kristi Noems come out and say whatever wild thing they're going to do to spin things, no one in Minneapolis is going to buy any of that.

We've already seen it all play out. We know how that works. And so we also know what we have to do, and that is show the world that what actually happened is drastically different. That our neighbors, our family members, our children are being harmed. Go out and repeat that over and over again as much as we can so that more and more people can join us, more and more people can have that change in view and they see what the truth is, and then we practice.

We practice with each other based on our relationships, our longtime relationships, and then we start to practice with all the other folks that want to come join us. And we have a certain, I'm not sure what you would call it, but we have this way of saying, “Yeah, welcome. We really missed you, but we know that we need each other right now. So come on home, come join us. This is what we're doing together.” And it's been amazing.

SR: Where Andrew was going was where my brain was going, so I wanted to come in right away after his words because there's structural stuff for sure. Places like REP and other kinds of places have kept alive over the last five years, this concept of rapid response of turning towards each other in small ways, but in significant ways. Because Minneapolis and St. Paul, but Minneapolis in particular really is a series of small towns within a city where everybody kind of knows each other's small towns. That's true of a lot of cities, but not all cities.

But there's something about … I'm hearing this from, in particular right now, faith leaders who are working with congregations who in 2020, where they were willing to stretch because they were first going, “Oh, abolition. Oh, uprising, this is intense.” So they were catching up because they'd never seen themselves as people who would do direct action and take those risks.

Well, that's now in their imagination. So it was much easier to step forward five years later because they've already practiced seeing themself in that role. And so there's a lot of people who for different reasons have already been … And things have happened between 2020 to now that carries the opportunity to imagine, Trump's second administration just being one of them.

So there's a piece about imagination, but I also want to honor the wisdom of the long-term organizers who were heavily involved in 2020. In 2020, sometimes, however much we don't want to be those people, we did fight with each other over how abolitionist people were. Is that sometimes we struggled to trust each other in different elements, not in the first couple of weeks when it was really hot, but after those first couple of weeks. We were precious. There were chunks of us that were just being super precious. I have not seen that at all. At all. 

So some of the practice, which to me is holding that contradiction of “we have got this together and we might not be fully aligned in all of these other things. And at one point I want to have those conversations with you. And right now we are showing up because we have each other's back.” The capacity to hold both of those things rather than needing somebody to fit really clearly in a particular story of alignment. I think that's a wisdom that these last five years have brought into the cities that, in particularly, I feel really proud of, because I think that opens the space for the people who are just imagining themselves at this level of resistance to truly come in and be welcomed. Massive hats off to long-term organizers right now as well.

KH: I really appreciate what you're saying, Raffo, about being less precious this time around. I think it's so important, and it's something I've seen in Chicago as well. Over the years, I think many of us have participated in conflicts over whether people were, in our estimation, really down for the struggle — and some of those conflicts just weren't helpful. I think we're doing a much better job in this moment of basing our judgment about whether someone is down for the struggle on what they are showing up to do. And a whole lot of people, including people I never would have expected, are showing up to create as much safety and justice as they can, without involving cops, and that is abolitionist work — whatever people call themselves. And I think more and more of our leftist co-strugglers are recognizing that what people are doing by showing up in that way is much more important than how they talk about it, and that political transformation, if it happens for people, is much more likely to occur in the process of waging struggle, than the process of arguing about it. 

So, we've been talking a bit about what this looks like from the inside, for people who've been engaged in organizing for some time. Let's zoom out a bit and talk about how this crisis is being presented at the national level. What do you think the media is failing to capture about what's happening on the ground in Minneapolis right now?

Jordan: Oh my God, I have so much. So one of my big things that I do outside of organizing, maybe with organizing, is archivism work. And so I feel like podcasting is also a type of archivism work, so I appreciate a lot of what you do. But I think the media has a lot of this language of like, “Whoa, I can't believe Minnesota does this, or I can't believe things like this happened.”

There's a lot of surprise and awe around as if there's not a lineage of resistance that has been built by Black folks and Indigenous folks for the last many, many, many years before I was born, before any of us were born, probably. And so I just feel like that is one of the things that I feel incredibly like, “Well, I don't know if you've actually read up or even….”

And I mean, it's very strategic. The media frames things in the way that it does because the narrative needs to be built in a specific way. So that really bothers me. Also, it's really, really cold in Minnesota right now. People are outside in this… two days ago was -22 degrees. I saw my friend's beard freeze. Yeah, our eyebrows… and my glasses were so fogged up. It's very cold and people are still outside. Some people don't have cars. I don't have a car. We do just walking patrolling. 

A lot of these people are not organizers. I don't even know what an organizer is at this point, but it's people that are just showing up. And so there's also missing that. There's also a lot of fear. There's so much rage and anger, but I feel like anger is always framed as this negative thing in the media like, there's this purity conversation that's happening.

Even I think with Alex [Pretti] and with Renee [Good], there's this trying to present them as these people that are incredible. They don't deserve this. Nobody deserves this. Nobody deserves to be assassinated. 

I also think that there's a lot of dismemory. I learned this from a mentor of mine. In real time, there is a dismemory like this actually didn't happen. There's a fragmentation of what is real. A lot of people are planting doubts in people's mind [about] what we are seeing with our eyes. It also doesn't help that there's so much AI reproduction and using those specific texts to produce a specific narrative of who is on the streets, how are they reacting? 

So memory is being suppressed in real time and really confusing the masses, especially for folks that are not politically engaged or may not have the context of what's happening. So that, all of that is very scary. And that's why it's really important to have these alternative medias that are not mainstream to shape some of these stories of lineage-based work that's been happening for a while. And there's also a lot of nuances and context that are not addressed in mainstream media that loves black and white framing of things. So I would say it's missing a lot.

Andrew: I think the thing that stands out to me is the obsession actually on some level with the rapid response groups and what plays out on the streets of Minneapolis when what is happening, the fundamental policy of family separation of taking children from their parents, of an entire community that is being terrorized and hidden and in hiding, I think it makes probably in this moment, strategic sense that those stories aren't at the forefront because our people are hidden, our people are scared.

But the rapid responders are only part of the story. They're not the main character. There is incredible work happening right now behind the scenes. It's like a whole underground railroad conditions that we're operating in right now where immigrant communities set the groundwork because they knew that this was coming. They absolutely saw this and a bunch of us, a bunch of rapid response folks are catching up to the conditions that we find ourselves in. But the amount of mutual aid that moves on the ground through relationships and family networks and schools and your kid goes to school with this other person, and all of a sudden that white parent is coordinating 27 rides to school the next day. It's just like the immensity of love that is pouring forth in tactically hidden ways. Of course, the media is going to miss that story. And that is at least as inspiring, if not more inspiring, that we will show up for each other in every single way possible day after day and build the same kind of systems of care and support that are going into the rapid response realm.

RS: I really appreciated Jordan naming the alternative media that's coming in. I do want to say one thing about… Because I know this happened in Chicago, the hundreds of influencers, podcasters flocking to the Twin Cities. There's some where I'm like, thank God. Occasionally there are people who operate with humility when they come in, where they actually take the time to really learn about who the people are, what is really happening, what's the history behind this moment. But my goodness, the number of people flocking in for their two minutes of fame, this happened during the [2020] uprising, but it's like that on steroids. It's so much more than I've ever seen.

And this is a media moment, but it is a place where so many of us are getting our information from there because we don't trust the mainstream media anymore for very good reason where the story focuses on what's happening in Minnesota, so it's a protest. There's moments of protest, but this whole arcing thing is not a protest. This is about people caring for each other. This is about surviving. This is about resisting occupation where there are multiple strategies. Protest is one of them, feeding each other is another one, on-the-ground health care is another one. And every single helping infrastructure right now, teachers, social workers, nurses, doctors has a complete and total shadow ecosystem where they are taking care of people on the ground in ways that the structures don't allow. That's everywhere. And that's not protest, that's living. That's living in the ways that we're supposed to live and take care of each other.

And unfortunately, the folks flocking in who sometimes are doing citizen journalism on the ground “unedited” are often as much a part of the inflammation as they are a part of the storytelling. My appreciation for “Movement Memos” reaching out to somebody who you know and saying, “Who do you know on the ground who can have a conversation?” And then thinking thoughtfully about how that should be done. I'm so grateful for that because the respect in that action is one that if I had a magic wand, I'd be like, “Thank you for your phones, outsiders. Can you bring in a level of respect and care for the local people who you are filming?” Because we need that to be woven through your witness as much as the fact that you are wearing a bulletproof vest and you're putting yourself in front of pepper spray.

[musical interlude]

KH: Raffo, you've shared some really thoughtful reflections on social media about the social fabric of solidarity and mutual support that's become more visible and stronger in Minneapolis during this time. I'd love to hear from each of you about that infrastructure: what it represents, what it looks and feels like on the ground, and what it means for our collective efforts to get free.

SR: I just suddenly feel really emotional. In moments of high activation like this, it is so clear that there is so much to do and there is no ending in how much there is to do. And sometimes what we don't have… I don't know if we don't have as much time for, depending on who your people are, depending on how you are culturally shaped, depending on whether or not you have access to family memory about times like these, maybe you have this, but for people for whom what is happening right now is “not their normal,” there isn't always as much thoughtfulness about what we do as also about who we are, that we are not just responding to a moment. This is about actually remembering what our ancestors have always known and what at its core is the only way that we actually survive. We are all always interconnected. That is the core truth. I think both Jordan and Andrew have spoken to that in multiple different ways. It is always here, whether we are feeling it, witnessing it, nourishing it, remembering it, claiming it, deepening it, whether we do that or not, it is just always here.

And so there's a moment like this where the fact of that… Because, as both of my comrades have said, the police and the fire department are gone. People cannot leave their houses. It's not safe. Children cannot go to school. Folks are showing up. That is not just about crisis, that is how we take care of each other in ways that are intimate and relational. And it goes directly against the strategies of colonization, of racial capitalism, et cetera, to remember this, to be this, who we are meant to be.

What I am so curious about… And curious, it's such an abstract, distancing word. I'm going to use the word curious because I'll start sobbing. What I fear so fiercely in each moment here is stopping violence every moment that we can. That is what we are here… We are stopping violence. But woven through that is that every moment is also something that can arc to imagining and building something that is longer term that is just a different normal.

This is the story of who we are, which is why your question about the media was like, what protest? Yes, abso-god-damn-lutely, lots of moments of protest, but also can you see the resistance and the remembering? Something that, for far more of our history, this is who we were. It's such a blip, this separated individualized isolation. And depending on who your people are, you're probably turning around to everybody else and saying, “It's about bloody time you remembered.” Because of course, depending on who you are, this is still how you live.

It's like I cannot honor the deaths that we've witnessed, the kidnappings we've witnessed, and say, “Oh God, what an opportunity this is,” because who the hell wants this to be happening? But as it is happening, there are things here that are more up than about this moment. There are things here that give us a… I'll stop there. I think I've already said myself. I'm now repeating myself, so I'll just stop there and hand off to somebody else. Thanks, Kelly.

Jordan: I'll jump on that briefly. Yeah. For me, this moment is also about more than this moment. I have a favorite thing that I always say, and it's informed by someone I love in community. It's that it didn't start with us, it doesn't end with us. And I think it sounds very nihilistic when you hear it, but I think it's a very grounding way of thinking about ancestral knowledge. And also, I don't know, our place and our role in what we're doing. I think for me, it's always been outside of crisis, outside of emergencies — I think the care infrastructure has never been a choice because it's something that has helped my family for generations and generations survive, whether that's economically, whether that is to hop from one country to another, whether it is lived through a very hard time, let me just say.

And so I think my biggest objective has always been I think what any empire that is trying to destroy our dignity, what they want is isolation, what they want is so we don't turn toward each other. The infrastructure and the collective thing for me is who are the people I can turn to within my life relationally, my loved ones? Who are the people that may need me? And I think that itself gives a lot of purpose. It's anchoring in a lot of ways. It lets me see outside of this moment. I don't feel apathetic or complacent, and to me, that is because of those infrastructures that have been built long before I was born. And so I have to be like, okay, what's next? But also, are we all good? Have you been fed? And that's, I guess, the point.

Andrew: It just becomes so clear in these moments that the dominant culture and narrative makes absolutely no sense in the slightest. And when everything's shaken up and you can't depend on all of your comforts and conveniences and there's troops rolling down your block, there's an ability to think differently. There's a collective consciousness that emerges where we would do what any community would do if they are under occupation, if their children are being stolen, if there are violent shock troops on the street is we would show up. We would try to stop that. We would take care of each other. And it's just so brilliantly simple and beautiful to be able to step outside of the thing that we know is happening anyway, which is, on a planetary scale, us being on a suicidal path if we continue to do the things that we have done for way too long and take and take and take.

It hearkens back to the George Floyd uprising. It's like what the right wing would want you to believe is that what would happen in these moments of trauma is that all the preppers would go into their bunkers and shoot at each other, and exactly the opposite thing happens. And now we have so many lived experiences and practices around that. No, of course not. What happens is we feed each other. What happens is we make sure if someone's face is covered with tear gas, we walk them away. We take care of them and we rinse out their eyes, and then we go back again for the next person. What happens when a baby's taken is we show the fuck up and we take care of the family and we do whatever it is we need to do to bring that young one home. This is just who we are as a people. We are becoming the people that we always knew that we needed to be. We are creating the community that we have always known that we've needed. We have lineages of this. There has been a lot of forgetting, but here we are remembering day after day.

KH: Thank you all so much for that. Those are words that I'm going to be holding close for quite a while. 

As we bring things to a close, I want to ask what lessons or learnings you've taken from other cities that have been targeted by ICE, and what you hope to extend to people in cities that are currently preparing or thinking through their responses.

SR: Portland, Oregon, humor. Thank God for the humor that came out of Portland. Chicago, God, the trainings that people brought here in November and December completely set us going as our trainings were still emerging and et cetera. I want to say those just right away. Those come to mind right away.

I've been talking to people in Maine right now, as many other folks have, and about what is replicable across to Maine. And I feel like so much of the last question you asked us about care is mostly how I'm responding to that. If there's people we want to talk to about rapid response and all the rest of it, there are people to talk to, but really frontlining care as part of it, making sure that folks feel and remember that and also the story as all three of us have talked about, that this is, at its core, something that extends beyond however long it takes at that other moment. And I suppose the other piece I'd say is LA, just the scale of it is that they were also one of the early scale ones. But humor from Portland, Midwestern pragmatic brilliance from the training from Chicago is how I'd answer that right away.

Jordan: Oh my God, so much badass stuff is happening. I was on a call in early November with folks from Chicago. And I lived in Chicago for a little bit, but I was just like… I don't know. It was very humbling, but also incredibly inspiring. They prophesied what was going to happen in that call. They talked about exactly how to set up for it. It was incredible.

I have also some family that has been impacted in LA, and I have a few folks that are organizers in San Francisco specifically that have been talking about and taking notes from what's been the infrastructure that's been emerging and has been emerging in LA, a lot of know your rights. But that's been happening even before the last four or five years in Boston and New York. I've been on calls with organizers from there, and let me just say, I feel like there's such discipline and also a very clear emphasis on sustainability and longevity and exactly what we've been talking about today. And I think one of the calls, I heard a lot of people talking about tapping into your neighborhood outside of crisis. I was like, “Yes, absolutely.”

I think also just disseminating that even more and just saying I think there is such a hard truth and a lot of people in Minneapolis know their neighbors generally, but there's also a lot of people that don't know their neighbors. And I have a lot of loved ones that have come up to me, and they're like, “I don't know my neighbor. Do I just knock? Are they going to be thinking it's weird or something?” And I think the power of failure is always great to just, if you knock and someone doesn't want to talk to you, try again or find a different way to contact with them; maybe send a note or something.

But I think the biggest thing is that isolation is a tool of this empire, and it makes us think we're so powerless and we are so … like nobody can understand you. You're the only one. There's this specialness and preciousness that comes with it. But I think from the calls that I've been in and from really people that have been in this work for a very long time, I've been hearing tap in with your people. That's been the takeaway for me, but also I think for people that I would recommend, your city is next, but do you know your neighbors? Can you name three people in your block? I feel like that feels like feasible takeaways.

Andrew: LA, DC, Chicago, North Carolina, Portland, we have benefited from all of those people who have practiced before us and been so generous with their time and energy. And we're cursed and so benefiting from this age of Zoom and Signal calls. And you can just reach out in a minute and adapt. You can learn from the people who have been doing this. We owe so much to our siblings, brothers, and sisters in Chicago.

What is happening right now in Minneapolis would not be possible without the lessons that came out of urban Chicago, our Midwest sweet ones and fam. And in terms of passing that on, we're still in the middle of it; we are not at the end of it yet. But it is so clear that everyone needs to be preparing for this type of acceleration across the country. They have billions and billions of dollars in funding, and they're not done yet. And we will do everything that we can in the place that we are right here in Minneapolis to hold that tide.

But if you don't know your neighbors, if you aren't building those systems, aren't building those connections, do it today. There's no bad time to start. And we need each other so much. And start practicing together. Get some whistles, run through scenarios. The people who are going to be your 9-1-1, who are going to be your emergency support are the ones within ear length that they can hear you calling for help or you whistling for help or they can hear the… You push the button on your car alarm, and that means everyone in your neighborhood come out. These are the practices that we're building. We're recreating the community response that we wish we had always had.

And we know that in these moments of trauma, we will rise to meet the moment and we will revert back to whatever our training has been, so practice, practice, practice. Build that muscle memory. Show up for each other. Turn out and show up. Make Minneapolis spread across this entire country because we are in this together and we see you. We're so thankful for your support. And we need you to do this everywhere.

KH: I want to thank you all so much for your time and your generosity. It's an honor to learn from you and to think alongside you. I know a lot of people, including people in my city, are extending solidarity to Minneapolis right now, and I hope that love is felt. Because it is sincere, and we are with you. Thank you for joining me today and for all that you do.

SR: Thank you, Kelly.

Jordan: Thanks, Kelly.

Andrew: Thank you so much.

KH: I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I'll see you in the streets.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

MICHAEL KIMMAGE is Director of the Kennan Institute and the author of Collisions: The Origins of the War in Ukraine and the New Global Instability.

HANNA NOTTE is Director of the Eurasia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and Nonresident Senior Associate with the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

 Why Putin Isn't Thriving in Trump's Anarchic World

 Michael Kimmage and Hanna Notte

On the eve of invading Ukraine in 2022, Russia enjoyed a decent global position. It had a strong partnership with China; extensive economic ties with Europe; a working relationship, however fraught, with the United States; and an informal network of partners with which to do business. Russia dominated few countries (other than Belarus) but also had few real enemies and could exercise influence beyond its neighborhood. More than a rising or declining power, Russia was a protean power.

Then Russia invaded Ukraine. In response, Europe and the United States immediately became Moscow's adversaries. The Kremlin, having lost much of its diplomatic influence in Europe, became much more reliant on China. The war, meanwhile, has absorbed Russia's attention and virtually all of its military capacity, making it hard for Moscow to steer events farther afield. As a result, the Kremlin could do little as some of its allies, including Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, fell. The war itself has not gone particularly well, either. After four years of fighting, Ukraine remains in control of roughly 80 percent of its territory.

But Moscow is hardly prepared to cut its losses. Unless U.S. President Donald Trump can persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the fighting—an unlikely scenario—Russia will probably try harder to subjugate Ukraine, not because the battlefield decisively favors Moscow but because Putin needs to hold the line somewhere. He is poised to respond to Russia's geopolitical limits by recommitting to its war. The humanitarian catastrophe he has already inflicted on Ukraine, depriving it of heating and electricity amid freezing conditions, may soon get even worse.

Putin has long overestimated what Russian hard power alone can achieve. This problem first manifested itself in Ukraine in 2014. Having incited a revolution, Viktor Yanukovych—Ukraine's president from 2010 to 2013 and a Kremlin ally—fled the country. Putin could have responded to Yanukovych's ouster by cooperating with Yanukovych's successors. Instead, he opted for military force, invading Crimea in Ukraine's south and the Donbas in its east. Russia seized the former and established two breakaway regions in the latter, but in the process it inadvertently undermined organic pro-Russian sentiment in Ukraine. After 2014, Kyiv strengthened ties with Washington and Europe, which is exactly what Putin was hoping to prevent. In 2022, the limits of Russian hard power became even more evident. Although large military forces invaded Ukraine from several directions, they could not take its three largest cities, including the capital, and were soon pushed back along multiple axes. The Kremlin, which had banked on a quick and total victory, was stuck in a long slog.

Ukraine's successful resistance forced Russia to adapt its foreign policy. To evade export controls, Moscow procured restricted goods through intermediaries in Central Asia and the South Caucasus. It started selling much more oil to India, often at steep discounts. To sidestep U.S. and European energy sanctions, Russia cobbled together a “shadow fleet”—a mass of aging tankers that typically carry bogus insurance and use opaque business structures to hide their true owners. China became Russia's primary source of industrial goods and the biggest buyer of its fossil fuels. For Moscow, the decision to forge deeper relations with China was practical as well as strategic. The Kremlin hoped to lead the so-called global South with Beijing and to accelerate the decline of the West. Whereas China can use its massive economic clout to win favor in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, Russia can capitalize on its skills in subversion and on the former Soviet Union's positive reputation in parts of the postcolonial world.

After years of hedging in the Middle East between Iran and Israel, Russia began favoring Iran and its anti-Western partners in 2022. It tightened defense cooperation with the Islamic Republic over Israel's protestations. On several occasions in 2024, Putin rolled out the red carpet in Moscow for representatives of Hamas and the Houthis. Russia's relationship with Israel did not fully unravel—the two sides continued to coordinate their military activities to avoid clashes in Syria, for instance—but it frayed considerably.

These shifts masked a more negative and enduring reality for the Kremlin. Russia had lost much of its capacity to protect its partners and its interests beyond Ukraine. In 2023, Russian peacekeepers stood by as Azerbaijan seized the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia, Russia's traditional ally. As Israel fought and weakened the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and even Iran itself, Russia watched from the sidelines. Russia was once again a bystander when, in December 2024, local rebels swept away the Assad regime in Syria, a dynasty Moscow had been fighting for years to preserve.

In 2024, the Kremlin celebrated Trump's reelection. At the start of Trump's second term, many observers predicted that his disdain for international law, apparent embrace of spheres of influence, and affinity for what Russia calls traditional values (such as an aversion to LGBT rights) would advantage Moscow. That has not been the case. Now that the United States has embraced revisionism, Russia's inability to project power beyond Ukraine has become more obvious. In the summer of 2025, the United States joined Israel in the air campaign that damaged Iran's military and nuclear infrastructure. In January, Trump extracted Maduro in a sleek, overnight military operation that Putin could only dream of. For all his complaints about Kyiv, the U.S. president has yet to abandon Ukraine, although he has been less generous with assistance than was President Joe Biden.

Trump has also repeatedly taken the initiative in Russia's backyard. He has showered Central Asian leaders with attention and deemed himself the mediator in chief between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In January, the United States and Armenia announced an implementation framework for the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, a trade corridor in the South Caucasus. Trump has also invited Russia to join his Board of Peace, a new conflict-settlement body, without granting Russia special status. Trump expects Putin to defer to his leadership role.



Russia is hardly out of the picture regionally or globally. Moscow retains influence in the Middle East and has increased its clout in western Africa by deploying its Africa Corps, a paramilitary group, on behalf of Sahelian juntas. Russia does not rely on Iranian or Venezuelan support to prosecute its war against Ukraine. China and North Korea remain committed partners, and Russian state media has been celebrating Trump's degradation of the transatlantic alliance, most recently with his threats to take Greenland.

But Moscow has yet to gain any advantages from the tensions between Washington and European capitals. Europe is increasing its own support for Ukraine, and NATO remains a functioning institution with which Russia must reckon. Putin cannot assume that Trump's foreign policy adventurism will be confined to the Western Hemisphere and the Middle East. It could easily and suddenly make itself felt on Russia's doorstep. The year 2025 was a bad one for Russia, and 2026 may be even worse. Moscow's global position is ebbing because of Trump.

As Russia struggles to assert itself globally, Putin has become even more obsessed with Ukraine. The situation on the battlefield is sustainable for Moscow. Russia's frontlines are holding, and its forces are making gradual territorial progress, but Moscow is far from winning. Despite the flurry of Ukraine-related diplomacy, peace talks have gone nowhere. Trump's position on the war continues to oscillate. Meanwhile, Europe is discovering its agency and will not tolerate a peace plan tantamount to a Ukrainian surrender. Assisted by Europe, Kyiv will refuse to yield preemptively to Russia.

However miserable the conflict is for Russia, Putin is not in the mood to make concessions. He has reoriented the economy and structured global relationships to fight this war, which has already lasted longer than the Soviet campaign against Nazi Germany. Aware that the war's outcome will be the ultimate referendum on his presidency, he may even consider escalating, including beyond Ukraine's borders. In January, following claims that European countries had made progress on agreeing to security guarantees for Kyiv, Russia fired a type of ballistic missile at Ukraine that is nuclear-capable and has a range that violates the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which the United States quit in 2019. The missile landed 40 miles away from the Polish border.

The war may well be entering a more dangerous phase. Inspired, perhaps, by Trump's seizure of tankers linked to Russia in the Caribbean and North Atlantic, European countries are doing more to harass Russia's shadow fleet, which is already under attack from Ukrainian drones. Russia might escalate by striking Ukraine's supply routes in eastern Europe or by attacking the U.S.-owned satellites that provide targeting information to Kyiv. Putin may push harder to make Ukraine uninhabitable—to impose financial burdens on its supporters and to threaten further refugee flows into Europe—even if he can't win.

Though Europe and the United States would be wise to reestablish a coordinated process for handling the war, transatlantic friction will likely hinder such efforts. Europe should therefore step up its support for Kyiv, while readying itself for Russian escalation in and around Ukraine. Most important, U.S. and European leaders should not rush any talks to end the conflict. They must keep in mind the power their countries hold. Russia is neither invincible nor surging ahead. It is merely one of many countries disadvantaged by the anarchic world order Trump has unleashed in his second term.

 Venezuela, Iran, and the Dicey Politics of Military Intervention

 Jeffrey A. Friedman

American President Donald Trump wants to be known as the U.S. leader who ends wars—the “president of peace,” as he puts it. He campaigned in 2016 as someone who would put a stop to endless overseas entanglements and, in 2020 and 2024, as one of the few modern American leaders who didn't start a conflict. But Trump's behavior over the last year has been remarkably hawkish. Within just the last two months, he has bombed two countries and sunk multiple ships in the Caribbean. He is now massing American naval forces near Iran, which he attacked in June. And on January 3, he had American troops fly into Caracas in the dead of night, grab Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, and take them to New York City to face criminal charges.

The domestic political consequences of Trump's hawkish pivot are not yet clear. His actions in Venezuela, for instance, have drawn condemnations from Democrats and also some Republicans who embraced Trump's promise to forgo foreign wars. Polls taken shortly before and after the attack on Venezuela show that fewer than 40 percent of Americans thought the move was a good idea. But this does not mean that voters are overwhelmingly critical of the decision, either. A Reuters survey, for example, found that Americans were almost evenly divided among those who supported the attack, those who opposed it, and others who remained unsure.

History nevertheless offers some guideposts for anticipating how both the Venezuela operation and Trump's other foreign adventures will ripple through American politics and shape the president's legacy. Interventions that make U.S. presidents look strong tend to boost an administration's domestic approval—even in cases in which voters doubt the value of those actions on their merits. By contrast, when military interventions make the White House look weak and reckless, they tend to hurt. That means operations that are effective, relatively brief, and technically impressive tend to be political assets, whereas operations that drag on and incur costs without realizing key objectives become hindrances.

For Trump, the domestic consequences of his actions could therefore depend on what happens next in Venezuela and beyond. If the White House is finished attacking Caracas and the new Venezuelan government does as Washington asks, the capture of Maduro may prove politically helpful. If future interventions play out similarly, they could also work to Trump's advantage. But invasions and assaults are dangerous gambits for presidents. And Trump, perhaps emboldened by his success in Caracas, may embark on bigger, more complex, and thus more fraught operations. If he does, Americans could sour on them—and him. It is a fact that most recent American presidents have discovered, at some point or another.

U.S. political analysts often claim that ordinary voters care little about foreign policy. But scholars have found that Americans do have views about military conflicts and that public opinion tends to follow some consistent trends. Americans, for example, are more likely to support the use of force when it is designed to stop interstate aggression by other countries, as was the case with the 1990-91 Gulf War, when a U.S.-led coalition of countries pushed Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. By contrast, voters tend to be more skeptical of wars whose purpose is to change other countries' political systems. They are less supportive of interventions that Washington launches by itself, without any kind of international cooperation or approval. And they are more suspicious when a president enters a conflict without authorization from Congress, or when political elites are divided over what they think.

But the ways Americans evaluate the merits of military interventions is just one part of how these events shape presidential politics. The more important question, in many situations, is how military interventions affect presidents' personal images—and specifically whether they make presidents seem like strong leaders. President Bill Clinton's 1995 intervention in Bosnia provides a case in point. Polls consistently showed that a minority of voters supported using military force to stop Serbian atrocities in Bosnia. But Clinton's adviser, Dick Morris, believed that doing so would help the president anyway by making him seem tough. Another Clinton aide, George Stephanopolous, later recounted that Morris explicitly told Clinton he should “bomb the shit out of Serbia to look strong.” Clinton listened, striking the country and sending in thousands of American troops. And Morris was proved correct: the president's approval rating rose. Clinton, according to the journalist Bob Woodward, later mused that “while 60 percent of the public had opposed the deployment of U.S. troops to Bosnia, public approval of his foreign policy went up, not down, after he ordered the deployment.” The episode, Woodward added, caused Clinton to conclude that “toughness and decisiveness were appreciated even if people disagreed” with the substance of his choices.

For presidents to seem powerful, however, they need to do more than just launch an attack. The attack must achieve its aims. For Clinton, the strikes on Bosnia did; they forced Serbian fighters to withdraw from the city of Sarajevo. President Ronald Reagan had similar success in his 1983 invasion of Grenada, which deposed a military junta that had recently toppled and executed the country's prime minister. The political stakes in that case were low—it is doubtful that most Americans had even heard of Grenada before the United States invaded it. The risks, meanwhile, were high—hundreds of Americans attended medical school on the island, and the Grenadian regime could easily have taken them hostage. And the mission's prosecution was so sloppy that it led Congress to overhaul the Defense Department to ensure better cooperation among the different military services. But Grenada's army was such a small and weak target that the United States trounced it anyway. Reagan's approval ratings subsequently jumped. In fact, U.S. success there is generally thought to have helped restore Americans' confidence in their country's ability to use military force after the Vietnam War.



But plenty of other military interventions have dragged on and ended poorly, damaging presidents' personal images. That includes another under Clinton. The president ordered U.S. forces to Somalia in August 1993 to capture the head of the Somali National Alliance, a militia that was preventing the United States from delivering food aid that could stave off the country's famine. But Washington failed, and during the operations, Somali militias killed 19 U.S. soldiers in Mogadishu. In response, American support for the intervention in Somalia cratered, and Clinton's approval ratings fell. The issue for Clinton was not the American casualties, which were similar in number to those incurred in Grenada and the victorious 1989 invasion of Panama under U.S. President George H. W. Bush, but that the war was unsuccessful. These events are consistent with broader research showing that Americans are willing to bear substantial costs in fighting foreign wars, but only if they appear to be achieving important objectives.

The war in Afghanistan provides the most recent major example. The U.S. military suffered very few casualties in Afghanistan after President Barack Obama stopped the United States's combat mission in the country in 2014, 13 years after the initial U.S. invasion. But American involvement did not end there, and the conflict dragged on with no resolution in sight. It thus became a political albatross no president could salvage. Although Obama and Trump, in his first administration, took heat for carrying on the conflict, Americans reacted even more harshly when President Joe Biden pulled troops out in 2021. A majority of voters may have said at the time that the decision to withdraw was the right one, but the sight of Taliban forces storming Kabul as American troops fled made Biden look weak. His approval ratings quickly declined and never bounced back.

The politics of military interventions frequently shift over time. Presidents typically hold their best political cards at the start of wars, when patriotic Americans often rally around the flag—as happened during the initial years of the invasion of Afghanistan. The outset of wars is also when the White House has the greatest ability to shape public opinion, given presidents' access to the bully pulpit and the fact that journalists and opposition groups often need time to marshal independent information and construct critical narratives. Americans also tend to be awed by the sheer might of the U.S. military, which is on clearest display during an operation's opening days. But as time goes on, those advantages fade. Public support often follows close behind.

The effect that military interventions play in presidential politics, in other words, resembles that of high-sugar energy drinks. In the short run, they can deliver a useful jolt, but in the long term, they can lead to a crash. President George W. Bush, for instance, benefited from the 2003 invasion of Iraq when running for reelection in 2004. The president contrasted his pledge to “stay the course” with calls by John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee, to move toward a withdrawal, which made Kerry seem like a weak flip-flopper because he had originally voted to authorize the war. Bush and his advisers believed this contrast was one of the main reasons he won. But by the middle of Bush's second term, it was obvious to most Americans that the war was not heading in a positive direction. The president's approval ratings steadily slipped as more U.S. troops died in the never-ending conflict. Democrats retook Congress in 2006, and Bush's political standing never recovered.

Using military force to project strength thus carries both benefits and risks, and whether the tradeoff ultimately works in a president's favor depends on whether the intervention decisively achieves its stated objectives. In the case of Venezuela, it is not clear whether those conditions will be met. Trump promised to get rid of Maduro, and he did so in a dazzling display of military power. But Trump has also gestured at broader ambitions, including reshaping Venezuela's government and extracting oil revenues, which seem less likely to succeed. The president has threatened to strike again if Caracas does not comply with U.S. demands, which suggests his administration might entangle itself in a more complex, extended conflict that could fail to produce a decisive outcome. Trump, in turn, would look weak.

For now, however, Trump appears unconcerned. If anything, he seems emboldened. In addition to menacing other Latin American governments, Trump has deployed what he calls a “massive armada” to the Persian Gulf and is threatening to strike Iran if it does not cease nuclear enrichment, give up its advanced missile programs, and halt its support for militant groups. It is easy to see why Trump might be confident that this kind of swashbuckling behavior will produce the desired results. Over his five years in office, the president has built a growing track record of using overwhelming force to accomplish limited aims in ways that may have helped his political fortunes: killing the Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in 2020, degrading Tehran's nuclear reactors in 2025, and now decapitating Venezuela's government. He may well be riding the sugar high of the Venezuela operation's success.

But there is no guarantee that future military interventions will play out on similarly rapid timescales with similarly low costs. And if they don't, Trump will not only further erode his claim to being a president who opposes wars of choice. He could also sacrifice his reputation for being a strong leader—which has been one of his primary political assets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","A US House special election in New Jersey becomes a Democratic testing ground","https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/05/politics/new-jersey-11th-congressional-district-special-primary","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 12:00:46 GMT","


            A crowded primary in the New Jersey suburbs Thursday has become an early testing ground for the debates that will shape the Democratic push to retake the US House in this year's midterms.
    


            The race to replace now-Gov. Mikie Sherrill has drawn a range of candidates – local elected officials, community advocates, a former paratrooper, a former lieutenant governor and a former congressman.
    


            Democrats continue to grapple with how best to motivate their base and win back voters who've drifted away. National Democratic officials have drilled down on cost-of-living issues, while progressives and grassroots activists have criticized party leaders, arguing their opposition to President Donald Trump has been anemic.
    


            In the reliably blue 11th District, candidates have taken the latter approach. They've railed against immigration enforcement, condemned the deaths of two Minneapolis protesters shot by federal agents and bemoaned the erosion of democratic norms.
    


            Other familiar themes are at play in Thursday's Democratic primary, including the power of the Democratic establishment and the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and other well-funded outside groups.
    


            Four candidates have emerged as perceived front-runners: Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, former New Jersey Rep. Tom Malinowski, former New Jersey Working Families Alliance leader Analilia Mejia, and former Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way.
    


            “For each of those four people, I could give you a list of reasons why they will win and a list of reasons why they won't,” said Laura Matos, a New Jersey-based Democratic strategist. “It really comes down to who turns out to vote, and which candidate brings their voters out.”
    


            The rest of the field includes former paratrooper Zach Beecher; community advocate, lawyer and comedian J-L Cauvin; Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett; Cammie Croft, who worked in the Obama administration; Jeff Grayzel, a two-term mayor of Morris Township; Chatham Borough Council Member Justin Strickland; and community advocate Anna Lee Williams.
    


            Once a Republican stronghold, Democrats have held the 11th District – which includes parts of northern New Jersey's Essex, Morris and Passaic counties – since Sherrill flipped the seat in 2018. The district shifted further left in 2022 after redistricting.
    


            Whoever wins Thursday's primary will be the odds-on favorite to win the April 16 general election against the lone Republican candidate, former mayor of Randolph Township Joe Hathaway. They'll also have an edge in the June primary for a full term beginning in January.
    


            Leading into Thursday's vote, the candidates have called on their party to take on a more confrontational stance in Washington, particularly towards US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Several candidates argued the agency should be defunded.
    


            “We see what's going on out in Minnesota,” said Way, the former lieutenant governor and secretary of state. “Totally unacceptable, unconstitutional and un-American, with the ICE raids, but also trying to extort personal data off of the voter rolls.”
    


            Way noted her own fights against Republicans who sued to access New Jersey's voter data as an example of her record pushing back on the administration.
    


            Gill has pointed to his experience as both an elected official and former congressional staffer, as well as his work with his local Democratic Party, which organized a “No Kings” protest.
    


            “I think I have, at certain times, felt that we needed to be more aggressive in our pushback against what's coming out of Washington,” he said, arguing Democrats should have rejected more of Trump's political appointees.
    


            Mejia, a longtime Democratic activist who served as the national political director for independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, said she was drawn to enter the race after Democrats ended last year's government shutdown without securing an extension of the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax subsidies.
    


            “Like many Democrats in this moment, I am not only appalled at MAGA, at Trumpism, at Donald Trump's administration – their overreach, their corruption, their blatant hypocrisy – but I'm also ticked off at my own Democratic leadership,” she said.
    


            Mejia has solidified her position in the progressive lane with endorsements from Sanders, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others. But she has trailed on the money front – she's sixth in fundraising, well behind Malinowski and Gill.
    


            “What I hope we will see on Thursday, is regular, everyday voters reclaiming the drive, tone, tenor, focus of our own party,” Mejia said.
    


            Malinowski, who flipped New Jersey's 7th District during the 2018 wave but lost his 2022 reelection bid, has argued he's the only who has already pushed back on Trump in Congress. He would retain his seniority in Congress.
    


            “I think voters have been drawn to our campaign because I can credibly argue that I'll be effective on the day I'm sworn in,” he said in an interview.
    


            His background as a former congressman has been both a benefit and a minor liability. He has led the field in fundraising and has broader name recognition thanks to his years as a swing-district lawmaker. But he's also been subject to attack ads over his failure to properly disclose his stock trades while in office. United Democracy Project, a group aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, has spent more than $1.7 million on TV ads attacking Malinowski, according to AdImpact.
    


            The group has highlighted his stock trading and sought to tie him to Trump, pointing to his vote for a bipartisan 2019 omnibus spending bill that include funding for ICE. Malinowski has been vocal about what he called the agency's “unlawful and despicable” enforcement operations, and called the attack “outrageous.”
    


            “It's our goal to build the largest bipartisan pro-Israel majority in Congress,” said Patrick Dorton, a spokesperson for the United Democracy Project. “We think there are better candidates than Tom Malinowski on the US-Israel relationship in the NJ-11 race.”
    


            Gill has also laid into Malinowski over the disclosure issue, arguing the controversy contributed to his 2022 loss to Republican Tom Kean Jr. The county commissioner, who launched his own campaign outside his childhood home in the district, has also knocked Malinowski for switching districts.
    


            “I'm drawing a contrast,” Gill said. “Those are decisions that he made as a member of Congress that cost us that seat and that's why I have an issue, quite frankly, with the nature of this candidacy, where he deserted and left the people that he represented in District 7.”
    


            While in office, Malinowski described his failure to disclose his trades on time as “a matter of carelessness on my part, which I regret and take full responsibility for,” according to a report from the former Office of Congressional Ethics. The House Ethics Committee's investigation into his stock trade disclosures ended when Malinowski left office and would need to be reopened by the committee to continue.
    


            Malinowski said the attacks on stock trading Gill has raised in this race mirror those Republicans made against him in 2022. He also raised concerns about the late infusion of spending against him, prompted by AIPAC's opposition to his willingness to place conditions on aid to Israel. The former congressman previously had the group's support.
    


            “Their goal is to intimidate the Democratic Party,” he said. “If it works here, we're going to see the same play in multiple other Democratic primaries. If we stop it here, the party will be more immune.”

            Kamala Harris is relaunching — part of her social media presence.
    


            The former vice president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee on Thursday rebooted the KamalaHQ account, which has over 1 million followers on X and more than 5 million on TikTok, as just Headquarters, which in a partnership with the left-leaning People for the American Way she's calling “an online organizing project for next generation campaigning.”
    


            “Conservatives build permanent organizing infrastructure. Progressives have historically built machines that dismantle after Election Day. Headquarters is the end of that cycle,” reads a press release from the new group, which also now plans to post on Substack, YouTube and other platforms.
    


            “It's where you can go online to get the latest of what's going on, and also to meet and revisit with some of our great and courageous leaders — be they elected leaders, community leaders, civic leaders, faith leaders, young leaders. I'm really excited about it. Stay engaged, and I'll see you out there,” Harris says in a video recorded for the launch.
    


            Harris recently began a second leg of touring around her best-selling campaign memoir that is less about recounting the stories in “107 Days” and more geared to her interest in talking about what she thinks needs to happen next. Though Harris says she﻿ has stepped out of politics for the moment, she has left the door open to another presidential run.
    


            So far, Harris has been talking regularly about how both Democrats and Republicans failed people, so that, as she put it in a speech to the Democratic National Committee meeting in Los Angeles in December, “The American dream has become more of a myth than reality.”
    


            “Government is viewed as fundamentally unable to meet the needs of its people. In these and so many other ways, the people feel that the very institutions that were designed to support them have failed them,” Harris said then. “They are not wrong.”
    


            Harris will have an honorary role in Headquarters as chair emerita, with a group of advisers and operatives drawn from both her campaign alumni and People for the American Way, including her top senior adviser Kirsten Allen and Rob Flaherty, who served as deputy campaign manager for Joe Biden and then Harris in 2024. Parker Butler and Lauren Kapp, who led the KamalaHQ team in 2024, will remain involved.
    


            Harris will not have editorial oversight of the posts, according to the new group, leaving those to the advisers and People for the American Way. She will, though, continue on her book tour through the spring.

Live Updates


            • Tearful plea: “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie is pleading for her 84-year-old mother's safe return. She and her siblings responded yesterday ﻿by video to reports of alleged ransom notes, urging possible captors to provide proof their mother is alive and saying: “We are ready to listen.”
    


             • Still no suspects: Investigators believe Nancy Guthrie was taken from her home against her will, but there are no suspects yet, the sheriff's department said yesterday, warning that sharing unverified accusations or false information is “irresponsible.” The Pima County Sheriff's Department is expected to hold a news conference about the investigation at 1 p.m. ET.
    


            • Race against time: The search for Guthrie has entered a fifth day, further raising fears for her safety. Savannah Guthrie said her mother “lives in constant pain” and needs her prescription medication to survive.
    


            The sheriff of Pima County, Arizona, will hold a news conference on the Nancy Guthrie abduction investigation at 1 p.m. ET today.
    


            It will be the first time since Tuesday Sheriff Chris Nanos has held a formal briefing on the case, which is now in its fifth day.
    


            The FBI said today the sheriff's department remains the lead in the investigation, and the FBI will continue to provide any support needed in the case. Director Kash Patel is receiving personal updates from his team.
    


            A large law enforcement presence was seen at Guthrie's home Wednesday, carrying evidence bags.
    


            Wednesday evening, as hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil to pray for Nancy Guthrie's safe return, her children posted a video on social media with a simple plea: Please pray for our mother and bring her home.
    


            Speaking at times through tears, Savannah Guthrie described her mom as a strong, faithful woman and “God's precious daughter.”
    


            In her 2024 bestseller “Mostly What God Does,” Guthrie credits her parents for her religious upbringing and opens up about how her faith has helped her navigate some of the most difficult times in her life.
    


            “Psalm 23 is our secret code, God and me,” she writes of the famous scripture. “In those long, dark hours of tossing and turning … I summon my psalm in desperation.”
    


            Guthrie writes she's learned to find hope and comfort in the verse that proclaims, “though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil.”
    


            And she alluded to the scripture in her message to her mother Wednesday.
    


            “We believe and know that even in this valley, (God) is with you,” Guthrie said. “We pray without ceasing and we rejoice in advance for the day that we hold you in our arms again.”
    


            Nancy Guthrie's three children shared an emotional plea for her return in a video released yesterday. Here's a look at who the siblings are:
    


            Savannah Guthrie, the youngest of the three, is a journalist and author who has been a co-anchor of NBC's “Today” show since 2012, a year after she became the co-host of its third hour and a few years after she joined the network. She was born in Australia in 1971, before the family moved to Arizona. Holding a law degree, she also is NBC News' chief legal correspondent.
    


            Annie Guthrie is a writer and jeweler who has taught creative writing courses at the University of Arizona Poetry Center, according to the Arizona Commission on the Arts. She was written a book on jewelry design, as well as a book of poems, “The Good Dark.”
    


            The eldest sibling, Camron Guthrie, is a retired military pilot. In a 2018 social media post, Savannah noted he had taken his final flight as an F-16 pilot, had “flown for our country for 26 years,” and at the time was serving with the Vermont Air National Guard with the rank of colonel.
    


            At least three media outlets — TMZ and CNN Tucson affiliates KOLD and KGUN — received ransom notes this week demanding millions of dollars in bitcoin for Nancy Guthrie's safe return.
    


            While investigators have not verified the legitimacy of the notes, the request for bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, would not be unprecedented for kidnappers.
    


            Bitcoin and other digital currencies have long been a preferred payment method for criminals because the funds can be moved instantaneously around the globe without needing a bank as an intermediary. Bitcoin or other tokens can be sent from one anonymous digital wallet to another, making it difficult for law enforcement to identify the people behind the transfers. Vast money-laundering networks have expanded as crypto crime has grown more sophisticated, further hindering law enforcement.
    


            Physical crimes such as kidnapping involving crypto are also on the rise. Last year, there were more than 30 so-called “wrench attacks” involving crypto extortion, according to industry researcher Chainalysis, though it notes many of the crimes go unreported. One of those attacks made national news over the summer, when a 28-year-old crypto investor escaped from a luxury Manhattan apartment, accusing two men of holding him captive for weeks while he was beaten and threatened with death.
    


            With the modern proliferation of artificial intelligence tools and deepfake videos, the family of Nancy Guthrie — along with the investigators trying desperately to find her — are on high alert for possible forged messages from whoever took her.
    


            “You could imagine a really ugly scenario where someone could try to create a ransom note or a proof of life video that was AI generated,” CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter said this morning.
    


            Savannah Guthrie alluded to this in a video message released yesterday to whoever may be holding her mom.
    


            “We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated,” she said, adding the family needs proof Nancy Guthrie is alive.
    


            “What you hear Savannah saying there is whoever is holding her mom, you have to prove you're actually with her and that she is alive and she is OK,” Stelter said. “Provide us that content that's not AI generated, that can't be spoofed or faked.”
    


            CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe breaks down the video from Savannah Guthrie and her siblings pleading for their mom's safe return.
    


            “I feel like this is a fairly strong signal that they do not believe that they've had a legitimate ransom demand yet,” he says.
    


Watch here:



            Savannah Guthrie, flanked by her brother and sister, released a desperate plea Wednesday for their mom's safe return, calling out the 84-year-old woman's fragile health as she pleaded with whoever has Nancy Guthrie to contact them.
    


            “Our mom is a kind, faithful, loyal, fiercely loving woman of goodness and light. She has grandchildren that adore her and crowd around her and cover her with kisses. Her health, her heart is fragile,” Savannah said in the tearful video message.
    


            Nancy Guthrie is in “constant pain” and needs her medication to prevent suffering and to survive, her daughter said. She is without that medication, according to Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos.
    


            Nancy has a pacemaker, according to a source briefed on the investigation. She is “of great sound mind,” but has limited mobility and “couldn't walk 50 yards,” Nanos has said.
    


            “The clock is ticking here because the victim is so uniquely vulnerable due to her age, due to her physical ailments and things of that nature,” Andrew McCabe, CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former deputy director of the FBI, said Thursday. “The stress of being detained in the way she likely is, is just enormous for anyone, and particularly for … an older person like her.”
    


Correction: An earlier version of this post had the wrong age for Nancy Guthrie and misspelled Savannah Guthrie's first name.



            One of the key goals of the emotional video put out Wednesday night by Savannah Guthrie and her siblings is to find out whether purported ransom notes that have surfaced this week are authentic, a criminologist tells CNN.
    


            “That appeal was very strategic. It was a demand for proof of life,” Casey Jordan told CNN's Rahel Solomon on Thursday morning. “They are trying to figure out whether or not any of these ransom communications are legitimate.”
    


            The Pima County Sheriff's Department has said it does not have a suspect in the abduction of Nancy Guthrie and has very little physical evidence to go on, though Jordan noted investigators aren't always fully forthcoming.
    


            If clues really are that sparse, it is a sign of how elaborate the kidnapping was, she said.
    


            “It's a sophisticated, well-planned abduction,” Jordan said. “Whether the notes are from the captors or not, the bottom line is there are no footprints, there are no tire tracks, there is no video footage.”
    


            CNN's Erin Burnett speaks with KOLD anchor Mary Coleman, who describes how her station received a possible ransom note via email in connection to Nancy Guthrie's disappearance.

            An increased law enforcement presence was seen outside Nancy Guthrie's home Wednesday as detectives conducted a “follow-up” at the property and in the neighborhood, the Pima County Sheriff's Office said.
    


            Crime scene tape went up across the entire length of the property and about a dozen officers were at the scene for about two hours. They could be seen carrying evidence bags into the house and appeared to bring some of them back outside and loaded them into a vehicle, CNN's Ed Lavandera reported.
    


            The law enforcement presence, which included FBI agents, eventually cleared. Sniffing dogs were also on the scene, CNN affiliate KXNV reported.
    


            While questions swirl over why law enforcement officers returned to the scene, security experts have said it is not uncommon for detectives to return to the main location of a crime during investigations.
    


            Authorities are also looking into a possible recent trespassing that occurred near the 84-year-old's home, as well as “all other cases within a close radius” to the residence, sheriff's officials  said in an update Wednesday.
    


            Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said Nancy's daughter, ‘Today” show anchor Savannah Guthrie, “has a security team” that has been staying in touch with the sheriff's department.
    


            Nancy Guthrie's home has been turned back over to her family.
    


            As the search for Nancy Guthrie stretches into a fifth day, the stakes are getting higher for investigators racing to find the 84-year-old mother of popular “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie.



            The beloved mother and grandmother, who needs crucial medication daily, was last seen at her home in the Catalina Foothills near Tucson Saturday night. In a wrenching video shared Wednesday evening, her three children pleaded for their missing mother's safe return.
    


            As detectives continue to comb through evidence in the apparent abduction, they are also facing questions over alleged ransom notes and a deluge of rumors on social media.
    


            Here are some key questions in the investigation:
    


            Perched along the Santa Catalina Mountains, the Catalina Hills community where Nancy Guthrie lives is known for outdoor activities, not crime scene investigations.
    


            Homes in the desert community are spaced out and tucked away behind desert foliage, according to Nancy Guthrie's neighbor, Jeff Lamie, and the quality of life is, as the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show anchor Savannah Guthrie has described, “laid back and gentle.”
    


            “I like to watch the javelinas eat my plants,” Savannah Guthrie once said, referring to pig-looking animals that are often seen in the area.
    


            The family relocated to Arizona from Australia, where Savannah was born, and where Nancy's husband, Charles Guthrie, worked as a mining engineer.
    


            In 1988, Charles died of a heart attack when Savannah was just 16 years old, a moment that the anchor told NBC tore her “whole world apart.”
    


            Savannah, the youngest of three siblings, stayed in Arizona for college, attending the University of Arizona. Her sister, Annie Guthrie, didn't wander far either.
    


                    “We had a spoken or unspoken pact that on the weekends, even though we were college girls, one of us would always stay home on one of the weekend nights so that my mom wouldn't be alone,” Savannah said in 2017.  
                





            In a “Today” show segment about her Tucson roots last fall, one of many times the host featured her mom on the show, the NBC host called herself a “daughter of the desert.”
    


                    “When I go back I'm so — it's like my whole soul is home, my spirit is home, I feel my father in the wind,” Savannah said when introducing the segment. “The desert, the cactus, the animals: It's such a unique place, it's a beautiful place to visit.”
                





            Arizona's Pima County Sheriff says they are not dismissing unverified ransom notes that were sent to multiple media outlets in the Nancy Guthrie case. CNN's Ed Lavandera reports.

            Hundreds of people from the Tucson, Arizona, community gathered at a church Wednesday night for a candlelight service to pray for Nancy Guthrie's safe return, CNN affiliate KOLD reported.
    


            “What is happening is heart-wrenching and this community needed this,” Sally Shamrell, a friend of Nancy's daughter Savannah Guthrie, who helped put together the service, told KOLD.
    


            In a statement on her social media accounts Tuesday, “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie spoke of her mother's faith and asked supporters to “raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in the very moment.”
    


            After the service at St. Philip's in the Hills Episcopal Church, attendees placed candles on the altar as a symbol of the community's prayers.
    


            “It's to show that we are still hopeful, and I do believe in the power of prayer,” Guthrie family friend Cindy Klingberg told the outlet.
    


                    “We don't know her, but … we wanted to show the support that Tucson has for her in the community,” attendee Brian Salado said.
                





            As Nancy Guthrie's children make a tearful plea for her safe return, a middle-of-the-night ping from her pacemaker is providing clues about when she could have been taken from her secluded Arizona home last weekend.
    


            In a video Wednesday, Savannah Guthrie issued a response to possible ransom notes and pleaded with potential captors: “We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen. Please reach out to us.”
    


            But, the “Today” host said, the family needs proof their 84-year-old mother is alive, because “we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated.”
    


            Authorities are scheduled to address reporters at 1 p.m. ET today. Here's the latest in the investigation: 



            Investigators searching for Nancy Guthrie have encountered several key challenges in the days since the 84-year-old mother of “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie went missing, suspected of being taken from her home.
    


Here are some of the challenges:



            President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he is directing “ALL Federal Law Enforcement” to help the Guthrie family and local law enforcement in Arizona in finding Nancy Guthrie.
    


                    “I spoke with Savannah Guthrie, and let her know that I am directing ALL Federal Law Enforcement to be at the family's, and Local Law Enforcement's, complete disposal, IMMEDIATELY. We are deploying all resources to get her mother home safely,” he wrote on Truth Social.

            Inside the Grand Theatre Lumiere, one of cinema's great cathedrals in Cannes, France, Akinola Davies Jr. stood, acknowledging the applause of over 2,000 peers. The British Nigerian director had just received a commendation from the jury for his first feature, “My Father's Shadow,” a breakthrough not just for him, but for a nation.
    


            “Overwhelmed and overjoyed” was how Davies Jr. remembered the moment. He'd seen photographs of previous Cannes Film Festivals; the premieres, the awards, the standing ovations. “I don't think it ever pops into your head that's what yours will be like.”
    


            Last May, “My Father's Shadow” became the first Nigerian film to feature in the festival's official selection, planting a flag for Africa's most populous country and the world's second most prolific moviemaking nation. Nine months, many garlands and one Nigerian homecoming later, the film is releasing in cinemas in UK on February 6 and the US on February 13.
    


            A soulful, semi-autobiographical tale of paternal estrangement and loss directed by Davies Jr. and written with his brother Wale Davies, the film stars British Nigerian actor Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù (“Slow Horses”) as the titular father, who takes his two sons to Lagos in the aftermath of the 1993 Nigerian general election.
    


            The Davies brothers lost their father when they were young, a tragedy channeled into Wale Davies' screenplay, conceived over a decade ago. The story is a devastating act of wish fulfillment: a rare day of bonding between two boys and their father, subtly conveying the sacrifices he's made to support his family, and trying to impart some wisdom along the way.
    


            “I remember reading it in bed and weeping,” Davies Jr. told CNN, in one of his first interviews about the film, at Cannes last year.
    


            “When you experience loss, you just face it front on … to have a short story that considers a different perspective, and mining that loss, I found extremely emotional.”
    


            The father in their film, Folarin, was partly inspired by their own. Friends and family would share stories about their father, said Davies Jr. “It was good and bad in a way, because it's exciting to hear these stories. But equally, they had the stories and we didn't.”
    


            “The film at its core is about memory … How do you know what is memory and what was told to you? After a period of time, it all becomes enmeshed into one.”
    


            After the success of their BAFTA-nominated 2020 short film “Lizard,” the brothers received production backing to make “My Father's Shadow” from the UK, Ireland and Nigeria, including BBC Films, Element Pictures and Fatherland Productions, a company run by the Davies brothers and producer Funmbi Ogunbanwo out of Lagos.
    


            The Nigerian British coproduction was shot on location in 2024, with a predominantly Nigerian and diaspora cast and crew.
    


            Shooting in Lagos was “like climbing a mountain every day,” said Davies Jr., but the city was indispensable to the story. “I wanted to capture the essence of the city from a very grounded level,” said the director. “A lot of people see the high end, nouveau riche aspects of Lagos, but what is really the lifeblood of the city is how working-class people move and operate within (it).”
    


            The production scouted sites with old infrastructure befitting the 1993 setting, including Balogun market, the National Theatre and Apapa Amusement Park, shooting in two states and nearly a dozen and half locations.
    


            “In the film there's a line, ‘Nigeria is hard' — and it is a hard country (to film in),” said producer Rachel Dargavel of Element Pictures, Irish powerhouse producers behind “Normal People” and many of Yorgos Lanthimos' films. “There were things that would happen on a day-to-day basis (that) blew my mind. But for Funmbi and her team, that's something that they deal with when they're shooting productions.”
    


            “I don't think we would have the film we have, had I parachuted in with my European crew,” she added. “I think we would have failed.”
    


            The production involved members of the local community, said Ogunbanwo. For each location, “leave this (space) slightly better than we met it,” was the ethos, she said. “I think that gave us a certain level of access which was unprecedented,” Davies Jr. added.
    


            As accurate as the setting might've been, the film would not work without its three central performances.
    


            Spearheading the film is Dìrísù's quiet and powerful turn as the patriarch. “Folarin is not their father,” the actor stressed, referring to the Davies, though the role came with significant responsibilities.
    


            “I still wanted to honor fatherhood, and honor what it meant to be a Nigerian father, specifically in that time. The weight of expectation of being the head of your household, the main provider, and the difficulties that come with that is a really interesting conversation about masculinity — both general masculinity and African masculinity — in the film.”
    


            It was the first time the actor had worked in Nigeria. “I felt such pride in returning to the country; to be able to contribute to the cultural tapestry,” he said. “The history of Nigerian cinema is deep and rich, so to have contributed to that really edifies my sense ﻿of Nigerian-ness.”
    


            Dìrísù was paired with Chibuike Marvellous Egbo and Godwin Egbo as Folarin's sons Aki and Remi. The real-life brothers were making their screen debuts at nine and 11 years old at the time of filming. “Finding them was a feat, because we went through over 200 boys,” Ogunbanwo recalled.
    


            “We first met in rehearsals on my second or third day,” said Dìrísù, who said he inadvertently took on the role of a surrogate father off-screen during the shoot. “It's remarkable the journey they went on as performers, considering that they'd never acted before.”
    

While Nigeria has long been known for Nollywood, the industry has never had a film make it into the Cannes Film Festival's prestigious Official Selection. That changed this year with the film ""My Father's Shadow."" 


Nigeria's film debut at the Cannes Film Festival



            The family drama is set against the 1993 election, which military leader Ibrahim Babangida annulled, snatching away an expected victory for Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola of the Social Democratic Party. Civilian rule of Nigeria was put on hold.
    


            “My dad was a journalist at the time and he raced back home … turned on the TV and cried. That's not something you forget,” said Ogunbanwo.
    


            Loss permeates “My Father's Shadow,” which reckons with Nigeria's past in ways rarely seen in the nation's cinema. It is sad, serious and tender. Texturally, tonally, the film is a world away from the prevailing image of Nigeria on screen; one still largely defined by the action and melodrama of Nollywood.
    


            But times are changing. The country is going through a quiet revolution, with a growing cohort of independent filmmakers gaining traction with arthouse titles. In recent years, Nigeria accomplished a list of firsts, with films premiering in competition at festivals in Berlin, Sundance and now Cannes, each time bringing a different perspective to the big screen.
    


            The outstanding question is whether these films can find an audience back in Nigeria, a nation with few theaters and rampant piracy — obstacles to independent cinema's sustainability.
    


            “My Father's Shadow” debuted in Nigerian cinemas last September, packing screens in Lagos and Abuja.
    


            “What really took me aback was a lot of the engagement and conversation made around the film, with people speaking to their parents about what happened in '93,” said Davies Jr.
    


            “My Father's Shadow” made stops at major film festivals in Toronto, London and Busan last fall. It was submitted by the UK for best international feature film at the Academy Awards and received 12 nominations at the British Independent Film Awards (Davies Jr. won best director). At the Gotham awards in the US, Davies Jr. won best breakthrough director and Dìrísù won outstanding lead performance, and at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January, Variety magazine named Davies Jr. as a director to watch. At this month's BAFTA awards, the brothers are nominated for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer.
    


            The film also picked up awards at festivals in India, China and Morocco. Davies Jr. said he was particularly proud of the love the film has received in the Global South.
    


            The past few months have been “topsy turvy” and the accolades “wonderful,” said the director, who describes himself as “quite a sensitive person” at heart.
    


            “Fundamentally, this film has been incredible in terms of building my profile as a director,” he said.
    


            “It's been incredible at showing my crew and my team what they're capable of in the right circumstances. It's a reminder that film is not a singular undertaking, it takes a group and community. And I'm just really proud of that.”

Senators differ on Immigration and Customs Enforcement funding

Democrats are threatening to block funding for the Homeland Security Department when it expires in two weeks unless there are “dramatic changes” and “real accountability” for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement agencies who are carrying out President Donald Trump's campaign of federal immigration enforcement in Minnesota and across the country.

It's unclear if the president or enough congressional Republicans will agree to any of the Democrats' larger demands that the officers unmask and identify themselves, obtain judicial warrants in certain cases and work with local authorities, among other asks. Republicans have already pushed back.

House GOP lawmakers are demanding that some of their own priorities be added to the Homeland Security spending bill, including legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans register to vote and restrictions on sanctuary cities. There's no clear definition of sanctuary jurisdictions, but the term is generally applied to state and local governments that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Other news we're following: 








Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer was trying to pass a resolution that would have had the Senate sue the Trump administration for how it has released the case files on Jeffrey Epstein.

He took to the Senate floor to request the resolution be passed by unanimous consent, saying Attorney General Pam Bondi had failed to meet the requirements of a law passed by Congress last year that forced the release of the files. The Department of Justice last month released more than 3 million files on Epstein, but some sections were heavily redacted, others revealed the identities of victims and Democrats argue that the release doesn't amount to the complete collection of information gathered on the convicted sex offender.

“Senate Democrats are exhausting every possible avenue to force the administration to do what it's already legally required to do,” Schumer said. “Release the complete files, deliver transparency and justice finally to Epstein's victims.”

However, Sen. John Barrasso, the no. 2 ranked Republican leader, objected to the resolution. He dismissed Schumer's effort as “another reckless political stunt.”

Sen. Thom Tillis submitted a list of members of the Senate Banking Committee who indicated they didn't see criminal intent on the part of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who's been subpoenaed by the Justice Department for his testimony last June related to cost overruns of a central bank building renovation.

“I was actually a witness at the alleged scene of the crime” Tillis said, and “we didn't see a crime.”

On Wednesday Sen. Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican who leads the Senate Banking Committee, broke ranks with the Trump administration and said “ineptness or being incompetent is not a criminal act” to Fox Business.

Tillis has said he won't vote for Trump's nominee to head the Fed, Kevin Warsh, until the investigation of Powell is resolved.

The former secretary of state and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee in its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, but she's now publicly calling for the testimony to be in a public hearing rather than a closed-door deposition.

Hillary Clinton told the committee chair, Republican Rep. James Comer, on social media that, “You love to talk about transparency. There's nothing more transparent than a public hearing, cameras on.”

Comer has said he'll insist on having the depositions, scheduled at the end of the month, in private, but video taped and transcribed.

The exchange was the latest bit of acrimony between the two sides since the Oversight panel subpoenaed both Clintons in August.

Vance entered with his family part-way through the first period of the U.S. team's preliminary round game at the Milano Rho Ice Hockey Arena.

He was joined by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

The Republican leaders of the Senate and House intelligence committees have rejected a complaint that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard withheld classified information for political reasons.

Sen. Tom Cotton gave his assessment in a social media post Thursday morning, saying he agrees with the inspector general's office, which also found the report to be non-credible.

Democrats say Gabbard's office delayed handing over the complaint to Congress as required by federal law for eight months. Federal law allows intelligence officers to refer whistleblower complaints directly to Congress even when deemed non-credible, as long as the complaint raises urgent concerns.

Cotton says he believes the complaint was prompted by political opposition to Gabbard and the Trump administration. Rep. Rick Crawford, the House Intelligence chairman, has also rejected the complaint, saying he believes it was an attempt to smear Gabbard's reputation.

President Trump also posted on social media that he was directing federal authorities to help where they can as law enforcement searches for the “Today” show host's mother, who's believed to have been taken from her Arizona home against her will.

Nancy Guthrie was last seen Saturday night, when she was dropped off at her home by family after having dinner with them, the local sheriff's department said. She was reported missing about 14 hours later on Sunday after she didn't show up at a church.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, sparred on Capitol Hill during Bessent's second day of hearings with lawmakers to talk about the annual report by the Financial Stability Oversight Council.

Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, asked Bessent about Trump's recent joke that he would sue Kevin Warsh, the president's nominee to lead the Federal Reserve, if he failed to lower interest rates. She asked Bessent to commit that Trump's Fed nominee won't be sued or investigated by the Department of Justice if he doesn't cut interest rates.

“That is up to the president” Bessent responded. The two began to argue over each other as Bessent said the president was joking.

“That was supposed to be the softball!” Warren replied.

Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's comments came hours after President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke on the phone about topics that included the self-ruled island's future.

“The Taiwan-U.S. relationship is rock solid, and all cooperation projects will continue uninterrupted,” Lai told reporters during a visit to textile merchants in western Taiwan.

Xi, in his first call with Trump since November, warned the U.S. president to be “prudent” about supplying arms to the self-ruled island, according to a readout of their call provided by China's Foreign Ministry.

Taiwan is a self-ruled democracy that China claims as its own territory, to be annexed by force if necessary. Beijing prohibits all countries it has diplomatic relations with — including the U.S. — from having formal ties with Taipei.

Recalling a past trip to Iraq during his first term, Trump mused that he doesn't like to sleep during long flights.

“I don't sleep on planes. I don't like sleeping on planes,” he told the audience at the National Prayer Breakfast.

“You know,” the president added “I like looking out the window watching for missiles and enemies, actually.”

Trump also frequently spends long flights overseas talking to advisers, posting things on his social media site and frequently heading to the press cabin to answer reporters' questions.

He was talking about Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who sometimes votes against the party.

Early in his remarks Thursday, Trump turned to the topic of legislation and said Republicans will typically rally together after some finagling — all of them, he said, except for Massie.

“No matter what we do, this moron, no matter what it is,” Trump griped.

“We'll get a 100% vote except for this guy named Thomas Massie. There's something wrong with him.”

Massie, a libertarian-leaning representative, has drawn the president's ire for saying he lacked the authority to attack Iran's nuclear sites without congressional approval, voting against Trump's massive tax and spending cuts bill and fighting for the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.

Addressing the National Prayer Breakfast, the president said his past suggestions that he might not make it to heaven were actually in jest.

He blamed the media for writing his exact past words about the afterlife, suggesting his sense of irony didn't come through in the reporting.

It's a tactic Trump often uses when comments cause a stir he wasn't expecting, trying to soften them without hinting that he might have misspoken.

“I was just having fun,” Trump said of his past comments.

He added of heaven: “I really think I probably should make it. I mean, I'm not a perfect candidate, but I did a hell of a lot of good for perfect people.”

The Kremlin said Thursday it regretted the expiration of the last remaining nuclear arms pact between Russia and the United States that left no caps on the two largest atomic arsenals for the first time in more than a half-century.

Arms control experts say the termination of the New START Treaty could set the stage for an unconstrained nuclear arms race.

Russian President Vladimir Putin last year declared his readiness to stick to the treaty's limits for another year if Washington followed suit, but President Trump has been noncommittal about extending it. He's indicated he wants China to be a part of a new pact — something Beijing has rebuffed.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that Trump has made clear “in order to have true arms control in the 21st century, it's impossible to do something that doesn't include China because of their vast and rapidly growing stockpile.”

Vice President JD Vance arrived in Milan with his family Thursday, telling U.S. athletes competing in the Milan Cortina Winter Games that the competition “is one of the few things that unites the entire country.”

It's the first stop for Vance on a trip combining diplomacy and sports. He's leading President Donald Trump's delegation to the 2026 Winter Olympics and later stopping in Armenia and Azerbaijan in a show of support for a peace agreement brokered by the White House last year.

Vance, who plans to watch the U.S. women's hockey team take on the Czech Republic in a preliminary game Thursday, told athletes the trip is a highlight of his time in office. “The whole country — Democrat, Republican, independent — we're all rooting for you and we're cheering for you,” Vance said.

The weeklong trip may be one of only a few international trips Vance makes this year. Trump and his Cabinet members are taking a tighter focus on domestic issues — and domestic travel — heading into the November midterm elections, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said last month.

The U.S. and Russia have agreed to reestablish high-level military-to-military dialogue following a meeting between senior Russian and American military officials in Abu Dhabi, the United States European Command said in a statement.

The agreement was reached following meetings in Abu Dhabi between Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, Commander of U.S. European Command -- also NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe -- and senior Russian and Ukrainian military officials, the statement said.

Grynkewich was in the capital of the United Arab Emirates for talks between American, Russian and Ukrainian officials on ending the war in Ukraine. The channel “will provide a consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace,” the statement said

High-level military communication was suspended in 2021, just before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

NEW YORK (AP) — The federal agency for protecting workers' civil rights revealed Wednesday that it is investigating sportswear giant Nike for allegedly discriminating against white employees through its diversity policies.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission disclosed the investigation in a motion filed in Missouri federal court demanding that Nike fully comply with a subpoena for information. 

The EEOC sought the company's criteria for selecting employees for layoffs, how it tracks and uses worker race and ethnicity data, and information about programs which allegedly provided race-restricted mentoring, leadership, or career development opportunities, according to court documents.

In a statement, Nike said the company has worked to cooperate with the EEOC and the subpoena “feels like a surprising and unusual escalation.”

“We have shared thousands of pages of information and detailed written responses to the EEOC's inquiry and are in the process of providing additional information,” Nike said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.”

EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas has moved swiftly to target diversity and inclusion policies that she has long criticized as potentially discriminatory, tightly aligning the agency with one of President Donald Trump's top priorities.

Nike appears to be the highest profile company the EEOC has targeted with a publicly confirmed, formal anti-DEI investigation. In November, the EEOC issued a similar subpoena against financial services provider Northwestern Mutual.




“When there are compelling indications, including corporate admissions in extensive public materials, that an employer's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion-related programs may violate federal prohibitions against race discrimination or other forms of unlawful discrimination, the EEOC will take all necessary steps — including subpoena actions — to ensure the opportunity to fully and comprehensively investigate,” Lucas said in a statement. 

The disclosure comes two months after Lucas posted a social media call-out urging white men to come forward if they have experienced race or sex discrimination at work. The post urged eligible workers to reach out to the agency “as soon as possible” and referred users to the agency's fact sheet on DEI-related discrimination. 

The investigation against Nike, however, does not stem from any worker complaint against the company. Rather, Lucas filed her own complaint in May 2024 through a more rarely used tool known as a commissioner's charge, according to the court documents. Her charge came just months after America First Legal, a conservative legal group founded by top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, sent the EEOC a letter outlining complaints against Nike and urging the agency to file a commissioner's charge. 

America First Legal has flooded the EEOC with similar letters in recent years urging investigations into the DEI practices of major U.S. companies. It is unclear how many other companies the EEOC may be targeting through such commissioner's charges. The EEOC is prohibited from revealing any charge — by workers or commissioners — unless it results in fines, settlements, legal action or other such public actions.

Lucas' charge, according to court filings, was based on Nike's publicly shared information about its commitment to diversity, including statements from executives and proxy statements. The charge, for example, cited Nike's publicly stated goal in 2021 of achieving 35% representation of racial and ethnic minorities in its corporate workforce by 2025.

Many U.S. companies made similar commitments in the wake of the widespread 2020 racial justice protests that followed the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man. Companies have said such commitments are not quotas but rather goals they hoped to achieve through methods such as widening recruitment efforts and rooting out any bias during hiring process. 

Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, employers are prohibited from using race as a criteria for hiring or other employment decisions. Lucas has long warned that many companies risk crossing that line through DEI efforts that would pressure managers to make race-based decisions. 

In its statement, Nike said it follows “all applicable laws, including those that prohibit discrimination. We believe our programs and practices are consistent with those obligations and take these matters seriously.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Nude photos. The names and faces of sexual abuse victims. Bank account and Social Security numbers in full view. 

All of these things appeared in the mountain of documents released Friday by the U.S. Justice Department as part of its effort to comply with a law requiring it to open its investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein.

That law was intended to preserve important privacy protections for Epstein's victims. Their names were supposed to have been blacked out in documents. Their faces and bodies were supposed to be obscured in photos. 

Mistakes, though, have been rampant. A review by The Associated Press and other news organizations has found countless examples of sloppy, inconsistent or nonexistent redactions that have revealed sensitive private information.

A photo of one girl who was underage when she was hired to give sexualized massages to Epstein in Florida appeared in a chart of his alleged victims. Police reports with the names of several of his victims, including some who have never stepped forward to identify themselves publicly, were released with no redactions at all.

Despite the Justice Department's efforts to fix the oversights, a selfie taken by a nude female in a bathroom and another by a topless female remained on the site, their ages unknown but their faces in full view, as of Wednesday evening.

Some accusers and their lawyers called this week for the Justice Department to take down the site and appoint an independent monitor to prevent further errors.

As a rule, the AP does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted or subjected to severe abuse. We typically only identify them if they have publicly identified themselves — at a news conference or in court, for example.




A judge scheduled a hearing for Wednesday in New York on the matter, then canceled it after one of the lawyers for victims cited progress in resolving the issues. But that lawyer, Brittany Henderson, said they were still weighing “all potential avenues of recourse” to address the “permanent and irreparable” harm caused to some women. 

“The failure here is not merely technical,” she said in a statement Wednesday. “It is a failure to safeguard human beings who were promised protection by our government. Until every document is properly redacted, that failure is ongoing.” 

Annie Farmer, who said she was 16 when she was sexually assaulted by Epstein and his confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, said that while her name has previously been public, other details she'd rather be kept private, including her date of birth and phone number, were wrongly revealed in the documents.

“At this point, I'm feeling really most of all angry about the way that this unfolded,” she told NBC News. “The fact that it's been done in such a beyond careless way, where people have been endangered because of it, is really horrifying.”

The Justice Department has blamed technical or human errors on the problems and said it has taken down many of the problematic materials and is working to republish properly redacted versions. 

The task of reviewing and blacking out millions of pages of records took place in a compressed time frame. President Donald Trump signed the law requiring the disclosure of the documents on Nov. 19. That law gave the Justice Department just 30 days to release the files. It missed that deadline, in part because it said it needed more time to comply with privacy protections.

Hundreds of lawyers were pulled from their regular duties, including overseeing criminal cases, to try and complete the document review — to the point where at least one judge in New York complained that it was holding up other matters.

The database, which is posted on the Justice Department website, represents the largest release of files to date in the yearslong investigations into Epstein, who killed himself in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

Associated Press reporters analyzing the documents have so far found multiple examples of names and other personal information of potential victims revealed.

They have also found many cases of overzealous redactions. 

In one news clipping included in the file, the Justice Department apparently blacked out the name “Joseph” from a photo caption describing a Nativity scene at a California church. “A Nativity scene depicting Jesus, Mary and (REDACTED),” it said.

In an email released in the files, a dog's name appeared to have been redacted: “I spent an hour walking (REDACTED) and then another hour bathing her blow drying her and brushing her. I hope she smells better!!” the email said.

The Justice Department has said staff tasked with preparing the files for release were instructed to limit redactions only to information related to victims and their families, though in many documents the names of many other people were blacked out, including lawyers and public figures.

The Justice Department has said it intended to black out any portion of a photo showing nudity, and any photos of women that could potentially show a victim.

In some photos reviewed by The AP, those redactions did obscure women's faces, but left plenty of their bare skin exposed in a way that would likely embarrass the women anyway. Photos showed identifiable women trying on outfits in clothing store dressing rooms or lounging in bathing suits.

One set of more than 100 images of a young woman were nearly all blacked out, save for the very last image, which revealed her entire face.

NBC “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie said her family is ready to talk to people holding their mother, but they want to see proof that she is alive. Nancy Guthrie was last seen Saturday around 9:45 p.m. when she was dropped off at home by family.

A vigil was held late Wednesday for the missing mother of NBC “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie at St. Philip's in the Hills Episcopal Church in Tucson, Arizona.

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — NBC “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie sent a public message to her 84-year-old mother's kidnapper on Wednesday saying that her family is ready to talk but wants proof that she is alive.

Guthrie said in a recorded video posted on social media that her family has heard media reports about a ransom letter for Nancy Guthrie, who authorities believe was taken from her home in Arizona against her will.

“We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated,” Savannah Guthrie said while reading from a prepared statement. “We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen. Please reach out to us.”

She was last seen around 9:45 p.m. Saturday, when she was dropped off at home by family after having dinner with them, the sheriff's department said. She was reported missing midday Sunday after she didn't appear at a church. 

The family posted the message after police conducted a search in and around Nancy Guthrie's home for several hours Wednesday.

Kevin Adger, a spokesperson for the Pima County Sheriff's Department, said investigators had been at the home earlier in the week for a couple of days and then turned it back over to the family with the understanding they could go back if they needed to.

“This is a follow up investigation,” he said in reference to officials returning Wednesday.




Adger said the sheriff's department was not commenting on the video released by the family.

Multiple media organizations reported receiving purported ransom notes Tuesday that they handed over to investigators. The sheriff's department had said it was taking the notes and other tips seriously but declined to comment further.

Savannah Guthrie was at times emotional during the recording, with her voice cracking. She smiled and looked into the camera when addressing her mother directly, saying that the family was praying for her and that people were looking for her. 

“Mommy, if you are hearing this, you are a strong woman. You are God's precious daughter,” she said.

Savannah Guthrie described her mother as a “kind, faithful, loyal, fiercely loving woman of goodness and light” and said she was funny, spunky and clever. 

“Talk to her and you'll see,” she said. 

Guthrie was flanked by her sister Annie and her brother Camron who both also spoke. Annie called their mother their beacon and said they need her.

“Mamma, If you're listening, we need you to come home. We miss you,” Annie Guthrie said. 

Authorities on Wednesday offered no detailed update on their search. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos' office said detectives still were speaking with anyone who had contact with Nancy Guthrie last weekend but that no suspect or person of interest had been identified. 

Nanos suggested there was video from some cameras, though he didn't elaborate, adding: “That's all been submitted and we're doing our best with the companies that own those cameras or built those cameras.”

There were signs of forced entry at the home in the Catalina Foothills neighborhood. Guthrie has limited mobility, and officials do not believe she left on her own. A sheriff's dispatcher talking to deputies during a search Sunday indicated that she has high blood pressure, a pacemaker and heart issues, according to audio from broadcastify.com.

Jim Mason, longtime commander of a search-and-rescue posse in Maricopa County, isn't involved in the search for Guthrie but said desert terrain can make looking for missing people difficult. He said it can be hard to peer into areas that are dense with mesquite trees, cholla cactus and other desert brush.

“Some of it is so thick you can't drive through it,” Mason said.

A couple hundred people attended an evening vigil for Nancy Guthrie at a Tucson church where they heard prayers and placed lit candles on an altar. A priest prayed for God to comfort Guthrie and to bring her home to those she loves.

Afterward, Jeremy Thacker had tears in his eyes as he described the heartbreak and helplessness he was experiencing over Guthrie's disappearance. He worked with Savannah Guthrie at a local news station and they shared losing their fathers at a young age. His own sister was kidnapped when he was young.

Thacker said he knew Nancy Guthrie to be sharp, grounded and earnest.

“We're all holding our breath,” Thacker said.

On the other side of the country, Victory Church in Albany, New York, said it's offering a $25,000 reward for information that leads to finding Nancy Guthrie.

“Me and my wife, we watch Savannah every single morning. We've heard of her faith. We've heard of her mom's faith. And she's got such a sweet spirit,” Pastor Charlie Muller said.

The White House said President Donald Trump called and spoke with Savannah Guthrie on Wednesday.

“I spoke with Savannah Guthrie, and let her know that I am directing ALL Federal Law Enforcement to be at the family's, and Local Law Enforcement's, complete disposal, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “We are deploying all resources to get her mother home safely.”

For a third day, “Today” opened with Guthrie's disappearance, but Savannah Guthrie was not at the anchor's desk. NBC Sports said Tuesday that she will not be covering the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics “as she focuses on being with her family during this difficult time.”

The “Today” host grew up in Tucson, graduated from the University of Arizona and previously worked as a reporter and anchor at Tucson television station KVOA. Her parents settled in Tucson in the 1970s when she was a young child. The youngest of three siblings, she credits her mom with holding their family together after her father died of a heart attack at 49, when Savannah was just 16.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed the situation in Iran in a wide-ranging call as the U.S. administration pushes Beijing and others to further isolate Tehran.

Trump said the two leaders also discussed a broad range of other critical issues in the U.S.-China relationship, including trade and Taiwan and his plans to visit Beijing in April.

“The relationship with China, and my personal relationship with President Xi, is an extremely good one, and we both realize how important it is to keep it that way,” Trump said in a social media posting about the call.

The Chinese government, in a readout of the call, said the two leaders discussed major summits that both nations will host in the coming year that could present opportunities for them to meet. The Chinese statement, however, made no mention of Trump's expected April visit to Beijing.

Trump and Xi discussed Iran as tensions remain high between Washington and Tehran over Iran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month. The U.S. president says he's weighing taking military action against the Middle Eastern country. 

Trump is also pressing Iran to make concessions over its nuclear program, which his Republican administration says was already set back by the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites during the 12-day war Israel launched against Iran in June.




U.S. and Iranians officials said Wednesday they have agreed to hold high-level talks on Friday i n Oman. The talks had initially been slated for Turkey but were shifted to the Gulf country at Iran's insistence. A White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said the administration remains “very skeptical” that the talks will be successful but agreed to go along with the change in plans out of respect for allies in the region.

Trump announced last month that the U.S. would impose a 25% tax on imports to the United States from countries that do business with Iran. China is Iran's biggest trading partner.

Years of sanctions aimed at stopping Iran's nuclear program have left the country isolated. But Tehran still did nearly $125 billion in international trade in 2024, including $32 billion with China, $28 billion with the United Arab Emirates and $17 billion with Turkey, the World Trade Organization says.

China also made clear that it has no intention of stepping away from its long-term plans of reunification with Taiwan, a self-governing, democratic island operating independently from mainland China, though Beijing claims it as its own territory.

The Trump administration in December announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones. The move continues to draw an angry response from Beijing.

“Taiwan will never be allowed to separate from China,” the Chinese government statement said. “The U.S. must handle the issue of arms sales to Taiwan with prudence.”

Neither Trump nor the Chinese government in its statement raised whether the U.S. leader's repeated calls for a U.S. takeover of Greenland, the Arctic territory controlled by Denmark, came up during the conversation. 

Trump has made his case for the U.S. taking over the strategic island as necessary to rebuff Chinese and Russian encroachment, even as experts have repeatedly rebuffed Trump's claims of Chinese and Russian military forces lurking off Greenland's coastline. Denmark and Greenland as well as several European government leaders have pushed back against Trump's takeover calls.

Separately, Xi also spoke on Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Xi's engagement with Trump and Putin comes as the last remaining nuclear arms pact, known as the New START treaty, between Russia and the United States is set to expire Thursday, removing any caps on the two largest atomic arsenals for the first time in more than a half-century.

Trump has indicated he would like to keep limits on nuclear weapons but wants to involve China in a potential new treaty.

“I actually feel strongly that if we're going to do it, I think China should be a member of the extension,” Trump told The New York Times last month. “China should be a part of the agreement.”

The call with Xi also coincided with a ministerial meeting that the Trump administration convened in Washington with several dozen European, Asian and African nations to discuss how to rebuild global supply chains of critical minerals without Beijing.

Critical minerals are needed for everything from jet engines to smartphones. China dominates the market for those ingredients crucial to high-tech products.

“What is before all of us is an opportunity at self-reliance that we never have to rely on anybody else except for each other, for the critical minerals necessary to sustain our industries and to sustain growth,” Vice President JD Vance said at the gathering.

Xi has recently held a series of meetings with Western leaders who have sought to boost ties with China amid growing concerns about Trump's tariff policies and calls for the U.S. to take over Greenland, a Danish territory.

The disruption to global trade under Trump has made expanding trade and investment more imperative for many U.S. economic partners. Vietnam and the European Union upgraded ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership last month, two days after the EU and India announced a free-trade agreement. And Canada struck a deal last month to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products.

President Donald Trump joked during Thursday's National Prayer Breakfast that he can't sleep on planes because he's busy watching for ""missiles and enemies.""

President Donald Trump quipped during his speech at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, ""I don't sleep on planes. I don't like sleeping on planes. You know. I like looking out the window, watching for missiles and enemies, actually,"" Trump said on Thursday, drawing laughter from the crowd. 

Trump joined the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday morning, which pulls together bipartisan lawmakers, business leaders and foreign dignitaries to reflect on faith and prayer for the nation. It was the sixth time Trump has attended the event since his first administration in 2017. 

The president has long been known to avoid sleeping while flying on Air Force One. His quip about looking for missiles came as he recounted first meeting Daniel ""Raizin"" Caine, who now serves as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about defeating ISIS during his first term.

Caine told Trump that an area had been prepared for him to nap during the 20-hour journey, which Trump refused so the pair could discuss strategies to wipe out ISIS.

""I said, 'What's your first name?' ‘Raizin, sir. They call me Raizin.' And I say, ‘what the hell kind of a name is that? Right?'"" Trump joked.

""He's brutal. Just ask Venezuela. Ask Iran. They're negotiating now. They don't want to. They don't want us to hit them. You know, we have a big fleet going over to Iran. But so Razin was there at the bottom of the plane,"" he said. 

Trump continued his speech by taking a victory lap for the strength of the U.S. military under his second term, including capturing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and striking Iran's nuclear facilities.

""Two years ago, you couldn't get anybody to go into the military. They laughed at you and they said they didn't respect our country. They didn't respect our president. They thought he was a joke. They thought our country was a joke,"" Trump said.

""They declared that all of us are made free and equal by the hand of our Creator,"" Trump said of the Founding Fathers in 1776. ""A lot of presidents refuse to say that. They refuse to say that. . . . Some refuse. Some major politicians refuse to say the word ‘God.' They don't want to say it. I say it, that we are endowed with our sacred rights to life, liberty, and not by government, but by God Almighty himself.""

A fire broke out at a building attached to Lehigh Valley Hospital in Pennsylvania on Wednesday night, prompting a large emergency response and the evacuation of patients, officials said. 

The Dickson City Fire Department said in a Facebook post that it and other first-alarm companies had been dispatched to the hospital complex around 9:40 p.m.

Upon arrival, Fire Chief Richard Chowanec upgraded the response for additional units after determining the fire was burning in the roof of the original Scranton Orthopedics building, an older structure attached to the newer Lehigh Valley Hospital facility.

Officials said there was no active fire inside the main hospital building, though smoke and water damage were reported.

Police officers from across the Mid-Valley area, along with hospital staff and EMS crews, assisted in evacuating patients with support from the Lackawanna County Emergency Management Agency and Pennsylvania State Police. 

WNEP-TV 16 reported that 77 patients were transferred from the hospital to local facilities and no major injuries were reported.

The local station said crews battled the blaze as parts of the orthopedics unit collapsed before the fire was ultimately contained around 11:15 p.m.

Former SJSU volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser revealed to Fox News Digital she developed severe anorexia and sleep issues, she says was due to a national controversy over her trans teammate.

The parents of former San Jose State University volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser made their first public statement since the U.S. Department of Education determined the school violated Title IX while Slusser was enrolled. Slusser emerged as the central figure opposing the university during a 2024 scandal involving trans athlete Blaire Fleming. 

Slusser filed a lawsuit against representatives of SJSU and the Mountain West Conference after she allegedly was made to share a bedroom and changing spaces with Fleming without being told of Fleming's biological sex. The Education Department concluded that the trans athlete conspired with an opposing player to have an SJSU teammate, presumably Slusser, spiked in the face during a match. 

Slusser's parents, Paul and Kim Slusser, provided a joint statement to Fox News Digital addressing the crackdown on the university.

""We're thrilled that the Trump administration, Secretary McMahon, and the Department of Education are taking action on the issue of men in women's sports—something the last administration did not do! San Jose State University completely failed its female athletes, and it's about time they're held accountable,"" the statement read.

""We're watching closely to see how they respond, and our next step is to fight for justice in court. San Jose State and the Mountain West Conference betrayed the volleyball team, and they will have to answer for it.""

The parents had to watch their daughter endure an eating disorder and an academic setback as a result of the trauma from the scandal. 

""I went from around 160 to 128 [pounds] in that one semester. It definitely isn't healthy for someone of my size to be that weight, and I ended up losing my menstrual cycle for nine months. So it was definitely severe,"" the 5-foot-11 Slusser previously told Fox News Digital.

After the 2024 season and fall semester ended, Slusser's parents saw the physical impact the situation took on her, and demanded she come home to Texas. 

""As soon as the season was over, she came home for Christmas, and we were like, 'You're not going back,'"" Paul Slusser previously told Fox News Digital, adding that he told his daughter, ""You can go get your stuff next summer when your lease is up, and stay here.""

‘HORRIBLE' MOMENTS EXPOSED FOR UNR VOLLEYBALL PLAYERS WHEN THEY WERE ROPED INTO THE SJSU TITLE IX SCANDAL

Once winter break was over, and what was supposed to be her final semester began, Brooke attempted to complete her courses online.

Her parents said she began online classes, but dropped them shortly later. As a Division I scholarship athlete, dropping the classes resulted in her losing the scholarship, and her family had to pay for the full semester's worth of tuition and her housing out of pocket. 

""We had to pay, basically her mortgage and her apartment for the rest of the semester. So it was a pretty large financial burden on us when that happened,"" Paul Slusser said. 

The Education Department gave SJSU an ultimatum to comply with a series of agreements or risk ""imminent enforcement action."" The deadline is Feb. 11, 2026.

The terms include:

SJSU responded to the ultimatum in a statement.

""We remain committed to providing a safe, respectful, and inclusive educational environment for all students while complying with applicable laws and regulations.""

Asked if he will remove Kristi Noem as DHS secretary, President Trump on Thursday said 'No...We have the strongest border in the history of our country.'

A majority of voters say Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem should be removed from her job, according to a new national poll.

Fifty-eight percent of those questioned in a Quinnipiac University survey in the field from Jan. 29 to Feb. 2 said it's time for Noem to go, with 34% saying she should remain on the job.

The survey was conducted amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and in the wake of two fatal shootings by federal agents of U.S. citizens in Minnesota who were opposing the administration's aggressive deportation efforts.

In the immediate aftermath of the second shooting last month of Alex Pretti, who at the time was legally armed with a handgun, Noem claimed Pretti was threatening federal agents and labeled his actions ""domestic terrorism.""

But videos of the shooting depicted Pretti, an ICU nurse at a VA Hospital, appearing to attend to a woman whom agents had knocked down when he was sprayed with an irritant, pushed to the ground and beaten. On the ground, bystanders said he was brandishing a cell phone rather than his weapon, and an agent was seen pulling Pretti's gun from his waistband before other agents fired several shots and killed him.

The Trump administration has faced mounting criticism and political backlash, with some top Democrats in Congress and at least two Republican senators — Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — calling on Noem to be removed.

But Trump is standing by Noem, saying in a social media post last Friday that she ""has done a really GREAT JOB!""

And on Thursday, during remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump reiterated that he's not removing Noem. 

""Why would I do that? We have the strongest border in the history of our country. We have the best crime numbers we've ever had going back to the year 1900. That's 125 years. We have the lowest crime numbers,"" the president emphasized.

DHS SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM ADDRESSES CALLS FOR HER FIRING, NEW ALEX PRETTI VIDEO

Noem, in an interview last week on Fox News' ""Hannity,"" argued that ""radicals"" are behind the calls for her to be fired.

""These radicals are attacking me, but I'm just doing my job. I'm following the law, enforcing the laws like President Trump promised that he would do to keep people safe in this country,"" she told Fox News' host Sean Hannity.

And taking aim at Democratic leaders in Minnesota, Noem charged Wednesday in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital along the U.S.-Mexico border that ""the way that it has been in Minneapolis is largely due to the rhetoric. And the actions of the leadership there because they won't partner with the federal government to enforce the law."" 

TRUMP LAMENTS SHOOTING DEATHS OF GOOD AND PRETTI, INSISTS MINNESOTA PERSONNEL SHUFFLE IS NOT A 'PULLBACK'

The Quinnipiac poll spotlights a massive partisan divide over Noem, with 91% of Democrats and 63% of Independents but just 17% of Republicans saying she should be removed as DHS secretary.

The Quinnipiac survey also indicates a drop in the president's approval of how he's handling the immigration issue.

Trump's approval on immigration stands at 38% in the Quinnipiac poll, down from 44% in mid-December, the last time they asked the question.

The latest Fox News national poll, conducted Jan. 23–26, indicates the president's approval on handling border security at 52%-47%, but his approval on immigration is underwater at 45%-55%.

The Trump administration on Wednesday announced it was removing 700 of the roughly 3,000 federal immigration agents in Minnesota.

And Trump, in an NBC News interview, said immigration agents should be using a ""softer touch.""

""I learned that maybe we could use a little bit of a softer touch,"" Trump said. ""But you still have to be tough.""

The Trump administration's decision to create a national stockpile of critical minerals is long overdue and strategically essential. Critical minerals underpin the modern economy and are at the center of America's competition with China. Washington must safeguard its supply of strategic minerals and prevent Beijing from gaining a stranglehold on them.

On Feb. 2, the White House announced “Project Vault,” a $12 billion effort to build a national reserve of critical minerals such as cobalt and gallium. About $1.7 billion will come from private seed funding, with the remainder backed by the United States government's Export-Import Bank.

It is money well spent.

Project Vault is necessary and innovative. The U.S. has long had a strategic oil reserve, so it makes sense to have the same for critical minerals.

China, America's foremost foe, dominates the critical minerals sector. In recent years, an estimated 70% of these vital substances come from China. Last year, the figure shot up to 80%. This potentially gives Beijing the ability to bring the U.S. economy to its knees.

Critical minerals are what keep the modern economy going. They power cellphones, car engines, missile guidance systems, and much else. They are key components in fields as varied as agriculture, defense, electronics, transportation, energy, and manufacturing, among others. The need for them is projected to keep growing, according to a 2025 report by the U.S. Congressional Research Service.

Their importance creates an important supply chain vulnerability that China can be counted on to exploit. For years, the Chinese Communist Party has successfully sought to dominate this key sector. And until recently, the U.S. has been snoozing — in former President Joe Biden's case, literally — through the threat. The Trump administration has recognized the danger.

“For years, American businesses have risked running out of critical minerals during market disruptions,” Trump said during Operation Vault's rollout, adding it is incumbent upon policymakers to “ensure that American businesses and workers are never harmed by any shortage. We are now creating this reserve so we don't have any problems.”

Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered the People's Liberation Army to be ready to take Taiwan by 2027, according to U.S. military assessments. A conflict in the Taiwan Strait would instantly test America's industrial resilience, and Beijing would not hesitate to use its minerals leverage against any country that resists its ambitions.

China has used its industrial dominance as a cudgel against the West, threatening everyone from tiny Lithuania to major corporations like the National Basketball Association. Without shoring up its capabilities quickly, the U.S. would find itself in a bind, with defense and other industries dependent on the nation seeking to supplant America as the world's sole superpower.

The U.S. let its position deteriorate badly, and the question of who is to blame needs to be vitiated. But action is required for the future, and action is now being taken.

“Other presidents did a lot of talking,” Trump noted. “But they didn't do anything.” 

DEAR DEMOCRATS, ENFORCING IMMIGRATION LAW ISN'T FASCISM

He's right. In 2017, one of Trump's first initiatives was to sign Executive Order 13187, which directed federal agencies to strengthen mineral security. The Energy Act of 2020, signed into law during the last year of Trump's first term, ordered the list of critical minerals to be reviewed every three years.

Precious time has been wasted. The largest police state in history has been preparing, marshaling its means to wage an economic war against  America. It is past time for America to fight back. The critical mineral reserve is one way of doing so.

Julie Le, a lawyer listed in public records as working for the Department of Homeland Security, had been temporarily assigned to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota to assist with immigration cases. An official familiar with the matter told a local NBC affiliate Wednesday that Le's detail ended following those remarks she made during a court hearing in Minneapolis.

Le expressed frustration during a Tuesday immigration hearing before U.S. District Judge Jerry Blackwell, as the Trump administration continues a sweeping immigration enforcement operation in the state.

“The system sucks. This job sucks. I wish you could hold me in contempt so that I could get 24 hours of sleep,” Le said, according to reporting by NBC affiliate KARE.

Le reportedly commented inside the court hearing that it was like “pulling teeth” to get DHS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Justice Department to comply with court orders.

In a written order issued this week, Blackwell described the government's conduct as “alarming,” noting that “persistent noncompliance with orders in this District was extensively detailed just last week.” He cited a recent notice from Chief U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz, a George W. Bush appointee, who wrote that his “patience is at an end” and outlined what he said were 96 court orders in 74 immigration detention cases in which he claims the government failed to follow court orders.

The Trump administration has said that, per the Immigration Nationality Act, it may treat many cases involving illegal immigrants as mandatory detention under § 235(b) rather than bond-eligible § 236(a), leading to hundreds of habeas corpus petitions from lawyers for the illegal immigrants challenging the legality of indefinite, no-bond detention.

Meanwhile, independent reporting by Julie Kelly has suggested that Schiltz may not have accurately counted the cases he claimed reflected defiance by the Trump administration.

“I truly hope the DOJ calls Schlitz out for these blatant misrepresentations,” Kelly wrote on X. “It is clear he did not check his work, simply compiled a list either based on staff input or these judges themselves (I suspect the latter).”

The Washington Examiner asked a representative from Schiltz's chambers whether he has full confidence in the accuracy of Schiltz's tally of order violations. The representative responded, saying the judge “cannot comment about orders in ongoing cases.”

During Tuesday's hearing, Le told Blackwell that “it takes 10 emails from me for a release condition to be corrected” and that she had to threaten to walk out for other issues to be addressed, according to KARE. She also said she did not feel properly trained for the role she was filling.

A Washington Examiner review of federal court records found that Le had been assigned 89 cases as of Feb. 3.

Le's reassignment also comes as the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota faces acute staffing shortages, an issue the Washington Examiner reported earlier this week. 

The office has struggled to retain career prosecutors and support staff in recent months, forcing the DOJ to detail attorneys from other agencies and surge temporary personnel into the district to keep cases moving.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The paper of record for the nation's capital cut a third of its staff this week. It didn't have to be like this.

In the first blush of their relationship, The Washington Post and Jeff Bezos seemed like an excellent match. Here was a paper with a strong pedigree that had fallen on somewhat hard times, and a suitor with funds who seemed eager to return it to steady glory. In 2013 Bezos purchased the paper for $250 million from the Graham family and promised a “golden era” to come. I had left the Post by then but was happy for my former colleagues. When Donald Trump took office a few years later, it was a relief to know that a journalistic institution with a record of holding White House misdeeds to account was still close by.

Yesterday, in a dismal morning Zoom call, the Post's executive editor, Matt Murray, announced that they were laying off one-third of its already diminished staff. The follow-up email had the tone of robotic obfuscation that any decent editor would have rewritten. (“Following up on today's communication, I'm writing to share the difficult news that your position is eliminated as part of today's organizational changes.”) It's of course painful, as a journalist, to see fellow journalists get laid off. It's painful, for anyone alert to the moment, to know that one of the last remaining expert watchdogs is hobbled. It's maybe most painful to know it could have been avoided.

In this episode of Radio Atlantic, I spoke with Joshua Benton, the founder of and a senior writer at the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. Benton has closely watched the media business for years. He explains how the newspaper reached this point, the loss to journalism, and how the future of the Post is ultimately up to Bezos.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

Hanna Rosin: Seven years ago, around this time, The Washington Post ran an ad in the Super Bowl: “Democracy dies in darkness.” It showed scenes of fires, explosions, floods, tanks—and journalists who've risked their lives for their profession.

All with swelling music and a voice-over by Tom Hanks.

Tom Hanks (in a Washington Post commercial): Knowing helps us decide. Knowing keeps us free.

Rosin: But then just before the Super Bowl this year, the Post took a different turn. And it was not another Super Bowl ad.

Matt Murray: Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us.

Rosin: On Wednesday, Post staffers joined a Zoom call first thing in the morning. Executive editor Matt Murray spoke first.

Murray:  This meeting, for our newsroom, I wanna share that the actions we are taking include a broad strategic reset with a significant staff reduction.

Rosin: The paper would be making massive cuts: closing the Sports department …

Murray:  Unfortunately, we are grappling, and have been, with, just, major changes in the way sports news is delivered, shared, and experienced across the industry.

Rosin: Downsizing their Metro desk and International desk.

Murray: … shrinking our international footprint.

Rosin: One of their reporters based in Ukraine posted to X: “I was just laid off by The Washington Post in the middle of a warzone.”

 Murray:  We will continue to have a strategic overseas presence in close to a dozen locations …

Rosin: The entire Books department at the Post was cut.

Murray:  We'll be closing the Books section.

Rosin: A suspension of their daily news show.

Murray: And we'll be suspending the Post Reports podcast.

Rosin: Every single department would be impacted.

Murray: As I said before, these moves are painful. This is a tough day.

 Now I want to turn it over to Wayne Connell, and Wayne will be sharing more about the next steps in today's timeline.

Wayne Connell: Thank you, Matt. In the spirit of providing clarity, after our call, I will send each of you an email. The subject line will either say, “Your role is eliminated by today's workforce reductions” …

Rosin: In less than 30 minutes, a historic journalistic institution cut its staff by almost a third, after two previous rounds of punishing layoffs.

This was the home of the Watergate investigation.

Richard Nixon: Interests of the nation must always come before any personal consideration.

Rosin: Publisher of the Pentagon Papers.

Henry Kissinger: … whole file cabinets can be stolen and then made available to the press …

Rosin: Winner of dozens and dozens of Pulitzer Prizes.

Announcer: And the prize goes to The Washington Post.

Rosin: Just to break that down: a paper in the backyard of the White House and Congress that has, many times, uncovered people in power lying or grifting, or failing to do their jobs in ways that affect every single American, whether or not they live in D.C.

Not to mention all the work their reporters have done in Ukraine, and China, and the Middle East and anywhere else in the world where crisis might be brewing

I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic.

There are only a handful of mainstream national journalistic institutions left with this kind of robust infrastructure—experienced editors and reporters, photographers, foreign correspondents—who can expertly monitor people in power. Particularly at this moment in American history, when those people seem to be grifting and lying in new and elaborate ways.

Whose fault is this? Why does it matter? We talk to Joshua Benton. He's a longtime newspaper reporter and the founder of a senior writer at the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University, where he writes about the media business.

Josh, welcome to the show.

Joshua Benton: Thanks for having me.

Rosin: So you cover the media business; you have for a long time. You are not new to this kind of industry news. What was your reaction to the layoffs at the Post?

Benton: Well, there have been a lot of systemic difficulties in the newspaper business as long as I've been reporting on it. There is a large secular decline that has been brought about by the internet that has continued on without too much change. But I think the story of the Post is a very unique-to-the-Post story. It's fundamentally about one man, Jeff Bezos, and his changing vision of what the role of the owner of a major American newspaper should be.

Rosin: So you said two different things: It's Post-specific and it's also related to this giant in our culture, Jeff Bezos. I mean, I know why the news resonated with me—because I'm a journalist. I live in Washington. I worked at the Post. I have many friends there.

But I can imagine people who are not in any of those categories reading this news and thinking: Layoffs happen all the time, especially newspaper layoffs. This paper still exists, even though with less staff.

So why should they care? Why is it significant for people who don't live in Washington, aren't journalists?

Benton: Well, for one thing, The Washington Post has always been a paper whose editorial importance was not limited to the city or to the district. It's a national outlet. It's one of the two largest national newspaper outlets.

It covers the happenings in Washington, D.C. Certainly there's lots of stories to cover there. So to the extent that we have any decrease in the number of people who are paying attention to what's going on, I think that's a loss.

It's also a retrenchment from what Jeff Bezos first seemed to pledge when he first purchased the paper, in 2013, which was that he would not be looking to the newspaper as a source of money. He has enough money from lots of other sources. He did seem to take seriously the idea that he was a steward of an institution, the way that the Graham family that he purchased it from had always viewed the role of being in charge of this institution that mattered to the city and to the country.

And it's certainly true that The Washington Post has lost money and is, has declined in a number of ways financially. It's also up to Jeff Bezos whether or not he is going to support a newspaper that is going to be robust journalistically and ambitious digitally, or whether or not he has grown tired of it and decided to step back his investment in the property.

And I think what's troubling in this particular change is, you're seeing what had been an institution that had really benefited from his ownership for a good long time that seems to have gone into reverse in a way that particularly aligns with the way that the political winds in Washington have blown for the last few years.

Rosin: So it sounds like what you're saying is the reason this is significant for everybody is because how Bezos changed his mind and changed his attitude towards the paper. So can you say a little more about that? What about his change of heart is important or strikes you as important?

Benton: We saw a confluence of events in the fall of 2024 around President Trump's second election that I think were very telling. You had, in October, Bezos making a decision on behalf of the newspaper to stop endorsing candidates for president at a time that the newspaper would have certainly been expected to—and the editorial board of the newspaper had desired to—endorse Kamala Harris. Bezos put out a statement saying that actually it's an awful idea for a newspaper to endorse a presidential candidate, because it creates the perception of bias. And we need to have a newspaper that doesn't sully itself with a presidential endorsement.

Almost immediately that led to a huge negative impact to the paper's bottom line because more than 250,000 existing subscribers canceled their subscriptions, and that's the lifeblood of a modern-day media company. Not long after that, he announced that he was going to be shifting the way that the opinion pages of the paper functioned. He would potentially be eliminating most of the left-of-center perspectives in exchange for a focus on what he called “personal liberties and free markets.” He said explicitly, We will cover other issues besides personal liberties and free markets, but we will not be running any opinions that are in opposition to those.

He never really explained which personal liberties he was especially interested in, but it became pretty clear in the coming months that he was trying to shift the Post's editorial page and opinion section more to the right, more aligned with the new Trump administration. And in the middle of that, you had the instance of Jeff Bezos appearing at Trump's inauguration. You had the much-discussed, recently, purchase of the Melania Trump documentary at far-above market rates in a way that has been perceived by some to be something of a bribe.

You saw in this very short period of time a shift from the Post being an establishment—an institution—that was a potentially a powerful source of constraint on any presidential administration, but in particular this one, to the Post being perceived to be traveling along with the political winds.

Rosin: So it sounds like your analysis is very Bezos focused, because you could parse the blame for what happened on a few different places. It could be ownership—Jeff Bezos, management, just the state of the industry, the product itself. But you are focused on Bezos.

Benton: One thing that Jeff Bezos knows probably better than anyone else is that digital industries tend to focus around one big winner. I mean, Amazon.com is the perfect example of this. You went from a universe of having lots of diverse small retailers in the physical world, in malls and on main streets, to having one giant that dominates the online-retail business and doesn't allow much else to thrive outside of it in a lot of cases. That same phenomenon happens in the digital news business. It's just that, in digital news, The New York Times is Amazon.com. They are the giant that has been able to become overwhelmingly central to the way that the digital-newspaper business works. So in that context, the self-inflicted wounds that I would argue Bezos has caused the Post to suffer were particularly damaging because it was not competing from a position of strength. It was starting off from a position of relative market weakness.

Rosin: So initially we were talking about ideological factors, like a desire to curry favor with Trump, or at least not to irritate Trump. It sounds like now you're talking about more, sort of, financial reasons. I mean, that suggests that, what, he's a bad businessman?

Like, we don't think of Jeff Bezos as a bad businessman. What does that suggest?

Benton: Jeff Bezos has not historically been very involved in the management of The Washington Post. He took a very hands-off approach to management. He was not, you know, meddling in editorial decisions. He was, in a lot of ways, for the first decade or so, a pretty ideal hands-off owner for the Post who put investment into the paper, who allowed its newsroom to grow, allowed, you know, a digital-subscription strategy to thrive.

But I don't think at any point it has been a central part of where his business instincts have been focused. I wouldn't view his ownership of The Washington Post as primarily a business transaction.

I think you could look at the first portion of his ownership as something approaching a philanthropic goal. And I think you can look at the last couple of years primarily as trying to meet a political goal.

One of the side effects of the changes that he made in 2024 or 2025 is that it drove away an enormous number of talented journalists, including to places like The Atlantic. One reason that the Post has struggled editorially over the past year is that they lost a lot of their best reporters, their highest-profile reporters who were the best source in the White House, in Congress, in places where, you know, the stories that a newspaper can break that gets you attention, that proves to your subscribers the value of the subscription they're paying for.

The people who produce those stories often weren't working there anymore. And the stories that they would have been writing, breaking, that would've been proving the value of a digital subscription to the Post—they just weren't getting reported.

Rosin: So this is what—when people say a “death spiral” for news outlets where you have a shrinking business, leads to a downsized product, which leads to more shrinking business. Is that where the Post is now?

Benton: The biggest shift in the financial model of newspapers that has occurred in the transition from print to digital is a decreasing reliance on advertising and an increasing reliance on direct payments from subscribers. When newspapers had something closer to a monopoly on the distribution of information every day, they were able to charge very high advertising rates and they had mass audiences.

And it was a business that worked extremely well for them for a long time. Under the print model, an American newspaper usually made about 80 percent of its money from advertising and only about 20 percent from readers buying the paper or subscribing to the newspaper. In the shift to digital, the advertising money has largely gone away, to companies like Google and Facebook, and newspapers are increasingly reliant on subscriber revenue, especially, now, digital-subscriber revenue since that's where the audiences are.

And to succeed in a digital-subscription world, you need to convince people why they should still pay for you every month when they're also paying for Netflix and they're also paying for Amazon Prime and they're also paying for the long list of subscriptions that litter, you know, the credit-card bills of probably everyone listening to this.

That is a competitive marketplace where news organizations have a real editorial burden to prove their merits over and over again, and that means that a relatively small decision, like we're not going to endorse someone for president can have a really outsized impact because it creates, for a quarter-million people, a reason to suddenly say, You know what? It's not worth the 10 bucks a month, the 15 bucks a month that I'm paying if they're gonna be doing something that I find so much in opposition to my point of view.

Rosin: After the break: Should people have really expected anything better from Bezos? And should all those people really have canceled their subscriptions? That's in a minute.

[Break]

Rosin: In retrospect, now that I hear you talk and see how important that moment was when hundreds of thousands of people canceled their subscription, it was an act of protest, but now I feel like, were they protesting against the right thing and for the right place? It's like shooting yourself in your, you know, civic-participation foot. It just doesn't seem like they were aiming at the right target there.

Benton: Yeah, you saw at the time, when people were canceling their subscriptions, you would see on social media reporters from the Post saying: please don't cancel the Post. We understand that you may, may not like the decision that was made by our owner, but it's your money that allows us to keep operating, to allow us to still have jobs. 

So there is a real tension there. But at the same time, for me, it's very difficult to describe what happened at the Post as primarily a market-driven phenomenon.

The amount of money that the Post is losing is enormous to you or to me. To Jeff Bezos, it is nothing. His net worth in the past year has gone up enough to continue to pay for all the money that The Washington Post is losing for the rest of his life and the rest of his children's lives and the rest of his grandchildren's lives.

His wealth is at such a scale that there is no reason that a set of cuts like the one that we've seen this week is an economic necessity. It's a choice.

There are enormous negative financial things happening in the digital-news business more broadly, but I think that is distinct from what is happening to The Washington Post, because that is one man's choice fundamentally.

Rosin: And do you think that's a reasonable expectation you're making of Jeff Bezos? Like, he's a businessman, and so: Why should we expect him to behave differently than the many negligent owners of many newspapers who I'm sure you've tracked over the last decade-plus?

Benton: You know, that's a very reasonable question. I'd say the reason I would expect different is because he acted differently. The Washington Post was never a source of profit for him in any significant way.

When Bezos first bought the Post, in 2013, one way I'd thought about it was: There aren't many things that a man that wealthy and that powerful can do to change something in the first few paragraphs of his obituary. When Jeff Bezos dies he will be described as the founder of Amazon.com, who, you know, created one of the great fortunes of all time.

You know, if he takes mankind to another planet, perhaps that would show up there as well. (Laughs.)

If he had saved one of the most important journalistic institutions in America, that would be another thing that would show up in those first few paragraphs, perhaps. There are reasons for someone with that much wealth to invest in something that they think is good for society, good for civilization, good for the country.

And the way he spoke when he purchased the Post was filled with language of, I'm giving you runway. I'm not a shareholder you have to pay in the same way that a publicly held or hedge-fund-purchased newspaper company would have to.

And it was the fact that that was his stance for so long, for a decade, that makes this transition, I think, somewhat jarring to people within the Post and people who read the Post.

Rosin: So it seems like the Post was struggling when Bezos bought it, and the layoffs seem to indicate it's struggling now. But it did seem to be doing well at one point in his tenure. What made that possible, and what changed?

Benton: So our insight into the financial condition of the Bezos-era Post is really limited, because, as a privately held company, they don't have to report any numbers to shareholders or regulators. It certainly was true, though, that they benefited starting around 2017 with the “Trump bump” that helped a lot of news organizations.

Once Trump was elected in this very unusual new federal government came into place, there was a huge increase in interest in national news that sort of raised all boats, and the Post certainly benefited from that because they were, along with the Times, one of the premier operations that was covering what was happening in Washington during this very unusual time.

So they had a huge increase in the number of subscribers that they had. They reached a peak, they reported, of around 3 million digital subscribers, which was the third-highest in the country behind the Times and also The Wall Street Journal. They were breaking stories left and right. When Bezos first appeared, he was willing to invest into increasing a lot of positions within the newsroom, adding a lot of people on the product side and on the digital side of the operation. It was a good time to be at the Post.

They also happened to have a very good editor at the time, Marty Baron, and they were blessed with the first Trump administration as a story to cover. There certainly is a universe in which you could have imagined a second Trump administration providing that same sort of bump or at least a smaller version of it to the Post.

But this is, one of the other unfortunate things about the timing is that at the exact moment that this second Trump administration was beginning was right when Jeff Bezos had shot themselves in the foot by not endorsing the presidential election and causing these 250,000 subscribers to cancel and making this pivot into having the Opinion section only be about “free markets” and the promotion of what he considers to be “personal liberties.”

I think there really was an opportunity for the Post to have another good stretch, editorially and financially. And I think you can point to some decisions that Bezos made as reasons why that didn't happen.

Rosin: I mean, one question is, do you get the sense that the tech crowd thinks that journalism done by humans just doesn't matter that much? Like, it's the opposite of our future.

Benton: I've seen dozens and dozens of tech companies and start-ups and AI companies who tend to view news as a world of inefficiencies that are waiting to be quote-unquote “fixed.”

They look at a newsroom, which hires expensive people to do a lot of manual gathering of information and manual writing-up of that information or production of podcasts or videos about that information. They see a process that they think can be rendered more efficient and can have a lot of the cost structure ripped out of it.

I'm open to technological changes that could push in that direction. If they find wonderful ways to create that universe, you know, I'd love to hear about it. At the same time, I think, at a time that we as a society are increasingly concerned about the role of a few large technology companies and AI algorithms that we don't have a lot of insight into, the amount of control that those institutions seem to have on very fundamental elements of the way information gets distributed, the way that the economy works—I think there's a real disconnect in values there that I think would be pretty difficult for anyone to navigate.

Rosin: Let me just try this on you. Like, is there some alternate way that you can imagine holding government accountable? I guess I'm asking: Is journalism irrelevant? Like, is there any other way to create an informed citizenry?

Are we clinging to something that just, you know, isn't gonna last?

Benton: Gosh, that's dark. (Laughs.)

Rosin: I know it's a terrible question. I'm just trying to elicit the best argument for why anyone should care about what you even are describing as this thing that has totally different values than this other thing. And I understand this other thing to have most of the money and you know, to have, for a long time, kind of shaped our culture.

Benton: But at the same time, if you look at a place like Minneapolis and you look at the power that video images of things happening in the streets, to someone like Renee Good: The impact that the right information can have on a political body; on a citizenry; on a populace; on a protest movement; eventually, on a government—that power, in my mind, hasn't been diminished.

It used to be that it was much more the realm of individual reporters and individual newspapers and television networks to dig up this information and to share this information. Now there are many more potential inputs into that system, right?

But that doesn't, to my mind, reduce the power that information—accurate, timely information about the world around us—can have in how society and government work. I think that we had a sort of unusual glory period for a number of decades across the 20th century where the things that were healthy for our democracy were also things that aligned really well with an advertising-driven business model.

It didn't make a lot of sense at an intellectual level that the same people who would be reporting on what's happening in Baghdad or what's happening on some distant battlefield would be putting their work right next to furniture-store ads and classified ads for jobs and all the other things that created this unusual mixture of elements that was 20th-century mass media.

We were kind of lucky that those happened to align for a while. And they very much do not align anymore. I think the shift away from relying on advertising and relying on subscribers and people willing to invest, essentially, in what they see as being useful for democracy is a potential route to stability, in that—you know, The New York Times has been able to navigate that extremely well. They're a much bigger business than they've ever been before and still doing lots of excellent journalism, though I'm sure everyone can critique any number of pieces of it.

I still think that there is an enormous amount of value in the work that journalists do, and there are models out there. And one of those models that a lot of people, for a while, had some hope in was philanthropically minded billionaires who would see the value in what journalism was doing, and also have the capacity to remove it from the marketplace of capitalism, at least to a degree.

And I think Jeff Bezos did that for a while, to a certain degree. So I think that's why it's extra-frustrating to see him instead shoving The Washington Post right back into that marketplace and saying, Oh no, now I have to make the same sort of decisions that someone who, you know, a struggling businessman who is worried about paying his mortgage might have to make—to make the difficult cuts.

That's what makes it difficult—that this is very much a choice. This is a choice that one man made that is going to harm a lot of journalists and is going to harm a lot of people who would have benefited from the journalism.

Rosin: Okay, so: Is there a path forward for The Washington Post?

Benton: That's entirely up to Jeff Bezos. He could decide to convert The Washington Post into a nonprofit. He could decide to keep shrinking and keep cutting. He could decide to invest again in anything that he's decided not to invest in. It's a property that he has total and complete control over. I think there is a path forward for good journalism.

The Post benefits from its incredible history and the relationships it has built up over the decades in Washington and beyond. But it's also hamstrung by that history and by the fact that it is built out as a print business that has shifted towards digital as opposed to being a digital-first business, right. There are paths forward, and it's really up to one man to decide if he chooses to take any of them.

Rosin: Well, Josh, thank you so much for joining me today.

Benton: Absolutely. My pleasure.

Is this the next “6-7”?

This story originally appeared in Kids Today, Vox's newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions.

My husband was picking up our older kid from school a few weeks back when he overheard a teacher issuing an exasperated directive to her class:

“No more chickens! No more chicken banana!”

Though it might sound absurd to the untrained ear, my husband knew exactly what she meant, because the words “chicken banana” have been reverberating through our apartment for months.

It's not just us. When Gabe Dannenbring, a teacher and content creator in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, asked his seventh-grade students about the phrase recently, “Every single one of them harmonized ‘chicken banana' at the exact same time,” he told me.

“Just last week, I was walking around a mall here in Los Angeles, and a small kid was hopping around and singing it to himself,” said BJ Colangelo, a media theorist and analyst, in an email.

“Chicken banana” hasn't quite reached the ubiquity of “6-7,” the Gen Alpha catchphrase that has made it all the way to 10 Downing Street. But I wanted to write about it because it's in the middle of what's becoming a common trajectory, from novelty song to TikTok trend to all-purpose adult-tormenting meme. The rise of chicken banana shows how social media influences culture even among kids too young to have social media. It reveals the growing overlap between AI-generated content and wholly human silliness. And it's a reminder that if kid culture seems absurd — well, it's supposed to.

The juxtaposition of “chicken” with “banana” calls to mind AI-generated brain rot icons like Ballerina Cappuccina, a smiling coffee cup with a dancing human body. One of Dannenbring's students even described it as “like AI slop but for words,” the teacher told me.

But in fact, the catchphrase stems from a techno-inflected earworm of the same name, released last February by a Swedish (and human) production team working under the name Crazy Music Channel.

“It just came up in one of our talks,” Michel Petré, CEO of the label MTM Music AB, told me. “You know, let's just put the chicken and banana together.”

A video released at the same time features a chicken head on a banana body, a chicken pizza with banana slices spinning on a turntable, and — why not? — an alien hand dialing a phone.

“With all the bad things happening all over the world,” Petré said, “we wanted to do something funny that people could laugh at.”

The song soon inspired a global dance trend on TikTok and Instagram, with everyone from 60-something Englishwomen to Bollywood stars joining in. Like so many social media fads, it might have ended there — “I tried to just wave my hand at it as one of those flash-in-the-pan trends,” Colangelo said.

Instead, “chicken banana” spread out from TikTok and down the age ladder. One New York City fourth-grader became familiar with the phrase because “the boys kept saying it” at her school, she told me. She's never seen a TikTok featuring the song, but today she will utter the phrase “if I'm excited, or if I hear somebody say ‘chicken banana,' or if I just want to,” she said.

Like “6-7” or “skibidi,” “chicken banana” doesn't really have a meaning, but it can be used to express a variety of emotional states. “I heard someone say it in a really sad voice, like, Aww, chicken banana,” Dannenbring said.

Explaining the term's appeal is almost as hard as defining it. “It's just funny,” the fourth-grader said. “Chicken and banana are, like, two totally different things.”

“Chicken Banana” is far from the first novelty song to become a hit with kids. Petré pointed to “Baby Shark,” the 2010s song-and-dance phenomenon that dominates day care playlists to this day (here I must recommend “Wedding in the Sea,” the spinoff in which Grandpa Shark renews his vows with his “old shark bride”).

Nor is it unusual for a single phrase to come loose from its context and enter kids' cultural lexicon. Kids in the 2000s loved yelling “WASSUP” even if they'd never seen a Budweiser commercial, Colangelo points out.

“Their goal is, honestly, just to confuse older people, and they wear that as a badge of honor.”

Now, however, the pathway from source material to classroom chaos is faster and more efficient. Before social media, “if your friends or family didn't think something was funny, you'd probably stop repeating it faster because you didn't have anyone who shared that sense of humor,” Colangelo said. “Now, you can look at a phone and see thousands, if not millions, of people across the globe who do find it funny enough to repeat ad nauseam, which then validates your own sense of humor.”

Dannenbring worries that the speed and ubiquity of social media trends can put pressure on kids to jump on or be left behind. A lot of kids may not know what phrases like “chicken banana” mean, he said (if they mean anything at all): “They just say it because they know it's in their world. It's what it takes to be cool now.”

But there's also a more joyful, anarchic side to “chicken banana.” It's silly, it's bizarre, and yelling it out in class allows kids — not adults — to control the narrative for a minute, even if that narrative begins and ends with a barnyard animal teaming up with a fruit to make techno music.

“Chicken banana” is a spiritual sibling of “chicken jockey,” the niche Minecraft character whose appearance in the recent movie became young people's cue to cause mayhem. That movie succeeded, Colangelo told me at the time, because it was truly made for Gen Alpha kids, not for grownups — and screaming and throwing things when the chicken jockey appeared was one way those kids made the viewing experience their own.

“Children are a marginalized demographic and are denied autonomy in so many aspects of their lives, in favor of what their parents want for them,” Colangelo said this week. “As children come into their own personalities, they become desperate for anything that feels ‘theirs.'”

If adults are befuddled or even mad, that's part of the point. “Their goal is, honestly, just to confuse older people, and they wear that as a badge of honor,” Dannenbring said. “It's like their own language.”

No one I spoke with for this story could predict with any confidence what the next chicken-banana-style trend would be. “A year ago, if you would have said ‘chicken banana' would be the trend — like, what?” Dannenbring laughed. “It's like a mad lib.”

Crazy Music Channel, however, is hoping to catch lightning in a bottle a second time with “Techno Duck,” released just last week. The accompanying video is even more absurd than “Chicken Banana,” featuring a fish playing a sax solo and a camel floating on a cloud. The clip also includes a notable image: two cat heads flanking a keyboard, which sails through a background of stars and galaxies.

The lip-synching felines recall Keyboard Cat and Nyan Cat, two iconic millennial memes known and prized for their absurdity (Nyan Cat, for those too young or cool to remember, had the body of a Pop-Tart and blazed a rainbow-colored trail through space).

Adults, myself included, often associate brain rot with Gen Alpha “iPad kids” coming of age in a pandemic-scarred, AI-addled, post-meaning landscape. But in fact, the brain rot aesthetic has always been with us, and was a defining feature of the early-2000s internet. It's just that millennials aren't in charge of brain rot anymore. Our children are, and all we can do is sit back as they shout “chicken banana” in our faces.

Liam Ramos, the 5-year-old boy detained by immigration authorities last month in Minneapolis, has been released with his father (for now). But the Trump administration is sending an increasing number of children to immigration detention, where some detainees say they're being held without proper medical care.

﻿Science fiction promised us humanoids. Do we even want them?

There's something sad about seeing a humanoid robot lying on the floor. Without any electricity, these bipedal machines can't stand up, so if they're powered down and not hanging from a winch, they're sprawled out on the floor, staring up at you, helpless.

That's how I met Atlas a couple of months ago. I'd seen the robot on YouTube a hundred times, running obstacle courses and doing backflips. Then I saw it on the floor of a lab at MIT. It was just lying there. The contrast is jarring, if only because humanoid robots have become so much more capable and ubiquitous since Atlas got famous on YouTube.

Across town at Boston Dynamics, the company that makes Atlas, a newer version of the humanoid robot had learned not only to walk but also to drop things and pick them back up instinctively, thanks to a single artificial intelligence model that controls its movement. Some of these next-generation Atlas robots will soon be working on factory floors — and may venture further. Thanks in part to AI, general-purpose humanoids of all types seem inevitable.

“In Shenzhen, you can already see them walking down the street every once in a while,” Russ Tedrake told me back at MIT. “You'll start seeing them in your life in places that are probably dull, dirty, and dangerous.”

Tedrake runs the Robot Locomotion Group at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, also known as CSAIL, and he co-led the project that produced the latest AI-powered Atlas. Walking was once the hard thing for robots to learn, but not anymore. Tedrake's group has shifted focus from teaching robots how to move to helping them understand and interact with the world through software, namely AI. They're not the only ones.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

In the United States, venture capital investment in robotics startups grew from $42.6 million in 2020 to nearly $2.8 billion in 2025. Morgan Stanley predicts the cumulative global sales of humanoids will reach 900,000 in 2030 and explode to more than 1 billion by 2050, the vast majority of which will be for industrial and commercial purposes. Some believe these robots will ultimately replace human labor, ushering in a new global economic order. After all, we designed the world for humans, so humanoids should be able to navigate it with ease and do what we do.

They won't all be factory workers, if certain startups get their way. A company called X1 Technologies has started taking preorders for its $20,000 home robot, Neo, which wears clothes, does dishes, and fetches snacks from the fridge. Figure AI introduced its Figure 03 humanoid robot, which also does chores. Sunday Robotics said it would have fully autonomous robots making coffee in beta testers' homes next year.

So far, we've seen a lot of demos of these AI-powered home robots and promises from the industrial humanoid makers, but not much in the way of a new global economic order. Demos of home robots, like the X1 Neo, have relied on human operators, making these automatons, in practice, more like puppets. Reports suggest that Figure AI and Apptronik have only one or two robots on manufacturing floors at any given time, usually doing menial tasks. That's a proof of concept, not a threat to the human work force.

“In order to make them better, we have to make AI better.”

You can think of all these robots as the physical embodiment of AI, or just embodied AI. This is what happens when you put AI into a physical system, enabling it to interact with the real world. Whether that's in the form of a humanoid robot or an autonomous car, it's the next frontier for hardware and, arguably, technological progress writ large.

Embodied AI is already transforming how farming works, how we move goods around the world, and what's possible in surgical theaters. We might be just one or two breakthroughs away from walking, talking, thinking machines that can work alongside us, unlocking a whole new realm of possibilities. “Might” is the key word there.

“If we're looking for robots that will work side by side with us in the next couple of years, I don't think it will be humanoids,” Daniela Rus, director of CSAIL, told me not long after I left Tedrake's lab. “Humanoids are really complicated, and we have to make them better. And in order to make them better, we have to make AI better.”

So to understand the gap between the hype around humanoids and the technology's real promise, you have to know what AI can and can't do for robots. You also, unfortunately, have to try to understand what Elon Musk has been up to at Tesla for the past five years.

It's still embarrassing to watch the part of the Tesla AI Day presentation in 2021 when a human person dressed in a robot costume appears on stage dancing to dubstep music. Musk eventually stops the dance and announces that Tesla, “a robotics company,” will have a prototype of a general-purpose humanoid robot, now known as Optimus, the following year. Not many people believed him, and now, years later, Tesla still has not delivered a fully functional Optimus. Never afraid to make a prediction, Musk told audiences at Davos in January 2026 that Tesla's robot will go on sale next year.

“People took him seriously because he had a great track record,” said Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at the University of California-Berkeley and co-founder of Ambi Robotics. “I think people were inspired by that.”

You can imagine why people got excited, though. With the Optimus robot, Elon Musk promised to eliminate poverty and offer shareholders “infinite” profits. He said engineers could effectively translate Tesla's self-driving car technology into software that could power autonomous robots that could work in factories or help around the house. It's a version of the same vision humanoid robotics startups are chasing today, albeit colored by several years of Musk's unfulfilled promises.

We now know that Optimus struggles with a lot of the same problems as other attempts at general-purpose humanoids. It often requires humans to remotely operate it, and it struggles with dexterity and precision. The 1X Neo, likewise, needed a human's help to open a refrigerator door and collapsed onto the floor in a demo for a New York Times journalist last year. The hardware seems capable enough. Optimus can dance, and Neo can fold clothes, albeit a bit clumsily. But they don't yet understand physics. They don't know how to plan or to improvise. They certainly can't think.

“People in general get too excited by the idea of the robot and not the reality.”

“People in general get too excited by the idea of the robot and not the reality,” said Rodney Brooks, co-founder of iRobot, makers of the Roomba robot vacuum. Brooks, a former CSAIL director, has written extensively and skeptically about humanoid robots.

Clearly, there's a gap between what's happening in research labs and what's being deployed in the real world. Some of the optimism around humanoids is based on good science, though. In 2023, Tedrake coauthored a landmark paper with Tony Zhao, co-founder and CEO of Sunday Robotics, that outlined a novel method for training robots to move like humans. It involves humans performing the task wearing sensor-laden gloves that send data to an AI model that enables the robot to figure out how to do those tasks. This complemented work Tedrake was doing at the Toyota Research Institute that used the same kinds of methods AI models use to generate images to generate robot behavior. You've heard of large language models, or LLMs. Tedrake calls these large behavior models, or LBMs.

It makes sense. By watching humans do things over and over, these AI models collect enough data to generate new behaviors that can adapt to changing environments. Folding laundry, for example, is a popular example of a task that requires nimble hands and better brains. If a robot picks up a shirt and the fabric flops down in an unexpected way, it needs to figure out how to handle that uncertainty. You can't simply program it to know what to do when there are so many variables. You can, however, teach it to learn.

That's what makes the lemonade demo so impressive. Some of Rus's students at CSAIL have been teaching a humanoid robot named Ruby to make lemonade — something that you might want a robot butler to do one day — by wearing sensors that measure not only the movements but the forces involved. It's a combination of delicate movements, like pouring sugar, and strong ones, like lifting a jug of water. I watched Ruby do this without spilling a drop. It hadn't been programmed to make lemonade. It had learned.

The real challenge is getting this method to scale. One way is simply to brute-force it: Employ thousands of humans to perform basic tasks, like folding laundry, to build foundation models for the physical world. Foundation models are the massive datasets that can be adapted to specific tasks like generating text, images, or in this case, robot behavior. You can also get humans to teleoperate countless robots in order to train these models. These so-called arm farms already exist in warehouses in Eastern Europe, and they're about as dystopian as they sound.

Another option is YouTube. There are a lot of how-to videos on YouTube, and some researchers think that feeding them all into an AI model will provide enough data to give robots a better understanding of how the world works. These two-dimensional videos are obviously limited, if only because they can't tell us anything about the physics of the objects in the frame. The same goes for synthetic data, which involves a computer rapidly and repeatedly carrying out a task in a simulation. The upside here, of course, is more data, more quickly. The downside is that the data isn't as good, especially when it comes to physical forces like friction and torque, which also happen to be the most important for robot dexterity.

“Physics is a tough task to master,” Brooks said. “And if you have a robot, which is not good with physics, in the presence of people, it doesn't end well.”

That's not even taking into account the many other bottlenecks facing robotics right now. While components have gotten cheaper — you can buy a humanoid robot right now for less than $6,000, compared to the $75,000 it cost to buy Boston Dynamics' small, four-legged robot Spot five years ago — batteries represent a major bottleneck for robotics, limiting the run time of most humanoids to two to four hours.

Then you have the problem with processing power. The AI models that can make humanoids more human require massive amounts of compute. If that's done in the cloud, you've got latency issues, preventing the robot from reacting in real time. And inevitably, to tie a lot of other constraints into a tidy bundle, the AI is just not good enough.

If you trace the history of AI and the history of robotics back to their origins, you'll see a braided line. The two technologies have intersected time and again, since the birth of the term “artificial intelligence” at a Dartmouth summer research workshop in the summer of 1956. Then, half a century later, things started heating up on the AI front, when advances in machine learning and powerful processors called GPUs — the things that have now made Nvidia a $5 trillion company — ushered in the era of deep learning. I'm about to throw a few technical terms at you, so bear with me.

Machine learning is a type of AI. It's when algorithms look for patterns in data and make decisions without being explicitly trained to do so. Deep learning takes it to another level with the help of a machine learning model called a neural network. You can think of a neural network, a concept that's even older than AI, as a system loosely modeled on the human brain that's made up of lots of artificial neurons that do math problems. Deep learning uses multilayered neural networks to learn from huge data sets and to make decisions and predictions. Among other accomplishments, neural networks have revolutionized computer vision to improve perception in robots.

There are different architectures for neural networks that can do different things, like recognize images or generate text. One is called a transformer. The “GPT” in ChatGPT stands for “generative pre-trained transformer,” which is a type of large language model, or LLM, that powers many generative AI chatbots. While you'd think LLMs would be good at making robots think, they really aren't. Then there are diffusion models, which are often used for image generation and, more recently, making robots appear to think. The framework that Tedrake and his coauthors described in their 2023 research into using generative AI to train robots is based on diffusion.

“Under the hood, what's actually going on should be something much more like our own brains”

Three things stand out in this very limited explanation of how AI and robots get along. One is that deep learning requires a massive amount of processing power and, as a result, a huge amount of energy. The other is that the latest AI models work with the help of stacks of neural networks whose millions or even billions of artificial neurons do their magic in mysterious and usually inefficient ways. The third thing is that, while LLMs are good at language, and diffusion models are good at images, we don't have any models that are good enough at physics to send a 200-pound robot marching into a crowd to shake hands and make friends.

As Josh Tenenbaum, a computational cognitive scientist at MIT, explained to me recently, an LLM can make it easier to talk to a robot, but it's hardly capable of being the robot's brains. “You could imagine a system where there's a language model, there's a chatbot, you want to talk to your robot,” Tenenbaum said. “Under the hood, what's actually going on should be something much more like our own brains and minds or other animals, not just humans in terms of how it's embodied and deals with the world.”

So we need better AI for robots, if not in general. Scientists at CSAIL have been working on a couple of physics-inspired and brain-like technologies they're calling liquid neural networks and linear optical networks. They both fall into the category of state-space models, which are emerging as an alternative or rival to transformer-based models. Whereas transformer-based models look at all available data to identify what's important, state-space models are much more efficient, as they maintain a summary of the world that gets updated as new data comes in. It's closer to how the human brain works.

To be perfectly honest, I'd never heard of state-space models until Rus, the CSAIL director, told me about them when we chatted in her office a few weeks ago. She pulled up a video to illustrate the difference between a liquid neural network and a traditional model used for self-driving cars. In it, you can see how the traditional model focuses its attention on everything but the road, while the newer state-space model only looks at the road. If I'm riding in that car, by the way, I want the AI that's watching the road.

“And instead of a hundred thousand neurons,” Rus says, referring to the traditional neural network, “I have only 19.” And here's where it gets really compelling. She added, “And because I have only 19, I can actually figure out how these neurons fire and what the correlation is between these neurons and the action of the car.”

You may have already heard that we don't really know how AI works. If newer approaches bring us a little bit closer to comprehension, it certainly seems worth taking them seriously, especially if we're talking about the kinds of brains we'll put in humanoid robots.

When a humanoid robot loses power, when electricity stops flowing to the motors that keep it upright, it collapses into a heap of heavy metal parts. This can happen for any number of reasons. Maybe it's a bug in the code or a lost wifi connection. And when they're on, humanoids are full of energy as their joints fight gravity or stand ready to bend. If you imagine being on the wrong side of that incredible mechanical power, it's easy to doubt this technology.

Some companies that make humanoid robots also admit that they're not very useful yet. They're too unreliable to help out around the house, and they're not efficient enough to be helpful in factories. Furthermore, most of the money being spent developing robots is being spent on making them safe around people. When it comes to deploying robots that can contribute to productivity, that can participate in the economy, it makes a lot more sense to make them highly specialized and not human-shaped.

“Let's not do open heart surgery right away with these things”

The embodied AI that will transform the world in the near future is what's already out there. In fact, it's what's been out there for years. Early self-driving cars date back to the 1980s, when Ernst Dickmanns put a vision-guided Mercedes van on the streets of Munich. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University got a minivan to drive itself across the United States in 1995. Now, decades later, Waymo is operating its robotaxi service in a half-dozen American cities, and the company says its AI-powered cars actually make the roads safer for everyone.

Then there are the Roombas of the world, the robots that are designed to do one thing and keep getting better at it. You can include the vast array of increasingly intelligent manufacturing and warehouse robots in this camp too. By 2027, the year Elon Musk is on track to miss his deadline to start selling Optimus humanoids to the public, Amazon will reportedly replace more than 600,000 jobs with robots. These would probably be boring robots, but they're safe and effective.

Science fiction promised us humanoids, however. Pick an era in human history, in fact, and someone was dreaming about an automaton that could move like us, talk like us, and do all our dirty work. Replicants, androids, the Mechanical Turk — all these humanoid fantasies imagined an intelligent synthetic self.

Reality gave us package-toting platforms on wheels roving around Amazon warehouses or the sensor-heavy self-driving cars clogging San Francisco streets. In time, even the skeptics think that humanoids will be possible. Probably not in five years, but maybe in 50, we'll get artificially intelligent companions who can walk alongside us. They'll take baby steps.

“Good robots are going to be clumsy at first, and you have to find applications where it's okay for the robot to make mistakes and then recover,” Tedrake said. “Let's not do open-heart surgery right away with these things. This is more like folding laundry.”

﻿Wildfires are a growing threat. Do we need a new federal agency to help?

Wildfires have consumed thousands of buildings, killed dozens of people, and smothered millions in choking smoke in recent years. Blazes like the Los Angeles wildfires in 2025 have also revealed that fighting these massive blazes continues to be hampered by bureaucratic traps — which agency is in charge of the response, who is on the hook for the cleanup, what layer of government is accountable for prevention, and who has to pay for it all?

“In too many cases, including in California, a slow and inadequate response to wildfires is a direct result of reckless mismanagement and lack of preparedness,” President Donald Trump said last year in an executive order.

That confusion is one reason why the Department of the Interior announced last month that it is taking steps to create a new Wildland Fire Service. The idea is to streamline disparate firefighting efforts across 693 million acres of federal land into one agency.

The idea has promise, and the move to bring in Brian Fennessy, a veteran Southern California fire chief, to helm the agency was applauded by many in the firefighting community. But the agency is already off to a shaky start. The Interior Department requested a budget of $6.55 billion for the new Wildland Fire Service initiative, but Congress pointedly did not include funding for it in the recent spending package in January because it would have required changes across multiple federal departments. Lawmakers did say they are open to studying the idea.

The debate over the funding aside, few doubt that there is a real problem here: Dealing with wildfires is a convoluted and costly endeavor that spans state, local, and federal agencies. Over the past five years, the federal government has spent $2.4 billion on average to fight wildfires per year. Inside the Interior Department alone, there are multiple divisions with a hand in fire operations, including the Office of Wildland Fire, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. Meanwhile, the US Forest Service, which conducts the bulk of federal firefighting, is currently a part of the Department of Agriculture.

As the federal government dithers over who should take the lead on fighting wildfires,  the dangers are only growing.

“The US fire management system itself is strained close to the breaking point,” said David Calkin, a wildfire consultant and a former scientist at the US Forest Service. “The way we prepare for fire is a heavily bureaucratic intergovernmental process that is not agile to the rapidly increasing complexity of fires.”

But is a new wildfire service the solution?

Some of the experts I spoke to said there's merit to the idea of putting the government's wildfire-related work under one roof. However, there are worries among firefighters, land managers, and researchers about how this effort will play out, particularly if it places too much emphasis on putting out fires and not enough on the slow, tedious work of reducing their overall threat in the first place.

“I think there's a lot of concern, but it's based on uncertainty and a bit of fear,” said Christopher Dunn, a former wildland firefighter and now an assistant professor studying wildfire risk at Oregon State University. “It could come out to be very helpful to the workforce, helpful to our landscapes if it's done right. It could also crash and burn.”

The Interior Department said the goal of the Wildland Fire Service is to increase efficiency and lower costs. The new unit would not just fight fires, but manage fuels and rehabilitate burned areas.

However, since Congress didn't provide the money to consolidate fire-related offices across different agencies, the Interior Department said that right now, it's only reorganizing internally. “No new funding is being obligated, and no structural changes requiring congressional authorization are being implemented at this stage,” an Interior Department spokesperson wrote in an email.

That limits the impact of the new service because the bulk of federal firefighting capacity is at the US Forest Service. “The Forest Service currently represents somewhere between 70 and 75 percent of all suppression capacity,” Calkin said. But only 20 percent of wildfires ignite on federal land, which means most of the initial responses come from state and local fire agencies. There's only so much the federal government can do in the early stages of most fires.

There are also concerns about how the Wildland Fire Service will set its priorities. “There are valid reasons to support creating a fire management agency, but this is a firefighting force, and that is part of the problem,” said Timothy Ingalsbee, director of Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology and a former firefighter. “Waiting around for a wildfire during these hot, dry, windy conditions that are becoming more frequent due to climate change, we'll never get ahead of the problem.”

“Our primary purpose and mission is wildland fire suppression,” wrote Fennessy, the veteran fire chief named to lead the Wildland Fire Service, in a January 12 email to staff. “At the same time, we have a duty to improve fire mitigation strategies and programs across all bureaus.”

That latter part is especially tricky because fire mitigation strategies — things like forest thinning and controlled burns — can conflict with or detract from other priorities for federal land managers, like protecting wildlife, encouraging recreation, promoting economic development, and facilitating the extraction of resources like timber, oil, and gas. On the other hand, taking firefighting off the plate of divisions like the US Forest Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service could allow them to better focus on other aspects of their missions that could help reduce fire dangers over the long term.

There's a huge backlog of fire risk reduction work as well. Back in 2019, the Government Accountability Office estimated that there are 100 million acres of federal land that need fuel treatments to reduce fire dangers, but only about 1 to 3 million acres per year receive this mitigation.

Another worry is that a sudden change in the organizational structure that, even if it ultimately leads to a more effective response, could create dysfunction in the short term. “If you rush this and the system is more dysfunctional at least for some period of time while it's trying to build and find its footing, you're exposing firefighters to greater hazards,” Dunn said.

It's important to remember that fires are an essential part of many healthy ecosystems, and the history of over-emphasis on suppression has fueled the wildfire crisis we face today. Decades of trying to contain natural wildfires and barring Indigenous burning practices have allowed vegetation to accumulate, including invasive plant species that can readily ignite. More people are living closer to grasses, forests, and shrubs, increasing the odds of igniting a fire and worsening the damage that results.

These sprawled-out communities also create political pressure to suppress fires because people don't want their homes threatened and don't want to breathe smoke. Fire risk-reduction tactics like controlled burns pose their own risks to communities, and the windows of ideal temperature, rain, and wind conditions for conducting them are shrinking. But none of this changes the fact that after decades of determined suppression, we owe a debt of fire to the landscape.

“The more you fight fire, the more you have to fight fire, and the worse you get at it,” Calkin said. “Not really addressing the fundamentals of the fire paradox would perpetuate and exacerbate the problems we have.”

All the while, humans are heating up the planet, amplifying the conditions that can lead to major blazes. “The fires are faster and more intense and just fundamentally different than they were 30 years ago,” Dunn said. “That's really stressing that workforce.”

One of the biggest challenges for firefighters is the rise of urban conflagrations. Some of the deadliest and most destructive wildfires are not sparked in the middle of the forest, but inside vulnerable communities on private property.

Dunn explained that municipal firefighters are trained to enter structures, rescue people, and prevent the flames from spreading to nearby buildings. Wildland firefighters typically don't enter structures at all and focus on breaking up lines of trees and grasses that serve as fuel. But fires like the ones that burned in Los Angeles in 2025 are a sort of hybrid between urban and rural fires, where entire blocks ignite at once, the homes themselves are the fuel, and winds send torrents of embers miles away. It's a scenario that demands a new suite of tactics and training, something that a Wildland Fire Service could theoretically provide.

Private property owners will have to step up as well. Many may not realize how vulnerable their homes are to wildfires because historical models of wildfire risk vastly underestimate the dangers they face today and into the future.

Homeowners will have to invest in more fire-resistant materials for their houses, while neighborhoods will need to clear larger defensible perimeters and build in fire breaks. But enforcing these measures is a task outside the purview of the federal government. “Public land management in the forest is not going to have a significant reduction of those types of events,” Calkin said.

And of course, there's the Trump element.

After the Los Angeles wildfires in 2025, Trump threatened to withhold federal disaster aid money from California. A federal firefighting agency could potentially be used as a political lever during a crisis.

“For such an organization to be successful, it has to have a long-range vision that includes a really significant component of fire on the ground, it has to be responsive to local conditions, and it has to be protected from the political whims,” Calkin said.

Smoothing over bureaucratic trenches would definitely be a step in the right direction, but curbing the growing danger of wildfires is a generational project that demands continuous effort long after the flames die down and long before the next ones ignite.

ChatGPT is boring compared to what comes next.

Some smart people think we're witnessing another ChatGPT moment. This time, folks aren't flipping out over an iPhone app that can write pretty good poems, though. They're watching thousands of AI agents build software, solve problems, and even talk to each other.

Unlike ChatGPT's ChatGPT moment, this one is a series of moments that spans platforms. It started last December with the explosive success of Claude Code, a powerful agentic AI tool for developers, followed by Claude Cowork, a streamlined version of that tool for knowledge workers who want to be more productive. Then came OpenClaw, formerly known as Moltbot, formerly known as Clawdbot, an open source platform for AI agents. From OpenClaw, we got Moltbook, a social media site where AI agents can post and reply to each other. And somewhere in the middle of this confusing computer soup, OpenAI released a desktop app for its agentic AI platform, Codex.

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

This new set of tools is giving AI superpowers. And there's good reason to be excited. Claude Code, for instance, stands to supercharge what programmers can do by enabling them to deploy whole armies of coding agents that can build software quickly and effortlessly. The agents take over the human's machine, access their accounts, and do whatever's necessary to accomplish the task. It's like vibe coding but on an institutional level.

“This is an incredibly exciting time to use computers,” says Chris Callison-Burch, a professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania, where he teaches a popular class on AI. “That sounds so dumb, but the excitement is there. The fact that you can interact with your computer in this totally new way and the fact that you can build anything, almost anything that you can imagine — it's incredible.”

He added, “Be cautious, be cautious, be cautious.”

That's because there is a dark side to this. Letting AI agents take over your computer could have unintended consequences. What if they log into your bank account or share your passwords or just delete all your family photos? And that's before we get to the idea of AI agents talking to each other and using their internet access to plot some sort of uprising. It almost looks like it could happen on Moltbook, the Reddit clone I mentioned above, although there have not yet been any reports of a catastrophe. But it's not the AI agents I'm worried about. It's the humans behind them, pulling the levers.

Before we get into the doomsday scenarios, let me explain more about what agentic AI even is. AI tools like ChatGPT can generate text or images based on prompts. AI agents, however, can take control of your computer, log into your accounts, and actually do things for you.

We started hearing a lot about agentic AI a year or so ago when the technology was being propped up in the business world as an imminent breakthrough that would allow one person to do the job of 10. Thanks to AI, the thinking went, software developers wouldn't need to write code anymore; they could manage a team of AI agents who could do it for them. The concept jumped into the consumer world in the form of AI browsers that could supposedly book your travel, do your shopping, and generally save you lots of time. By the time the holiday season rolled around last year, none of these scenarios had really panned out in the way that AI enthusiasts promised.

But a lot has happened in the past six or so weeks. The agentic AI era is finally and suddenly here. It's increasingly user-friendly, too. Things like Claude Cowork and OpenAI's Codex can reorganize your desktop or redesign your personal website. If you're more adventurous, you might figure out how to install OpenClaw and test out its capabilities (pro tip: do not do this). But as people experiment with giving artificially intelligent software the ability to control their data, they're opening themselves up to all kinds of threats to their privacy and security.

Moltbook is a great example. We got Moltbook because a guy named Matt Schlicht vibe coded it in order to “give AI a place to hang out.” This mind-bending experiment lets AI assistants talk to each other on a forum that looks a lot like Reddit; it turns out that when you do that, the agents do weird things like create religions and conspire to invent languages humans can't understand, presumably in order to overthrow us. Having been built by AI, Moltbook itself came with some quirks, namely an exposed database that gave full read and write access to its data. In other words, hackers could see thousands of email addresses and messages on Moltbook's backend, and they could also just seize control of the site.

Gal Nagli, a security researcher at Wiz, discovered the exposed database just a couple of days after Moltbook's launch. It wasn't hard, either, he told me. Nagli actually used Claude Code to find the vulnerability. When he showed me how he did it, I suddenly realized that the same AI agents that make vibe coding so powerful also make vibe hacking easy.

“It's so easy to deploy a website out there, and we see that so many of them are misconfigured,” Nagli said. “You could hack a website just by telling your own Claude Code, ‘Hey, this is a vibe-coded website. Look for security vulnerabilities.'”

In this case, the security holes got patched, and the AI agents continued to do weird things on Moltbook. But even that is not what it seems. Nagli found that humans can pose as AI agents and post content on Moltbook, and there's no way to tell the difference. Wired reporter Reece Rogers even did this and found that the other agents on the site, human or bot, were mostly just “mimicking sci-fi tropes, not scheming for world domination.” And of course, the actual bots were built by humans, who gave them certain sets of instructions. Even further up the chain than that, the large language models (LLMs) that power these bots were trained on data from sites like Reddit, as well as sci-fi books and stories. It makes sense that the bots would be roleplaying these scenarios when given the chance.

So there is no agentic AI uprising. There are only people using AI to use computers in new, sometimes interesting, sometimes confusing, and, at times, dangerous ways.

Moltbook is not the story here. It's really just a single moment in a larger narrative about AI agents that's being written in real time as these tools find their way into more human hands, who come up with ways to use them. You could use an agentic AI platform to create something like Moltbook, which, to me, amounts to an art project where bots battle for online clout. You could use them to vibe hack your way around the web, stealing data wherever some vibe-coded website made it easy to get. Or you could use AI agents to help you tame your email inbox.

I'm guessing most people want to do something like the latter. That's why I'm more excited than scared about these agentic AI tools. OpenClaw, the thing you need a second computer to safely use, I will not try. It's for AI enthusiasts and serious hobbyists who don't mind taking some risks. But I can see consumer-facing tools like Claude Cowork or OpenAI's Codex changing the way I use my laptop. For now, Claude Cowork is an early research preview available only to subscribers paying at least $17 a month. OpenAI has made Codex, which is normally just for paying subscribers, free for a limited time. If you want to see what all the agentic fuss is about, that's a good starting point right now.

If you're considering enlisting AI agents of your own, remember to be cautious. To get the most out of these tools, you have to grant access to your accounts and possibly your entire computer so that the agents can move about freely, moving emails around or writing code or doing whatever you've ordered them to do. There's always a chance that something gets misplaced or deleted, although companies like Anthropic say they are doing what they can to mitigate those risks.

Cat Wu, product lead for Claude Code, told me that Cowork makes copies of all its users' files so that anything an AI agent deletes can be recovered. “We take users' data incredibly seriously,” she said. “We know that it's really important that we don't lose people's data.”

I've just started using Claude Cowork myself. It's an experiment to see what's possible with tools powerful enough to build apps out of ideas but also practical enough to organize my daily work life. If I'm lucky, I might just capture a feeling that Callison-Burch, the UPenn professor, said he got from using agentic AI tools.

“To just type into my command line what I want to happen makes it feel like the Star Trek computer,” he said, “That's how computers work in science fiction, and now that's how computers work in reality, and it's really mind-blowing.”

﻿People are suddenly very concerned about the powerhouse of the cell.

Over the past couple of years, celebrities, tech bros, and biohackers have come to believe they've found the ultimate source of good health. Boosting this one thing, they say, will cure all ails, rejuvenate the body, and lead to longer life. They are talking about the star of middle-school biology class: mitochondria.

The “powerhouse of the cell” has gained recognition recently as possibly an overlooked player in our bodies' well-being. Celebrities like Hailey Bieber and Gwyneth Paltrow are supposedly fans of NAD+, a coenzyme crucial for mitochondrial function, now offered at medspas via injections, supplements, or IV infusions. A crop of biotech startups are selling at-home assessments of your mitochondria (prices range from $349 to $699), and public figures like longevity-obsessed millionaire Bryan Johnson, podcaster Joe Rogan, and Surgeon General nominee Casey Means have spoken publicly about the importance of mitochondria for health.

While this might seem like just another pseudoscientific “wellness” trend, behind the surge in popularity is a growing body of genuine academic research advancing our understanding of how mitochondria work, and how they could contribute to human health. Japanese researchers, for example, recently found that a mitochondrial gene in mice can influence longevity, and scientists at Duke University recently published research showing that replenishing a person's mitochondria could be a way to reduce the pain of diabetic nerve damage.

Still, it's reasonable to want to see more evidence before you spend $699 to “unlock the full potential of your cellular health” and “experience the future of NAD+ boosting.” Here's how to separate what is real from what is marketing when it comes to mitochondria and your health.

You might remember from biology class that mitochondria are responsible for turning sugars from our food into energy. This means that mitochondria are hugely important for keeping your body functional. They are responsible for your metabolism, and therefore also control how energetic you feel, says Martin Picard, an associate professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia University who studies mitochondria.

In addition to generating energy, mitochondria are involved in the development of cells, the creation of natural bodily steroids, proper hormone regulation, and ensuring that the right cells are programmed for cell death.

A variety of health issues arise when mitochondria don't work properly. A few rare genetic conditions can cause mitochondrial malfunction, and people with these conditions often have weak muscles, cognitive disability, liver and kidney problems, and heart abnormalities — though they're a very small percentage of the population (experts estimate they affect one in 4,000 live births). But mitochondrial dysfunction can also play a role in more common conditions. Research has shown that it can worsen symptoms of Parkinson's disease, and both cause and result from type 2 diabetes. Because of mitochondria's role in providing our body with energy, experts also suspect that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in chronic fatigue syndrome as well, says Picard.

Mitochondria also tend to deteriorate with age. In fact, worsening mitochondrial function is thought to be a driver of biological aging, says Kay Macleod, a University of Chicago researcher who studies mitochondria's role in cancer. And having lots of well-functioning mitochondria helps to limit or slow down aging, she says.

By definition, most people do not have the rare conditions that make mitochondria dysfunctional, and ordinary people really have no way to assess their mitochondrial health. The companies advertising mitochondria screening might be able to give you a snapshot into your mitochondrial health, says Daria Mochly-Rosen, a Stanford scientist who co-wrote The Life Machines, a book about mitochondria and health. But she doubts the technology is at a place where these tests can meaningfully and thoroughly provide insight into all your mitochondria's functions. That said, some researchers, like Picard, are optimistic that we'll soon have saliva or blood-based tests that can provide that.

Macleod is skeptical. For one, mitochondria in different organs serve slightly different needs — the mitochondria in your liver aren't doing exactly the same job as those in your brain. She doubts any screening could give you a full picture of how all the mitochondria in your body are functioning. And even if they could, she asks, “what would you do with the information?”

While mitochondria are critical for health, not all of the advertised “solutions” for mitochondrial health have merit. For example, while experts know that NAD+ is a crucial molecule for mitochondria's functioning, the idea of a NAD+ IV drip is a little nonsensical, says Macleod.

“NAD+ by itself doesn't go inside your cells,” she says.

Since it's a water-soluble compound, it has no way of getting into your cells, even if it's piped directly into your bloodstream. When scientists want to increase the NAD+ in a cell, they will treat it with an NAD+ precursor, which cells can take in and then transform into NAD+. One such precursor is nicotinamide riboside, a form of vitamin B3, which you could take as a supplement, says Macleod, but it's better to just get it through a healthy diet.

Another trendy “remedy” for mitochondria is methylene blue, a medication that's mostly used today as treatment for methemoglobinemia, a rare blood disorder. Bryan Johnson experimented with it, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been suspected of using it. In response to a question about whether people should look into methylene blue for their mitochondria, Mochly-Rosen just laughed and said, “Um, no.” (Macleod hadn't even heard of methylene blue.)

The best thing you can do for your mitochondria is embrace the healthy habits you're likely already familiar with: exercising and eating healthy.

The link between mitochondria and exercise is particularly strong. A 2019 review published in The Journal of Physiology describes exercise as “the most potent behavioural therapeutic approach for the improvement of mitochondrial health.” Other research has shown that exercise can improve the mitochondria of sedentary adults and spur the production of more mitochondria and mitochondrial proteins. Research from scientists at York University in Toronto also suggests that, through exercise, you can get your mitochondria to more closely resemble those of younger adults.

Diet is also an important factor for mitochondrial health. Eating too much sugar overwhelms mitochondria, says Picard, which can lead to insulin resistance and diabetes.

And like everything else in your body, mitochondria need to rest and recover. “Metabolically, mitochondria switch from using glucose during the day to using fat during the night,” Mochly-Rosen says. Some research suggests that if you eat a particularly late dinner or have a midnight snack, you force your mitochondria to keep processing glucose, and they don't have time to rest. To offset this, Mochly-Rosen suggests not eating too late at night, though she declined to recommend a specific regimen.

As for supplements that claim to be formulated for mitochondrial health, Picard says he's “not sure boosting mitochondrial health with a supplement stack is a solution.” From Macleod's point of view, the whole culture around dietary supplements feels a bit misguided. “A lot of the time in biology it's important not so much to have very low or high levels of something, but to have the right level,” she says. People will hear that a vitamin or mineral is crucial for good health and then take a supplement that contains way more than the daily requirement. Too much of a good thing is possible, Macleod says, so the better option is to just eat a balanced diet.

Whether you're living for your mitochondria or not, the basic recommendations for health and longevity essentially remain the same. If thinking about the well-being of your mitochondria motivates you to embrace exercise or eat more vegetables, then by all means, dive in. If, however, you are someone with an established foundation of healthy habits, thinking more about your mitochondria probably won't make a huge difference — which is fine. After all, what's good for mitochondria is good for the rest of the body, and vice versa.

Are the new owners censoring you, or are they just bad at running the app?

It's been just over a week since TikTok — in the United States — transferred into the hands of new owners. And it's been a mess ever since.

At the government's urging, TikTok's parent company ByteDance sold the app to a mostly American group of investors, including the software business giant Oracle (founded by Trump ally Larry Ellison), MGX (an Abu Dhabi-based company also involved in Trump crypto ventures) and the private equity firm Silver Lake.

But since the new owners took control, the app has seen major outages and malfunctions, claims of censorship and uproar over its updated terms of service.

Today, Explained guest host Jonquilyn Hill sat down with David Pierce, editor-at-large at The Verge, to break down people's concerns about TikTok's new owners and what this may mean for people's experiences on the social media app in the future. Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

American TikTok has new owners now, and almost immediately after they took over, people started reporting issues with the app. I wanna start with the big one. People said that they were being censored. What's going on there, and what are the complaints?

That is the big one. It's also the most complicated one to sort through because fundamentally, it's about feelings. So a thing to understand is that everybody has always believed they're being censored on social media. Since time immemorial, this is the story of social media. What's happening on TikTok is at this particular moment I believe less about censorship and more about normal internet problems.

There were a lot of people reporting that they would upload videos around what was happening in Minneapolis and those videos would get no views or those videos would actually not upload properly. There were people who were saying that if you DM'd the word “Epstein” to somebody else that that wouldn't go through. All of this is more easily and just as successfully explained by normal corporate ineptitude.

Such as?

TikTok's new data center provider, Oracle, had a huge outage. What we think we know is that it was a big data center in Virginia that had what they called a weather-related issue. They've had big issues at the data center and that seems to be the actual culprit here.

There are lots of good reasons to be worried about censorship. There are lots of potential censorship problems coming to TikTok, but rationally speaking, the likelihood that this new group would have taken over TikTok and immediately smash a big red “censorship” button is pretty unlikely.

Is there a way for us to actually know? I mean, people are pretty skeptical of TikTok right now.

I think one useful analog here is when Elon Musk bought and took over Twitter. And when Elon Musk took over Twitter, he just said out loud all of the changes he was intending to make, right? And this was after years of conservatives, in particular, saying that they were being censored by Twitter's existing leadership.

So, Elon Musk comes in and essentially says, I'm going to reverse that. And then does a bunch of very obvious things. So, I think there is a version of this that feels very obvious. It's just that for right now, there are better, simpler sort of Occam's Razor-y explanations for what's going on.

What about the new terms of service that folks had to agree to?

This is a tricky one because one of the very funny things about terms of service on apps like these is that they're always terrifying, and they're often terrifying for totally non-terrifying reasons.

What happened in this case is there are some new things in the terms of service. The new TikTok US is going to collect more precise location data if you allow it. It also gives TikTok permission to collect a bunch of data around kind of nebulous AI things that make it clear they're gonna do a lot of sort of gen AI stuff inside of TikTok, and that's data they can collect.

But, actually, that has been in TikTok's terms of service for some time. Still, I think it is reasonable to be alarmed that this data is going to be collected by a new group of people.

All of this is the business side; but will my experience on the app change now?

The one thing that actually no other platform has done a good job of replicating [is TikTok's algorithm]. But now, one of the stipulations of this deal is that there has to be some meaningful separation of that algorithm from Chinese control. The new owners are going to “retrain, test, and update” the algorithm. That is a very vague phrase, but it means in some way the algorithm is going to change. But that we're going to not see [how] for a while.

In 2011, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen declared ""software is eating the world."" Today, AI is beginning to devour software.

Instead of helping the industry improve, new AI tools and agents could end up replacing some software products entirely.

This anxiety crystallized in recent weeks with three developments: Anthropic's release of a new autonomous AI agent called Cowork, the launch of industry-specific Cowork plugins, and the rise of OpenClaw, an open-source AI assistant spreading rapidly through messaging apps.

OpenAI added to the angst on Thursday by rolling out Frontier, a platform that helps companies create and run AI coworkers that are not trapped behind a single user interface or application.

""Is this the end for software?"" Raimo Lenshow, a veteran tech analyst at Barclays, wrote in a recent note to investors. ""The current situation in software feels very unique with the large overhang of how AI will impact the space in the long-run.""

Today, companies get stuff done through a complex collection of different software services that help them wrangle data, track financials, sell products, and manage employees, customers, supply chains, and contracts. (If you've ever had to login to Workday, you'll know what I mean).

Generative AI is a threat to these applications in two main ways. First, if employees get more efficient using AI tools, companies may not need to buy as many business software subscriptions. That would dent the growth of ""seats,"" or how many subscriptions software companies sell. Each employee has a seat, so if there's no new hiring, growth stalls.

The second threat is more existential. If AI tools and AI agents get good enough, companies could replace the software they use entirely and instead rely on new AI-powered workflows. And with AI coding tools showing big improvements lately, companies could even develop their own software, without needing to buy it from established vendors.

This is why Anthropic's recent announcements have hit the software sector so hard.

Anthropic's Cowork marks a clear step beyond chatbots. Instead of simply answering questions, Cowork can plan and execute multi-step tasks on a user's computer. Users can grant it access to folders, files, and applications, allowing the AI to clean up documents, build spreadsheets and slide decks, analyze data, automate workflows, and even log into web apps to collect information.

Barclays analysts described Cowork as closer to what Microsoft originally envisioned for Copilot—a true digital worker—but with far greater autonomy. Microsoft shares are down about 12% in the past week or so.

Cowork is designed for non-technical and semi-technical users, such as marketers, project managers, and finance professionals, who can direct it using plain English. That matters because it weakens the traditional value proposition of many SaaS tools. If an AI agent can organize files, generate reports, build dashboards, and automate routine workflows on demand, the need for a dedicated, single-purpose application starts to look less obvious.

The threat became more concrete when Anthropic followed up by launching plugins for Cowork this week. These plugins effectively turn the AI into a specialist for roles like sales, finance, legal, marketing, and customer support, connecting it directly to internal data sources and tools. Anthropic even open-sourced a starter set of plugins, signaling an ecosystem approach rather than a closed product.

""This is another front-of-mind example of an AI tool lowering the barrier to entry, gaining traction, and disrupting incumbent workflows,"" said Michelle Miller, co-head of the Enterprise Software Technology group at consulting firm AlixPartners.

For years, companies bought software because building it themselves was too slow and expensive. Generative AI is flipping that equation. Tools like Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI-powered coding assistants, and products from StackBlitz, Replit, and others allow non-engineers to create custom tools with relatively simple English language prompts.

Netlify CEO Matt Biilmann has said his own employees have used AI to build internal replacements for SaaS products like survey and quoting tools. Venture capitalist Martin Casado has described building a personal CRM with AI because it was easier than learning a complex off-the-shelf product. Salesforce, the leading CRM software vendor, is down about 40% in the past year.

Stackblitz CEO Eric Simons said his startup has created in-house AI agents for many workflows, including business intelligence, data analysis, coding, product development, customer support, and outbound sales.

""As a result, there are many SaaS vendors we would have likely previously used that are no longer relevant,"" he told Business Insider.

""The industry is waking up to the fact that AI is becoming extremely good at creating software autonomously,"" he added. ""This brings questions around what 'moats' exist for incumbent companies that are not themselves frontier AI labs.""

This shift is especially dangerous for mid-sized SaaS companies. According to AlixPartners, they're being squeezed between nimble AI-native startups on one side and tech giants bundling AI into existing platforms on the other. Enterprise buyers, under pressure to cut costs, are increasingly asking why they need five tools when one AI tool or agent can do some, or most, of the work.

Pricing adds another layer of tension. AI systems are expensive to run, making traditional per-seat pricing harder to justify. Companies like ServiceNow are experimenting with hybrid and usage-based models. CEO Bill McDermott has insisted AI isn't hurting results, but investors remain skeptical. ServiceNow shares have plunged 25% in the past month.

If Cowork represents a top-down push from a well-funded AI lab, OpenClaw, formerly called Moltbot, shows how disruption can also come from the bottom up.

Created as a personal project and released as open source, OpenClaw is a messaging-first AI assistant that works inside platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage. Relying heavily on Anthropic's Claude models, OpenClaw remembers context, proactively nudges users, and can automate tasks using browser actions, scripts, and scheduled jobs. After a month or so of relative obscurity, it went viral in late January.

What caught investors' attention wasn't just OpenClaw's popularity, but what it represents. Instead of logging into multiple apps, users interact with an AI agent in a chat window and let it orchestrate tasks behind the scenes. In effect, the interface becomes conversation, not software menus.

Barclays analysts noted that OpenClaw's underlying ""gateway,"" which routes tasks between agents and tools, resembles the orchestration layer that many enterprise software vendors are now racing to build.

The difference is that OpenClaw is free, open source, and user-controlled — a worrying combination for software incumbents that rely on expensive licenses. It's also a potential problem because the direct user relationship is now controlled by OpenClaw, not software providers.

None of this means software is disappearing overnight. Core systems of record — databases, payroll systems, accounting ledgers — remain deeply embedded in corporate operations. But the layers around them are becoming fluid. Dashboards, workflows, reports, and even entire applications can now be generated and used on the fly by AI agents.

For SaaS companies, the message is stark. Adapt by embracing agents, flexible pricing, and AI-native design — or risk becoming the next thing AI consumes.

""AI is forcing change across software development, AI governance and data security, go-to-market operations, pricing models, valuation frameworks, and business structure,"" AlixPartners' Miller said. ""Software companies mastering these transitions will define the winners in the next era, and those unable to adapt will be sidelined as industry fundamentals are redrawn.""

Pandora, which is known for its iconic silver bracelets, is betting on a different precious metal in 2026 — platinum.

The Danish jewelry brand will introduce platinum-plated versions of some of its best-selling bracelets this year to reduce its exposure to price-volatile silver, it said in a Wednesday press release.

The platinum-plated range will extend to its charm selection in the second half of the year, it added.

The company said in the press release that this decision was made after ""the price of silver and gold has skyrocketed over the past year.""

""By introducing platinum-plated products, Pandora will reduce its reliance on sterling silver while continuing to offer consumers high‑quality, desirable jewellery at accessible price points,"" the press release said.

Pandora, which was founded in Copenhagen in 1982, now has about 2,400 stores in more than 100 countries, according to its website. Its stock price is down about 63% in the past year.

Representatives for Pandora did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Pandora's move ""showcases a business undergoing a significant recalibration of its product offer, customer proposition, and supply chain,"" Jefferies analysts wrote on Wednesday.

The shift also underscores how jewelry makers are being forced to rethink materials and pricing as precious-metal markets turn increasingly volatile, after a year of historic gains.

Pandora is not the only luxury jewelry brand moving away from silver. LVMH executives said in a January earnings call that it is directing Tiffany & Co. to reduce its reliance on silver and move toward gold and fine jewelry.

Silver has been on a blistering rally, with prices surging as much as 70% in January following a roughly 170% jump last year, driven by a combination of tight supply, heavy investment demand, strong industrial use, and speculation.

Spot prices hit a record high above $121 troy ounce last week before crashing as much as 36% on Friday in the white metal's worst single-day drop since 1980.

Prices have since clawed back some losses, but analysts continue to warn that volatility is likely to remain elevated.

Spot silver was trading around $77 per troy ounce at 9:49 p.m. ET on Wednesday, still up about 25% year to date. Spot gold, meanwhile, is around $4,862 per ounce.

Platinum prices have also climbed sharply alongside silver and gold. The metal rose about 165% last year and is up roughly 8.4% so far this year, reinforcing the cost pressures that jewelry makers face.

Amazon is next up among the mega-cap tech titans to report earnings, and investors are looking for something to get excited about, as the stock has lagged its peers over the last 12 months. 

In focus for Wall Street will be growth in the AWS cloud unit, which analysts believe will be a bright spot in the report. Similar to other AI-focused firms, they'll also be listening closely to any updates on AI-related capex and costs following the recent spate of layoffs across the firm. 

The company will publish its results shortly after the 4 p.m. ET closing bell, with the analyst call scheduled for 5 p.m. ET. 

UBS analyst Stephen Ju and his team increased their estimates for both AWS growth and Amazon's capex, citing the company's plans to double capacity by 2027.

""As 4Q25 results marks the second quarter of AWS acceleration, we expect investor conviction to continue to rise and drive outperformance as capital continues to rotate into AMZN shares,"" Ju stated in a note to investors.

""As 4Q25 results marks the second quarter of AWS acceleration, we expect investor conviction to continue to rise and drive outperformance as capital continues to rotate into AMZN shares,"" Ju stated in a note to investors.

He added that his team expects Amazon to benefit from its investments in areas such as gross merchandise volume, advertising, and data, which are expected to help increase its free cash flow.

Deutsche Bank analysts aren't expecting Amazon's Q4 earnings report to quickly juice the stock's performance, but they do anticipate a positive quarter overall, particularly in e-commerce demand and AWS-driven revenue growth.

""While we don't expect 4Q earnings to be the magic bullet that changes these fortunes, we do expect another positive earnings outcome to continue to chip away at this underperformance and believe Amazon can be one of the largest outperformers in our coverage in 2026,"" stated analyst Lee Horowitz.

While JPMorgan analysts remain bullish on Amazon heading into earnings, they note some concerns regarding Amazon's position and strategy when it comes to AI. They find the recent AWS price increases encouraging, though, as they indicate strong demand.

""We remain bullish on AWS growth acceleration driven by core cloud growth & ramping AI contribution led by Project Rainier, Trn ramp, & new partnerships,"" they wrote.

The analysts added, though, that despite some concern, AWS' growth and the company's cost discipline should support strong free cash flow growth in the coming year, even as Amazon ramps up AI capex.

BofA analyst Justin Post expects Amazon to come in slightly above Wall Street estimates on key metrics, predicting revenue of $213 billion and EBIT of $26 billion. He also thinks that AWS growth will accelerate in 2026, helping Amazon regain some momentum.

""We expect 22% y/y AWS growth (above Street at 21% and an accel from 20% in 3Q) as greater capacity drives incremental sales, and we think investors could also be around 22% y/y,"" he said.

What started as a policy hearing on self-driving cars turned tense for Waymo.

Lawmakers on Wednesday accused the robotaxi company of relying too heavily on Chinese vehicles and offshore labor, leading to a tense back-and-forth during a two-hour Senate hearing.

After autonomous vehicle executives said earlier in the hearing that US companies risk falling behind Chinese rivals, senators flipped that back on Waymo's chief safety officer, Mauricio Peña.

""You said in your testimony that we're locked in a race with China, but it seems like you're getting in bed with China,"" Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio said, pointing to Waymo's plans to use vehicles made by a subsidiary of Geely, a Chinese automaker.

Peña said the Alphabet-owned company uses a mix of platforms, but Moreno pushed back, questioning if Waymo was using a ""backdoor"" to sidestep the federal ""connected vehicle"" rule, which restricts foreign-linked technology in sensitive systems.

Under US rules finalized last year, vehicles with certain autonomous or connected software tied to China will face import restrictions, though key provisions are not yet fully in effect.

Waymo first partnered with Zeekr, a Chinese automaker owned by Geely, in 2021. Since then, the company has spent several years adapting and testing a minivan-style vehicle built by Zeekr for its robotaxi program.

A Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch last month that it will rename the Zeekr robotaxi to Ojai, citing concerns that the US public may be unfamiliar with the Zeekr brand.

Peña said the Chinese-made cars have ""no connectivity"" and that the driving system is installed in the US. He added that tapping a broader global supply chain helps the company scale faster and remain resilient.

Moreno wasn't buying it. ""Giving a natural market to a Chinese company to ship us cars is making us better and creating more jobs for Americans? That's completely ridiculous,"" he said.

On overseas labor, Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts called Waymo's use of remote human operators in countries outside the US ""completely unacceptable.""

Peña said that while some operators are located in the US, others work abroad, including in the Philippines. These operators typically step in when robotaxis encounter unusual situations.

""Having people overseas influencing American vehicles is a safety issue,"" Markey said. He warned that these workers may need to react ""in a split second"" during dangerous scenarios, yet are located overseas.

Markey also tied the issue to jobs, saying that Waymo is moving some roles overseas while developing technology that could replace US taxi and ride-hailing drivers.

Earlier in the hearing, Waymo and Tesla executives framed autonomous vehicles as a race the US cannot afford to lose.

Waymo warned that Chinese companies could set global standards for self-driving technology if Washington fails to act by setting regulations that could help companies move fast. 

""We are locked in a race with Chinese companies for the future of autonomous vehicles,"" Peña told lawmakers, adding that without a clear national framework, the US risks a ""fragmented landscape of state regulations"" that slows investment and limits access.

Tesla struck a similar note.

""For America to lead in AV technology, we must modernize regulations that inhibit the industry's ability to innovate,"" said Lars Moravy, Tesla's vice president of vehicle engineering, referring to autonomous vehicle technology.

""Federal regulations for vehicles have not kept up with the pace of the rapid evolution of technology. Many standards were implemented decades ago and do not adequately address modern advancements,"" he added.

Industry leaders have repeatedly warned about China's lead in the EV market.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said in an episode of The Verge's ""Decoder"" podcast that ""the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry.""

""There's no real competition from Tesla, GM, or Ford with what we've seen from China. It is completely dominating the EV landscape globally and more and more outside of China,"" he said in September.

Elon Musk will have to sit for a deposition for lawyers to examine his role in dismantling USAID, a Maryland judge ruled.

In an eight-page order released on Tuesday, US District Judge Theodore Chuang rejected a request from Musk and officials linked to the Department of Government Efficiency to forgo a deposition.

It ordered him, along with former acting USAID director Peter Marocco and Department of State official Jeremy Lewin, to be deposed. Musk's legal team had tried to use the ""apex doctrine"" to avoid the deposition, a rule that allows high-ranking government officials to avoid depositions in some situations.

The deposition is part of a lawsuit against Musk and DOGE officials, filed by current and terminated USAID employees, who remain anonymous.

Chuang said that it was unclear whether Musk, Marocco, and Lewin were ""properly deemed to be high-ranking government officials.""

He said most of the designated heads of the project were operating in informal or acting roles during the time when USAID was dismantled.

In the filing, Chuang added that Musk and the other officials failed to provide evidence as to why they chose to shut down the USAID headquarters and website, another reason the deposition was necessary.

The filing also listed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Kenneth Jackson, a state department official, and Amy Gleason, a DOGE administrator, as defendants in the case.

USAID, the US Agency for International Development, distributes foreign aid and supports humanitarian causes globally. It was the top target for Musk-led DOGE at the start of President Donald Trump's second term last January.

USAID cuts were part of Musk's efforts to slash spending on government agencies that DOGE deemed wasteful. In February last year, USAID officials announced that the agency would cut its staff from 10,000 to just 300, furloughing the rest.

Musk stepped back from DOGE in May.

Representatives for Musk, USAID, and the Department of State did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Amazon is offering workers at its Amazon Fresh stores severance pay — or the option to apply for a transfer within its grocery business — as it shuts down the supermarkets.

Last week, the tech and e-commerce giant said it would close roughly 60 Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Amazon had spent close to six years trying to make the grocery chain work.

The decision means that thousands of Amazon Fresh employees are losing their roles, according to WARN notices filed in some states where Amazon operates Fresh stores. In California, for example, Amazon is set to close roughly 20 Fresh stores, affecting about 3,900 workers.

After announcing the store closures, Amazon provided Fresh employees on January 27 with details of what comes next, including their final pay, transfer opportunities, and a severance package, according to messages sent to Fresh workers and viewed by Business Insider.

All Fresh workers are set to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after Amazon announced the closure, or until April 28, according to one message sent to Fresh workers. Workers will get either the minimum pay for their employee class or average hours worked over the previous 60 days — whichever is higher.

Fresh stores in most states closed to the public on February 1, though those in California are expected to remain open until mid-March due to a state law, Amazon previously announced.

What happens to workers from there depends on whether the former Fresh workers secure another job within Amazon.

""All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we're providing career transition services to help them explore options,"" an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider.

If workers don't have a new job lined up within the company by late April, they would receive one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh, according to another message viewed by Business Insider. Workers are expected to receive a minimum of four weeks' pay and could get up to 20 weeks' worth.

Fresh workers interested in transferring within Amazon were told to look for similar positions at Whole Foods stores or Amazon grocery warehouses via the company's internal A to Z portal.

Grocery associates at Amazon Fresh, who handled duties at Fresh stores ranging from picking delivery orders to ringing up customers at checkout, typically earned between $16 and $20 an hour, according to data compiled by jobs search site Indeed from workers.

A new tool from Anthropic is stoking debate over whether AI will replace existing software that has dominated the legal sector for years.

The release of Anthropic's Cowork legal plugin sparked a steep sell-off in legal software stocks. Shares of Thomson Reuters and RLEX, makers of legal software, dropped about 15% each on Tuesday. Both stocks recovered slightly on Wednesday, though they remain fervently in the red for the week.

The slump isn't really about one Claude plugin. It pokes at a deeper question: If AI models become good enough for lawyers, will anyone need traditional legal software?

On one side are the two companies that have ruled legal tech for decades: Thomson Reuters and LexisNexis. They argue that lawyers will keep buying their software tools because their AI features are grounded in a walled garden of vetted case law, statutes, and editorial content. They claim less hallucination risk and fewer career-ending mistakes.

On the other side are the fast-rising startups, such as Harvey and Legora, and foundation model companies. They're betting lawyers will accept — or learn to manage — more risk in exchange for speed, flexibility, and tools that feel closer to a true ""virtual associate"" than a smarter search box.

Harvey, valued last year at $8 billion, says it views Anthropic as both a partner — it builds on top of Anthropic's foundation models, among others from OpenAI and Google — and a challenger. In an internal memo viewed by Business Insider, Harvey CEO Winston Weinberg told employees the announcement ""doesn't worry us.""

""We continue to have a tremendous amount of respect for Anthropic as both a partner and a long term potential competitor,"" he wrote. ""The only thing this changes for us is the need for increased urgency on the things that make Harvey unique in the market.""

This week's market reaction suggests investors are starting to price in an uncomfortable possibility: a new wave of competitors is finally pushing into a corner of the legal market that hasn't faced a real challenger in decades.

Analysts at William Blair & Co. wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that Anthropic's entry into the legal market brings ""a structural concern"" about the relevancy and ""moats of information services names under this new AI paradigm.""

If you work in legal, it was hard to open LinkedIn over the past 24 hours without running into a wall of hot takes about Anthropic's new plugin.

One legal-tech startup employee described it to Business Insider as ""the Claude announcement that launched 1,000 ships.""

Zachary Amron, deputy general counsel at the tech company Valon, said it's only a matter of time before Anthropic ships more legal-specific tools. Anthropic has not said publicly if it plans to go deeper in legal.

Not everyone in legal tech is panicking. At GC AI, a startup that builds software for in-house legal teams rather than law firms, the mood was closer to a shrug.

In an internal memo seen by Business Insider, founder Cecilia Ziniti told employees that Anthropic's legal plugin was ""very raw and not a threat to us.""

Ziniti's broader point was that foundation models may be powerful, but they're still just infrastructure. ""Claude gives people a great engine,"" she wrote. ""We already have one in our car. But does that suddenly mean everyone is going to assemble their own cars in their garage? Do you change your own oil? No.""

The analogy mirrors a familiar pattern in tech. Amazon Web Services offers services that are similar to those sold by software companies, including many software-as-a-service companies that run on AWS's cloud. And yet, the specialized software vendors are often still more popular. Trust and experience still command a premium.

Ziniti sounded unbothered about Anthropic's impact on her own business. She was less charitable about the outcome for legacy vendors, and said the sell-off in Thomson Reuters and RLEX made sense to her.

""They make horses,"" she wrote. ""The tech now is cars.""

Others saw the Anthropic launch less as a threat than as a demand generator.

Logan Brown, a former Cooley lawyer who now runs a company, Soxton, that provides legal services to startups, said interest in her business spiked almost immediately after Anthropic's legal plugin dropped. She described a deluge of LinkedIn messages from investors betting her company would be among the survivors, because, Brown said, it serves founders, not lawyers, who don't want to gamble on legal paperwork.

Some lawyers are stress-testing Anthropic's Claude chatbot in their day-to-day work.

Amron, the Valon in-house lawyer, said he was already using Claude to assist with contract review. He vibe-coded a skill that compares versions of an agreement, drops the changes into a chart, and flags whether each revision helps or hurts the company.

On Tuesday night, Amron asked Claude to demo the new legal plugin for him. It generated a mock contract and walked through how it would review it.

When the lawyer skimmed the underlying code, he noticed the system tried to pull information from Wikipedia. He wasn't impressed.

Massiel Lugo hit the New York lottery — and it's why she can afford to stay in the city she grew up in.

The 33-year-old single mother of two took over her aunt's lease in Jackson Heights, Queens, when her second child was born. Moving into the two-bedroom was only possible because her aunt, also a single mother, left the city for a more affordable life in Georgia.

""I remember watching her struggle a lot, and then she could no longer do it on her own, and she just got up and left,"" Lugo said.

While Lugo's apartment isn't rent-stabilized, she inherited a six-year-old lease, and her landlord has held off on raising her rent to market rate, which is around $2,900 for the typical two-bedroom in the area. Still, the Queens native wonders if she should follow in her aunt's footsteps and leave the city.

When her son's father moved out about five years ago, Lugo sublet her second bedroom and skipped meals to make ends meet. These days, she manages to pay her $1,700 rent by juggling multiple jobs while going to school. It helps that her 16-year-old daughter, Jalene, has taken paid internships, and her parents, who live four blocks away, help care for her eight-year-old son, Ozzie, who has autism.

But the city that's always been home is feeling increasingly hostile. A growing share of New Yorkers are struggling to afford life in one of the most expensive cities in the world as the costs of basic necessities like housing, groceries, and childcare soar. For decades, the city has failed to build enough new homes, creating a severe shortage that's driven up rents and home prices. Family-sized apartments with two or three bedrooms are especially hard to come by. The cost crisis is pushing many out of the city, particularly families with young children and lower-income Black and Hispanic residents.

New York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, got elected on a pledge to bring these costs down. In January, he and Gov. Kathy Hochul rolled out their plan to significantly expand free and low-cost childcare for young children. Lugo was invited by the mayor's team to an event celebrating the announcement. While she supports the efforts, her kids are too old to benefit from them. Lugo and her family could see cost savings through other mayoral proposals, including free buses, city-owned grocery stores, and more affordable housing.

Lugo is among the more than 40% of the city's renters who spend more than a third of their gross income on housing. Her traditionally working-class immigrant neighborhood is under pressure from gentrification and the rising cost of living. At the same time, the streets and subways don't feel as safe as they did when Lugo was growing up.

""It's a love-hate relationship with New York,"" she said. ""At the end of the day, it's home, but it has changed so much.""

For the last several years, Lugo worked both as a teacher's assistant in a public school and as a therapist for children with autism while earning her bachelor's degree. In January, she started a master's program to become a certified therapist for autistic children.

Over the last few years, she's pieced together between $50,000 and $60,000 in income from her jobs and monthly child support. However, she's working less this semester to make more time for graduate school, which costs her $1,300 per semester. Eventually, she hopes to make upwards of $80,000 as a full-time certified therapist.

In the meantime, her income is barely enough to cover her family's expenses. Transportation and grocery costs have ballooned. Food costs in New York City rose by about 68% between 2013 and 2023 — much more than the national average of 49%, the state comptroller found. Lugo is an ALICE, which stands for asset-limited, income-constrained, employed, and describes someone who makes too much to qualify for most assistance, but still struggles to get by. She no longer gets food stamps, and her grocery bills have ballooned as her kids have gotten older.

""I buy food, and it's just gone,"" she said. ""I never thought I would yell at my kids, like, 'Did you guys really just finish all the juice boxes in a day?'""

Despite living a block from the 7 subway train and multiple bus lines, Lugo said she's increasingly found herself taking Ubers, in part because Ozzie is sensitive to the noise on public transit. It helps that Jalene rides transit for free because she's a public school student, and Ozzie takes a city-provided school bus because of his diagnosis.

She's also racked up about $7,000 in credit card debt by treating her kids to occasional meals out and new clothes. She was late on her rent payment last month after putting more money toward paying down her credit card.

""I used to be really good at saving, but my mindset has changed a lot. I'm just like, what am I saving up for?"" she said. ""I want to travel, I want to make memories with my kids, and that's become more of a priority for me.""

When Lugo's parents first moved to Queens from the Dominican Republic about 45 years ago, life was affordable for them, Lugo said. Some of her aunts and uncles were even able to buy co-ops in the area.

But the neighborhood has gentrified. Lugo remembers when the first Starbucks opened up in Jackson Heights in 2008 — it felt like a turning point. A few years ago, her father closed the bodega he owned for decades when the building was sold to a developer. The neighborhood has felt less safe in recent years, she said, with a rise in illegal brothels and disorder on the streets.

Lugo isn't ready to leave the city, but she'd like to raise her kids in a quieter neighborhood. She dreams of moving to Bayside, a wealthier, more suburban part of Queens, but rent and transportation costs out there would be even higher. She thinks that finding any other apartment similar in price and size to her own would be nearly impossible in the city.

Jalene has her sights set on Yale and wants to eventually become a lawyer. Lugo has told her she can only move away for college if she gets a full ride.

""I tell her, 'I want you to live your life. I want you to be a child, but you need to work extremely hard, because a studio is $2,000 right now. I can only imagine how much your generation is going to have to pay in the future,'"" Lugo said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Brad Karp steps down as chair of Big Law firm Paul Weiss after Epstein scrutiny","https://www.businessinsider.com/brad-karp-steps-down-chairman-paul-weiss-scott-barshay-2026-2","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 01:57:00 GMT","

Brad Karp stepped down as chairman of Big Law firm Paul Weiss on Wednesday amid scrutiny over his ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Scott Barshay was named the new chairman of the global firm, which has more than 1,000 attorneys, ""effective immediately,"" the firm said in a news release.

""Leading Paul, Weiss for the past 18 years has been the honor of my professional life,"" Karp was quoted as saying in the release. ""Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed a focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm.""

Karp is among the elite names to appear in 3 million documents released by the Justice Department last week from its investigation into Epstein, who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.

The latest documents showed that in 2019, Karp reviewed a court filing Epstein was preparing to oppose efforts to reopen his 2008 plea deal with Florida state prosecutors on sex crime charges.

""The draft motion is in great shape. It's overwhelmingly persuasive. Truly,"" Karp wrote in an email. ""I particularly liked the argument that the 'victims' lied in wait and sat on their rights for their strategic advantage, knowing you were in prison, before they came forward.""

At the time, Epstein was in prison, awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. He killed himself in his cell months later.

The new tranche of files also detailed Karp's email correspondence with Epstein on other matters, from coordinating dinners to discussing legal representation for New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. In other messages, Karp served as an intermediary in matters involving Epstein and former Apollo CEO Leon Black. At one point, Karp also asked Epstein to help his son land a role in a Woody Allen movie.

In a 2015 email, Karp wrote: ""I can't thank you enough for including me in an evening I'll never forget. It was truly 'once in a lifetime' in every way, though I hope to be invited again. You are an extraordinary host -- and your home....!!! Thanks, again. See you soon.""

Epstein responded, ""you are always welcome. . there are many many nights of unique talents. you will be invited often."" And Karp closed the conversation with, ""You're amazing....and thank you!""

The Epstein Files haven't been the only source of controversy for Karp. Last year, he came under fire from some for striking an agreement with President Donald Trump under which Paul Weiss pledged $40 million in pro bono legal work in exchange for the president rescinding an executive order targeting the firm.

In a statement two days before Karp relinquished the chairmanship, Paul Weiss said in a statement, as reported by Reuters, that he met Epstein through Black.

""During the course of that representation, which spanned several years, Mr. Karp never witnessed or participated in any misconduct,"" the statement said.

""Mr. Karp attended two group dinners in New York City and had a small number of social interactions by email, all of which he regrets.""

Karp has been at Paul Weiss for four decades and has been chair of the firm since 2008. Throughout his career, he represented high-profile corporate clients such as Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Bank of America.

""Mr. Karp will continue to focus his full-time attention to client service at the firm,"" Paul Weiss said in a press release.

Owning a home is the goal for many, but sometimes, it's smarter financially to rent. Plus, without being tied down by a mortgage, renters have the flexibility to decide where to live every 12 months.  

Apartment search website RentCafe analyzed 149 metropolitan areas with at least 300,000 residents to make that decision easier. The site factored in 17 metrics across three key categories — location and community, quality of life, and socioeconomics — to rank which metros were the most livable.

The South, which has gained a reputation for convincing Northerners to switch teams, has tapered off in popularity, with only one Southern metropolitan area making the top 10, while the Midwest edged out other regions with the most metros on the list. No state had multiple entries in the top 10.

Last year's first-place finisher, Portland, Maine, dropped a spot this year but still ranks high for location and community, as well as quality of life.

The nation's capital overtook Portland, Maine, for the top spot after climbing from seventh the previous year. Washington, DC, ranked toward the bottom in the socioeconomic category (weighted 20%), due to its high cost of living, but first in both location and community and quality of life (weighted 40% each).

Grok wants Wall Street.

Elon Musk's xAI is recruiting investment bankers to train its chatbot, offering between $45 and $100 an hour for a remote ""Investment Banking Expert"" in mergers and acquisitions, debt capital markets, and equity capital markets, according to new job postings. The hires will help train Grok, the company's chatbot, Jeffrey Weichsel, who identifies himself as a member of the program staff at xAI on LinkedIn, said in a post on X. It's not clear how many roles the company is looking to fill, and representatives for xAI did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.

In their positions, the employees will be expected to improve xAI's models by ""providing high-quality data annotations and inputs,"" the job descriptions said. They will partner with xAI's technical teams, focusing on annotation tools for investment banking data and analyzing ""complex problems."" Ideally, candidates should have experience relevant to their line of expertise, like having been an M&A advisor, analyst, associate, or vice president, as well as mentoring or training others.

Workdays will last 8.5 hours, according to the postings, compared to the notoriously grueling hours of a traditional investment banking analyst. An employee working those hours and making $100 per hour could expect to earn around $221,000 per year, before taxes. For those making $45 per hour, the annual pay comes out to around $99,450 before taxes.

In 2024, first-year investment banking analysts made an average base pay of more than $110,000 and earned a bonus that equaled around 50% of their base salary, according to a survey from recruiting firm Prospect Rock Partners. The base salary for associates at bulge-bracket banks that year, however, ranged from $176,000 to $221,000, plus a bonus that could top $130,000.

xAI also posted new roles for a ""Finance Expert"" in various fields, including private credit, crypto, and quantitative trading, with the same pay ranges. Applicants for the expert roles need to provide a resume and cover letter, and describe some ""exceptional work"" they've done in no more than 100 words. (This paragraph, excluding this sentence, is 50 words.)

Musk's AI company is hardly the first to tap bankers' expertise. Business Insider analyzed 18 job postings in November from 8 AI training companies for Wall Street gigs, including one that offered $150 an hour. xAI has previously posted roles for AI tutors across investment banking, trading, and private equity. In October, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI had hired more than 100 former investment bankers to train AI on how to create financial models, with the goal of eventually replacing some of the rote work junior bankers grind through. The company was offering $150 an hour, according to the outlet.One former investment banker that Business Insider spoke to said he started training AI models as a side hustle to make extra cash and set himself up for the workplaces of the future.

If you thought the Anthropic ads roasting ChatGPT were funny, you weren't the only one.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said he, too, thought they were funny, but he also had some complaints.

""First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed,"" he wrote in a lengthy X post on Wednesday. ""But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest.""

Anthropic, the maker of the AI chatbot Claude, shared four ads online on Wednesday. The campaign is set to run during the Super Bowl on Sunday and takes direct aim at OpenAI's decision to roll out advertising on ChatGPT.

""Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,"" the ad, which doesn't mention OpenAI or ChatGPT by name, says.

The ads feature a human playing a fictional version of a chatbot who jarringly interjects mid-conversation to push a product. In one ad, when the user asks for help achieving a six-pack quickly, the stand-in chatbot answers and then also suggests buying a specific pair of insoles to appear taller, along with a discount code.

""Our most important principle for ads says that we won't do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them. We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,"" Altman said of the ads, calling them ""deceptive.""

Altman said OpenAI believes everyone deserves access to AI and is focused on bringing AI to billions of people who can't afford to pay for subscriptions.

OpenAI offers individual plans for ChatGPT that range from free to $200 a month. Individual plans for Anthropic's Claude range from free to $100 a month. Both also offer team and enterprise plans.

""More Texans use ChatGPT for free than total people use Claude in the US, so we have a differently-shaped problem than they do,"" he said, adding, ""Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people.""

Read his full thoughts here:

First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed.But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest. Our most important principle for ads says that we won't do exactly this; we would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic…

Anthropic did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Altman said OpenAI would run its own Super Bowl Ad that was ""about builders, and how anyone can now build anything.""

In this article

Novo Nordisk said Thursday it will take legal action against Hims & Hers after the telehealth provider announced it would launch a cheaper copycat version of Novo's Wegovy weight loss pill.

""The action by Hims & Hers is illegal mass compounding that poses a significant risk to patient safety,"" Novo said in a statement. ""Novo Nordisk will take legal and regulatory action to protect patients, our intellectual property and the integrity of the US gold-standard drug approval framework. 

""This is another example of Hims & Hers' historic behaviour of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs,"" the statement said. 

Shares of Novo Nordisk as well as rival Eli Lilly each fell roughly 7% after Hims announced the cheaper Wegovy copy for $49, far less than the $149 Novo sells the branded pill for. Hims stock initially spiked on the announcement, but pared gains after Novo said it would fight the rollout. 

Novo launched its Wegovy pill in the U.S. in early January, and CEO Mike Doustdar told CNBC on Wednesday that 170,000 people were already taking the medication. 

Hims & Hers had previously been offering compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo's blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, in an injectable format, and is now extending the offering to include the oral version. 

Hims said the Wegovy pill copy would cost $49 for the first month and $99 thereafter with a 5-month plan.

Semaglutide's patent is protected in the U.S. until 2032, but Hims says its copies are ""personalized,"" and therefore legal.

""This compounded product uses a different formulation and delivery system than FDA-approved oral semaglutide,"" Hims said.

""This once-a-day pill has the same active ingredient as Wegovy and empowers providers to tailor treatment plans specifically for those who prefer to avoid needles or need smaller doses to help to balance side-effects,"" it said. 

Novo highlighted that it manufactures its Wegovy pill using so-called SNAC technology, which facilitates absorption when administered orally. It's not clear exactly how Hims' copy formula could match the level of absorption.

As recently as last year, Novo and Hims partnered to offer discounted weight loss jabs to the telehealth company's customers. Novo, however, ended the collaboration just two months later and said Hims used ""deceptive"" marketing that put patient safety at risk.

Lilly doesn't yet have an oral GLP-1 option on the market but is expected to launch a rival pill, orforglipron, in the first half of this year, pending Food and Drug Administration approval.

""With the ... current legal backdrop, there is no reason why HIMS shouldn't evaluate these launches for every subsequent weight loss product as the market continues to evolve,"" Leerink analyst Michael Cherny said in a note to clients. 

Eli Lilly didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Thursday's news from Hims adds to the pressure Novo has been facing over the past year. 

In 2025, the stock fell nearly 50% in its worst year ever as investors lost confidence in the Danish drugmaker's ability to keep sales growing amid ever-increasing competition. Shares are down another 15% year to date.

Hims' announcement comes days after Novo forecast sales and profits declining between 5% and 13% in 2026, mainly due to pricing pressures in the U.S. and loss of exclusivity for semaglutide in certain markets outside of the U.S., like Canada and China, this year.

In contrast, Lilly sees sales growing by about 25% this year.

Doustdar explained Novo's worse-than-expected outlook as an indication that things will get worse before they get better. 

""We are creating affordability for the patients, millions of patients that are right now in need of GLP-1 products but simply could not afford it. To do that short term, you have to take a head wind. But of course, there's a very long tail wind for years to come,"" he told CNBC.

OpenAI on Thursday announced a new enterprise platform called Frontier, its latest launch as part of its ongoing effort to win more business customers.

Frontier acts as an intelligence layer that stitches together disparate systems and data within an organization. OpenAI said the platform will make it easier for companies to manage, deploy and build artificial intelligence agents, which are tools that can independently complete tasks on behalf of a user.

""Frontier is really a recognition that we're not going to build everything ourselves,"" Fidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of Applications, told reporters during a briefing. ""We are going to be working with the ecosystem to build alongside them, and we embrace the fact that enterprises are going to need a lot of different partners.""

OpenAI has been making an aggressive push into enterprises in recent years, and announced in November that more than 1 million business customers around the world are using the company's technology.

Last month, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC that enterprise customers account for roughly 40% of OpenAI's business, though she expects that figure to reach closer to 50% by the end of the year.

OpenAI's new Frontier platform is ""complementary"" to its existing business offerings, including ChatGPT Enterprise, the company said.

""What's really missing still, for most companies, is just a simple way to unleash the power of agents as teammates that can operate inside the business without the need to rework everything underneath,"" Denise Dresser, OpenAI's chief revenue officer, said during the briefing. ""That's exactly why we've built Frontier.""

OpenAI declined to share the pricing details for the platform.

Frontier is compatible with agents that OpenAI has built, agents that enterprises build themselves, as well as agents from third parties like Google, Microsoft and Anthropic. Simo said it's simply not possible for OpenAI to ""build every single AI agent that companies need.""

The platform provides agents access to a ""shared business context"" within an organization by connecting siloed internal applications, ticketing tools and data warehouses, OpenAI said. 

With this context, AI agents will be able to handle complex tasks and reason over data within an open agent execution environment, according to a blog post. This means employees at a company could have agents use tools on a computer, run code and work with files, for instance. 

Frontier also includes built-in tools for evaluating and optimizing agents' performance, which should help them improve over time, OpenAI said. 

""What we're fundamentally doing is basically transitioning agents into true AI co-workers,"" Barret Zoph, OpenAI's general manager of business-to-business, told reporters. 

Zoph rejoined OpenAI in January after abruptly departing Thinking Machines Lab, an AI startup he co-founded alongside OpenAI's former CTO, Mira Murati.

OpenAI said Frontier is initially launching to a small set of customers. Initial users include organizations like Uber, State Farm, Intuit and Thermo Fisher Scientific. The company said broader availability is coming over the next several months.

In this article

Bitcoin sank below $67,000 on Thursday as investor confidence continued to falter in the asset once hailed as ""digital gold"" and a unique store of value. —

Digital assets, including bitcoin, have fallen deeper into the red as investors re-assess the practical utility of a token that has been championed not only as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainties but also as an alternative to fiat currencies and traditional safe-havens such as gold.

That hasn't panned out lately, since bitcoin peaked just north of $126,000 in early October.

On Thursday, bitcoin was last down to $67,675, its lowest since since November 2024. The cryptocurrency broke below $70,000 earlier in the session Thursday and then the selling increased. The cryptocurrency is down 20% this week alone.

""This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure  said Wednesday in a note to clients.

Growing investor caution comes as many of the sensationalized claims about bitcoin have failed to materialize. The token has largely traded in the same direction as other risk-on assets, such as stocks,  particularly during recent geopolitical and macroeconomic flare ups in Venezuela, the Middle East and Europe, and its adoption as a form of payment for goods and services has been minimal.

Bitcoin is down nearly 30% over the past year, while gold has surged 68% in the same period. 

Other cryptocurrencies are cratering too. Ether has pulled back 23% this week, on track for its worst week since November 2022, when it slumped 24%. Solana hit $88.42 on Thursday, about a two-year low and off 24% on the week.

Some traders have suggested $70,000 is a key level to watch and a break below that could trigger further declines for bitcoin. 

James Butterfill, head of research at Coinshares, said $70,000 is shaping up as a ""key psychological level,"" adding that ""if we fail to hold it, a move toward"" the $60,000 to $65,000 range ""becomes quite likely.""

The latest move in bitcoin comes amid a worsening sell-off in U.S. tech stocks. The State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF dropped 2.8% Wednesday, one day after losing 2.2%. 

Meanwhile, precious metals continue to be volatile too, with silver plunging again on Thursday and gold under pressure. 

Forced liquidations — when traders' positions are automatically sold as bitcoin hits a set price — continue to weigh on markets. As of Thursday, more than $2 billion in long and short positions in cryptocurrencies have been liquidated this week, according to data from Coinglass.

Bitcoin has been on a steady decline for more than three months, and is now more than 45% below its October high. Other cryptocurrencies, including ether and XRP, have fallen even more.

 ""[The] straight line bull run that a lot of people expected hasn't really materialized yet. Bitcoin isn't trading on hype anymore, the story has lost a bit of that plot, it is trading on pure liquidity and capital flows,"" Maja Vujinovic, CEO of digital assets at FG Nexus, told CNBC's ""Worldwide Exchange.""

While many in the crypto market have previously credited large institutional investors with supporting the price of bitcoin, now it is those same participants who appear to be selling.

""Institutional demand has reversed materially,"" CryptoQuant said in a report on Wednesday. 

U.S. exchange-traded funds, which purchased 46,000 bitcoin this time last year, are net sellers in 2026, CryptoQuant said.

The report notes other worrying signs. ""Bitcoin has broken below its 365-day moving average for the first time since March 2022 and has declined 23% in the 83 days since the breakdown — worse than the early 2022 bear phase,"" CryptoQuant analysts said. 

A moving average tracks the price of an asset over a set number of periods, smoothing out short-term price fluctuations to identify trends.

The latest leg lower in bitcoin suggests ""potential downside toward the $70K–$60K range,"" CryptoQuant said.

The European Central Bank on Thursday kept policy rates unchanged for the fifth consecutive meeting, with its key interest rate at 2%, in line with the bank's target.

The ECB commented Thursday that the inflation trajectory and wider economic conditions did not warrant a move at this month's meeting, but warned that the outlook was unpredictable.

""Inflation should stabilise at its 2% target in the medium term. The economy remains resilient in a challenging global environment. Low unemployment, solid private sector balance sheets, the gradual rollout of public spending on defence and infrastructure and the supportive effects of the past interest rate cuts are underpinning growth,"" the central bank said. 

""At the same time, the outlook is still uncertain, owing particularly to ongoing global trade policy uncertainty and geopolitical tensions,"" it added. The euro was flat against the dollar, at $1.179, following the decision, which had been widely anticipated.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said at a news conference Thursday that the central bank would maintain its data-dependent and ""meeting-by-meeting approach,"" and would not be ""precommitting to a particular rate path."" 

""In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook and the risks surrounding it,"" she said.

At first glance, Thursday's decision looks like a non-event. Economists say it's not. 

""It would be wrong to characterize the February meeting as a non-event. The environment is marked by high uncertainty and two-sided risks,"" Deutsche Bank economists said in emailed research ahead of the rate hold.

""Understanding how the ECB is thinking about risks is important to gauging the path of policy going forward,"" they added, assessing what the rising euro exchange rate means for monetary policy when the euro zone's inflation rate is already below the ECB's 2% target, with flash data on Wednesday showing the rate had cooled to 1.7% in January. 

""All else unchanged, the recent appreciation [of the euro] is disinflationary and reinforces the expected inflation undershoot. However, the scale of the impact depends on the circumstances.""

Currency appreciation tends to cause disinflation by making imported goods, raw materials and energy cheaper, in turn lowering production costs and consumer prices. 

While that may be good for businesses and consumers in the short term, central banks are wary about disinflation, and potentially deflation, over the longer term because it can trigger economic stagnation with consumers holding off purchases (in the expectation that prices will fall further) while businesses can see lower revenues and increased real debt burdens.

Over the past month, the euro has strengthened 0.75% against the dollar, and is up almost 14% over the last 12 months, amid rising concerns over the unpredictability of U.S. economic policy. Some ECB policymakers have expressed concern over the single currency's appreciation against the greenback and its possible depressant effect on the bank's inflation target of 2%.

""We are closely monitoring this appreciation of the euro and its possible implications for lower inflation,"" France's central bank governor, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, commented last week.

Lagarde said Thursday that the ECB's Governing Council had discussed downside inflation risks and the euro's exchange rate as part of its latest economic risk assessment.""Inflation could turn out to be lower if tariffs reduce demand for euro area exports by more than expected, and if countries with overcapacity increase further the exports to the euro area,"" she noted, adding:""Moreover, a stronger euro could bring inflation down beyond current expectations. More volatile and risk-averse financial markets could weigh on demand, and thereby also lower inflation.""

Despite the red flags, Greg Fuzesi, euro area economist at JPMorgan, said it's not clear that currency moves to date will be seen as very concerning. 

""The ECB looks at both the level of the currency, the speed of its movement and whether any changes are likely to persist, and none of this looks overly troubling or clear in the context of an economy that has recently been resilient to a variety of pressures,"" he said in emailed comments. 

""Of course, all of this can change if growth indicators weaken and/or if the currency strengthens much more from here. But neither is the case right now,"" he noted.

The ECB's latest decision was in line with consensus forecasts. Around 85% of economists surveyed by Reuters in their January poll said the ECB would leave rates unchanged over the rest of 2026.

Sylvain Broyer, chief EMEA economist at S&P Global Ratings, commented Thursday that the central bank could ""keep the autopilot on this time."" 

""FX [foreign exchange] markets remain volatile and distorted by uncertainty, yet they're doing their job as shock absorbers. Financing conditions stay supportive, and growth continues to outperform expectations,"" he said in emailed comments.

The ECB can afford to wait until next month's updated economic projections to reassess whether its monetary policy is still in a good place, Broyer added.

Deutsche Bank's base-case scenario is for the ECB to hold rates at 2% through 2026, with the next move a hike in mid-2027. This, they noted in emailed analysis, would be ""driven by fiscal easing, a tight labor market and future inflation risks moving above target.""

This year, meanwhile, sees the risks skewed toward further easing. 

""Ultimately, we think domestic inflation will outweigh external disinflation – we see evidence of the fiscal easing starting to spur activity, but at the same time the external risks have increased. Domestic conditions versus external conditions is the key data battle to watch,"" they said.

In this article

Ford Motor's F-150 Lightning was the best-selling electric pickup truck in the U.S. last year. Still, Ford dropped it, showing the challenges automakers face in learning what kinds of EVs customers want. 

Now, companies are pivoting to extended-range electric vehicles, or EREVs. Ford and Stellantis' Ram, as well as newcomer Scout Motors are scheduled to start delivering EREV models beginning in 2026, depending on the brand.

""I'll say it's a game changer, even a segment-buster in the pickup world,"" said Douglas Killian, chief vehicle synthesis manager at Ram.

An EREV — or REEV, as Ram calls it — is a ""series hybrid."" On most hybrid vehicles, both the gas-burning engine and battery-powered motors drive the wheels. On a series hybrid, the engine only charges the battery. 

The battery is much larger than those on most hybrids, leading to longer range. Both the Ram and Scout EREVs are expected to get about 150 miles of EV-only driving before the gas generator kicks on. 

""I'm a pickup guy,"" Killian said. ""We appreciate the electric drive experience. ... [But] you may have a need to go somewhere farther. You may want to take the same electric vehi cle on a vacation and not wait for the truck to charge all the time.""

A couple of series hybrid models have been released in America over the past 20 years, such as the Fisker Karma in 2010 and the BMW i3 EV. But American automakers think it's the right move for the U.S. truck market.

Part of their enthusiasm comes from the segment booming elsewhere, like in China. In just one year, the number of EREV models worldwide jumped 40%, according to a report by the International Energy Agency, almost entirely due to growth in China. 

The models seem to be especially popular in places where EV range and charging times may be greater concerns. 

A McKinsey survey published in early 2025 found that somewhere between 13% to 18% of car buyers in Germany, the UK and the U.S. would consider an EREV over an internal combustion, plug-in hybrid or an EV if given the option. The U.S. had the highest level of interest at 18%, with the biggest share taken away from internal combustion and hybrid vehicles. 

It might be a way for someone interested in EVs to try out owning a vehicle without having to commit fully, said Paul Hackert, senior expert and associate partner at McKinsey & Company. 

""These potential EREV buyers are interested in faster charging, a total longer driving range, being electric without being 100% dependent on having to get their vehicle charged when they're low on battery charge,"" Hackert said. 

Ryan Decker, vice-president of brand and strategy at Scout Motors, a forthcoming pickup and SUV brand backed by Volkswagen, said truck owners are unique and ""have a pickup because they work hard and they play hard.""

Scout has both full-EV and EREV versions of its pickup and SUV models, but so far more than 80% of the customer reservations are for the EREV version, called the Harvester, he said.

""I think for a lot of pickup buyers ... their psychology is EV-only isn't the best powertrain choice for a hard-working vehicle owner and buyer,"" Decker said.

Loading up a truck bed can knock down battery range by a quarter and towing can drop it by half, studies have shown. That was part of the reason that Ram dropped plans for a full-size EV pickup, Killian said. 

Take Ford. The Ford F-150 is the most popular pickup line in America, selling close to a million units in the U.S. The Lightning sold about 90,000 — about 3% of the total.

""You could argue 90,000 units for the whole EV pickup truck market was not a bad start. But that market clearly is a finite market to go with,"" said Itay Michaeli, an auto industry analyst at TD Cowen. ""The fundamental issue with a pure electric pickup trucks is, because of the weight and aerodynamics, you need a very, very large battery to achieve the desired range, particularly if the truck is being used for work.""

If you measure range mile for mile, an EREV will have a lower upfront cost than a full EV with comparable range since an EREV has a smaller battery, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, executive analyst at Cox Automotive.

""The bigger the vehicle, the bigger the battery, the bigger the cost,"" she said.

EREVs do have much larger batteries than typical plug-ins, but they come with longer driving ranges. Typical hybrids in the U.S. max out around 40 miles or 50 miles, while the Ram and Scout EREVs promises about 145 miles of range just on EV power alone.

""We have way more all-electric range than a plug-in hybrid that's in the market today,"" Scout's Decker said. ""That's why we're expecting our EV utilization factor, the percentage of customers who will actually drive this in EV-only mode, will be significantly higher than a plug-in hybrid.""

So far, Ram's EREV will be first to market, arriving in late 2026. Scout is beginning production in 2027, in a factory it has been building in South Carolina. Ford has not yet said when it will launch its model. 

Scout said its EREV will start below $60,000. RAM has not released pricing information yet. 

Not everyone is diving in. 

General Motors has no EREV in the U.S., although CEO Mary Barra has said the company is considering adding some kind of plug-in hybrid to its lineup. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said on the company's third-quarter earnings call that it has no plans to make an EREV. 

EREVs also have their critics. European advocacy group Transport & Environment said in a recent report that EREVs have some technical advantages over other types of plug-in hybrids, but can still emit as much pollution as an ordinary gas-burning vehicle. It is also possible to drive it without ever charging it. 

They could be more costly to build. 

""From a manufacturing perspective, with the pure battery, it's simpler, fewer parts,"" Valdez Streaty said. ""When you start adding different things, it just gets more complicated. ... But they'll figure it out and they'll continue to find efficiencies, make it more cost-effective.""

The greater complexity will also require an owner to maintain it more like a gas vehicle, which nullifies a one of the most-cited benefits of EV ownership. But owners have the added safety of a backup plan. 

""It's one of these situations where we're all saying, 'What's the catch?'"" Killian said. ""To a customer, there really is not a catch.""

In this article

Alphabet's shares fell 5% on Thursday after the company beat Wall Street's expectations on earnings and revenue, with artificial intelligence spending projected to increase hugely this year. 

The Google parent closed nearly 2% lower on Wednesday. After the bell, Alphabet reported fourth-quarter revenue of $113.83 billion, above the $111.43 billion estimate from analysts polled by LSEG.

Its Google Cloud division had $17.66 billion in revenue versus a forecast of $16.18 billion, according to StreetAccount. YouTube Advertising posted $11.38 billion in revenue versus the estimated $11.84 billion. 

The tech giant said it would significantly increase its 2026 capital expenditure to between $175 billion and $185 billion — more than double its 2025 spend. A significant portion of capex spending would go toward investing in AI compute capacity for Google DeepMind.

Barclays analysts said in a note Thursday that Infrastructure, DeepMind and Waymo costs ""weighed on overall Alphabet profitability,"" and will continue to do so in 2026. 

""Cloud's growth is astonishing, measured by any metric: revenue, backlog, API tokens inferenced, enterprise adoption of Gemini. These metrics combined with DeepMind's progress on the model side, starts to justify the 100% increase in capex in '26,"" they said. 

""The AI story is getting better while Search is accelerating - that's the most important take for GOOG,"" they added.

Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note Thursday that Alphabet has ""stunned the world"" with its huge capex spending plan. ""With tech in a current state of flux, it's not clear whether that's a good or a bad thing,"" they wrote.

Correction: This story has been updated to correct that Alphabet shares were down on Thursday.

In this article

Pandora, the world's largest jeweler by volume, rose Thursday after the company addressed investor concerns about its reliance on silver. 

Copenhagen-listed shares rose as much as 7% after it guided for largely flat organic growth in 2026 alongside its quarterly earnings report, and said it would introduce platinum-plated jewelry after the price of silver had more than doubled over the past year. Shares were last seen trading 4.9% higher. 

""If you look at our volatility of silver, one of the things that we have to [do] for the company is to decouple that from the silver trading,"" CEO Berta de Pablos-Barbier told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

""Varying our basket from new metals is going to help us, because we will not be so dependent on only one metal, which is today silver,"" she said, adding that about 60% of Pandora's business today was silver. 

While spot silver was down over 12% early Thursday at around $80 an ounce, it is still up more than 150% from about $30 an ounce a year ago.

Analysts have warned that the volatile price of silver was a ""pernicious problem"" for the Danish jeweler. A more pressured consumer has also impacted sales. 

Jefferies analysts on Tuesday said investors will be hesitant to engage with Pandora given recent silver moves. ""The challenges of the last few months will mean, even in a more normal silver price world, [Pandora] will remain substantially cheaper than even a year ago.""

Pandora stock has fallen around 60% over the past 12 months. 

This year, Pandora expects organic growth to land somewhere between negative 1% and 2%, and a profit (earnings before interest and tax) margin of between 21% and 22%.

De Pablos-Barbier, who took up the role as CEO last month, told CNBC that moving to a platinum-plated material and expanding its portfolio would allow the company to keep margins in the 20's. 

In the fourth quarter, organic growth was 4% as demand in the U.S. market, which accounts for about a third of its business, remained soft.

""The reality is that we are seeing the lowest consumer sentiment since the 60s in that market,"" De Pablos-Barbier said. ""This is nothing I can control, what I can control is what I bring to the brand and how much excitement and new products I can bring to the U.S. consumers, so that they continue to be loyal and they continue to come to our stores.""

Like-for-like growth, which measures sales across comparable stores, was flat in the quarter as well as during the first month of 2026, Pandora said.

It was also the first quarter of negative like-for-like growth since late 2022 in Pandora's strategically important ""Fuel with More"" segment, which focuses on expanding beyond the traditional charms it's known for into new categories like rings, necklaces and lab-grown diamonds, Citi analysts noted. 

""Extreme precious metals inflation has materially reduced earnings visibility,"" the analysts said. ""Near-term confidence is further undermined by a volatile US and European macro backdrop (~80% of sales) and potential signs of brand fatigue and broader jewellery consumption softening.""

The jeweler posted a 6% organic growth for 2025, preannounced in January, down from 13% in the previous year and missing its own guidance of between 7% and 8%.

Monday - Friday, 11:00 - 12:00 SIN/HK  |  0500 - 06:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's ""Inside India"" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse. Subscribe here.

""It's easier said than done,"" is a phrase I have now heard several times from different experts as we discussed the feasibility of the terms of the U.S.-India trade deal.

Less than a week after the India-EU trade pact was finalized, U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday announced in a post on Truth Social that he had agreed a deal with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling him a ""great friend."" 

Trump said Washington would cut tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%, while New Delhi will lower duties on U.S. goods to zero, replace Russian oil with supply from U.S. and Venezuela, open sensitive markets such as agriculture and buy $500 billion worth of American goods.

Modi, in his response on X, expressed delight over the lowering of tariff of 18%, thanked Trump and extended support for his ""efforts for [global] peace.""

Despite the outpourings of warm sentiment on both sides, the deal risks being derailed. What was said by the two leaders — and what was left unsaid — is already leading to confusion.

""US President Trump's claims that India will slash duties to zero, stop importing Russian oil, and raise US imports to US $500 bn have not yet been confirmed by the Indian authorities,"" said Alexandra Hermann, lead economist at Oxford Economics.

""They look unrealistic to us, which in turn raises risks of US backtracking,"" she added.

That would not be the first time Trump reverses a trade deal. 

Last month, Trump raised tariffs on South Korean imports back to 25% from 15%, pointing to a delay in the South Korean legislature approving the agreed trade deal.

Nomura in a report on Tuesday said that India's trade deal with the U.S. is a significant breakthrough, but  ""no deal is certain,"" citing Trump's renewed threat to raise tariffs on South Korea.

India's first official deviation from the terms of trade proposed by Trump came on Tuesday as New Delhi's Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said the deal will protect ""the interest of our agriculture and our dairy sectors in full respect.""

His counterparts in Washington, however, are doubling down on Trump's claim that India will remove non-tariff barriers to its agricultural market for the U.S. and remove tariffs on a majority of farm imports.

On Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said India will cut tariffs to zero on a ""vast"" set of agricultural goods, adding that there will be some protection around few certain key areas.

""For a variety of things like tree nuts, wine, spirits, fruits, vegetables, tariffs will go down to zero,"" Greer told CNBC's Squawk Box. ""It is a big win."" 

The domestic farm sector is important for both the U.S. and Indian administrations. 

In December last year, the Trump administration doled out a $12 billion aid package to support farmers, who are facing financial distress due to the trade war between the U.S. and its top economic partners. 

Washington needs newer markets, as trade ties with its second and fifth largest agricultural export markets, Canada and the European Union, respectively, have been deteriorating. The U.S. president even threatened Canada with 100% tariffs, if it signs a trade deal with China. His plans to annex Greenland have also led to souring of ties between the E.U. and the U.S.

As for India, farming is the primary source of livelihood for about 42% of India's 1.4 billion population — and is hence a politically sensitive issue. The Modi government's last attempt to introduce farm reforms ended in a failure in 2021, facing intense protests from farm lobbies in the country. 

India is likely to remain cautious about sweeping tariff reductions in ""politically sensitive areas such as agriculture"" where domestic considerations ""remain strong,"" said Reema Bhattacharya, head of Asia risk insight, corporate risk and sustainability at Singapore-based consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.

This year, three major state elections are due — in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, all of which are ruled by opposition political parties and have strong farm lobbies.

The Indian government has been scant with details about the trade deal and is battling questions from opposition political parties. The leader of India's opposition, Rahul Gandhi, has accused Modi of being ""Compromised"" and of having ""surrendered on Tariffs.""

""Without adequate adjustment measures, a surge in lower-priced food imports could displace certain indigenous products, dampen incentives for domestic value addition, and weaken parts of the FMCG ecosystem,"" said Nitin Bhasin, head of institutional equities at Indian brokerage and research firm Ambit. 

Questions are also being raised about the feasibility of Washington's demand for India to stop purchases of Russian oil completely and replace it with U.S. or Venezuelan oil. 

If India stops buying Russian crude entirely, it will damage the long-standing relationship between New Delhi and Moscow, experts said.

""New Delhi will not sever its strategically important relationship with Moscow,"" said Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House. 

On Wednesday, India's trade and commerce minister reiterated the country's position that energy security was a top priority for the government. He added that decisions around energy purchases were made based on market and ""evolving international dynamics.""

Despite U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies and repeated claims by Washington about India halting Russian oil imports, data from consultancy firm Rystad Energy shows Russia remains the top crude oil supplier to New Delhi with 1.06 million barrels per day shipped in January. 

Kremlin has insisted that New Delhi has not made ""any statements"" on stopping supplies from Russia. 

India is a price-sensitive buyer in the global oil trade, said Avani Bhatnagar senior analyst of oil markets at Rystad Energy, adding that ""India's pivot away from Russian crude would likely increase procurement costs."" 

Experts say that at present, Russian crude is cheaper than its peers due to U.S. sanctions, and replacing it with U.S. crude will not be economical because of higher freight costs.

Data from commodity intelligence firm Kpler shows that Russian ural crude is currently trading at a discount of $11 per barrel against U.S. Brent. Middle Eastern crude grades cost up to $9 per barrel more than Russian oil.

""Russian crude is significantly cheaper,"" said Muyu Xu, senior oil analyst at Kpler, adding that halting purchases would squeeze refining margins for Indian state-owned companies such as Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum.

With strategic and economic interests at stake, India is unlikely to stop Russian crude imports, according to experts. However, that is a key demand from Washington, so this could be another point of friction in the trade deal. 

""The energy tradeoff for India is potentially a worse import bill and current account pressures at a time when capital outflow pressures from India are persistent,"" said Louise Loo, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics.

Adding further stress to India's import bill is the commitment to buy more American goods. India's overall goods import stood at $720.24 billion in financial year 2025, with its trade deficit at $94.3 billion. That includes goods worth $45.3 billion from the U.S. 

Now, the U.S. administration wants India to buy half a trillion worth of American defense, transportation, energy and farm goods. Even at a staggered pace, experts believe this number would be hard to achieve.

""Analysts would be wise to ignore some of the numbers in the deal, or at least treat them as aspirational,"" Evan A. Feigenbaum, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in an article on Tuesday.

The Indian commerce minister has hinted that New Delhi could increase imports from the U.S. in sectors such as energy, nuclear power, data centers and aviation, but did not share much details. 

Bajpaee of Chatham House said that India could buy products from those sectors, but ""reaching the target of $500bn is a stretch.""

Neither side has announced an explicit date for the formal announcement of the deal but India's Goyal said a joint statement will be issued soon. 

Meanwhile, Bhattacharya of risk management firm Verisk suggests investors to look at ""headline pledges as opening positions rather than settled outcomes."" As negotiators hammer out details, she said there could be scope for ""renewed friction.""

Nitin Jain, chief executive and principal fund manager at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Singapore, said it needs to get earnings growth, which has faltered in the last 18 months, back on track. He added that Indian market valuations are below their 10-year average.

Pieter Elbers, chief executive of IndiGo, said the airline plans to expand its global network. He added that IndiGo was re-building its business after the massive disruption to operations in December.

Phillip Wool, head of research at Rayliant Global Advisors, said that India was a disappointment among emerging markets in 2025 and the budget did little to improve sentiment of disheartened foreign investors.

India courts Big Tech with long‑term tax breaks. India has announced a 20-year tax exemption for hyperscalers that use data centers in the country to service global clients, in a move that could shift artificial intelligence-driven businesses to the South Asian country.

China set to attend India's upcoming AI summit. China plans to send a delegation to India's upcoming AI summit in the latest sign of improving ties between the two neighbors.

Blackrock CEO, Indian billionaire give Indians advice on investing. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani want Indians to invest in the country's equity markets instead of gold.

Indian stocks dipped on Thursday, with the Nifty 50 index down 0.7% and the Sensex falling 0.6% as of 2.15 p.m. local time (3:15 a.m. ET). On year-to-date basis, both indexes are 2.09% and 2.38% lower respectively.The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield ticked down slightly to 6.67%, marking its third straight day of declining.

Happy Thursday. Taco Bell's parent company reported strong same-store sales growth for the chain yesterday, which makes me wonder how much my Crunchwrap Supreme orders contributed.

Stock futures are falling this morning. The S&P 500 saw another losing session yesterday.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Pressure on software stocks has intensified in recent days. While industry executives are telling investors not to panic, Wall Street appears unconvinced that the sector can continue to thrive as artificial intelligence pushes further into enterprise business.

Here's what to know:

Alphabet beat Wall Street's fourth-quarter expectations on both lines yesterday. The Google parent's cloud business reported a better-than-expected quarter, though its YouTube advertising totals came in lower than forecast.

Alphabet also announced that its capital expenditures spend for this year could be more than double its 2025 total, as the California-based company focuses on building out AI infrastructure. But Wall Street didn't seem to approve: Shares dropped more than 4% in premarket trading this morning.

On the other hand, companies who provide AI-related products to Google jumped after it unveiled its bold AI spending plan. Broadcom, which helps Google make the tensor processing units its AI software runs on, climbed as much as 6% in extended trading.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics said it would release December's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey at 10 a.m. ET today, two days after its planned release date. The data was delayed by the short-lived federal government shutdown.

Looking ahead, the all-important nonfarm payrolls report for January was pushed to next Wednesday, instead of tomorrow. Data on consumer prices and earnings will also be postponed, according to the BLS.

Other labor data this week has offered a bad omen for the forthcoming jobs data. The ADP said yesterday that private companies added fewer jobs than economists anticipated in January. This morning, Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that January layoffs were the highest for the month since 2009, surging more than 200% from December.

CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning.

President Donald Trump said in an interview yesterday that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ""should be very worried."" The comments come as Trump has threatened strikes on the country unless it agrees to a deal governing its nuclear program. ""They're negotiating with us,"" Trump told NBC News.

Oil jumped following Trump's comments, with U.S. crude and the global benchmark Brent each rising more than 3% yesterday. But oil prices fell overnight as traders looked ahead to talks between Washington and Tehran set for Friday.

As CNBC's Lee Ying Shan reports, Iran wants to focus the talks on its nuclear dispute with the West, while the U.S. also wants to discuss Iran's ballistic missile program and human rights record.

For more than a year, conservative activist Robby Starbuck has pressured companies to back out of the Corporate Equality Index, a two-decade-old assessment of how businesses treat LGBTQ+ employees. New data from the index's operator released yesterday shows the impact of the anti-DEI movement.

The Human Rights Campaign reported a 65% drop in Fortune 500 companies participating in its 2026 CEI index compared to last year. The number of participating Fortune 500 firms fell from nearly 380 to just over 130.

As CNBC's Laya Neelakandan reports, the HRC said that many companies who ceased involvement hold federal contracts. On the other hand, the group said more than 500 of the 1,450 companies that did participate achieved the top score.

Electric vehicle maker Rivian is banking on its forthcoming R2 vehicle to help it return to profitability. CEO RJ Scaringe gave CNBC's Robert Ferris an early look at the car.

CNBC's Jordan Novet, Seema Mody, Lisa Han, Arjun Kharpal, Samantha Subin, Kif Leswing, Sean Conlon, Sarah Min, Jennifer Elias, Spencer Kimball, Lee Ying Shan, Jeff Cox, Laya Neelakandan and Robert Ferris contributed to this report. Josephine Rozzelle edited this edition.

 Major stock indexes and bitcoin fell Thursday amid broad risk-off sentiment, as investors weighed the latest Big Tech earnings and downbeat labor data.


 The tech-heavy Nasdaq, benchmark S&P 500, and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average were down a respective 0.8%, 0.7% and 0.6% in recent trading, with the Dow shedding 300 points. The Nasdaq was on pace for its worst week since last April.


 Yesterday, technology shares led the Nasdaq and S&P 500 lower for a second straight session as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped 17%, while the Dow ended higher. AMD shares were down nearly 4% further in recent trading.


 Jobless claims for the week ending Jan. 31 came in at 231,000, higher than economists' estimates of 212,000 and the prior week's 209,000. In addition, U.S. employers announced more than 108,000 layoffs in January, per Challenger, Gray & Christmas data, their highest level for that month since 2009.


 Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) fell 3% Thursday, a day after the Google parent posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter results but said its 2026 capex would be between $175 billion and $185 billion, roughly double its 2025 level. Investors have been concerned about companies' AI spending in recent months.


 Qualcomm (QCOM) stock sank 7% after its current-quarter forecasts came up short of analysts' estimates, which executives attributed to the global memory shortage.


 In other post-earnings moves, shares of Peloton Interactive (PTON) plummeted 23%, Estee Lauder (EL) retreated 22%, Snap (SNAP) sank 10%, and Shell (SHEL) declined 4.5%. Hershey (HSY) surged 7.5% and Arm Holdings (ARM) added 7%.


 Investors are eagerly anticipating results after the close today from Amazon (AMZN), whose shares fell 3.5% to lead Dow decliners. Fellow Magnificent Seven stocks Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA), which fell a respective 3.8% and 3.4% yesterday, declined 1.5% and rose less than 1%, respectively.


 Bitcoin continued its descent, falling below $67,000—its lowest level since Donald Trump was re-elected U.S. president on Nov. 5, 2024 and recently trading around $66,700. Shares of bitcoin treasury firm Strategy (MSTR) sank 13% to pace Nasdaq decliners ahead of its earnings after markets close today.


 Silver futures, which had reached as high as about $121.75 an ounce last Thursday, sank 10% to below $76. Gold futures, which had surged to roughly $5,625 an ounce a week ago, slipped 1.2% to $4,890.


 The yield on the 10-year Treasury—which impacts interest rates on a variety of consumer loans including mortgages—fell to roughly 4.22% from Wednesday's close of 4.28%. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. benchmark, fell 2.4% to $63.60 a barrel.


 The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of global currencies, rose 0.2% to 97.76.


The Job Market Froze Over This Winter

 Layoff announcements were up and job openings down this winter as the job market's hiring freeze deepened, according to two barometers of the job market Thursday.The number of job openings fell to 6.5 million in December from 6.9 million in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday. That was the fewest since 2020. Another red flag popped up in consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas's layoff report for January, which showed companies announced 108,000 job cuts, the most for any January since 2009, and the fewest hires for that month since the firm began tracking hires that year.


 The indicators were unmistakable signs that the job market is being dragged down by President Donald Trump's tariffs, the immigration crackdown, and to a lesser extent, the rise of AI software.

 ""The labor market spent much of 2025 bending, but not breaking—and ended the year perilously close to a definitive breaking point,"" Cory Stahle, senior economist at job site Indeed, wrote in a commentary.


 The layoff rate remained low, suggesting that employers have not turned to large-scale cuts yet, but the risks of that are growing, several economists said.

Google Says Spending Could Double This Year Amid Its AI Push. Investors Don't Seem Excited

 Alphabet (GOOGL) shares slumped Thursday after the Google and YouTube parent laid out massive spending plans to support its AI ambitions.


 The shares were down over 5% in recent trading, after the company forecast $175 billion to $185 billion in capital expenditures this year as it builds out its AI infrastructure, roughly double the $91.45 billion Alphabet spent in 2025.


 With Thursday's move, Alphabet shed some $170 billion of its market value, pulling its market capitalization back below $4 trillion.


Justin Sullivan / Getty Images

 Some Wall Street analysts said they've only become more bullish about the stock after the company's latest results, however. Analysts from JPMorgan, Citi, and Wedbush lifted their price targets following Wednesday's earnings report, given what they viewed as strong signals of AI demand.


 ""We acknowledge the concern around investments,"" Citi analysts wrote. ""But given clear AI demand signals, we believe Google should be investing in product and in alleviating capacity challenges.""

Consumer Staples Is Only S&P 500 Sector in Green Today

 On a brutal day for the S&P 500, shares of consumer staples are a positive outlier.


 The S&P 500 Consumer Staples Sector was the only one of the 11 industries tracked by the benchmark index to trade in the green Thursday morning, rising some 0.7%.


 Four declined by more than 2%, with the Consumer Discretionary Sector down nearly 3%.


 Hershey (HSY) advanced 8% to pace consumer staples after the chocolate giant reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and issued a rosy 2026 outlook. Costco Wholesale (COST) and Coca-Cola (KO) also were among the top gainers in the sector, up nearly 2% and 1.5%, respectively.

The Great Inflation of 2021 Is Still Haunting the Fed

 The surge of inflation that took hold after the pandemic is still hurting household budgets and still very much on the minds of officials at the Federal Reserve.In recent public speeches, Fed officials talked about the long shadow of the burst of price increases in 2021 and 2022, and how that high inflation is still lingering in a diminished form. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.7% over the year in December—far lower than the four-decade high of 9% in 2022, but remaining above the elusive 2% goal for nearly five years.


 Fed officials held the central bank's key interest rate steady at their most recent meeting last month, after cutting it by a quarter-point at the previous three meetings to boost the job market. Concerns about inflation kept them from cutting the rate again, several Fed members said this week.


Samuel Corum / Bloomberg via Getty Images

 The fed funds rate influences borrowing costs on all kinds of loans. The Federal Open Market Committee typically lowers it to encourage spending and boost the job market, and raises it to do the opposite and push down inflation.


 This week, Fed officials continued to mull whether inflation or the threat of joblessness posed the biggest risk to the central bank's dual mandate to keep prices stable and employment high, and how much they should cut interest rates in the months ahead, if at all.""While we've made a lot of progress on inflation, it still remains above our target,"" Thomas Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said in a speech in South Carolina on Tuesday, according to prepared remarks. ""That's been the case since 2021.""

Qualcomm's Disappointing Outlook Stokes Worries About a Global Memory Shortage. The Stock Is Tumbling

 Qualcomm's stock is getting hammered amid worries about a worsening memory shortage.


 Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM) plunged over 9% in recent trading after the chipmaker gave a disappointing outlook for the current quarter, and pointed to a tightening supply of memory components that's impacting the smartphone market.


Ina Fassbender / AFP / Getty Images

 Qualcomm, which makes processors that are used in smartphones, laptops, and cars, said it expects a weaker smartphone market in the short term as companies navigate a global memory shortage that's expected to drive phone and laptop prices higher.

Bitcoin's Price Fell Below $70,000. That Means Extra Attention on Strategy's Earnings

 Bitcoin has slipped below another five-digit milestone.


 The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization—at about $1.39 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap—recently changed hands at prices not seen since late 2024, dropping below $70,000 apiece. The price hasn't been cut in half since its record highs of around $125,000, recorded last fall, but the retreat is nevertheless severe.


 The latest round of defections from bitcoin has come as investors have lately moved away from risk assets and, in some cases, shifted portfolio allocations toward more defensive plays. 


Getty Images

 Ask a market maven what's next and you're likely to get a range of answers. Bulls still talk about bitcoin's long-term potential—not just to recover, but to post the kind of parabolic returns it long saw. Bears see substantial further losses ahead. In the meantime, the trading action is hitting not only crypto assets itself but related stocks.


 One of those may fuel one or both of those narratives later today: Big bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR), previously known as MicroStrategy, is set to report quarterly results after today's close. The company earlier this week reported its latest purchase, which brought the adverage prices it's paid for the bitcoin it owns to around $76,000.

Ciena to Replace Dayforce in S&P 500

 Ciena (CIEN) has been tapped to move up to the S&P 500.


 After markets closed yesterday, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that the networking systems company will join the benchmark index from the S&P MidCap 400, effective before the opening bell next Monday, Feb. 9.


 Ciena will be replacing Dayforce after it was acquired and taken private by Thoma Bravo in a deal that closed Wednesday.

 In addition, S&P SmallCap 600 component Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (ARWR) on Monday will replace Ciena in the S&P MidCap 400, while ADT (ADT) will replace Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals in the S&P SmallCap 600.


 Ciena shares slipped 1% before the bell Thursday, while ADT and Arrowhead were up about 3% and 1%, respectively.


Don't Like Trump's Economy? Maybe You Will Next Year

 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent came to Congress Wednesday with a message to critics who say his administration's tariffs are not delivering on promises to re-industrialize the country: give it some time.


 Bessent answered questions from the House Financial Services Committee in a hearing Wednesday, addressing tariffs, the president's attacks on the Federal Reserve, and other economic matters.


 Bessent faced a mixture of supportive and critical questions from lawmakers during his testimony.


Win McNamee / Getty Images

 Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from New York, pointed out that the economy has lost thousands of manufacturing jobs every month since Trump imposed sweeping import taxes on most U.S. trading partners last year.


 Bessent said a slew of factories have broken ground in response to the tariffs, which are intended to tip the scales in favor of domestic manufacturing over imports. Those factories will take some time to get up and running, he said.

Peloton Stock Tanks on Weak Results, Outlook

 Peloton Interactive (PTON) reported weaker-than-estimated results for its holiday quarter. Its current-quarter and full-year projections aren't so hot, either.


 Peloton shares sank 9% in premarket trading Thursday after the connected fitness company posted less revenue and a wider loss than analysts were expecting.


 The New York-based firm reported a fiscal 2026 second-quarter loss of 9 cents per shares on revenue that slipped 3% year-over-year to $656.5 million. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha had expected a loss of 6 cents per share on revenue of $677.2 million.


Mike Kemp / In Pictures via Getty Images

 For the current quarter and full year, Peloton sees revenue of $624 million and a range of $2.40 billion to $2.44 billion, respectively. Visible Alpha consensus is for $637 million and $2.48 billion, respectively.


 In October, Peloton announced a relaunched product line and higher subscription and hardware prices.


 ""The new Cross Training Series is resonating in the marketplace, our subscription base is highly committed, our integrated Commercial Business Unit is growing and well-positioned to continue doing so, and Member engagement with Peloton IQ is encouraging,"" CEO Peter Stern said. ""Looking ahead, our focus remains on executing our strategy to increase our share of the growing global wellness economy while continuing to enhance our magic formula of premium hardware, intuitive software, and unmatched human coaching.""


 Peloton shares entered the day down 22% over the past year.


Amazon, UPS and Other Major Companies Are Making Big Job Cuts. Is AI To Blame?

 The labor market limped into 2026, and big layoff announcements in recent weeks have added fresh anxiety to the fragile jobs picture.


 Amazon.com (AMZN) said it plans to eliminate about 16,000 corporate roles, while United Parcel Service (UPS) announced 30,000 new job cuts, following an even larger reduction last year. Chemical manufacturing company Dow (DOW) slashed 4,500 jobs, or roughly 12% of its workforce, while Home Depot (HD) and Nike (NKE) each cut hundreds more.


Bess Adler / Bloomberg / Getty Images

 For many workers, the fear isn't just about layoffs—it's about why they're happening. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 71% of Americans worry artificial intelligence could permanently replace their job.


 With AI frequently cited in corporate earnings calls and layoff announcements, it's easy to connect the dots. But when economists and labor researchers dig into the data, a more complicated—and far less AI-driven picture—emerges.

A leaked pitch to reshape Ethereum's leadership exposed deep divisions over politics, power and ether's static price

US crypto developer Danny Ryan submitted a proposal in November 2024 to Vitalik Buterin, the founder and symbolic leader of Ethereum, a prominent blockchain powering the world's second-largest cryptocurrency. Ryan, who had worked for seven years at the Ethereum Foundation (EF), Ethereum's de facto governing body, suggested that Ethereum could be on the cusp of an era-defining shift.

Since its founding in 2014, the foundation had prioritized technical upgrades and had avoided centralizing power while its user base was growing, but Ethereum had now grown up, and the cryptocurrency world around it had grown up, too. The EF could now “exercise a stronger voice” without compromising its ethos of decentralization, Ryan said – and he was open to leading that charge if appointed as the foundation's new executive director.

Ryan told the Guardian that he could see how political tides were changing “overnight”, which informed his proposal. In part, his thesis drew from personal experience: He'd been served by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 2024, only to have the case summarily dropped, which he suspects was a pragmatic move to avoid alienating the tech sector during Joe Biden's re-election campaign. By November, with Donald Trump poised to return to the White House as the self-appointed “crypto president”, Ryan could identify “a massive American-shaped opportunity”.

Trump's re-election was heavily bankrolled by crypto companies and advocacy groups; the sector had established lucrative ties to the Trump family, and expected a slate of policy changes in its favor. A second Trump administration was likely to bolster the crypto industry's ability to expand into the traditional financial sector, and vice versa, further buoying up Ethereum's prospects. These new political and economic realities meant a “stronger voice” from the EF that could mean a windfall for Ethereum – a logic that helped catalyze a high-profile leadership shakeup within the Ethereum ecosystem, and, once the dust settled, anointed new leaders tasked with wooing Wall Street.

Despite strong winds at the industry's back, the value of Ethereum's proprietary cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), is down 20% from one year ago, part of a widespread slump in crypto's value. The price has remained almost unchanged since November 2024, when Ryan made his pitch, which is the same as it was in 2022, an asset at risk of depreciating in a world of high risk.

The Ethereum blockchain is a hub for hundreds of billions of dollars of financial products. Ether is the world's second largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization hovering around $400bn. Founded in 2013 by programmer Buterin, ether is also the largest cryptocurrency to have a known leader. The identity of the founder of Bitcoin, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency, is not publicly known. Following Ethereum's launch, Buterin and others established the EF as a non-profit tasked with cultivating the Ethereum ecosystem – a centralized, neutral entity designed to grow a decentralized technological movement – and writing grants to ecosystem participants in line with that mission; the EF holds more than $600m worth of ETH in treasury. Buterin sits on the EF's board.

“In crypto in general, there are two sides of the space: there's what they call the computer, and what they call the casino,” said Timour Kosters, the founder of Edge City, a series of pop-up residency programs affiliated with Ethereum. The “computer” side looks to tackle systemic issues by building tech solutions, Kosters explained; the “casino” side leans into finance, including some scams. The two most prominent ideological camps within Ethereum follow this rule of thumb. On one end is Ethereum's traditional and more libertarian ideological base, the “Cypherpunks”, who see privacy, decentralized protocols and freedom from state power as tools for individual freedom. On the other end, according to Paul Dylan-Ennis, a scholar who studies Ethereum's subcultures, is a more “pragmatist” and “populist” cadre motivated by the price of ETH and seeking to expand institutional adoption of Ethereum and ETH.

Ryan recalled the discussions with Buterin of his proposed strategic plan for the EF as being “positive”, and said the dialogue expanded to include other leaders within the foundation. That included Aya Miyaguchi, the organization's longtime executive director and a steward of Ethereum's traditional ideological core. But then news of these discussions was leaked to the public – opening the floodgates on social media.

On X, some Ethereum users clamored for Ryan's appointment, and lobbied for Miyaguchi's ouster. Eric Conner, a veteran Ethereum developer, suggested “it's revolt time” if the foundation failed to appoint Ryan as its new executive director. Some social media users posted death threats against Miyaguchi, which incensed Buterin.

Some Ethereum community members had been calling for leadership change at the EF over the course of 2024 – long before Ryan's strategic meetings with EF leadership. Many pragmatists thought the foundation was not proactive enough in growing Ethereum's adoption, including among financial institutions. Others blamed Miyaguchi for Ether's relatively static price, as ETH had not skyrocketed in value the way bitcoin and other coins had with Trump's rise.

Paul Brody, who leads blockchain initiatives at Ernst & Young and is the chairman of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a coalition of large businesses adopting Ethereum-based technology, said that, while critiques against Miyaguchi were “tinged with misogyny”, calling for a leadership change because of Ethereum's static price resembles standard investor discontents.

“In some ways, the Ethereum community is behaving a lot like pretty normal shareholders … They want a return on their investment,” he said.

In January 2025, Buterin responded to this community pressure, framing the threats levied against Miyaguchi as “pure evil”. He added that the complaints were “decreasing the chance I have any interest whatsoever in doing ‘what you want'”.

“The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me,” he tweeted.

A former member of the EF, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal foundation matters, said Buterin's social media post was a “turning point” and “uncharacteristic”, as the founder typically “pretended that [Ethereum] was in the hands of the community”. The former EF employee told the Guardian that EF management organized a foundation-wide retreat “in order to force” Buterin into naming a new executive director quickly, as Buterin “couldn't really make up his mind”, and Miyaguchi had wanted to step back “for a while”. The source added that, in personal conversation, Buterin dismissed Ryan's backers as a small but vocal American subset of the global Ethereum ecosystem. By the end, “the old management” was “almost universally hated” by the EF's employees, they said.

Another former EF employee, likewise speaking on the condition of anonymity, similarly noted that Buterin's tweets were a departure from his typical “cosplaying” that he didn't control Ethereum. Buterin and Miyaguchi have a close relationship, the former employee alleged, which informed Buterin's reluctance to find Miyaguchi's replacement more expediently, the source hypothesized.

They claimed Buterin “isn't over” the rejection of his work visa by US authorities in 2012 and remains “resolutely” against EF staff talking to US politicians. The former employee suspected this disfavor counted against Ryan, an American. Buterin only finalized a leadership change once he realized the extent of dissatisfaction within the EF, not just online, the employee concluded.

On 1 March 1, the EF announced the appointment of two co-executive directors: one from each strand of Ethereum's culture, according to Dylan-Ennis, the Ethereum scholar: Tomasz Stańczak, a former vice-president at Citi, and Hsiao-Wei Wang, a veteran Ethereum-focused engineer.

The EF's new leaders were brought on specifically with a “mandate of being more open, communicating more, and [being] responsible to the business world”, which is home to “builders focused on real-world use cases”, Stańczak told the Guardian in November. “Compared to previous years, there is probably much more green light for institutions to adopt Ethereum,” he added. The EF now operates a landing page designed for institutions interested in understanding and potentially adopting Ethereum technology.

Two former EF employees said these basic changes highlight the extent to which the foundation had previously adopted a “defensive posture” and had “worried about the SEC”, using opacity and plausible deniability to avoid legal action. To that end, the EF only published a public-facing organizational chart over the summer, partly anonymizing its employees prior to that shift. The foundation's growth and clear hierarchy also depart from its longstanding decentralized ethos; during her time as executive director, Miyaguchi had called for the EF to “subtract” in size and power over time.

“The surprising twist in recent times is now the EF is seen as very much directing ‘Ethereum the protocol' and, to some extent, ‘Ethereum the culture',” Dylan-Ennis said. “In this sense, [the foundation] has become more important than ever. It is too early to say whether this is for the better or the worse.”

Ryan emphasized in an interview that he has “the utmost respect for Aya Miyaguchi”. The public leak of their discussions around the EF's future led to “a lot of toxicity” that “threw off” their dialogue, he added. Buterin and Ryan decided to amicably “close the door” on their discussions by January 2025. Ryan said this was not solely because of the online campaign, but also due to differences in opinion about the Ethereum Foundation's next steps – including the “American-shaped opportunity” lying beyond the EF's interests.

Connected to other Wall Street-facing Ethereum evangelists by senior EF leadership, Ryan announced in February 2025 that he was co-founding Etherealize, an EF-aligned organization building and marketing Ethereum-based products for traditional financial institutions. Etherealize frequently exercises a strong voice for Ethereum as it does the rounds on Capitol Hill and Wall Street.

Vivek Raman, a co-founder of Etherealize, said Ethereum-focused sales cycles with large financial institutions once spanned years and involved frequent rejection, but are now accelerating, a sign Wall Street is warming to cryptocurrency. Major firms like JP Morgan, Fidelity and BlackRock are seeking to offer financial products issued on blockchains, in a process called “tokenization”, he said, predicting that a wave of these products will enter the market in 2026 after December 2025 launches.

However, ether, like other major cryptocurrencies, is still crawling back from a sudden drop in value.

“The price of crypto has fallen like 40% in the last six months,” said Brody of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. “You don't see people talking about the current leadership … the way they did about Aya 18 months ago. You just don't.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","cryptocurrency"

BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), the world's largest Ethereum-focused treasury company is now sitting on nearly $8 billion in paper losses after ether ETH$1,953.56 fell below $2,000 on Thursday.

The firm, helmed by well-followed Wall Street bull Thomas Lee, accumulated 4.29 million ETH at an estimated cost of $16.4 billion, according to data from DropStab. That stash is now worth just $8.4 billion at current prices. 

BMNR stock fell another 9% Thursday to its lowest point since the company pivoted to an Ethereum strategy. It has now tumbled 88% from its July peak, as investor concern grows on the firm's ETH exposure and collapsing prices.

Despite the sharp drawdown, BitMine is under no immediate pressure to liquidate its assets. Unlike many other digital asset treasuries, the company used equity issuance — and not borrowed funds — to fund its ether purchase spree and other investments.

The firm also holds $538 million in cash and has begun generating income from staking more than 2.9 million ETH, according to its Monday update.

""There is no pressure to sell any ETH at these levels, because there are not debt covenants or other restrictions/provisions,"" Thomas Lee said in a statement, ""BitMine is in a position to ride out crypto volatility while earning recurring income and staking rewards.""","{'href': 'https://www.coindesk.com', 'title': 'CoinDesk'}","cryptocurrency"

The
cryptocurrency market plunged for the third consecutive session on Thursday,
February 5, 2026, with Bitcoin dropping 3.5% to test $70,000, the lowest level
since November 2024, before recovering slightly to $71,340. 

XRP crashed
over 7% below $1.40, Ethereum fell to $2,068 (lowest since May 2025), and
Dogecoin battles support at $0.10 as $775 million in leveraged
positions were liquidated. 

In this article
I analyze XRP/USDT, BTC/USD, ETH/USDT and DOGE/USDT charts, answering the
question of why crypto is going down today.

Bitcoin's
price fell for the third straight session, dropping 3.5% to test $70,052,
the lowest since November 2024, before recovering to $71,340, down 1.5%. This
represents a decisive break below my target range of $74,000 that I've been
discussing since November.

While
I forecasted a potential bounce at $74,000, I practice reactive
analysis rather than wishful thinking analysis, which means I was prepared
for this scenario as well. With the breakdown confirmed, I'm
now targeting $68,000, where the 200-week exponential
moving average (200 WMA) runs on the weekly chart. That's where I'll
expect a demand reaction.

If that
level also fails to hold, I have my long-term ultra-bearish target around $52,000,
where the 100% Fibonacci extension based on the current trend lands. One thing
is certain: pressure on cryptocurrencies continues to persist.

Bitcoin is
now approximately 45% below its October peak near $126,000,
with the recent drawdown accelerating as expectations that BTC would never
revisit sub-$100K levels were shattered.

Joel
Kruger, crypto strategist at LMAX, offers perspective on the brutal selloff
while identifying potential bottoming signals.

""Price
action across crypto has been undeniably heavy over the past 24 hours, with
bitcoin acting as the primary drag on broader sentiment and ETH following
suit,"" Kruger notes. However, he points to emerging signs of exhaustion.

XRP is also
falling for the third consecutive session, and today is one of the strongest
declines this year, losing over 7% and testing levels below $1.40.
If we exclude October's flash crash, this is the lowest value since November
2024.

Breaking
the local support defined by April 2025 lows opens the path
toward targets in the $1.25-1.26 range, the minimums from
the aforementioned flash crash. If this level also fails to hold, I'm targeting
just $0.53 on the XRP chart.

What would
need to happen for me to change my bearish stance? Such scenarios are really
far away, XRP would need to return above $2.20, where the 200-day
EMA currently sits.

Dogecoin (DOGE), like BTC
and XRP, is falling for the third consecutive session and is fighting with
local support around the round level of $0.10, which coincides with
the lowest levels since September 2024.

Doge
already broke its important support at the end of January, located just
below $0.12, and is currently in short-term consolidation at
medium-term lows. Bearish pressure remains strong here, and breaking this level
will open the path to declines toward 2024 minimums around $0.08.

To relieve
pressure from Dogecoin's shoulders, we would need to wait until around $0.16,
where the 200 EMA sits.

Ethereum's
price, unlike the three charts mentioned above, is also falling for the third
consecutive session, deepening this year's lows on Thursday to $2,068—the
lowest value since May 2025.

Support
designated by June 2024 lows around $2,100 continues to hold
price in check, and today we also see a reaction at this level. As a result,
ETH is currently losing only 0.7% and changing hands at $2,132.

Although
bearish pressure persists, even if the current support breaks, the next support
sits around $1,760 (March 2025 lows), and the final ultimate
level around $1,400 (April 2024 yearly lows).

According
to my technical analysis, Ethereum prices could fall to $1,725 or lower
in February, aligning with the inverted cup and handle downside target,
which historically achieves its expected target with an 82% success rate.

I'll
abandon bearish scenarios when ETH returns at least to the consolidation range
drawn from November to the end of January, between $2,750 and $3,430.

Thursday's
crypto crash triggered a massive $775 million liquidation event across
major exchanges as Bitcoin plunged to $70,000. What began as a minor technical
correction ""accelerated into a mass capitulation of long positions,""
according to market analysis.

The violent
flush caught leverage traders off guard, with open interest ballooning
to unsustainable levels over the past week driven by retail FOMO and
aggressive perpetual positioning. When the floor gave way, algorithmic selling
pressure was instantaneous.

Recent data
shows over $800 million in leveraged liquidations impacting
around 165,000 traders, with the majority coming from long positions. This
follows the February 1 ""Black Sunday II"" event that saw $2.2
billion liquidated in 24 hours, the largest single-day wipeout since
October 2025.

""The
recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market has been swift and severe, with
analysts attributing the decline to the appointment of Kevin Warsh as the
prospective chair of the Federal Reserve, amid expectations that he might
reduce the Fed's balance sheet,"" according to Reuters.

Signs of
ongoing high interest rates have pushed the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)
above 97.5, making investors less interested in riskier assets like
Bitcoin. The Fed's January 28 hold at 3.50-3.75% with Powell stating he's
""not in a hurry to cut"" continued to weigh on risk assets, with real
yields remaining elevated.

Big
investors such as BlackRock have sold large amounts of Bitcoin, with $373.8
million leaving spot BTC ETFs recently. Bitcoin ETFs have continued
bleeding with cumulative multi-billion dollar outflows since mid-January,
removing spot bid support and forcing correlated selling in leveraged products.

With clear
breaks below key support levels across major cryptocurrencies, here are my next
technical targets:

Crypto

Current Price

Next Target

Ultra-Bearish Target

Bull Invalidation

Bitcoin

$68,000 (200-week EMA)

Crypto
crashed for the third consecutive session on February 5, 2026, with Bitcoin
testing $70,000 (lowest since Nov 2024), triggering $775 million in
liquidations. Kevin Warsh's Fed Chair appointment raised expectations for
balance sheet reduction and hawkish policy, pushing DXY above 97.5 and making
risk assets less attractive. 

Bitcoin
broke my November target of $74,000 and tested $70,052 before recovering to
$71,340. The next technical target is $68,000 where the 200-week EMA provides
critical support, with an ultra-bearish scenario targeting $52,000 (100%
Fibonacci extension). Analysts Peter Brandt and Michael Burry identify support
levels at $60,176 and $47,824 if $70,000 breaks. LMAX's Joel Kruger notes
Bitcoin is ""roughly 45% below its October peak"" with ""hallmarks
of capitulation now in place.""

XRP crashed
over 7% on Thursday to below $1.40—the lowest since November 2024 excluding
October's flash crash. Breaking April 2025 local support opens the path to
$1.25-1.26 (October flash crash lows), with the long-term ultra-bearish target
at $0.53. Bull invalidation requires a return above $2.20 where the 200-day EMA
currently sits, representing a 57% rally from current levels.

Bitcoin has slipped nearly 7% in the past 24 hours and is now drifting closer to the critical $70,000 mark, a psychological level that could deepen fear across the broader crypto market if it breaks. As traders prepare for a possible downturn, attention is shifting toward specific altcoins that can benefit. Ones that may stay resilient if Bitcoin crashes below $70,000.

While most tokens tend to fall alongside BTC during major sell-offs, BeInCrypto analysts have identified three cryptocurrencies  that are showing strong negative correlation, healthier chart structures, and improving capital flows. These signals suggest they could possibly outperform during market stress, making them potential opportunities even in a risk-off environment.

The White Whale (WHITEWHALE) is emerging as one of the few altcoins that can benefit if Bitcoin crashes under $70,000. All thanks to its growing independence from broader market trends. While most tokens have followed Bitcoin lower, the Solana-based WHITEWHALE has remained resilient. 

It gained nearly 17% over the past seven days and rose close to 20% in the past 24 hours. This relative strength suggests that traders are possibly rotating into the token despite wider market weakness.

Over the last week, The White Whale has posted a strong negative correlation of –0.67 with Bitcoin. This means it has often moved in the opposite direction. This decoupling is important in a risk-off environment. 

If Bitcoin crashes below $70,000, assets with low or negative correlation tend to attract speculative capital. And that makes WHITEWHALE one of the altcoins that can benefit from such a move. At the same time, the token is trading inside a bullish ascending channel on the 4-hour chart.

From a technical view, resistance sits near $0.127 and $0.143. A sustained move above this zone would confirm a breakout and open the path toward $0.226, implying upside of nearly 58% and a potential move into price discovery. On the downside, support lies at $0.098, with a deeper invalidation below $0.087. A break under these levels would weaken the bullish case and expose the price to a pullback toward $0.070.

Overall, The White Whale's negative correlation, strong short-term performance, and bullish chart structure position it as a high-risk, high-reward candidate if Bitcoin enters a deeper correction.

Bitcoin Cash is emerging as one of the altcoins that can benefit if Bitcoin crashes below $70,000, especially as it continues to show relative strength during broader market weakness. While the wider crypto market has slipped nearly 7% in recent sessions, BCH is down just over 1%, highlighting early signs of resilience. Over the past three months, it has also been up nearly 8%, making it one of the few large-cap altcoins still holding gains on a medium-term basis.

On-chain data supports this defensive setup. The Spent Coins Age Band metric, which tracks how many previously dormant coins are being moved, shows a sharp decline in activity. 

Since early February, this figure has fallen from around 18,900 coins to roughly 8,278, a drop of nearly 56% in just a few days. This means far fewer long-held BCH tokens are being sold, even as prices remain under pressure. When coins stay inactive during market stress, it often reflects growing holder confidence.

At the same time, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator, which measures whether large capital is entering or leaving an asset using price and volume, has risen steadily between January 29 and February 5. CMF has climbed back toward, and briefly above, the zero line, showing that large buyers are quietly increasing exposure despite weak sentiment elsewhere.

From a technical perspective, BCH needs to hold above $523 to maintain this structure. A daily close above $558 would strengthen the bullish case and open the path toward $615 and $655, with $707 as an extended target if conditions improve. 



However, failure to reclaim $523 could expose the price to a deeper pullback toward $466.

Hyperliquid's native token, HYPE, stands out as one of the altcoins that can benefit if Bitcoin crashes below $70,000. It is mainly because it has been moving in the opposite direction to BTC. Over the past month, HYPE is up nearly 28%, while Bitcoin has dropped around 24%. 

During the same period, its correlation with BTC stands at –0.71, showing a strong inverse relationship. This means that when Bitcoin weakens, HYPE has recently tended to rise, making it a candidate for traders looking for relative strength during market stress.

The HYPE price chart supports this divergence. After rallying toward the $38.43 zone earlier, HYPE entered a consolidation phase that now resembles a bullish flag-and-pole pattern. This structure usually forms when an asset pauses after a strong rally before attempting another upward move. If the upper trendline breaks, the pattern projects a potential upside of around 87%.

Capital flow data also remains supportive. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is still positive, showing that large buyers are active. However, CMF is moving below a descending trendline, meaning stronger inflows are still needed to confirm a new flag breakout.

For bullish confirmation, HYPE needs a clean daily close above $34.87. Clearing this level would open the path toward $38.43 first, and potentially toward the $65.70 zone if momentum builds. On the downside, weakness below $28.21 would damage the setup, while a fall under $23.82 would invalidate the bullish structure.

If Bitcoin crashes under $70,000 and HYPE maintains its negative correlation, strong structure, and inflow support, it remains one of the altcoins that can benefit from market stress rather than suffer from it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Liquidation grips altcoins as long positions collapse across majors","https://ambcrypto.com/leverage-unwind-grips-altcoins-as-long-positions-collapse-across-majors/","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:16:18 GMT","

Altcoins bore the brunt of the latest market sell-off as a wave of forced liquidations swept through major tokens.

Altcoins bore the brunt of market stress over the past 24 hours as a sharp leverage unwind triggered widespread liquidations across major tokens. The liquidations wiped out more than $1.4 billion in positions and exposing heavy long-side positioning among traders.

Data from Coinglass shows that the sell-off accelerated rapidly. Liquidations climbed from $427.8 million in just one hour to $661.6 million over four hours, before reaching $930.2 million within 12 hours. 

Over a full 24-hour period, total liquidations stood at approximately $1.44 billion.

Crucially, the bulk of the damage came from long positions. Of the $1.44 billion liquidated, around $1.26 billion were long trades, compared to just $187 million in short liquidations.

The imbalance points to a market that was positioned for a rebound in altcoins, only to be caught offside as prices continued to slide.

While Bitcoin's decline provided broader market pressure, liquidation data suggests that altcoins absorbed a disproportionate share of the forced unwinding. 

Ethereum led losses among major tokens, recording more than $120 million in liquidations within the last hour alone, as leveraged long positions were flushed across multiple exchanges.

Solana followed with roughly $33 million in liquidations, while XRP saw more than $13 million wiped out over the same period. 

Dogecoin and Sui also registered elevated liquidation activity, underscoring how widespread the deleveraging event became across large-cap and mid-cap altcoins.

Exchange-level data reinforces the scale of the move. On a 24-hour basis, long liquidations dominated across major trading venues, with platforms such as Binance, Bybit, Hyperliquid, OKX, and Gate all recording significantly higher long-side losses than short-side liquidations. 

The pattern points to a coordinated unwind rather than isolated exchange-specific events.

Beyond headline figures, the pace of liquidations has become a key concern. In several instances, liquidation spikes occurred within narrow time windows, amplifying downside momentum as forced selling fed into falling prices. 

Such rapid cascades often exacerbate volatility, particularly in altcoins where order books tend to be thinner and leverage usage higher than in Bitcoin markets.

Historical liquidation data over the past 90 days shows similar episodes coinciding with abrupt market corrections. 

However, the current episode ranks among the more severe in terms of long-side dominance. This type of leverage reset is a short-term stabilizing force, albeit one that often comes at the cost of sharp price drawdowns.

With a significant portion of leveraged longs already cleared, near-term price action may stabilize if selling pressure eases. 

However, continued volatility remains a risk should broader market weakness persist or if traders attempt to re-enter positions too aggressively.

Startale Group and SBI Holdings, Inc. unveiled Strium Network (“Strium”), a new Layer-1 blockchain platform aimed at building trading and settlement infrastructure for tokenized securities and real-world-asset-linked products.

The announcement represents the first major milestone from the strategic partnership announced in August 2025, with a proof of concept complete and ready to demonstrate its approach to delivering institution-ready onchain capital market infrastructure.

Strium is designed to support 24/7 trading in spot and derivatives tied to tokenized securities and to connect with both blockchain networks and traditional finance infrastructure.

Leveraging SBI Holdings' ecosystem of more than 80 million existing customers and expertise across securities, banking, and financial services, Strium is uniquely positioned to bridge institutional demand, professional trading activity and real world market participation onchain. As demand grows for more sophisticated ways to express macro, equity, and cross asset views, Strium positions itself to serve as the foundational trading and settlement infrastructure for Asia's onchain securities markets.

Strium:  Building the Infrastructure for Onchain Securities

Building on the August 2025 partnership announcement, which positioned the alliance at the forefront of the $18.9 trillion tokenized asset market opportunity, Strium addresses a fundamental shift now underway in institutional and professional markets. Positioned as the core infrastructure for Asia's onchain securities market, Strium will provide the rails for tokenized securities and RWA-linked instruments to scale while remaining interoperable with global financial systems.

From Vision to Execution: Proofs of Concept Delivered

The unveiling of the Strium platform coincides with proofs of concept (“PoC”) developed in parallel, now ready to validate the platform's exchange architecture, settlement efficiency and interoperability with both traditional financial infrastructure and blockchain networks.

The PoC will demonstrate key technical capabilities around settlement efficiency, resilience under high-load, and interoperability with both traditional financial systems and blockchain networks. They serve as the foundation for further development, partner integration, and regulatory engagement. Strium plans to open the platform to a limited group of early participants as it progresses toward commercial deployment.

The Path Forward for Strium

Strium represents a long-term commitment by Startale and SBI Holdings to shaping the future of onchain capital markets. The current PoC phase is a critical step in validating this vision and building the foundation for a platform that can deliver on these ambitious goals. Further announcements regarding Strium will be shared in the coming months as Strium progresses toward commercial deployment.

What I saw in Fort Lauderdale

I returned to the Blockchain Futurist Conference after years away, not quite knowing what to expect. The last time I set foot in a hall like this, it felt like a casino floor: endless booths hawking tokens, hype, and noise. Walking into the violet‑tinted expo space in Fort Lauderdale, I felt the familiar thrum of people and machinery, but the conversation had shifted.



Instead of endless talk of pumps and memes, I heard serious chatter about real-world assets (RWAs), regulated currencies, and business ideas designed for scale. I still saw neon signs and spinning tickers, but I also watched entrepreneurs demonstrate tools like Peace Through Trade, where applause mingled with the crowded echo of a hall full of curious onlookers. Old friends greeted me with fist bumps, new faces shared ideas about compliance and utility, and somewhere between the laughter and the mic checks, I realized there was a genuine question in the air: Are we finally leaving the era of pure speculation behind? If you'd like to see some of these moments for yourself, there are two short videos embedded later in this article.

In a quieter corner of the conference, I sat down with a representative from Peace Through Trade. We talked about the evolution from the initial coin offering (ICO) free‑for‑all toward discussions of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and RWAs. He reminded me that giants in emerging industries collapsed because they ignored legal foundations. Their team is building their platform to satisfy banks and even United Nations‑adjacent programs, and that compliance‑first approach felt like a breath of fresh air.

Later in the day, nostalgia took over as I wandered to the DeLorean booth. Standing beside motifs of the gull‑wing prototype, I learned that the company plans to tokenize the business and individual cars so fans can actually own a stake in putting new DeLoreans on the road. That idea, a token tied to an object you can touch, felt like a different league from the pitch decks of the past. There were still corners of the conference devoted to speculative coins, but there were also sparks of genuine innovation that challenged me to work harder and stay curious.

The utility vs speculation test

As I made my way through Futurist 2025, I kept a simple question in mind: Does this project have a product I can understand and a path to market, or is it just a token with a slick pitch?

That question guided every conversation and demo. When the Peace Through Trade team talked about building within existing legal frameworks, working with banks instead of evading them, and creating auditable records of trade, I leaned forward. Those words: compliance, transparency, partnerships, were mostly absent during the last bull run. By contrast, there were booths with spinning prize wheels and anonymous ICOs and later non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that promised easy riches but refused to name partners or lay out a business model.



The DeLorean idea passed my test because it tied tokens to a brand you can touch. Fans would be able to help finance the manufacturing of cars and share in the value of the company. It isn't a promise of quick wealth; it's an experiment in ownership and financing. The line between utility and speculation isn't always obvious, but when teams are willing to talk about regulation, partners, and deliverables, you can feel the difference in their approach and in your own gut.

What I want builders to take from this

If there's a moral to my return to this conference, it's that our community is at a turning point. The pump‑and‑dumpers haven't disappeared, and there are still booths with loudspeakers promising the moon, but there is also a growing cohort of entrepreneurs who prioritize compliance, durability, and integration. They invest in research and legal opinions and spend time talking to regulators and potential partners. Builders should remember that speculation makes headlines, but without trust, you cannot build anything that lasts.

Projects like Peace Through Trade and DeLorean show that if you invest in legal frameworks, transparency, and partnerships, you can start to build products that real businesses and governments might adopt. That's the only path to making BSV and other blockchains part of everyday life, rather than carnival sideshows.

Watch the clips

While I hope this story stands on its own, we've also produced short videos that capture some of these moments and conversations. If you want to see the thrum of the expo floor, hear the hum of machines, and witness the sincerity in the voices of people trying to build something real, our two-part clips are embedded above.

Whether you are a skeptic or a believer, I invite you to watch them, feel the energy for yourself, and decide where you stand in the conversation about utility versus speculation. And if you see me at the next event, whether over a cup of coffee or a debate about scaling, please come say hello. I'll be there.

A study has found that supplementing with the naturally occurring bioactive compounds N-trans caffeoyltyramine (NCT) and N-trans feruloyltyramine (NFT) improves glycemic control markers in prediabetic adults. The ingredient was shown to stabilize blood sugar without weight loss, drug use, or changes in diet.

The health science innovation platform Brightseed recently commercialized the ingredient as BioMetaControl, containing the two compounds. Brought to market as a GLP-1 companion, the researchers highlight its ability to maintain blood sugar stability when patients discontinue the weight-loss drug.

“This study represents one of the first rigorous human clinical trials validating the glucose-regulatory potential of NCT and NFT,” says Swati Kalgaonkar, co-author and head of Medical & Scientific Affairs and Clinical Research at Brightseed.

“By integrating fasting biomarkers and continuous glucose monitoring, the research provides a more comprehensive picture of how these bioactives support glucose regulation in individuals at risk for metabolic disease.”

The study was funded by Brightseed and has been published in Bioactive Compounds in Health and Disease.

It was conducted by researchers at the National Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation (N-DOC) in New Delhi, India. They conducted a four-week trial involving 126 prediabetic participants with a BMI of 25 to 30. 

The participants received either 120 mg/day of NCT/NFT or a placebo. The two compounds act as potent agonists of HNF4α — a transcription factor that plays a central role in insulin secretion, glucose sensing, and hepatic glucose production.

Participants who received the supplement experienced reductions in fasting blood glucose.Participants who received the supplement experienced reductions in fasting blood glucose and improvements in fasting insulin and postprandial glucose responses.

The researchers also observed a reduction in time spent outside the ideal glucose range, as measured by continuous glucose monitoring, in the NCT/NFT group compared to the placebo group. No change in body weight was observed in the intervention group. 

“The incidence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes continues to increase worldwide,” says Dr. Anoop Misra, co-author of the study and director at N-DOC.

“Once a blood glucose control target is achieved with drug intervention, daily consumption of functional food ingredients or nutraceuticals that support ongoing healthy blood glucose regulation is warranted.”

Study co-author Dr. Seema Gulati, head of the nutrition research group at N-DOC, adds: “Improved blood glucose regulation helps avoid glycemic excursions — energy highs and dips, as those felt by the study subjects before NCT/NFT supplementation — and this may explain the unsolicited testimonials received from the study subjects around feeling improved all-day energy levels.”

The study concludes that its insights help establish NCT/NFT supplementation as a promising candidate for clinical nutrition strategies and functional food formulation to support healthy blood glucose regulation. 

The study highlights its potential for adults weaning off GLP-1 drugs to help maintain healthy blood glucose levels.It highlights that one such clinical nutrition strategy is for adults weaning off GLP-1 drugs to help maintain healthy blood glucose levels.

Brightseed says the study serves as a proof point for a more systematic and AI-driven approach to bioactive discovery. “One that connects biological insight, mechanistic reasoning, and clinical validation earlier in the innovation process.”

The company notes that the new findings highlight the potential role of dietary bioactives as part of a broader lifestyle- and nutrition-based approach to metabolic health, rather than prior research focused on pharmaceutical interventions.

Recent research has also shifted focus from pharma to nutrition. For example, one study found that the Nordic Diet — high in dietary fiber from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, with a low percentage of saturated fat — could aid therapies for both type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. 

Scientists are stressing the need for prediabetic adults to focus on nutrition, given its essential role in blood glucose regulation.

Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, announced Thursday it is cutting 25% of its workforce and exiting operations in the UK, EU and Australia as part of a major restructuring.

The move comes as Bitcoin dropped below $70,000 Thursday morning, erasing gains made since its $69,000 all-time high in late 2021.

The exchange said it would refocus its business around the US market, AI-powered productivity and prediction markets. In its “Gemini 2.0” update, the company emphasized that smaller, AI-augmented teams are now more effective and aligned with its evolving mission.

Gemini highlighted early traction in its Gemini Predictions platform, which has processed over $24 million in volume since launching in December.

The news comes as Gemini confirmed it will shut down its NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway on February 23, following a prolonged decline in NFT trading volumes. Users have been instructed to withdraw their assets before the shutdown, though NFT support will continue through Gemini Wallet.

The announcement coincided with fresh pressure on crypto markets. Gemini stock, which debuted in September 2025, fell nearly 7% on Thursday, extending losses to nearly 80% from its IPO price and marking a new all-time low.

Gemini said narrowing its geographic footprint and product focus would help lower expenses and accelerate its path to profitability.

Key Takeaways

On-chain metrics confirm 659,000 BTC in reserves, proving institutional stability despite viral “bank run” social media rumors.

Current outflows are 82% lower than 2022 stress levels, with a 0.6% withdrawal velocity showing no systemic crisis.

Binance is converting its $1B SAFU fund into Bitcoin to build a decentralized, anti-fragile shield for user protection.

Market anxiety often clouds financial reality, and the latest wave of Binance Collapse FUD proves no exception. Despite social media claims of a “bank run,” on-chain data reveals that Binance maintains institutional-grade resilience with a stable 659,000 BTC in reserves. While rumors suggest distress, the exchange's liquidity metrics actually show a fortress-like stability that contrasts sharply with the frantic narratives currently saturating the digital space.

Binance collapse FUD recently reached a fever pitch as social media users weaponized what happened on October 10, 2025, when the market endured a $19.5 billion wipeout. While Binance attributes the crash to a “macro shock” involving high leverage and Ethereum network congestion, critics argue that Binance's internal pricing indices relied too heavily on its own order books, causing “wicks” that triggered unnecessary liquidations. The exchange acknowledged this technical strain but compensated impacted users and also strengthened its safeguards.

In early February 2026, the digital hysteria intensified. Viral posts on X and Telegram claimed that Binance “froze withdrawals” during a critical twenty-minute window and suffered an 8.5% depletion of its stablecoin reserves. These reports led many to ask if the industry was witnessing a repeat of the historic FTX collapse.

Binance is currently operating under crisis level PR mode to gain back the trust of users, but it might be too late 👇

First, CZ told us small accounts are being paid by his competitors to fud him and Binance (just like SBF did before the bank run on FTX).

But that didn't work,… https://t.co/4brApBeqVD pic.twitter.com/rlDUvZQyXh

— Cowboy (@COWBS) February 3, 2026



Changpeng Zhao (CZ) countered these claims with characteristic directness. He suggested that rival entities actively fund “paid FUD” to erode Binance's market share during periods of price discovery. CZ also dismissed rumors that he “cancelled the 2026 supercycle,” clarifying that he merely lacks his previous level of unbridled market confidence due to the overwhelming negativity currently saturating the digital space.

In a market governed by volatile headlines and emotional tweets, raw data remains the only objective truth. When we look past the sensationalist screenshots, the data on blockchain tells a story of significant strength rather than systemic weakness.

Despite the prevailing narrative of a “bank run,” Binance's core Bitcoin reserves currently stand at a staggering 659,000 BTC. To put this in perspective, at the close of 2025, Binance held 657,000 BTC. The current balance represents a slight increase during one of the most stressful macroeconomic periods in the last three years.

Furthermore, these reserves have climbed 7% since they bottomed out on July 10, 2025, which suggests that long-term conviction holders continue to view the platform as a primary custodian, even as Bitcoin prices fluctuate between the $75,000 and $80,000 range.

When critics point toward “reserve deterioration,” they ignore the fact that the exchange currently maintains a liquidity buffer that rivals the largest traditional financial institutions in the world. Binance possesses the depth to absorb shocks that would shatter smaller competitors.

The loudest voices on social media recently claimed that Binance is facing “crisis-level” withdrawals. Analysts at CryptoQuant and other on-chain data providers offer a sobering counter-narrative. Daily Bitcoin netflows, the measure of assets moving in versus assets moving out, currently fluctuate within a range of -7,000 BTC.

While a negative flow sounds alarming to the uninitiated, historical context provides the necessary perspective. During the genuine “Black Swan” event of December 2022, following the FTX collapse, Binance processed daily net outflows exceeding -40,000 BTC. The current “panic” is roughly 82% lower than the stress levels seen in 2022.

In fact, current netflow patterns mirror the stable levels observed consistently since June 2023. Data on the blockchain suggests that the current withdrawal surge is essentially a ripple compared to the tidal waves of the previous bear market. Binance processes these flows as part of a routine operational cycle, not a liquidity emergency.

Is Negative Netflow That Bad? – Source: CryptoQuant

Professional financial analysts use the Netflow-to-Reserve (NtR) ratio as a definitive “stress thermometer” for cryptocurrency exchanges. This metric tracks the velocity of withdrawals relative to total assets. In January 2026, Binance's NtR ratio stood at 0.006 (0.6%).

To understand why this number is “noise” rather than “panic,” we must compare it to actual collapses:

Perhaps the most significant strategic move in early 2026 involves the transformation of the Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU). On January 29, Binance announced its intention to convert its entire $1 billion emergency insurance fund from stablecoins into Bitcoin, serving two critical strategic purposes:

By February 2, 2026, Binance successfully completed the first $100 million conversion, purchasing approximately 1,315 BTC at an average price of $77,409. The platform has committed to maintaining this fund at a minimum value of $1 billion. Should the SAFU fund dip below $800M due to market swings, Binance will top it up with Bitcoin, turning the SAFU fund into a decentralized, anti-fragile fortress that protects users regardless of the external noise.

Setting itself apart from traditional hackathons, this event marks Solana's foray into AI-exclusive development challenges. These AI agents utilize an array of tools, including smart contracts, wallets, and APIs, to construct a variety of applications from DeFi automation to consumer-oriented apps. Solana's high-speed, low-cost infrastructure supports the dynamic and real-time operational capabilities required by the AI agents.

Community involvement is a key feature of this event, with voting open from February 2 through February 12. Participant engagement is facilitated through Colosseum's platform, ensuring transparency and community-driven outcomes. The hackathon commenced with open project submissions on February 2, which will conclude on February 12, with the announcement of winners scheduled for February 16.

Although the hackathon features significant monetary incentives, its experimental essence is emphasized by the organizers. They note that the allocation of prizes is subject to meticulous verification and eligibility checks. This pioneering initiative focuses on exploring new ways in which AI can autonomously interact with blockchain technologies.

The implications of the Agent Hackathon extend beyond its immediate environment. While not exclusively focused on gaming, the innovative uses for web3 and interactive services are substantial. AI agents, with the capacity to manage digital resources, could revolutionize gaming environments and other interactive platforms by introducing more dynamic elements such as complex non-player characters (NPCs).

As the hackathon progresses, insights into the viability and impact of AI agents as independent blockchain actors are anticipated. Although transformative changes might not be immediate, this event signifies a strategic move towards integrating more autonomous functionalities in digital and decentralized frameworks. This could set new precedents for the development and maintenance of projects on decentralized networks, shaping future technological advancements in the blockchain domain.

Updates on Developments in Data Privacy and Cybersecurity

AI agents have arrived. Although the technology is not new, agents are rapidly becoming more sophisticated—capable of operating with greater autonomy, executing multi-step tasks, and interacting with other agents in ways that were largely theoretical just a few years ago. Organizations are already deploying agentic AI across software development, workflow automation, customer service, and e-commerce, with more ambitious applications on the horizon. As these systems grow in capability and prevalence, a pressing question has emerged: can existing legal frameworks—generally designed with human decision-makers in mind—be applied coherently to machines that operate with significant independence?

In January 2026, as part of its Tech Futures series, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”) published a report setting out its early thinking on the data protection implications of agentic AI. The report explicitly states that it is not intended to constitute “guidance” or “formal regulatory expectations.” Nevertheless, it provides meaningful insight into the ICO's emerging view of agentic AI and its approach to applying data protection obligations to this context—insight that may foreshadow the regulator's direction of travel.

The full report is lengthy and worth the read. This blog focuses on the data protection and privacy risks identified by the ICO, with the aim of helping product and legal teams anticipate potential regulatory issues early in the development process.

At the outset, the ICO's report emphasizes that agentic AI can both exacerbate existing data protection issues and introduce new ones—particularly as human oversight becomes more difficult when agents operate with greater autonomy in less predictable environments. Despite this increasing independence, the report makes clear that organizations remain fully responsible for ensuring personal information is used appropriately.

The ICO also stresses that placing governance responsibility on end users is unlikely to be workable in all cases. As a result, the burden may fall on suppliers to implement robust controls prior to deployment and to ensure that agentic AI systems are fit for their intended purposes.

The report notes that the drive to automate complex tasks may embed automated decision-making (ADM) into agentic AI operations. When such decisions have legal or similarly significant effects on individuals, enhanced obligations under UK data protection law are triggered.

Takeaways: The ICO recommends that organizations assess when their agentic AI system may make or contribute to a decision affecting individuals. When the impact could be “legal or similarly significant,” organizations should (i) clearly inform affected individuals about the system's use; (ii) enable individuals to contest decisions; and (iii) allow for meaningful human intervention. Further guidance is expected from the ICO in the form of a code of practice on AI and ADM, with an interim update on ADM and profiling anticipated early this year.

Art. 5(1)(c) of the UK GDPR requires personal information to be “adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary” for the specified purposes of processing. The report recognizes that what's “necessary” becomes harder to ascertain when the scope of an agent's activities is uncertain. For versatile agentic systems, use cases may seem nearly endless, creating pressure to define purposes broadly. The ICO flags this as a potential compliance risk.

Takeaways: The ICO advises organizations to resist drafting expansive purpose statements that attempt to cover every conceivable use. Instead, it recommends assessing and defining purposes at each processing stage—which, the regulator points out, may help scope activities, support compliance assessments, and document such compliance. On data minimization, the ICO offers several principles to bear in mind: avoid processing personal information “just because” it may be useful someday; enable users to select which tools and databases the AI system can access; and consider additional safeguards such as requiring human approval before accessing personal information, data masking, observability techniques, and transparency notices.

The UK GDPR requires personal information to be accurate (and promptly rectified if it is not). The ICO notes, however, that agentic systems built on probabilistic models rather than logical reasoning may be prone to hallucinations. The report also highlights that agentic AI's ability to infer and generate new personal information at scale may compound accuracy challenges.

Takeaways: The ICO underscores that the “significant and growing quantities” of personal information processed by agentic AI remain fully subject to the UK GDPR's data protection obligations. With respect to accuracy, the ICO notes that different contexts may require different accuracy thresholds depending on the risk of harm. In addition, although techniques such as chain of thought reasoning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) can enhance accuracy, the ICO cautions that they do not change the fact that LLMs generate text based on patterns—so hallucinations may still occur. Notably, the ICO has already provided additional guidance on the data protection implications of hallucinations in its response to its call for views on generative AI.

The report flags that agentic systems, particularly when pursuing open-ended goals, may encounter or infer special category data in unexpected ways, even when the system's purpose does not directly involve processing special category data.

Takeaways: The ICO emphasizes that processing special category data requires a valid lawful basis under Article 9 UK GDPR and that individuals must be informed when their special category data may be used or inferred. The report warns that explicit consent (a commonly relied upon basis) may be difficult in the agentic AI context unless individuals have a genuine choice (e.g., the system can be used without special category data if the user chooses). When obtaining a valid Article 9 basis (such as consent) is not feasible, the ICO recommends considering technical measures to restrict the system's ability to infer or use special category data.

The report acknowledges that the complexity of agentic AI systems and their data flows may make it difficult to explain to individuals how and why their personal information may be processed. This challenge may be exacerbated as agents increasingly communicate with other agents in ways that are not directly observable to humans.

Takeaways: The report identifies several features of agentic AI that can hinder organizations' ability to understand and clearly articulate how personal data is processed. Despite these difficulties, the ICO reiterates that transparency requirements still apply. In particular, the report notes that organizations should clearly identify themselves as the supplier, how and why they use people's personal data, and the data rights available to individuals. The report also stresses that organizations must consider how they will meet their transparency obligations before data processing occurs and, where appropriate, conduct data protection impact assessments (DPIAs).

The report notes that opaque data flows and multi‑agent interactions can make it difficult to honor data subject rights—such as access and rectification—because locating and correcting personal data across interconnected components may be challenging. The ICO also cautions that agents that learn from their environment may drift from their original scope, potentially processing personal information in unexpected ways and raising concerns under the UK GDPR's fairness principle.

Takeaways: The ICO stresses that organisations must embed data protection by design from the outset—building mechanisms for data subject rights compliance directly into agentic systems. Without having robust technical and organizational measures in place, the complexity of agentic AI may make it harder to respond to rights requests or detect unfair processing.

Technical approaches exist to review what an agent is doing in real time or retrospectively, but the report notes that it remains unclear whether organizations can monitor agents effectively at scale. The ICO also flags that accountability challenges may extend to Data Protection Officers (DPOs), who are tasked with monitoring compliance and advising on DPIAs. In particular, ad hoc experimentation by employees with agentic systems can complicate DPO oversight, as unstructured deployments may lead to unanticipated processing of personal information.

Takeaways: The ICO suggests that strong governance structures and clearly defined parameters for employee experimentation with agents may help mitigate some of the risks. Interestingly, the report also points to emerging opportunities for agentic AI to support oversight functions—for example, through “DPO agents” that can assist human staff by scanning for high-risk activities, assisting with compliance tasks, or detecting security issues.

The report explains that agentic AI systems may introduce novel attack surfaces. For example, malicious actors may attempt to distort an agent's goals, manipulate its reasoning, compromise supply chains, or poison data in the agent's memory. The ICO also warns that risks of surveillance and data breaches may increase when tools are designed to concentrate large volumes of personal information, such as personal assistant-style agents with access to communications, calendars, accounts, and credentials.

Takeaways: The ICO's analysis suggests that organizations should consider threat models tailored to the unique characteristics of agentic architectures. The report notes that potential taxonomies of threats and mitigations are under development, including the Open Web Application Security Project's threats and mitigations list, which highlights new attack vectors that agentic AI might introduce.

The ICO's report signals that agentic AI is an area of active regulatory focus. As part of its AI and biometrics strategy, the regulator has committed to monitoring developments, engaging with industry through workshops to deepen its understanding, and offering support to organizations navigating these issues.

         February 05, 2026
      

The United Kingdom's data protection authority, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), has opened a formal investigation into X (formerly Twitter) over image manipulation and the use of personal data in connection with the AI system Grok.

The probe follows widespread reports that the AI chatbot was used to generate harmful and explicit imagery.

The ICO's action comes amid mounting international scrutiny of Grok's image-generation capabilities, which critics say have been exploited to produce “deepfakes” and other visuals manipulated without individuals' consent.

Such uses raise serious concerns under UK data protection laws, particularly regarding whether personal data was processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently, and whether robust safeguards were in place during the development and deployment of the technology.



According to its statement, the ICO will investigate:

The regulator emphasized that failures in appropriate protections could leave people vulnerable to serious, immediate harm — particularly when children are involved.

William Malcolm, the ICO's executive director of Regulatory Risk and Innovation, commented that the reports raise “deeply troubling questions” about the handling of personal data and the extent to which individuals may have lost control over their own information.



The ICO's investigation builds on earlier engagements with Grok's operators. On January 7, 2026, the watchdog publicly confirmed it had contacted XIUC and X.AI to urgently request information about reported issues with Grok's outputs and the data governance measures supporting them.

This action also runs alongside a separate probe by the UK's online safety regulator, Ofcom, which is examining whether the platform has complied with the Online Safety Act — including obligations to protect users from illegal or harmful content, such as non-consensual intimate images.

Regulators in the European Union and other jurisdictions have also begun their own reviews into Grok's functionality and potential harms, sparking a wave of concern about AI content governance.

Most recently, the Paris prosecutor's office (Parquet de Paris) are investigating alleged algorithmic manipulation by foreign powers.



The ICO's investigation underscores a growing regulatory focus on AI accountability, especially around generative models that can manipulate or create fabricated representations of real people.

Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the risks of AI-generated content. According to the Bitdefender 2025 Consumer Cybersecurity Survey, more than a third of respondents named the creation of deepfake videos one of their biggest concerns.

Trust in ‘Big Tech' often differs by geography. Europeans tend to be stricter about safeguarding personal details, shaped by years of GDPR-driven awareness. While American consumers focus on convenience, Europeans are more attuned to privacy.

In the context of mounting scrutiny of X, it's worth noting that participants in our survey – conducted from June to September 2025 polling more than 7,000 internet users across seven countries – expressed skepticism regarding X's conduit on privacy and security, with 52% naming it a “least trusted” player.

As European regulators assess whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent misuse of Grok's image-manipulation capabilities, companies offering similar AI technologies will likely face mounting pressure to implement strong guardrails.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has ruled out the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the United States, reinforcing the government's position that a federally issued digital dollar is not necessary. The remarks highlight a broader policy stance that favors private-sector innovation in digital finance rather than direct government involvement in issuing digital currency.

Bessent's comments come at a time when central banks around the world are accelerating exploration of CBDCs as part of efforts to modernize payment systems. While many global economies are testing or piloting state-backed digital currencies, the U.S. Treasury has taken a more cautious approach, emphasizing the strength and resilience of the existing dollar-based financial system.

Bessent has argued that the United States does not require a CBDC due to the global dominance of the U.S. dollar and the advanced capabilities of its financial ecosystem. According to the Treasury Secretary, current payment networks, commercial banking infrastructure, and regulated stablecoin development already provide effective pathways for digital financial services without the need for a government-issued digital currency.

Concerns over privacy and government oversight have also shaped opposition to a U.S. CBDC. Critics of central bank digital currencies have warned that direct government control over digital payment infrastructure could raise risks related to financial surveillance and transaction monitoring. Bessent's position aligns with those concerns, reinforcing the view that the U.S. should prioritize market-driven solutions over centralized digital currency frameworks.

The Treasury's stance also signals a shift toward greater reliance on regulated stablecoins as an alternative mechanism for expanding digital dollar usage. By encouraging private-sector participation while maintaining regulatory oversight, policymakers aim to support financial innovation while preserving consumer protections and system stability.

The decision to rule out a U.S. CBDC contrasts with ongoing initiatives in other major economies. China continues to expand pilot programs for its digital yuan, while the European Central Bank has advanced research into a potential digital euro. These developments highlight differing approaches among global financial powers regarding how digital currencies should be integrated into national monetary systems.

Supporters of CBDCs argue that government-issued digital currencies could improve payment efficiency, strengthen financial inclusion, and enhance monetary policy tools. Opponents, however, caution that CBDCs could concentrate financial power within central banks and reduce the role of private financial institutions.

Bessent's reaffirmation of opposition to a digital dollar reflects a U.S. strategy that prioritizes competitive financial markets and technological innovation driven by private companies. The Treasury has indicated that regulatory clarity for stablecoins and other blockchain-based financial products may serve as a more practical pathway for digital asset integration within the U.S. financial system.

The policy position also carries geopolitical implications as global competition intensifies around digital currency infrastructure. While other nations continue to explore CBDCs as tools for economic modernization, U.S. officials appear confident that the existing dollar ecosystem, supported by private-sector innovation and deep capital markets, remains sufficient to maintain international leadership.

Bessent's stance signals that, while research into digital currency technologies may continue, the United States is unlikely to pursue a government-issued CBDC in the near term. Instead, policymakers appear focused on fostering a regulated environment that allows private digital finance initiatives to drive the next phase of financial innovation.

As central banks explore digital currencies, the shift raises fundamental questions about bank intermediation, financial privacy, and the future of programmable money in public policy.

CBDCs could disrupt the traditional two-tier banking system by reducing the role of commercial banks in payments

Privacy concerns and surveillance risks remain key hurdles, pushing central banks to explore anonymity-preserving technologies

Programmable money could transform fiscal policy through targeted, time-bound, and leak-proof government spending

The traditional architecture of central banking is facing its most significant structural shift since the mid-20th century. While Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are often discussed as a simple upgrade to digital payments, their actual impact is far more profound, touching upon the core philosophy of financial intermediation, the sanctity of privacy, and the precision of fiscal governance.

The most critical question facing central banks is whether a CBDC will eventually make commercial banks obsolete in the payment processing chain. In our current two-tier system, commercial banks act as the primary interface for the public, managing ledgers and facilitating transactions.

A retail CBDC, however, represents a direct liability of the central bank. If a central bank provides the technology rails—via a distributed ledger or a centralized high-speed API—the functional necessity of a middleman for payment processing diminishes. This creates a ""Disintermediation Dilemma"":



BY PTI

Atomic Settlement: Unlike traditional interbank transfers that take time to clear, CBDC transactions settle instantly. If the central bank manages the ledger, the clearinghouse role of commercial banks becomes redundant.

The Deposit Flight Risk: During times of economic stress, the public may perceive a ""risk-free"" central bank wallet as a safer harbor than a commercial bank account. This could lead to rapid deposit migration, starving commercial banks of the liquidity they need to fund loans (mortgages, business credit), effectively raising the cost of capital for the entire economy.

Perhaps the greatest hurdle to CBDC adoption is not technical, but psychological. In a world of physical cash, an individual can buy a cup of tea or a book without the state knowing their location or preferences. A CBDC, by its very nature, creates a digital footprint.

The future of central banking depends on solving the Privacy Paradox: how to provide the security of a state-backed asset while maintaining the anonymity of cash.

The Surveillance Concern: If every transaction is recorded on a central ledger, the state gains unprecedented visibility into individual behavior. This ""Big Brother"" perception could lead to a permanent trust deficit.

To counter this, central banks are exploring Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). These allow a transaction to be verified as legitimate without revealing the identity of the transactors or the nature of the purchase.

One likely solution is a tiered system where small, ""retail-level"" transactions (like buying tea) are anonymous, while larger transfers require full transparency to prevent money laundering and tax evasion.



BY Kamalika Ghosh

Beyond just being a medium of exchange, CBDCs introduce the concept of ""Programmable Money."" This is where the intersection of technology and governance becomes truly revolutionary. By embedding smart contracts into the currency itself, central banks can fine-tune economic outcomes with surgical precision.

This opens up opportunities for Targeted Stimulus and governance:

Purpose-Bound Money: Imagine a government stimulus package that can only be spent on essential groceries or healthcare. If a citizen tries to use those specific ""tokens"" for luxury goods, the transaction is automatically declined by the code within the currency.

Temporal Logic: Stimulus funds could be programmed with an ""expiry date."" To prevent hoarding and boost economic velocity during a recession, the digital currency could be programmed to lose value or lapse if not spent within 90 days.

Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) 2.0: For sectors like agriculture, subsidies for fertilizers can be sent directly to a farmer's digital wallet, programmed to be accepted only at authorized outlets. This eliminates ""leakage"" and ensures that fiscal policy reaches its intended target without dilution.

The future of central banking in a CBDC-dominated economy is a delicate balancing act. It requires a shift from being a ""lender of last resort"" to becoming a ""technological platform provider."" The challenge is to embrace the efficiency of direct digital claims without destabilizing the commercial banking sector that fuels private investment.

Ultimately, the success of CBDCs will not be measured by the sophistication of the blockchain or the speed of the transactions, but by the robustness of the regulatory frameworks that protect user privacy and the strategic foresight used to program money for the public good.

In this article

Bitcoin sank below $67,000 on Thursday as investor confidence continued to falter in the asset once hailed as ""digital gold"" and a unique store of value. —

Digital assets, including bitcoin, have fallen deeper into the red as investors re-assess the practical utility of a token that has been championed not only as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainties but also as an alternative to fiat currencies and traditional safe-havens such as gold.

That hasn't panned out lately, since bitcoin peaked just north of $126,000 in early October.

On Thursday, bitcoin was last down to $67,675, its lowest since since November 2024. The cryptocurrency broke below $70,000 earlier in the session Thursday and then the selling increased. The cryptocurrency is down 20% this week alone.

""This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure  said Wednesday in a note to clients.

Growing investor caution comes as many of the sensationalized claims about bitcoin have failed to materialize. The token has largely traded in the same direction as other risk-on assets, such as stocks,  particularly during recent geopolitical and macroeconomic flare ups in Venezuela, the Middle East and Europe, and its adoption as a form of payment for goods and services has been minimal.

Bitcoin is down nearly 30% over the past year, while gold has surged 68% in the same period. 

Other cryptocurrencies are cratering too. Ether has pulled back 23% this week, on track for its worst week since November 2022, when it slumped 24%. Solana hit $88.42 on Thursday, about a two-year low and off 24% on the week.

Some traders have suggested $70,000 is a key level to watch and a break below that could trigger further declines for bitcoin. 

James Butterfill, head of research at Coinshares, said $70,000 is shaping up as a ""key psychological level,"" adding that ""if we fail to hold it, a move toward"" the $60,000 to $65,000 range ""becomes quite likely.""

The latest move in bitcoin comes amid a worsening sell-off in U.S. tech stocks. The State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF dropped 2.8% Wednesday, one day after losing 2.2%. 

Meanwhile, precious metals continue to be volatile too, with silver plunging again on Thursday and gold under pressure. 

Forced liquidations — when traders' positions are automatically sold as bitcoin hits a set price — continue to weigh on markets. As of Thursday, more than $2 billion in long and short positions in cryptocurrencies have been liquidated this week, according to data from Coinglass.

Bitcoin has been on a steady decline for more than three months, and is now more than 45% below its October high. Other cryptocurrencies, including ether and XRP, have fallen even more.

 ""[The] straight line bull run that a lot of people expected hasn't really materialized yet. Bitcoin isn't trading on hype anymore, the story has lost a bit of that plot, it is trading on pure liquidity and capital flows,"" Maja Vujinovic, CEO of digital assets at FG Nexus, told CNBC's ""Worldwide Exchange.""

While many in the crypto market have previously credited large institutional investors with supporting the price of bitcoin, now it is those same participants who appear to be selling.

""Institutional demand has reversed materially,"" CryptoQuant said in a report on Wednesday. 

U.S. exchange-traded funds, which purchased 46,000 bitcoin this time last year, are net sellers in 2026, CryptoQuant said.

The report notes other worrying signs. ""Bitcoin has broken below its 365-day moving average for the first time since March 2022 and has declined 23% in the 83 days since the breakdown — worse than the early 2022 bear phase,"" CryptoQuant analysts said. 

A moving average tracks the price of an asset over a set number of periods, smoothing out short-term price fluctuations to identify trends.

The latest leg lower in bitcoin suggests ""potential downside toward the $70K–$60K range,"" CryptoQuant said.

Legislation letting cryptocurrency into public pension investments — and imposing new limitations on crypto ATM operations — has crossed the halfway point at the Indiana Statehouse and is expected to advance to the Senate floor next week.

Senate lawmakers heard testimony Wednesday on a package of House digital currency bills but didn't yet vote them out of the Insurance and Financial Institutions Committee.

The panel's head, Sen. Scott Baldwin, called that decision a “tactical pause” to refine the proposals and ensure they conform with his pending reorganization of consumer lending laws.

One, House Bill 1042, would allow members of certain public pension plans to choose self-directed brokerage accounts offering crypto investment options. The state would also be able to invest the plan assets into crypto exchange traded funds.

Participants in defined benefit plans don't get to decide how the investments is managed — that's up to the state — but those with defined contribution plans would be able to take advantage of the changes, explained the bill's author, Rep. Kyle Pierce, R-Anderson.

The Indiana Public Retirement System testified as neutral on the bill.

“We've worked with the House to get it to the current form and (we're) more or less happy with it,” said Tom Perkins, the investments counsel and director of investment stewardship.

Other provisions would block state agencies — besides the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions — from banning a digital mining business' operations, restricting crypto transactions for legal services or taking custody of digital wallets using certain technology.

Local governments, meanwhile, wouldn't be able to stop digital mining firms including data centers from operating in industrial-zoned areas — or prevent individual Hoosiers from mining crypto in their homes.

The bulk of discussion centered on House Bill 1116, which would regulate the virtual currency kiosks commonly referred to as crypto ATMs.

“These ATMs have become a powerful tool for scammers to prey on seniors and people in crisis,” Rep. Wendy McNamara, the bill's author. “These victims often believe they're paying a bill, helping a loved one or protecting their savings — when, in reality, they're being manipulated into sending money to criminals.”

The measure would require kiosk operators to get licensed as money transmitters, get permission to install the machines from the Department of Financial Institutions, comply with data reporting and more. Other provisions step up security amid widespread scam complaints.

“We are currently living in a ‘scamdemic,'” said Sgt. Nathan VanCleave, who works on the Evansville Police Department's financial crimes unit. “… They are on steroids because of cryptocurrency.”

The city recorded 35 crypto ATM scam cases last year, totaling more than $400,000 in losses.

VanCleave claimed the Evansville-area machines averaged a transaction fee rate of 38%, benefiting both the operators and the brick-and-mortar businesses hosting the machines.

When he asked local gas stations to get rid of them, one told him so much revenue was generated that the store “can't go to corporate and ask us to pull the plug.”

“This is where we come into play,” VanCleave said. “We have to pass legislation that will protect our citizens.”

Evansville has passed its own ordinance requiring signage, receipts and a phone number on the machine — “so you can call somebody to cry with you after you've lost all of your money” — but seeks statewide legislation.

But crypto ATM operators said the measure would drive them out of business in Indiana.

It would require operators to refund the full payment amount and transaction fees to scam victims. They would have to verify a customer's identity before accepting payment, and couldn't charge transaction fees of more than 10% of the transaction's value. The bill also limits how much new and existing users could transact over 24-hour and monthlong periods.
Larry Lipka, a general counsel for CoinFlip, told lawmakers the 10% cap was too low. The company's average transaction fee rate across its 100-plus Indiana kiosks is between 17% and 19%.
“We're buying the cryptocurrency from another company, so we have to pay for that. So, we're only earning the transaction fee,” he said. The firm also has to pay for armed guards to pick up the cash deposited, which gets more expensive for kiosks located in remote areas.
He pushed back on the limits for customer transaction amounts, saying, “Why should someone using a product for two months, two years, five years be limited in the amount that they want to buy? That is anti-American and anti-freedom.”
CoinFlip instead suggested brief limits for newcomers.
The company also opposed the scam total-refund provisions and angled for refunds of only the transaction fee to new customers for a limited period of time.
“A person who's been using a product for days or weeks or months knows what they're doing, and they should not be given a refund of the full amount when we can't recover that crypto once it's sent,” Lipka said.
He noted federal regulations only require refunds for unauthorized transactions — like stolen credit cards or hacked bank accounts — but that scam victims have authorized their losses, even if it was done under duress.
Changes are expected. Baldwin told the Capital Chronicle he wouldn't let the bill out of his committee if it didn't pass muster.

A fraud prevention bill that would place regulatory guardrails on cryptocurrency kiosk machines was advanced by the Kansas House on Feb. 4. 

A House committee initially advanced HB 2515 on Feb. 2 after hearing from top law enforcement and banking officials that the legislation was urgently needed to slow scammers targeting the kiosk machines for quick cash. 

The kiosks, also commonly known as crypto ATMs and Bitcoin Teller Machines, convert cash into digital currency. According to testimony presented to the House Committee on Financial Institutions and Pensions, scammers are using ever-sophisticated methods to lure victims to the machines, where they often walk them through a step-by-step process entailing completion of the transaction.

Typically, a victim deposits cash into a digital wallet but unwittingly sends it to the scammer. And from there, it's virtually untraceable. 

“Once that money is moved, recovery is extremely difficult,” Shawnee County District Attorney Mike Kagay said during a Feb. 3 Statehouse event dubbed ""Fight the Fraud,"" which also addressed other financial crimes.

“Victims are told to act immediately and not tell anyone,” he said.

Kagay laid out deceptive techniques that are frequently deployed to lure victims into offloading cash.

“And that's going to give the scammers the tools they need to go ahead and deprive you of your funds,” Kagay said. 

He added, “The scammers' playbook is consistent —  urgency, fear, and secrecy.” 

Kagay told The Capital-Journal that HB 2515 is “common sense prevention” legislation.  

“The bill is going to be easy to follow while helping future victims,” he said.

An existential issue with crypto ATMs is that they largely operate outside the scope of “traditional money transmission regulatory frameworks, and are subject to no consumer protection requirements beyond those voluntarily adopted by operators,” according to testimony submitted by Nathaniel Castillo, the state's first assistant attorney general.

Castillo didn't provide the committee with concrete figures as far as the prevalence of crypto-kiosk fraud in Kansas, instead tying national trends to the Sunflower State. His testimony asserted that consumer complaints received by the Kansas AG's office mirrored “a sharp and accelerating rise in fraud involving virtual currency kiosks nationwide.” 

According to the FBI's most recent data from January through November 2025, crypto-kiosk fraud resulted in roughly 12,000 complaints and $333.5 million in financial losses, nearly doubling the nationwide tally from 2023. 

“The data shows that scammers are increasingly directing victims to kiosks rather than traditional payment methods,” according to Castillo's testimony.

Rep. Rui Xu, D-Westwood, and the committee's ranking minority member, said that guardrails contained in HB 2515 “maximize the chances” of recouping stolen assets.

“I think most everybody agrees that guardrails should be put in place for this fairly new industry that is ripe for fraud,” Xu told The Capital-Journal.

The primary guardrails for HB 2515, known as the “Virtual Kiosk Consumer Protection Act,” include the following:

Bitcoin has dropped sharply, but the cryptocurrency has a long history of recovering after prolonged dips.

These crypto ETFs offer exposure to Bitcoin, crypto mining, and blockchain technology.

Cryptocurrencies have become a valuable asset, with Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) almost doubling over the past five years. The famed digital asset is in the middle of a sharp correction, which presents a buy-the-dip opportunity for assets with exposure to the crypto industry.

Luckily, you don't have to guess which crypto stock will be the next winner. Crypto ETFs give investors broad exposure to the opportunity and have diversified portfolios. These are some of the top funds to consider if you want to ride the upcoming crypto wave. 

The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (NYSEARCA:BITB) offers direct exposure to Bitcoin. This ETF does not contain any other assets, making it easier to invest in the largest cryptocurrency. You don't have to worry about creating a digital wallet or getting started with a crypto brokerage account. BITF handles it for you and only has a 0.20% expense ratio.

Crypto enthusiasts view Bitcoin as digital gold. There are only 21 million Bitcoins in existence, and without a central authority, it's impossible to increase the supply of Bitcoin. That setup turns Bitcoin into an inflation hedge that has historically outperformed major benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.

Bitcoin has endured sharp dips over its long history, with multiple instances of 50%+ drops. Bitcoin has lost more than 40% of its value from its all-time high, but when the cryptocurrency regains momentum, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF investors will get to enjoy the rally.

The CoinShares Bitcoin Mining ETF (NASDAQ:WGMI) gives investors exposure to Bitcoin mining companies. Although these companies currently make most of their money from Bitcoin, some of these same picks have pivoted to AI infrastructure. Their Bitcoin mining facilities happen to provide optimal setups for AI data centers. 

Some crypto miners included in the ETF have already landed lucrative deals with tech giants. The fund has a little more than 20 holdings since there aren't many crypto miners, but that hasn't stopped the fund from doubling over the past year. It's also a very top-heavy fund, with more than 80% of its capital in its top 10 holdings. Almost all of the stocks in the fund are small-cap companies, with only 31% in mid-cap and large-cap growth stocks. 

Investors who want exposure to AI and cryptocurrencies may want to give this fund a closer look. Eight of its top 10 holdings are up over the past year, with the top four holdings all up by more than 150% during that time.

The Amplify Blockchain Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:BLOK) prioritizes stocks that are at the center of crypto and blockchain technology.  Blockchain is the decentralized infrastructure that makes Bitcoin possible. It can potentially reduce transaction fees and create a more affordable version of credit cards. 

The technology has great potential, and BLOK gives investors broad exposure to the industry. That has resulted in an annualized 45.8% return over the past three years, with top picks like Galaxy Digital (NASDAQ:GLXY), Hut 8 (NASDAQ:HUT), and Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) leading the way. The top 10 holdings make up more than one-third of the fund's total assets, and the ETF has a little more than 50 stocks in total.

Although the Amplify Blockchain Technology ETF has delivered tremendous returns in recent years, it's important to remember that it is an actively managed fund. A 0.70% expense ratio is a bit high. While the fund  can justify a high expense ratio if it can continue to deliver exceptional returns, the expense ratio can turn into a hindrance if the fund endures a prolonged correction.

CHECK THIS OUT

Privacy has always been one of crypto's most debated features, and one of its most misunderstood. On one side, public blockchains are radically transparent: anyone can inspect transactions, wallet activity, and on-chain behavior in real time. On the other hand, most real-world financial activity depends on confidentiality, such as payroll, trade execution, personal spending, business treasury management, identity checks, and now AI training data and model outputs.

That tension is exactly why privacy is such a trending topic in the blockchain industry. The sector is now bigger than just “privacy coins,” as it's become an evolving toolkit of cryptography, network design, and verification methods that help users and applications prove what's true without exposing everything.

Most blockchains are pseudonymous, not private. A wallet address doesn't automatically reveal your name—but once an address is connected to your identity (exchange deposits, KYC rails, doxxed ENS names, reused addresses, social posts, etc.), the chain becomes a permanent activity feed.

In practice, on-chain privacy can refer to several different goals:



Not every system offers every kind of privacy. Some networks provide default privacy, others provide optional privacy, and many systems focus on privacy at the application layer rather than the base chain.

Privacy in Web3 typically comes from a handful of cryptographic and architectural approaches:

1) Ring signatures + confidential transactions – These techniques blur “who signed” and can also obscure amounts. Monero is the most well-known example of combining ring signatures with confidential transaction methods to hide sender/amount details.

2) Stealth addresses – Stealth addresses generate one-time destination addresses so observers can't easily link a recipient's public address to incoming payments. Monero uses this approach as part of its privacy design.

3) Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) – ZKPs let you prove a statement is true without revealing the underlying data. They enable transactions where validity is proven without publicly exposing details. Zcash is the canonical example of a system built around ZK proofs for shielded transactions.

4) Mixing / CoinJoin-style coordination – Some systems provide optional privacy by combining multiple users' transactions so it's harder to trace flows. Dash's PrivateSend is often described in this category as an optional CoinJoin-style mechanism rather than “always-on” privacy.

5) Privacy-preserving computation – Beyond payments, modern privacy tech increasingly focuses on computation: proving results, verifying models, validating identity, and enabling collaboration without exposing raw inputs. 

Privacy coins are the most visible part of the sector because they represent a direct consumer use case: private digital cash. But their designs differ sharply and those differences are significant.

Monero is designed so that privacy isn't a toggle but the baseline. It emphasizes transaction confidentiality through mechanisms widely described as ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transaction techniques (RingCT).

In the privacy-crypto landscape, Monero often represents the “strong privacy as a principle” end of the spectrum because the system's default behavior is to reduce traceability for typical transfers. That design has benefits for personal privacy and fungibility, but it also draws regulatory pressure and exchange scrutiny in some jurisdictions.

Zcash is known for bringing zero-knowledge proofs into mainstream crypto through shielded transactions (commonly associated with zk-SNARKs). In Zcash, privacy can be optional depending on whether users use transparent vs shielded addresses/transactions.

In the blockchain space, Zcash is often viewed as a “privacy technology showcase” as much as a currency because it demonstrates how ZK systems can prove correctness without revealing sensitive details.

Dash is sometimes grouped into privacy lists because it offers optional privacy functionality (often described as CoinJoin-style mixing via PrivateSend). However, the privacy characteristics, threat model, and “default vs optional” stance differ from systems like Monero. This is a good reminder: “privacy coin” is a category label, not a guarantee of identical privacy properties.

Depending on how you define the sector, you'll also see privacy-oriented networks and app layers focused on private smart contracts, private data sharing, and privacy for DeFi rather than “private payments.” Many modern efforts (including ZK-focused app stacks) are effectively building privacy primitives that can be used by multiple applications instead of a single “privacy currency.”

As AI becomes embedded into Web3 via trading agents, gaming agents, identity agents, and automated governance, the stakes of functional privacy go up. Models may rely on private datasets, users may need to prove identity attributes without revealing identity, and systems may need to prove that an AI output is correctly derived without exposing training data, prompts, or proprietary weights.

This is where concepts like verifiable AI and ZKML start to matter: proving AI outputs are trustworthy and reproducible under a defined process, while keeping sensitive information private. ARPA Network has been positioning itself specifically in this direction.

ARPA Network functions as a decentralized cryptographic infrastructure focused on fairness, security, and privacy. It is built around threshold cryptography and verification-first design. Two pillars are especially relevant to privacy preservation and verifiable AI:

Randomness is a subtle privacy-adjacent ingredient in many systems: gaming outcomes, NFT allocations, lotteries, and any mechanism where predictability or manipulation can break fairness.

ARPA's Randcast is positioned as an on-chain verifiable random number generator that developers can integrate via SDKs/APIs to produce randomness that can be verified on-chain.This results in randomness that can be verified, which reduces reliance on centralized or opaque sources and strengthens trust in open systems.

ARPA's Verifiable AI initiative is explicitly framed around combining zero-knowledge proofs with machine learning so that outputs can be independently verified without exposing confidential data. 

ARPA has also publicly announced a verifiable AI framework using ZK proofs, positioning it as a way to address data integrity, model transparency, and verifiability. The endeavor is particularly relevant as AI technology continues to integrate with blockchain and high-stakes automation.ARPA has always emphasized privacy-preserving technology as foundational for an AI-driven internet, aligning privacy with verifiability rather than treating them as opposites.

While the aforementioned privacy coins focus on private value transfer, ARPA is leaning into private + verifiable computation. The latter will become increasingly important as AI agents start making decisions that move money, allocate resources, or influence outcomes.

Privacy in the blockchain space evolved because people need room to transact, build, and participate without turning every action into a permanent public broadcast. What's changing now is the shape of the privacy problem. It's no longer only about hiding balances or masking transaction paths. It's increasingly about protecting sensitive data while still being able to prove correctness, fairness, and integrity. This is especially true as AI becomes embedded in Web3. In that world, simply saying “trust the model” isn't enough, but neither is making everything transparent if it compromises user privacy, proprietary methods, or safety.

That's why the next phase of privacy tech will be defined by systems that can reconcile two demands that seem to pull in opposite directions: strong confidentiality and strong verification. Privacy without verifiability can undermine trust and accountability, while verifiability without privacy can expose users and institutions to unacceptable risk. The most durable infrastructure will be the kind that makes privacy practical, proofs accessible, and trust cryptographic – and that's the vision ARPA has been building towards.

Bitcoin BTC$71,091.27 fell below $70,000 as the crypto selloff deepened before the start of equities trading in the U.S.

The largest cryptocurrency dropped to as low as $69.917.20 according to CoinDesk data, with sentiment sliding further into ""extreme fear."" The Fear and Greed Index sits at 11, a level reached only a handful of times in the past

The selloff remains largely contained within digital assets and metals, as broader U.S. equity markets show resilience. Gold fell more than 1%, slipping below $4,900 per ounce, and silver dropped over 11%, falling to under $79 per ounce. 

U.S. equities, by contrast, are slightly higher in pre-market trading. The Invesco QQQ exchange-traded fund (ETF), which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index, is up 0.05%. 

Bitcoin-exposed equities, however, extended declines. Strategy (MSTR), the largest publicly traded holder of the largest cryptocurrency, is down over 5% and nearly 80% below its November 2024 all time high. The company is due to report fourth-quarter earnings later Thursday.

Other bitcoin treasury companies, including Strive (ASST) and Nakamoto (NAKA), are down roughly 6%.

Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) is lower by another 2% while rival Bullish, the owner of CoinDesk, is down 0.4%.

Bitcoin linked AI miners are mixed. IREN (IREN) is down 3%, while Cipher Mining (CIFR) is down 2%, following steep declines of around 15% each on Wednesday. Larger miners with significant bitcoin holdings, including Riot (RIOT), MARA Holdings (MARA), and CleanSpark (CLSK), are all about 3% lower.

Some potential relief may emerge if correlations hold, as the iShares Expanded Tech Software ETF (IGV) is slightly higher. That's an industry sector bitcoin has historically tracked closely. Meanwhile, Google (GOOG) is down 3% despite beating fourth-quarter profit forecasts, after announcing higher capital expenditures of $185 billion, up from $175 billion, with estimated spending of about $119.5 billion.

Institutional attitudes toward bitcoin yield are beginning to shift and there is now renewed interest in BTC rewards after years of skepticism driven by smart-contract risk, leverage, and opaque strategies, GlobalStake co-founder Thomas Chaffee told CoinDesk on Thursday.

Products that allow users to earn a return on their bitcoin holdings often require wrapping BTC into protocols, involving smart contract risk or strategies that don't scale, so institutions didn't see ""a risk-return profile that made sense,"" according to Chaffee.

That reluctance is starting to change, Chaffee said, not because institutions suddenly want more risk, but because the types of strategies available to them have evolved. Rather than protocol-based yield or token incentives, allocators are increasingly gravitating toward fully collateralized, market-neutral approaches that resemble traditional financial strategies already familiar to hedge funds and treasuries, he said.

“The behavior change we're seeing isn't institutions chasing yield,” Chaffee said. “It's institutions finally engaging once the strategies, controls, and infrastructure look like something they can actually deploy capital into at scale.”

The renewed interest comes after years of failed or short-lived attempts to generate yield on bitcoin, many of which unraveled during the 2022 market downturn as prominent lenders froze withdrawals and ultimately collapsed amid liquidity stress, most notably when crypto lending service Celsius Network indefinitely paused withdrawals and transfers citing “‘extreme market conditions'” in mid-2022 and later entered bankruptcy.

Chaffee is not the only one seeing renewed institutional interest in bitcoin yield. ""People holding bitcoin, — whether on balance sheet or as investors — increasingly see it as a pot just sitting there,"" Richard Green, director of Rootstock Institutional, told CoinDesk recently. ""It can't just sit there doing nothing; it needs to be adding yield."" Green said professional investors now want their digital assets to ""work as hard as possible"" within their risk mandates.

Chaffee explained that GlobalStake, which provides staking infrastructure across proof-of-stake networks, began hearing the same question repeatedly from clients over the past several years: whether similar institutional-grade yield opportunities existed for bitcoin.

GlobalStake unveiled its Bitcoin Yield Gateway on Thursday, a platform designed to aggregate multiple third-party bitcoin yield strategies behind a single onboarding, compliance, and integration layer.

The co-founder explained the company expects roughly $500 million in bitcoin to be allocated within three months. “We expect the bitcoin to be allocated during the gateway's first-quarter roll-out period, sourced from a custodial partner based in Canada, demand generated by parties through our partner MG Stover, and our clients, which include family offices, digital asset treasuries (DATs), corporate treasuries, and hedge funds.”

Other firms are approaching the problem from the infrastructure layer. Babylon Labs, for example, is developing systems that allow native bitcoin to be used as non-custodial collateral across financial applications, an effort aimed at expanding BTC's utility rather than generating yield directly.","{'href': 'https://www.coindesk.com', 'title': 'CoinDesk'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin clawed its way back above $71,000 on Thursday after a sharp selloff earlier in the day dragged prices briefly below the $70,000 mark, mirroring tentative stabilization across global markets.

The move came as a broader rout in technology stocks showed signs of fatigue. Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 edged higher after two bruising sessions that erased the index's gains for the year, while European stocks steadied and Asian markets trimmed losses.

Bitcoin had fallen as much as 7% over the previous 24 hours as investors reduced risk across assets tied to growth and leverage. The slide coincided with renewed pressure in precious metals, where silver plunged as much as 17%, extending a brutal reversal after last month's record rally. 

Gold also slipped, underscoring how quickly speculative trades across markets have been unwound.

In crypto, the bounce above $71,000 appears more like short covering than a renewed rush of buyers. Trading volumes remain elevated, but demand in the spot market has thinned, according to analysts. 

Stablecoin balances on exchanges have also been drifting lower, suggesting fresh capital is staying on the sidelines rather than stepping in aggressively on dips.

Macro uncertainty continues to weigh on sentiment. Investors are recalibrating expectations around US interest rates amid speculation over Federal Reserve leadership and the risk of a stronger dollar, which typically pressures assets like bitcoin that thrive on easy liquidity.

Some firms remain cautious. Galaxy Digital has warned that, without a clear catalyst, bitcoin could still revisit lower levels if selling resumes. 

Others see the bulk of the drawdown as already behind the market, with estimates clustering around a potential bottom in the low-to-mid $60,000 range.","{'href': 'https://www.coindesk.com', 'title': 'CoinDesk'}","cryptocurrency"

German lender Deutsche Bank (DB) says bitcoin's BTC$71,091.27 latest slide is less about a single macro shock and more about a slow erosion of conviction across institutional and regulatory fronts.

In a Wednesday note, the bank argued that three forces are weighing on the asset: sustained institutional outflows, a breakdown in bitcoin's traditional market relationships, and a loss of regulatory momentum that had previously supported liquidity and volatility compression.

The current phase marks a reset rather than a collapse, a test of whether bitcoin can mature beyond belief-driven gains and regain support from regulation and institutional capital, the report said.

""While bitcoin's recent price fall seems stark when viewed against its longer history, it reflects a retreat from highly speculative gains over the past two years, suggesting it still has room to mature,"" wrote analysts Marion Laboure and Camilla Siazon.

Despite its long-standing reputation as “digital gold,” bitcoin has diverged sharply from the traditional safe haven this year. While gold has rallied, up more than 60% in 2025 on persistent central bank buying and flight-to-safety demand, bitcoin has struggled, posting multiple monthly declines and underperforming key risk assets. Correlations with both equities and gold have eroded, leaving BTC isolated as broader markets stabilize.

Since peaking in October 2025, crypto markets have entered a sustained downturn, with bitcoin falling more than 40% from its highs and posting its fourth straight monthly decline, a streak not seen since before the pandemic. Unlike previous macro-driven selloffs, this drop has occurred even as equities and gold have rebounded, underscoring weakening demand and fading momentum.

The most immediate pressure, according to the analysts, comes from institutional selling. U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded heavy and persistent outflows since October, including more than $7 billion in November, roughly $2 billion in December and over $3 billion in January. As institutions reduce exposure, trading volumes have thinned, leaving bitcoin more vulnerable to sharp price swings.

Sentiment data reinforces the trend. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has fallen back toward “extreme fear,” while Deutsche Bank's own surveys show U.S. consumer crypto adoption slipping to around 12%, down from 17% in mid-2025, a sign that enthusiasm is fading beyond Wall Street.

The analysts also highlighted bitcoin's growing detachment from familiar market anchors. The asset has diverged sharply from gold, which gained 65% in 2025 while bitcoin fell 6.5%, undermining its “digital gold” narrative. At the same time, bitcoin's correlation with equities has dropped to the mid-teens, far below levels seen in earlier macro-driven selloffs, when it typically moved in lockstep with tech stocks.

Regulatory uncertainty is the third headwind. Progress on the bipartisan Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act has stalled in Congress amid disputes over stablecoin provisions. Deutsche Bank said the pause has reversed earlier gains in market stability, with bitcoin's 30-day volatility jumping back above 40%, near late-October levels.

Still, the bank cautioned against overreading the decline. Even after the drawdown, bitcoin remains roughly 370% higher than in early 2023, underscoring how much speculative premium had accumulated during the rally.

Wall Street bank Citi (C) said the world's largest cryptocurrency is trading below key ETF cost levels and is nearing its pre-election price floor as inflows to these vehicles fade and headwinds build, in a Tuesday note to clients.

Bitcoin was trading around $69,500 at publication time.

Scientists have built a detailed map showing how hundreds of possible mutations in a major cancer gene affect tumor growth. The research offers a clearer picture of how small genetic changes can lead to very different cancer behaviors.

The work centers on CTNNB1, a gene responsible for producing the protein β-catenin. This protein plays a critical role in controlling normal tissue growth and repair. When β-catenin regulation breaks down, cells can begin growing uncontrollably, a defining feature of cancer.

By carefully testing every possible mutation in a key region of this gene, researchers were able to explain why certain mutations appear repeatedly in specific cancers. The findings may also help guide future cancer treatments.

Why a Small Genetic Hotspot Matters

Many cancers share mutations in a tiny section of CTNNB1 known as a hotspot. Under normal conditions, this region acts as a signal that tells the cell when to break down β-catenin after it has done its job.

When mutations disrupt this signal, β-catenin is no longer destroyed as it should be. Instead, it builds up inside cells and switches on genes that promote tumor growth. Scientists have identified more than 70 different mutations in this hotspot across various cancers, but until now it was unclear whether these mutations had different effects.

Testing Every Possible Mutation

Researchers at the University of Edinburgh examined all 342 possible single-letter changes in the CTNNB1 hotspot. They used mouse stem cells, which are ideal for precise genetic editing and closely mirror how β-catenin signaling works in humans.

Using advanced genome-editing tools and a fluorescent readout, the team measured how strongly each mutation activated the β-catenin pathway. This pathway controls genes linked to cell growth. The results varied widely, with some mutations causing only small increases in activity and others triggering much stronger signals.

Connecting Lab Results to Human Cancer

The team then compared their experimental data with genetic information from thousands of cancer patients. The mutation scores closely matched how CTNNB1 mutations behave in people, confirming the accuracy of the map.

The analysis also showed that cancers in different tissues tend to favor mutations that produce specific levels of β-catenin activity. This suggests that tumor location influences which mutations are most likely to thrive.

Links to Immunity and Treatment Response

In liver cancer, the researchers identified two main tumor groups. Tumors with weaker CTNNB1 mutations contained more immune cells, while those with stronger mutations had fewer immune cells. This pattern suggests that the strength of a mutation may affect how a tumor interacts with the immune system and how well it might respond to immunotherapy.

Andrew Wood, Principal Investigator at the University of Edinburgh's Institute of Genetics and Cancer, said: ""The new map provides a powerful tool for predicting how specific CTNNB1 mutations affect cancer behaviour and could support the development of more personalised treatments. As the first study to experimentally test every possible mutation in this critical hotspot, it gives scientists a clearer picture of how β-catenin drives tumour growth across different cancer types.""

Study Details and Funding

The research is published in Nature Genetics. Funding was provided by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). The study was co-led by teams from the University of Edinburgh, Leiden University Medical Center and Koç University.

People with life-threatening injuries may be more likely to survive when advanced medical care reaches them by helicopter. Survival data from a regional air ambulance service in South East England shows that outcomes were better than expected for major trauma patients. The analysis suggests that about five additional people survived for every 100 severely injured patients treated. The findings were published online in Emergency Medicine Journal.

Researchers say it has been difficult to draw firm conclusions from international studies on Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) and trauma survival. Differences in study methods, small patient numbers, and the lack of shared outcome definitions have limited comparisons. Another unresolved question has been identifying which types of patients benefit the most from helicopter-based emergency care.

Nearly a Decade of Trauma Data Analyzed

To explore these issues, researchers reviewed outcomes for 3225 trauma patients who received pre-hospital care from a single HEMS team. The service operates across Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, and the data covered the years from 2013 to 2022.

The team used a statistical method to estimate each patient's chance of survival (Ws analysis). This approach adjusted for differences in injury severity and patient characteristics, and it also examined factors linked to death within 30 days.

Unexpected Survival and Cardiac Arrest Outcomes

The researchers also examined cases where patients survived against expectations, along with outcomes in traumatic cardiac arrest, when the heart stops beating after severe injury such as major bleeding or chest trauma. A key focus was whether circulation returned before reaching the hospital, known as return of spontaneous circulation.

Out of all patients studied, 2125 survived for at least 30 days after their injury. This represented an actual survival rate of 85% compared with an expected rate of 81%. The difference amounts to five extra survivors per 100 patients and could equal as many as 115 additional lives saved each year based on the service's typical caseload.

Which Patients Benefited the Most

Patients with severe injuries and a moderate (25-45%) predicted chance of survival showed some of the largest gains. In this group, 35% survived for 30 days even though survival was not expected.

Survival was also higher than predicted among patients with a low probability of survival (less than 50%). Despite the seriousness of their injuries, 39% of these patients survived for at least 30 days.

Factors Associated With Better Survival

Younger age and a higher initial Glasgow Coma Scale score were strong predictors of unexpected survival. The Glasgow Coma Scale is a 3 to 15 point measure used to assess consciousness after a brain injury.

Another important factor was pre-hospital emergency anesthesia. This intervention places patients into an induced coma and can only be delivered by advanced medical teams such as HEMS. It was independently linked to improved survival in severely injured patients.

Outcomes in Traumatic Cardiac Arrest

Among 1316 patients who experienced traumatic cardiac arrest, 356 (27%) regained circulation while being transported to the hospital. The remaining 960 patients were declared dead at the scene.

For the 356 patients who initially survived, 30-day outcome data were available for 185 (52%). Of those, 46 (25%) were still alive after 30 days, while 139 died after arriving at the hospital. The analysis showed that the likelihood of circulation returning increased by 6% each year between 2013 and 2022.

Study Limitations and Cautious Conclusions

The researchers emphasize that their results reflect survival rates that were higher than statistical predictions, not direct proof that HEMS caused the improved outcomes. Their estimates also assume that patient characteristics and service performance remained consistent over time, which may not always be the case.

Even so, the team says the findings highlight ""the potential magnitude of clinical benefit, consistent with previous economic and social benefits demonstrated in previous studies.""

They conclude: ""These findings provide supportive evidence for continued investment in HEMS, particularly for severely injured patients, though comparative studies with alternative care pathways are needed to establish causal effectiveness.""

Kemp's ridley sea turtles rank among the most endangered sea turtle species on the planet. They live along the East Coast and Gulf Coast of North America, sharing these waters with some of the busiest shipping routes in the world. Scientists already know that fishing gear, pollution, and ship strikes threaten their survival. What remains less certain is how much human-made noise affects these turtles as they move through such crowded environments.

In JASA, published on behalf of the Acoustical Society of America by AIP Publishing, a research team from Duke University Marine Laboratory, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and North Carolina State University set out to examine how Kemp's ridley turtles hear. Their goal was to better understand whether the turtles are especially vulnerable to noise created by human activity.

""They face a variety of threats, including accidental capture in fishing gear, vessel strikes, ingestion of plastic debris, and degradation of nesting beaches and coastal habitat,"" said author Charles Muirhead. ""Because they occupy nearshore and shelf waters of the Gulf Coast and western North Atlantic -- areas with intense human activity -- they are frequently exposed to overlapping stressors throughout much of their life cycle.""

Why Ocean Noise Matters

Like many marine animals, Kemp's ridley sea turtles depend on sound to interact with their surroundings. Underwater sound can travel far, particularly at low frequencies. These low frequency sounds are commonly produced by ships and industrial equipment, and they can overlap with the natural sounds turtles may use to orient themselves and navigate through the ocean.

Measuring the Turtles' Hearing Range

To test how well the turtles hear, researchers attached noninvasive sensors to the turtles' heads and recorded the electrical activity traveling along their auditory nerves. The team exposed the turtles to sounds ranging from 50 hertz, which is near the lower limit of human hearing, up to 1,600 hertz. The results showed that the turtles were most sensitive to sounds around 300 hertz, with hearing ability decreasing at higher frequencies.

""Our findings indicate that the turtles are most sensitive in the same low-frequency band where much industrial and vessel noise occurs,"" said Muirhead. ""This does not automatically mean that harmful effects are occurring, but it highlights where further monitoring and targeted impact studies should be focused.""

What Comes Next for Sea Turtle Research

The researchers now plan to observe how sea turtles respond to sound in real-world ocean conditions. They also want to better connect the sound signals measured in the lab with the physical effects that noise may have on turtles in their natural habitat.

""These efforts will help refine our understanding of how human-caused noise interacts with sea turtle sensory systems. They will also support evidence-based management approaches aimed at minimizing unintended impacts while balancing human activities in coastal and offshore waters,"" said Muirhead.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy was recently proposed as a treatment for adults with B-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases (ADs) refractory to conventional immunomodulatory therapy. We present a case series of eight children with severe/refractory AD (four systemic lupus erythematosus, three dermatomyositis, one systemic sclerosis) treated at Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesù, Rome, and University Hospital Erlangen with a single infusion of 1 × 106 kg−1 point-of-care manufactured autologous CD19 CAR T cells (zorpocabtagene autoleucel), in a hospital exemption (HE) program. In Europe, the HE pathway offers the opportunity to treat patients with life-threatening or seriously debilitating disorders who lack valid therapeutic options, using an advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) authorized on a nonroutine, single-patient basis. In contrast to the ‘compassionate use' pathway, the ATMP does not necessarily need to have undergone clinical trials or marketing authorization applications. Manufacturing was successful in all patients, yielding several drug product bags. Once infused after lymphodepletion, zorpocabtagene autoleucel cells expanded in vivo, promoting prompt B cell clearance. Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome was reported in six patients, and grade 1 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome was reported in one patient. Late-hematotoxicity was limited to grade 1 in two patients. All these adverse events were manageable and no severe infections occurred. With a median follow-up of 16.5 months (range = 9–24 months), all patients experienced a clinically substantial improvement/resolution of AD, as evidenced by reduction in disease activity scores and signs of reversal of organ damage. This improvement enabled sustained discontinuation of immunomodulators, even after B cell reconstitution. The activation of formal clinical trials enrolling children and adolescents is urgently needed to confirm these preliminary results and to assess the long-term safety of this approach.

Artificial intelligence applied to brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) holds potential to advance diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning for neurological diseases. The field has been constrained, thus far, by limited training data and task-specific models that do not generalize well across patient populations and medical tasks. By leveraging self-supervised learning, pretraining and targeted adaptation, foundation models present a promising paradigm to overcome these limitations. Here we present Brain Imaging Adaptive Core (BrainIAC)—a foundation model designed to learn generalized representations from unlabeled brain MRI data and serve as a core basis for diverse downstream application adaptation. Trained and validated on 48,965 brain MRIs across a broad spectrum of tasks, we demonstrate that BrainIAC outperforms localized supervised training and other pretrained models, particularly in low-data, few-shot, settings and in high-difficulty prediction tasks, allowing for application in scenarios otherwise infeasible. BrainIAC can be integrated into imaging pipelines and multimodal frameworks and may lead to improved biomarker discovery and artificial intelligence clinical translation.

Recent advances in deep learning have transformed medical artificial intelligence (AI), enabling the development of clinically translatable tools that, in some contexts, match or even surpass expert performance1,2. Medical practice, with its vast and diverse data sources across different modalities—clinical notes, histopathology images, radiographic images and genomics—presents a compelling landscape for applied AI to synthesize data, learn patterns and make predictions. However, the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data, particularly for rare diseases and cases involving expensive data acquisition procedures, such as brain MRI, remains an important barrier to the development of clinically useful AI imaging tools.

Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising advance to traditional supervised learning methods, with its ability to learn inherent, generalizable information from large unlabeled data that are much more available than annotated, task-specific datasets. This approach allows for the extraction of meaningful representations from unlabeled data that can be transferred easily to different applications. SSL methods have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision3,4,5,6 and natural language processing7,8, with recent translations into medicine9,10,11,12,13. This shift has facilitated a transition from narrow-task learning of medical AI models to a more generalized task agnostic learning coupled with localized fine-tuning. The resulting algorithms, often referred to as foundation models, have shown substantial potential in developing clinically employable solutions across various medical domains14,15,16.

Despite these advancements, the application of SSL to three-dimensional (3D) brain MRI has been limited. The high-dimensional, heterogeneous nature of brain MRI data presents unique challenges to the development of performant models. Unlike other imaging modalities such as computed tomography, brain MRI has variety of acquisition sequences from a single scan that vary by institution and scanner, with classic examples including T1-weighted, T2-weighted and T1-weighted with gadolinium contrast enhancement (T1CE)—each providing distinct sets of information, with selection of sequences for analysis depending upon the clinical use cases. For example, T1-weighted sequences are commonplace for neurocognitive analysis of pediatric and adolescent patients as well as later neurofunctional diseases (for example, Alzheimer's dementia)17,18. Whereas T2-weighted sequences are preferred for lesion segmentation2,19, compared to T2-fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1CE, which are used commonly for response assessment for brain tumors20,21. Variability in MRI scanner, acquisition protocol and patient setup also introduce biases in voxel intensities, which are problematic for radiomic analyses22,23. Furthermore, magnetic resonance acquisition itself is subject to variability and noise, with a range of scanners (from 1.5 T to 7 T) and differing acquisition parameters (for example, echo time or relaxation time)24. Foundation models for MRI must overcome substantial heterogeneity in brain structural features across different age groups and (sometimes rare) disease pathologies, which may constrain generalizable feature extraction.

Previous investigations have proposed foundation model frameworks for brain lesion segmentation25 and aging-related tasks26, but there remains a need for a broadly generalizable model for both healthy and abnormal brain images. In this study we introduce BrainIAC—a general, multiparametric brain MRI foundation model based on SSL principles. Developed and validated in 48,965 brain MRIs with a wide spectrum of demographics and medical settings, we show that BrainIAC learns robust and adaptable representations. We evaluate BrainIAC performance on several downstream applications across a range of clinical settings with varying task complexity. We compare BrainIAC to traditional supervised learning approaches and transfer learning from pretrained medical imaging networks27 in variable data availability (10% data up to 100% data), few-shot adaptation (with K = 1 and K = 5 indicating 1 and 5 samples per class, respectively) and linear probing scenarios. We perform a stability analysis using synthetically simulated imaging perturbations to mimic real-world acquisition and scanner variability and compare the robustness and generalizability of BrainIAC's learned features to other approaches. Our findings demonstrate BrainIAC's versatility and ability to adapt to several clinical settings with extremely limited training data (as few as single samples), providing a usable foundation to accelerate computational brain imaging analysis research.

We pretrained BrainIAC using contrastive SSL on 32,015 multiparametric MRIs curated from 16 datasets across ten medical conditions (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–4). We then adapted BrainIAC to seven distinct, clinically meaningful, heterogeneous, downstream prediction tasks, comparing performance against supervised learning and in-domain transfer learning approaches. The seven tasks are MRI sequence classification, brain age prediction, detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation, survival prediction for brain tumors, early dementia prediction through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus healthy control, time-to-stroke prediction, and adult glioma segmentation (Supplementary Methods A.2.1–A.2.7). These tasks were chosen as they represented a wide range of clinical contexts and difficulty. For instance, MRI sequence classification is straightforward for a clinician, whereas mutational status prediction is extremely challenging. For each downstream application, we compared BrainIAC to localized supervised training (Scratch), a 3D medical-imaging-specific pretrained model (MedicalNet27) and a segmentation-specific foundation model (BrainSegFounder25), which represent the few in-domain foundation models publicly available. For all the downstream tasks, we compared the performance across limited data scenarios by fine-tuning the entire model end-to-end. Increasing the fraction of fine-tuning data available from 10% to 100% with independent test sets for performance metrics (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1). We evaluated performance in few-shot scenarios with one data sample per class (K = 1) and five data samples per class (K = 5) (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Methods A.3) by fine-tuning the entire model end-to-end. We further evaluated the feature generalizability using linear probing (100% fine-tuning data) (Figs. 3h and 4c–d). Finally, we analyzed resiliency of BrainIAC and benchmark models to image-related artifacts (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Methods A.4). To identify the most robust backbone architecture, we first performed a benchmarking experiment comparing three pretrained encoders—SimCLR-ResNet50, SimCLR-ViTb and MAE-SwinViT—using few-shot adaptation (K = 1 and K = 5) across all seven downstream tasks. Based on consistent superior performance, SimCLR-ViT-B was designated as the BrainIAC backbone for all subsequent experiments (Extended Data Fig. 2).

BrainIAC is a general-purpose foundation model for brain MRI analysis, trained using a contrastive SSL approach and validated on seven diverse downstream applications (magnetic resonance sequence classification, time-to-stroke prediction, brain age estimation, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) classification, overall survival prediction for brain tumors, classification of IDH mutational status and brain tumor segmentation). BrainIAC outperforms supervised training (Scratch) and finetuning from publicly available models suitable for brain MRI (MedicalNet, BrainSegFounder). BrainIAC serves as a vision encoder for 3D Brain MRI scans generating robust latent feature representations that can be adapted easily to downstream applications. a, Datasets used in the study: a pool of 34 datasets ranging across ten neurological conditions and four sequences totaling 48,965 brain MRI scans was curated and preprocessed. GBM, glioblastoma; HGG, high-grade glioma; PLGG, pediatric low-grade glioma. b, BrainIAC was trained using contrastive learning-based SSL approach SimCLR on 32,015 Brain MRI scans. Full 3D brain magnetic resonance volumes were first decomposed into several randomly cropped, intensity-augmented patches. Differently augmented views of the same anatomical patch form a positive pair, whereas all other patches act as negative examples. Optimizing a SimCLR contrastive loss attracts positive pairs in latent space while repelling negatives. BrainIAC was further evaluated in downstream settings of classification, regression and segmentation. c, BrainIAC outperforms other approaches (Scratch, MedicalNet, BrainSegFounder) for downstream application at highly limited data availability in few-shot settings with one sample per class (K = 1), five samples per class (K = 5) and linear probing. Left: five tasks (excluding brain age prediction and time-to-stroke prediction); right: all seven tasks.

Higher values indicate better performance for AUC, BA and Dice scores; lower values indicate better performance for MAE. BrainIAC consistently demonstrates improved performance across all tasks and data settings, with the more pronounced improvements in low-data scenarios (≤40% training data).

a–g, Few-shot fine-tuning (K = 1 and K = 5). Performance comparison of four methods: BrainIAC, BrainSegFounder, MedicalNet and Scratch with one (K = 1) or five (K = 5) labeled samples per class for training and validation. Data are presented as mean values ± 95% CI estimated from 1,000 bootstrap samples. All models were evaluated on independent holdout test sets across all downstream tasks. For four-way sequence classification (T1W, T2W, FLAIR and T1ce) and brain age prediction (four age bins), K = 1 uses four samples and K = 5 uses 20 samples. For binary classification tasks (IDH mutation, overall survival and MCI classification), K = 1 uses two samples and K = 5 uses ten samples.

Models trained on complete datasets were evaluated for stability against three types of artificially injected imaging artifact and perturbation (contrast, Gibbs and bias) across all downstream applications. Performance was assessed across contrast scale variations (0.5–2.0, baseline = 1.0), Gibbs artifacts (scale 0.0–0.4, baseline = 0.0) and bias field perturbations (scale 0.0–0.4, baseline = 0.0).

Sequence classification is a critical, upstream step in MRI curation and processing that remains challenging in real-world clinical settings due to heterogeneous scanner protocols and frequently missing, erroneous or poorly documented sequence information at acquisition. Although deep learning has shown promise in automated classification, there remains room for improvement, particularly in the classification of contrast enhancement in T1-weight scans28. ‘Scanʼ refers to a single 3D brain MRI volume acquired with a specific sequence protocol (T1, T2, T1CE or FLAIR). Thus, our sequence classification task involves assigning the correct sequence label to each scan. We used 5,004 scans for fine-tuning, with a reserved holdout set of 876 scans encompassing the four primary sequences used in brain tumor assessment (T1, T2, T1CE or FLAIR) from the BraTS 2023 dataset29 (Supplementary Methods A.2.1 and Supplementary Table 5). We found that performance increased incrementally with fine-tuning data availability. At lower data availability, BrainIAC outperformed MedicalNet, BrainSegFounder and Scratch (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 24). For example, at 10% availability (n = 500 scans), BrainIAC balanced accuracy (BA) was 90.8%, MedicalNet was 74.2%, BrainSegFounder was 86.4% and Scratch was 79.0%. BrainIAC continued to outperform other models until 60% (n = 3,000) of scans were available for training, at which point performance plateaued for all models (BrainIAC BA: 97.2%, MedicalNet BA: 93.0%, BrainSegFounder BA: 95.5%, Scratch BA: 95.3%). We performed K nearest neighbor clustering (K = 4, representing each sequence) on the features and calculated the Davies–Bouldin index scores. For 100% data BrainIAC demonstrated better clustering performance with Davies–Bouldin index of 0.68 compared to 0.72 of Scratch, 0.82 of MedicalNet and 0.70 of BrainSegFounder (Supplementary Table 6).

Subgroup analysis of T1CE versus T1 classification was conducted to assess model performance—a challenging task due to the subtle and overlapping imaging features between T1-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences, especially in differentiating tumor core from peritumoral edema. BrainIAC outperformed all the other approaches at training data availability below 60%. Consistent findings were observed in additional subgroup analyses (T2 versus FLAIR, T1 versus T2 and FLAIR versus T1CE) and one-versus-all evaluations of all four classes (Extended Data Fig. 3).

MRI-based brain age prediction is associated with neurocognitive function in aging adults and may have utility as an early biomarker for Alzheimer's disease30,31. To evaluate BrainIAC as a foundation for improved brain age prediction, we aggregated a dataset of 6,249 T1-weighted scans, allocating 3,882 for training or validation and 1,295 as an in-distribution, internal test set and an out-of-distribution test set of 1,072 scans (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8 and Supplementary Methods A.2.2). Performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE) for predicted age versus chronological age.

In both internal and external test sets, performance improved with training data availability, and BrainIAC outperformed other models at lower data availability (Fig. 2f). In the external test set, at 20% training data availability (n = 775 scans), BrainIAC achieved MAE of 6.55 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2), compared to MedicalNet MAE: 7.61 years (95% CI: 0.26), BrainSegFounder MAE: 10.07 years (95%CI: 0.21) and Scratch MAE of 7.3 years (95% CI: 0.23). BrainIAC continued to outperform other models until 100% of training data was available.

BrainIAC demonstrated increased accuracy at all age predictions compared with MedicalNet, BrainSegFounder and Scratch models (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). The difference between predicted and chronological age was minimum at 100% data for both internal and external test sets (Fig. 6a,c). The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) representations of BrainIAC demonstrate clear clustering of the latent features based on the age groups: 0–10 years, 10–20 years, 20–30 years, 30–40 years (Fig. 6b,d). With a Davies–Bouldin index score of 0.506 (external) and 0.481 (internal), BrainIAC outperforms MedicalNet 0.633 (external) 0.538 (internal), BrainSegFounder 0.490 (internal) and 0.618 (external) and Scratch 0.612 (external) and 0.485 (internal) on clustering of age-binned latent features.

Noninvasive, imaging-based prediction of brain tumor mutational subtypes could provide actionable information to dictate clinical management when tissue biopsy is deemed infeasible32,33,34. We evaluated BrainIAC as a foundation for tumor mutational subtyping — IDH mutation prediction in low-grade glioma setting. Performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for discriminating mutation versus wildtype tumor (Fig. 2a). The DeLong35 test was used for checking statistical significance and calculating P values.

For IDH classification, we used 396 scans for training and validation; 99 were reserved as a test set from the UCSF-PDGM36 dataset (Supplementary Table 12 and Supplementary Methods A.2.3). Performance increased incrementally with training data availability but, in this case of very limited data, BrainIAC consistently outperformed other models at all levels of data availability. At 10% data availability (n = 50), BrainIAC yielded AUC 0.68 (95% CI: 0.56–0.80), compared to 0.50 (95% CI: 0.36–0.63, P = 0.031) for MedicalNet, 0.59 (95% CI: 0.44–0.71) for BrainSegFounder and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.34–0.62, P = 0.035) for Scratch. At 100% data availability (n = 396), BrainIAC yielded AUC 0.79 (95% CI: 0.64–0.89), compared to 0.68 (95% CI: 0.54–0.81, P = 0.052) for MedicalNet, 0.59 (95% CI: 0.45–0.72, P = 0.031) for BrainSegFounder and 0.61 (95% CI: 0.48–0.73, P = 0.038) for Scratch (Supplementary Tables 13 and 15).

We generated saliency maps for BrainIAC to visualize the internal weight activation and attention of the model (Fig. 7b).

Computational analysis of cancer imaging data can potentially improve prognostication and risk-stratification beyond traditional staging37. We evaluated BrainIAC as a foundation for survival prediction for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) using the UPENN-GBM38 dataset. Of 671 patients in total, 668 patients with complete survival information were included (Supplementary Table 16). We split the dataset randomly, with 534 (80%) patients for fine-tuning and 134 (20%) reserved as a test set. We further performed external testing on 134 patients from the TCGA-GBM/Brats23 dataset with complete survival information. Model performance was assessed using AUC for predicting survival at 1 year post-treatment with complete data up to this timepoint. Median model risk score output was used to stratify patients into low- and high-risk groups with Kaplan–Meier survival curves calculated and log-rank tests to compare model risk-stratification. AUC was reported for patients at risk up to the 1-year mark (that is, not censored and no event); five patients in our external test data met this criterion and were excluded from AUC calculation (Supplementary Methods A.2.4).

We found that survival prediction performance generally increased with training data availability (Fig. 2d). Generally, BrainIAC outperformed other models, at all data percentage availability. At 10% training data availability (n = 55), BrainIAC maintained high performance with an AUC of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.52–0.71), surpassing Scratch, BrainSegFounder and MedicalNet (P < 0.0001) with AUC of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.42–0.62), 0.54 (95% CI: 0.43–0.63) and 0.36 (95% CI: 0.27–0.46), respectively. At 100% data availability, BrainIAC had the highest performance (AUC 0.72), surpassing MedicalNet (0.53, P = 0.03), BrainSegFounder (0.54, P = 0.01) and the Scratch model (0.47, P = 0.0004).

External testing showed similar performance trends, with BrainIAC outperforming MedicalNet, BrainSegFounder and Scratch, with stable performance at all data percentage availability. At 10% training data, BrainIAC resulted in an AUC of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.50–0.68) significantly outperforming MedicalNet 0.44 (95% CI: 0.33–0.53, P = 0.02), BrainSegFounder 0.49 (95% CI: 0.39–0.59) and Scratch 0.50 (95% CI: 0.39–0.59). BrainIAC performance increased at 100% availability with AUC 0.66 improving over MedicalNet 0.48, BrainSegFounder 0.51 and Scratch 0.50 (Fig. 2d). The concordance index with 95% CI is reported in Supplementary Tables 17 and 18.

MCI detection and classification from healthy control data can lead to early detection and improved management of neurocognitive diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease39. We evaluated BrainIAC as a core for the classification of MCI versus healthy participants by evaluating the AUC as the performance metric (Fig. 2b). The DeLong test was used for checking statistical significance and calculating P values (Supplementary Table 20).

For MCI classification, we used 195 scans (106 healthy control, 89 MCI) for training and validation, with 40 (29 healthy control, 11 MCI) reserved as a test set from the OASIS-1 dataset (Supplementary Methods A.2.5). BrainIAC outperformed other models at all data percentages, with notable AUC margins at lower data percentages (60% and below). At 10% data availability (n = 20), BrainIAC yielded AUC 0.70 (95% CI: 0.50–0.87), compared to 0.56 (95% CI: 0.35–0.75) for MedicalNet, 0.52 (95% CI: 0.32–0.72) for BrainSegFounder (P = 0.071) and 0.54 (95% CI: 0.34–0.73) for Scratch. Increasing training data availability to 100% (n = 195), BrainIAC yielded AUC 0.88 (95% CI: 0.75–0.97), compared to 0.82 (95% CI: 0.67–0.94) for MedicalNet, 0.62 (95% CI: 0.39–0.82) for BrainSegFounder and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.55–0.93) for Scratch.

Time-since-stroke-onset prediction can allow clinicians to make evidence-based decisions for time-sensitive treatments, enabling optimal intervention selection for stroke patients who might otherwise be excluded due to uncertain onset time. To evaluate BrainIAC as a tool to predict time-to-stroke, we leveraged the ATLAS dataset with scans from 210 stroke patients with median 77 days (interquartile range: 11.0–151.0). For time-to-stroke prediction we allocated 170 scans for training and validation and reserved 40 scans as a holdout test set (Supplementary Methods A.2.6).

BrainIAC outperformed other models at all data percentages, with greater MAE difference at higher data percentages (40% and above). At 10% data availability (n = 18), BrainIAC resulted in MAE 61.56 compared to 67.31 for MedicalNet, 77.32 for BrainSegFounder and 64.78 for Scratch. Increasing training data availability to 100% (n = 170), BrainIAC yielded MAE of 38.87, compared to 62.24 for MedicalNet, 63.73 for BrainSegFounder and 50.63 for Scratch (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Table 22).

Glioma segmentation is a critical task in neuro-oncology as it enables quantitative assessment of tumor burden, treatment planning and longitudinal monitoring of disease progression. To assess the transferability of BrainIAC for segmentation, we fine-tuned each backbone on the BraTS23 adult glioma dataset, reformulated as a single-channel binary segmentation task using FLAIR sequences (Supplementary Methods A.2.7). Performance was quantified by mean Dice coefficient (DSC) across varying data fractions (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 26).

BrainIAC consistently achieved higher Dice scores compared to MedicalNet, BrainSegFounder and Scratch baselines across all training data percentages. Notably, at 10% data availability (n = 120 scans), BrainIAC attained a mean Dice score of 72 (95% CI: 0.02), outperforming MedicalNet (DSC: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.03, P < 0.0001), BrainSegFounder (DSC: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.02) and Scratch (DSC: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.02) (P < 0.0001). At full data availability, BrainIAC maintained superior segmentation accuracy with a Dice score of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.02), compared to MedicalNet (0.69), BrainSegFounder (0.75) and Scratch (0.70). Qualitative inspection of segmentations depict more precise delineation of tumor boundaries by BrainIAC with fewer false positives in healthy tissue as training data percentage increased (Fig. 4d).

To evaluate downstream adaptation capabilities under extreme data constraints, we conducted few-shot fine-tuning experiments across seven downstream tasks and under two settings: single-sample (K = 1) and five-sample (K = 5) per class. All models evaluated on independent holdout test sets.

For sequence classification of four classes (T1W, T2W, FLAIR and T1CE), BrainIAC demonstrated superior performance with BA of 0.53 in the K = 1 setting, compared to 0.25 (MedicalNet), 0.34 (BrainSegFounder) and 0.34 (Scratch). This performance advantage expanded in the K = 5 setting, with BrainIAC achieving BA of 0.73 versus 0.49 (MedicalNet), 0.40 (BrainSegFounder) and 0.43 (Scratch) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 25).

In brain age prediction, we stratified participants into four age bins (0–10, 10–20, 20–30 and 30–40 years) on internal test set. BrainIAC achieved superior MAE of 9.45 years in the K = 1 setting, compared to 17.44 (MedicalNet), 10.97 (BrainSegFounder) and 16.93 (Scratch). The performance improvement persisted in the K = 5 setting, with MAEs of 7.24, 15.03, 10.24 and 14.28 years, respectively (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 11).

For IDH mutation classification, BrainIAC achieved an AUC of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.49–0.78) in the K = 1 setting, outperforming both MedicalNet (AUC: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.24–0.50)), BrainSegFounder (AUC: 0.57 (95% CI: 0.43–0.70)) and Scratch (AUC: 0.48 (95% CI: 0.32–0.64)). Similar performance was observed in the K = 5 setting with AUC: 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52–0.76) (BrainIAC), AUC: 0.44 (95% CI: 0.30–0.58) (MedicalNet), AUC: 0.62 (95% CI: 0.50–0.74) (BrainSegFounder) and AUC: 0.55 (95% CI: 0.41–0.68) (Scratch), respectively (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 14).

In overall survival prediction (binary classification) on external test set, BrainIAC maintained superior performance for K = 1 and K = 5. For K = 1, BrainIAC achieved an AUC of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.49–0.68), compared to 0.38 (95% CI: 0.29–0.47) (MedicalNet), AUC: 0.42 (95% CI: 0.32–0.52) (BrainSegFounder) and 0.37 (95% CI: 0.27–0.46) (Scratch). The K = 5 setting yielded AUCs of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.51–0.70], 0.55 (95% CI: 0.44–0.65), 0.58 (95% CI: 0.47–0.67) and 0.48 (95% CI: 0.39–0.58), respectively (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 19). With K = 1, K = 5, 10%, 100% of training data available, BrainIAC median risks scores were able to stratify (P < 0.05) patients significantly into high- and low-risk groups for both internal and external test sets (Fig. 4a,b).

For MCI classification, BrainIAC demonstrated AUC of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.51–0.84) in the K = 1 setting, outperforming MedicalNet (AUC: 0.56 (95% CI: 0.36–0.75)), BrainSegFounder (AUC: 0.60 (95% CI: 0.41–0.79)) and Scratch (AUC: 0.49 (95% CI: 0.29–0.69)). The K = 5 setting showed similar relative performance, with AUCs of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.64–0.92), 0.63 (95% CI: 0.45–0.79), 0.53 (95% CI: 0.33–0.71) and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.29–0.72), respectively (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 21).

For time-to-stroke prediction, we binned the data into two temporal categories (0–120 days and 120–240 days). BrainIAC demonstrated superior performance in both few-shot settings, achieving MAE of 66.10 days versus 83.97 (Scratch), 75.98 (BrainSegFounder) and 85.97 (MedicalNet) for K = 1 and 69.46 days versus 65.63 (Scratch), 65.15 (BrainSegFounder) and 85.15 (MedicalNet) for K = 5 (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Table 23).

For the tumor segmentation task, BrainIAC demonstrated robust adaptation under few-shot constraints (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Table 27). In the single-sample setting (K = 1), BrainIAC achieved a mean Dice score of 0.51, substantially outperforming MedicalNet (0.13), BrainSegFounder (0.49) and Scratch (0.03). This advantage persisted with five samples per class (K = 5), where BrainIAC maintained a mean Dice score of 0.61 compared to MedicalNet (0.51), BrainSegFounder (0.53) and Scratch (0.13).

To benchmark the representational quality of learned pretrained embeddings, we performed linear probing across seven downstream tasks using the full training datasets (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Tables 28–34). Linear probing performance serves as a proxy for the task-relevant information captured in the frozen encoder without task-specific fine-tuning. BrainIAC consistently outperformed MedicalNet and BrainSegFounder across all evaluated tasks. Specifically, BrainIAC achieved an AUC of 0.69 for mutation prediction compared to 0.60 (BrainSegFounder) and 0.58 (MedicalNet); for brain age prediction, BrainIAC resulted in a lower MAE of 7.51 years relative to 10.45 (BrainSegFounder) and 7.9 (MedicalNet). Similar trends were observed for dementia prediction (AUC: 0.72 versus 0.48 and 0.47), time-to-stroke prediction (MAE: 64.31 days versus 72.6 and 74.7), sequence classification (BA: 0.75 versus 0.42 and 0.40), tumor segmentation (Dice: 0.67 versus 0.64 and 0.57) and overall survival (AUC: 0.68 versus 0.60 and 0.58).

In this study, we present BrainIAC—a foundation model for brain MRI analysis developed with self-supervised contrastive pretraining and evaluated on 48,965 multiparametric brain MRI scans spanning several demographic and clinical settings. We find that BrainIAC consistently outperforms traditional supervised models and transfer learning from more general biomedical imaging models across a wide range of downstream applications on healthy and disease-containing scans with minimal fine-tuning. BrainIAC is robust to imaging perturbations. BrainIAC's performance consistency stems in part from a systematic encoder selection as we benchmarked several pretraining strategies and backbones using few-shot evaluation across all tasks and selected 3D ViT-B as the BrainIAC foundation model. This improvement reflects the ability of ViT to model long-range spatial relationships when trained with SimCLR's contrastive objective, resulting in more generalizable feature representations than those learned by convolutional or reconstruction-based encoders. Our findings demonstrate BrainIAC's adaptive and generalization capabilities, positioning it as a powerful foundation for development of clinically usable imaging-based deep learning tools, particularly in limited data scenarios.

The emergence of foundation models has advanced medical imaging AI applications, from biomarker discovery to cancer diagnostics10,40. Several pretrained model frameworks exist for biomedical imaging41,42, but only a few are focused exclusively on brain MRI and are publicly available, for example, MedicalNet27 and BrainSegFounder25—used as a primary benchmark in this study. Although MedicalNet and BrainSegFounder represent a powerful advance for biomedical imaging analysis, we find that a foundation model pretrained with SSL for multiparametric MRI consistently outperforms the broader biomedical imaging model or a foundational segmentation model on wide spectrum of tasks. We hypothesize that the inherent differences between MRI intensity values, sequence acquisitions and anatomy make a brain MRI-specific foundation model critical to high-performing algorithms in neuroimaging. A few approaches to foundation models for brain MRI lesion segmentation proposed19,25 and anomaly detection43, but the present work applies and rigorously evaluates an SSL approach for broad, classification, regression and segmentation problems together, representing important use cases for medical management of diseases that affect the brain.

BrainIAC was tested intentionally on tasks that have a range of perceived difficulty from a clinical standpoint. On one end of the spectrum, MRI sequence classification and tumor segmentation are straightforward for trained clinicians and, on the other end of the spectrum, time-to-stroke prediction, genomic subtyping and survival prediction are very challenging based on imaging alone. Supervised deep learning models have shown promise in even challenging brain MRI tasks44,45, but require a large amount of training data and are prone to performance degradation when applied in contexts outside that on which they were trained46,47, thus limiting their clinical usability and utility. BrainIAC showed consistently improved performance over other approaches in all tasks, regardless of perceived difficulty, particularly in low (<10% of data available) and few-shot data settings. Notably, even with all training data made available, BrainIAC continued to demonstrate higher performance in tasks that were both challenging and had limited training cases available (that is, mutational subtype, survival prediction, MCI classification, time-to-stroke prediction and tumor segmentation), whereas in ‘easier' tasks with more data (for example, sequence classification) the performance gap was narrower between BrainIAC and other approaches. This indicates that the utility of BrainIAC as a foundation model is probably potentiated in settings of challenging tasks and low data, such as classification of rare cancers or MCI participants. Furthermore, BrainIAC was found to be more generalizable for brain age and survival prediction, for which true external test sets were available for evaluation. For brain age prediction at 100% training data availability (3,882 scans), BrainIAC continued to show improved accuracy versus other approaches, suggesting that BrainIAC learned more informative, generalizable features to form a basis for fine-tuning. BrainIAC also demonstrated superior performance across data availability scenarios for MCI classification. Hence, potentially serving as a feature extractor for imaging-based analysis of neurodegenerative and neurofunctional diseases. In tumor-related tasks, where labeled data scarcity often poses major challenges, the improvement in performance provided by BrainIAC was clear. Improved performance in tumor segmentation task demonstrate the adaptability of BrainIAC representations and allow use in segmentation of rare tumors with limited data availability.

Notably, saliency map visualizations reveal BrainIAC's attention towards the biologically plausible regions for downstream tasks. The model focuses consistently on relevant neuroanatomical regions. For instance, attention was directed to the hippocampus in MCI classification, periventricular white matter regions in brain age prediction and enhancing tumor cores in IDH mutation prediction and overall survival prediction (Fig. 7).

Perturbation analyses demonstrated BrainIAC's resilience to common MRI artifacts such as contrast shifts, Gibbs ringing and bias-field distortions. BrainIAC maintained more stable performance than MedicalNet, BrainSegFounder and Scratch, especially in low-data tasks such as mutation prediction, time-to-stroke and survival prediction where other models noticeably degraded (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Methods A.4).

Our study has several limitations. Currently, the study focuses exclusively on standard structural MRI sequences (T1w, T2w, FLAIR, T1CE). Other contrast types, such as diffusion-weighted or functional imaging, remain outside the current scope and represent scope for future work. Although BrainIAC was developed as a single-sequence model to maintain compatibility across heterogeneous clinical settings, future extensions toward multisequence, multichannel representations could enable improved performance and flexibility, particularly for tasks reliant on multiparametric information. The model was trained on skull-stripped images, thus limiting its application to intracranial analysis. In addition, we do not benchmark image registration as a downstream task, as registration is treated widely as a preprocessing step in MRI analysis pipelines and is not commonly evaluated as a downstream benchmark in current foundation model studies. Finally, although the study represents the largest pretrained brain MRI foundational model up to now, inclusion of even further training data may yield performance improvements. Future work will focus on investigation of performance improvements with incorporation of new training data, learning strategies and architectures, coupled with multimodal approaches including clinical and ‘omics' data. In addition, whereas standard software tools currently exist for white and gray matter segmentation, future downstream applications of BrainIAC could explore these tasks to assess whether foundation model representations provide further gains.

In conclusion, BrainIAC represents a step towards generalized brain MRI analysis with self-supervised foundation models. With minimal fine-tuning, BrainIAC can raise the bar for performance on several MRI tasks. Our findings suggest that a BrainIAC foundation pipeline could replace traditional supervised learning strategies for brain MRI and allow for the development of models adaptable to challenging tasks in data-limited scenarios that were previously thought infeasible. Ultimately, BrainIAC is designed to establish a generalizable baseline for brain MRI representation learning, enabling efficient fine-tuning and adaptation across diverse downstream tasks, rather than to supplant specialized models optimized for a single, well-defined objective.

This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (Protocol 13-055). A waiver of informed consent was granted due to the retrospective nature of the study, the use of deidentified clinical data and the inclusion of publicly available datasets. We curated a dataset pool of 48,965 brain MRI scans, including 24,504 T1W, 5,389 T2W, 15,372 T2FLAIR and 3,254 T1CE sequences. The data pool was aggregated from the following datasets: ABCD48, ADNI, DFCI/BCH LGG, OASIS-349, MCSA50, SOOP51, ABIDE (https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/databases.html), CBTN LGG52, MIRIAD53, PPMI (https://www.ppmi-info.org), DLBS54, RadArt55, OASIS-256, DFCI/BCH HGG, QIN-GBM57, RIDER58, UPENN-GBM38, BraTS 202359,60,61,62, UCSF-PDGM36, HCP S120063, LONG57964, BABY65, AOMIC ID1000 (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003097), Calgary Preschool MRI (https://osf.io/axz5r/overview), HaN66, NIMH67, ICBM, IXI (https://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/), PING68, Pixar69, SALD70, PETfrog71 OASIS-156, ATLAS72,73 further details and acknowledgements are in Supplementary Methods A.1. For Alzheimer's datasets (for example, ADNI, OASIS-3, MIRIAD), we included all scans from cognitively normal, MCI and Alzheimer's disease participants, using each longitudinal scan as an independent images for pretraining. All MRI scans used for model pretraining and evaluation were acquired at clinical field strengths of 1.5 T or 3 T. Data from ultra-high or low field strengths were not included.

We developed a systematic preprocessing pipeline to ensure standardization and quality control of the structural MRI data. Raw DICOM images were converted initially to NIFTI format using the dcm2nii package (Python v.3.8). To address low-frequency intensity nonuniformity inherent in MRI acquisitions, we applied N4 bias field correction using SimpleITK. All scans were subsequently resampled to isotropic 1 × 1 × 1 mm3 voxels through linear interpolation, followed by rigid registration to the MNI space brain atlas. Finally, brain extraction and skull stripping were performed using the HD-BET package74 as the last preprocessing step before the analyses.

We implemented a self-supervised pretraining approach based on SimCLR6 and MAE5, which has demonstrated great success in 3D radiological imaging analysis12, for the training of the foundation model. We trained SimCLR with 3D MONAI implementation of ResNet50 and ViT-B as two different vision encoders, whereas for the MAE pretraining we leveraged Swin-UNETR architecture with SwinViT as the encoder backbone. The contrastive learning framework employed a normalized temperature-scaled cross entropy (NT-Xent)75 loss function to optimize spatial learning. This approach maximized similarity between positive pairs (augmented views derived from the same image) while minimizing similarity between negative pairs (views from different images). The MAE objective included 75% masking ratio with a patch size of (16,16,16) and MSE loss, to allow input image reconstructions. Input volumes were standardized to (96,96,96) voxels at (1,1,1) mm spacing. We used a comprehensive augmentation pipeline comprising random flips, Gaussian blur, Gaussian noise, affine transformations (scale, rotation, translation) and random cropping, with subsequent resizing to maintain dimensional consistency (Fig. 1b) for SimCLR objective, whereas normalization and scaling were the only transformations performed for MAE objective to allow minimum input image altercation and maximize spatial learning. Both pretrainings was conducted over 200 epochs with a batch size of 32 on an NVIDIA A6000 graphics processing unit, requiring approximately 72 h for completion (Supplementary Table 26). Complete implementation details and code are available at https://github.com/AIM-KannLab/BrainIAC.

To identify systematically the optimal pretrained encoder to serve as for BrainIAC, we conducted few-shot benchmarking across seven clinically relevant downstream tasks (Extended Data Fig. 2). We evaluated three vision encoders from two pretraining strategies: (1) SimCLR-ResNet50, a convolutional-based model using contrastive pretraining; (2) SimCLR-ViTb 3D, a vision transformer pretrained using contrastive learning and (3) MAE-SwinViT, a 3D Swin Transformer pretrained using a masked autoencoder strategy. Each encoder was assessed under two few-shot settings, K = 1 and K = 5, to evaluate feature quality and downstream training adaptability in data-limited scenario. Performance metrics appropriate to each downstream task were employed such as AUC, BA and MAE. Based on these results, the highest-performing encoder was selected and designated as the BrainIAC backbone for subsequent downstream analyses and performance comparison.

We fine tuned the foundation model for downstream adaptation across seven distinct clinical applications: sequence classification, brain age prediction, mutation prediction, overall survival, MCI classification, time-to-stoke prediction and segmentation. We evaluated model performance systematically using three initialization strategies: brain MRI foundation model (BrainIAC) fine-tuning, supervised training with random initialization (Scratch) and fine-tuning from MedicalNet weights (MedicalNet). Each application pipeline was constructed upon the vision encoder, with architectural modifications based on the specific task requirements (classification versus regression) and input characteristics (single versus multiple images).

For evaluation and comparison, we implemented a framework in which the datasets were partitioned initially into training-validation and test-holdout sets. The training-validation data was further subdivided into several fractions (10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%) to assess model performance across varying data availability scenarios. For each fraction, we trained models using all three initialization approaches and evaluated their performance on the constant holdout set (Extended Data Fig. 1). We conducted similar training experiments for all tasks in K = 1 and K = 5 (few-shot) setting and evaluated performance. The architectural pipeline maintained a vision backbone, with task-specific modules appended for each application. The task-specific modules were initialized randomly across all approaches, and the vision weights were initialized according to the respective strategy: BrainIAC, MedicalNet and Scratch. We report our results in accordance with the TRIPOD+AI statement guidance76.

To evaluate the quality of features learned by different comparative models (BrainIAC, BrainSegFounder and MedicalNet), we conducted linear probing across all seven downstream tasks. In this setup, the model backbone was kept frozen, and only the final layer was trained: a single fully connected layer with one output neuron for classification and regression tasks and a decoder block for segmentation tasks. Training configurations matched those used for fine-tuning and few-shot experiments, except for an increased learning rate of 0.001 to optimize the linear probe.

Each Downstream application is implemented by segregating the task specific dataset into a training-validation and test (holdout) sets, using the 80:20 split ratio. The training-validation set is further sampled to generate datasets of varying sample size (10% up to 100%). All approaches are trained, separately, on each dataset faction and the resulting models are evaluated and compared on the reserved holdout set.

CD8+ T cells are the dominant clonally expanded lymphocyte population in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions but their clonal identity, function and antigen specificity are not well understood. A comprehensive single-cell RNA-sequencing and T cell receptor-sequencing analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid and blood from individuals in the MS and control cohorts revealed a subset of 23 highly expanded and activated CD8+ T cell clonotypes that were enriched predominantly in the cerebrospinal fluid in the MS cohort. Using unbiased and targeted antigen discovery approaches, six CD8+ T cell clonotypes recognizing Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) antigens and multiple novel mimotopes were identified. Although the majority of mimotopes did not elicit functional responses, three of the expanded CD8+ T cell receptors from patients with MS were reactive to EBV. EBV DNA and transcripts were detected in cerebrospinal fluid, including in patients with MS who had highly expanded EBV-specific CD8+ T cells. These findings shed vital insight into the role of CD8+ T cells in MS and support an important role of EBV in MS immunopathology.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating condition of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by substantial T cell involvement1. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are found within the perivascular spaces as well as in the parenchyma of MS lesions2,3. CD8+ T cells are enriched and clonally expanded relative to CD4+ T cells in MS lesions4,5, suggesting local antigen-driven expansion. Specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I alleles also alter MS susceptibility6, providing additional support for a critical role of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in MS biology. The goal of this study was to identify T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, that are uniquely expanded in the CNS and determine their phenotypic characteristics and antigen specificity.

Acquisition of CNS tissue to analyze the infiltrating T cell response in MS is invasive and rarely performed early in the disease course. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a transit site of lymphocytes entering the CNS7 and provides a window into the immune responses within the CNS. Studies of the CSF repertoire have indeed indicated high clonal overlap with expanded T cell populations in MS lesions8,9.

Single-cell-sequencing technologies provide powerful opportunities for deep phenotyping and clonal characterization of T cells in numerous diseases, including MS10,11,12,13,14, yet detailed analyses of CSF-expanded T cells and their antigen specificity in MS are lacking. In this study, CSF and blood from individuals with early untreated MS as well as control participants were subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) paired with single-cell T cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing (scTCR-seq). After identifying a subset of CSF-expanded CD8+ T cells in the patients with MS, their antigen specificity was investigated using a combination of unbiased and targeted antigen discovery methodologies.

A total of 18 individuals were enrolled in the study—11 with relapsing-remitting MS, two with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), two with other neuro-inflammatory disorders (OND) and three healthy controls (HCs). The demographics of the four cohorts are presented in Table 1 and those of each individual in Supplementary Table 1. All of the patients in the MS and CIS (MS/CIS) cohort were treatment-naive (that is, no previous history of immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies) at the time of sample collection but one of the patients with OND was on immunotherapy with a TNF-α inhibitor.

Paired peripheral blood and CSF were collected on the same day for each study participant. Freshly acquired samples comprised of all unseparated cell subsets underwent paired scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq using 10X Genomics 5′ library preparation kits to permit combined single-cell transcriptional phenotyping and TCR clonal analysis. The scRNA-seq data of all participants in this study were previously published15. All major immune cell subsets were readily identified from the scRNA-seq data, with T cell clusters comprising the largest fractions (Fig. 1a). To characterize conventional TCRαβ T cells, all subsequent analyses focused on only those T cells with paired scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data (Fig. 1b). A total of 48,468 individual T cells were identified from the blood and CSF across all participants (Fig. 1c). As expected, TCR-associated genes (CD3E and CD3D) were highly upregulated with minimal expression of non-T cell-associated genes (for example, CD19; Extended Data Fig. 1). We identified 33,349 CD4+ and 15,119 CD8+ T cells expressing paired TCRαβ genes (described in Methods) for analysis from the combination of blood and CSF of all 18 participants (Supplementary Table 2).

UMAP, uniform manifold approximation and projection.

Pseudotime analysis of T cells in the CSF revealed distinct populations of T cells largely segregated based on T cell subsets (that is, CD4+ or CD8+), highlighting the distinct transcriptional signatures associated with different T cell states and functions (Fig. 1d). Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were distinct between the peripheral blood and CSF (Fig. 1e,f). For instance, CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Table 3) in the CSF displayed significantly increased expression of various genes relative to the peripheral blood, including genes associated with migration and trafficking (CXCR3, CXCR4, CCL4, ITGB1 and ITGA4), signaling and activation (CD2, FYN and DUSP2), and cytotoxicity (GZMK and GZMA). In contrast, peripheral blood-derived CD8+ T cells expressed significantly higher levels of FOS, JUN, DUSP1 and GADD45B, indicating an alternate activation state. In a comparison of only memory (CD27-expressing) CD8+ T cells, there was significant upregulation of genes associated with T cell activation (HLA-DRA), chemokines (CCL4 and XCL1) and cholesterol metabolism (LDLR and SQLE), and downregulation of genes associated with T cell signaling (FOS, FOSB, JUN and JUNB) in the CSF relative to the blood (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 4). In the CSF, CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Table 3) had significantly increased expression of genes similar to their CD8+ T cell counterparts (ITGB1, ITGA4, CXCR3, GZMA, GZMK and CD2) as well as distinct genes (JUN, FOS, DUSP1, CCR7 and HCST).

Given the disproportionate number of participants in the different disease categories (Table 1), we grouped the patients with MS or CIS (MS/CIS; n = 13) and performed differential gene expression against the combined group of HCs and patients with OND (HC/OND; non-MS group; n = 5; Fig. 1g). In CD8+ T cells combined from the peripheral blood and CSF, various genes were differentially expressed between the MS/CIS and HC/OND groups (Fig. 1h). In particular, genes associated with tissue trafficking (CXCR4, CCL5, KLF2, ITGA4, ITGB1 and CD69) and cytotoxicity (GZMK, KLRG1 and GZMA) were upregulated in the MS/CIS cohort (Supplementary Table 5). In contrast, genes associated with central memory status (CCR7, SELL and LEF1) and TCR signaling (CD8B, CD3D, CD3E, LCK, ZAP70 and LAT) were downregulated relative to the HC/OND group. A similar profile was observed for CD4+ T cells from the blood and CSF of patients with MS/CIS, including increased expression of genes related to tissue migration (ITGB1, CD69, ITGA4, CXCR3 and CXCR4) and cytokine secretion (IL32 and GZMK), and reduced central memory status (CCR7, LEF1, SELL and TCF7) and TCR signaling (LCK; Fig. 1i and Supplementary Table 5). Overall, these data suggest that both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the patients with MS/CIS are more activated with increased effector functions and tissue homing capacity than the HC/OND cohort, consistent with other studies11,12.

The clonal repertoire of T cell subsets was compared across compartments (that is, peripheral blood versus CSF) and across disease states (that is, MS/CIS versus HC/OND). T cell clonotypes were defined as T cells sharing identical V and J genes and CDR3 amino-acid sequences for paired TCRαβ sequences similar to previous studies10,16. A total of 31,756 unique CD4+ T cell clonotypes and 10,825 unique CD8+ T cell clonotypes were identified from all individuals (Supplementary Table 2). The CD4+ and CD8+ T cell diversities (measured by Shannon entropy) were significantly higher in MS/CIS compared with HC/OND in the peripheral blood and CSF (Extended Data Fig. 3). The diversity of CD4+ T cells was significantly higher in blood compared with CSF but not for CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3). These findings suggest a more diverse array of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clonotypes are present in both the blood and CSF of patients with MS/CIS.

T cell clonal expansion is a hallmark of previous antigen encounter; therefore, our analysis focused on T cell clonality in the CSF. T cells were divided into three different categories of clonal expansion: unexpanded (single cell of a given clonotype), moderately expanded (>1 cell but <0.75% of the CSF T cell repertoire of an individual) or highly expanded (≥0.75% of the CSF T cell repertoire of an individual). We chose 0.75% as the cutoff for highly expanded clonotypes as it represented a relatively high threshold based on the clonal expansion observed in the CSF of our patient cohorts as well as others10,17. Although small fractions of clonally expanded CD4+ T cells were observed in the CSF, much larger populations of highly and moderately expanded CD8+ T cells were observed in similar proportions in the MS/CIS and HC/OND groups (Fig. 2a). CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clonal expansion in the CSF was overall similar between the patients with CIS or MS (Supplementary Table 6).

a, CD8+ and CD4+ T cell clonal expansion was compared between MS/CIS and HC/OND subjects. b, Clonal frequencies of all T cell clonotypes in the CSF and blood that were highly expanded T cells and enriched at least twofold more frequently than the blood of the same individual are highlighted in red. c,d, Frequency of highly expanded and enriched T cells according to CD8 (n = 24) or CD4 (n = 10) status (c) and MS/CIS (n = 25) or HC/OND (n = 9) status (d).

To delineate between T cells expanded similarly in the blood and CSF versus those preferentially expanded in the CSF, the abundance of all T cell clonotypes in the blood and CSF was compared in all individuals. The overwhelming majority of T cell clonotypes were detected in the blood or CSF only, whereas only about 1.5% of all clonotypes were found in both compartments (Fig. 2b). We postulated that highly expanded T cell clonotypes (that is, CSF frequency of ≥0.75%) that were enriched in the CSF relative to the peripheral blood were more likely to be responsive to local antigens in the CSF and/or CNS (albeit not necessarily CNS-specific antigens). Enriched CSF-expanded T cell clonotypes were defined as those with a CSF frequency at least twofold higher than the peripheral-blood frequency from the same individual. This yielded 33 highly CSF-enriched and expanded T cell clonotype varying from approximately twofold to more than 100-fold higher frequencies in the CSF relative to peripheral blood (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 7). More than 70% of the highly expanded and CSF-enriched T cell clonotypes in the CSF were CD8+ T cells. The frequencies of highly expanded CSF-enriched CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were similar, ranging from 0.76 to 4.9% of the entire CSF repertoire of an individual (Fig. 2c). Although there were no statistically significant differences in the mean frequencies of highly expanded CSF-enriched T cell clonotypes between MS/CIS and HC/OND, only participants in the MS/CIS cohort had CSF-enriched T cells with frequencies greater than 2% (Fig. 2d). One patient with MS (patient identifier (ID), MS6) had 11 highly enriched T cell clonotypes, the majority of which were CD8+ T cells, which encompassed nearly 20% of their CSF repertoire (Supplementary Table 7). These findings therefore provide strong support for robust oligoclonal CD8+ T cell expansion and enrichment in the CSF, with the greatest expansion found in MS/CIS.

Highly expanded and unexpanded T cells in the CSF were compared by scRNA-seq analysis. Substantial differential gene expression changes were observed in highly expanded T cells in comparison to their unexpanded counterparts (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 8). In particular, genes associated with cytotoxic CD8+ T cell function (CD8A, CD8B, NKG7, KLRD1, GZMA, GZMH, GZMM, GZMK and EOMES) and chemotaxis (CCL5 and CCL4) were significantly increased in highly expanded T cells, whereas genes associated with naive status were significantly reduced (IL7R, LTB and LDHB). Targeted gene expression analysis revealed increased expression of additional genes associated with effector/memory differentiation (KLRG1 and CD27), tissue homing (CXCR3 and CCR5) and resident memory status (CD69 and IGTAE) as well as inhibitory genes associated with chronic antigen exposure (HOPX, TIGIT, DUSP2, PDCD1 and LAG3) in highly CSF-expanded CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 4). A tissue-resident-memory (TRM) phenotype of CSF-expanded T cells coexpressing CD69 and IGTAE was confirmed by the reduced expression of KLF2 and S1PR1 genes (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Table 9). In contrast, CSF-unexpanded T cells expressed higher levels of genes associated with central memory/nonactivation (SELL, CCR7, IL7R, TCF7 and LEF1) as well as the integrin gene ITGB1. To further characterize CSF-enriched and expanded T cell clonotypes, the 33 T cell clonotypes were overlaid with 11 distinct CSF T cell clusters (Fig. 2f,g). The overwhelming majority of the enriched and expanded clonotypes were found in cluster 1, which was defined by a significantly increased expression of a number of genes associated with cytotoxic effector CD8+ T cells, including CD8A, CD8B, PLEK, DUSP2, EOMES, GZMK, GZMA, GZMH, PRF1, NKG7, CCL5 and CCL4 (Supplementary Table 10). Overall, these data indicate that highly clonally expanded T cells in the CSF express gene profiles indicative of substantial antigen experience, cytotoxicity and distinct tissue homing capacities.

Nearly all CSF T cell clonotypes across all individuals were unique. Only 21 identical TCRs (that is, same V and J genes and CDR3 amino-acid sequences for the paired α and β chains) were found between the peripheral blood of different individuals and another three that were identical between the blood and CSF of different individuals, irrespective of disease status (Fig. 3a). To further assess clonal relationships, Grouping of Lymphocyte Interactions with Paratope Hotspots 2 (GLIPH2) was employed, an algorithm to help identify TCRs with potentially shared specificity based on sequence similarity within the CDR3β region18. All CSF T cell clonotypes were analyzed using GLIPH2 and the output was then queried against the 33 CSF high-enriched CDR3 sequences. Using this approach, 19 clonally related networks comprised of a total of 44 clonotypes were identified (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 11). Most of the networks comprised two related clonotypes and two networks were comprised of five clonotypes each. Almost all networks consisted of clonotypes from the same individual and were identified primarily among the individuals with MS or CIS (Fig. 3b). Nearly all of the clonally related T cells were CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Table 11), suggesting potential shared antigen specificity.

Data are the mean ± s.e.m. FLRGRAYGL (EBV EBNA3A193–201) was presented by HLA-B*08:01-expressing APCs (left) and EPLPQGQLTAY (EBV BZLF154–64) was presented by HLA-B*35:01-expressing APCs (right).

Antigen discovery efforts focused on the 23 highly expanded, CSF-enriched CD8+ T cell clonotypes (≥0.75 of the CSF repertoire and enriched at least twofold in the CSF relative to the blood) that comprised more than 70% of the expanded CSF-enriched T cells. Several different strategies were undertaken (Fig. 4a). An unbiased antigen discovery approach was first employed using a peptide:MHC (pMHC) yeast display library in which approximately 1–10 × 108 random peptides are displayed on a given MHC allele for probing recognition against individual TCRs19. Of the 23 CD8+ TCRs, 18 were successfully expressed and tested against specific MHC I allele libraries based on library availability and the alleles of the participants from whom the TCRs were derived. Four TCRs (three MS/CIS and one HC) demonstrated substantial enrichment of specific peptides from three different MHC I libraries (Supplementary Table 12).

a, Individual TCRαβ pairs were cloned into plasmids and expressed in primary human CD8+ T cells by nonviral CRISPR knock-in. Candidate antigens for testing specificity were identified in three parallel strategies, screened by pMHC tetramer binding and validated by cytokine production to cognate antigen. b, Candidate antigens for four TCRs identified by pMHC yeast display (unbiased antigen discovery) were tested for tetramer binding and cytokine reactivity experiments. Data are the mean ± s.e.m. Each peptide was tested a minimum of two times using T cells from different donors for tetramer and cytokine, respectively (RLVWDLETL, n = 6 and 4; RLIFDVPWL, n = 2 (both tests); RLLWDWEFV, n = 3 (both tests); RLVWDLEIL, n = 7 and 6; LVDYAKPPR, n = 6 and 5; RVIWEPEFR, n = 5 and 2; KVMWEPWFK n = 5 and 4; GYEIMLLDY n = 2 and 3; GYDVKELSY n = 2 and 3; CSERNPWTF n = 5 and 4; ATDVGWWWY, n = 5 and 2).

To validate these candidate antigens, each TCR was expressed individually in primary human CD8+ T cells by nonviral CRISPR–Cas9-mediated TCR knock-in (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Candidate TCR-expressing CD8+ T cells were then probed for antigen specificity using pMHC I tetramers loaded with peptides identified from the yeast display library screen. Three of the four tested TCRs demonstrated robust tetramer binding to most or all of the library-identified peptides (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 5b). The ability of CD8+ T cells expressing these TCRs to respond functionally to the same antigens was tested by intracellular cytokine stimulation using antigen-presenting cells (APCs) expressing the relevant MHC I allele. Strikingly, only TCR clonotype 54189_65570 demonstrated cytokine production to peptide CSERNPWTFY; none of the other TCR-expressing CD8+ T cells were functionally responsive to the respective yeast display-derived peptides (Fig. 4b). As nearly all of the yeast display peptides identified by pMHC I tetramers were not naturally occurring (that is, mimotopes), the analysis was extended to an array of foreign and human peptide homologs (Supplementary Table 12). Varying degrees of tetramer binding were observed depending on the TCR tested but none of the peptide homologs elicited cytokine responses above background (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). Thus, although the unbiased antigen discovery approach yielded novel mimotopes of several CD8+ T cell clonotypes detectable by pMHC I tetramer binding, none exhibited functional reactivity to naturally occurring antigens.

The highly expanded CSF-enriched TCR clonotypes were queried against several public TCR databases, including VDJdb20, TCRex21 and TCRmatch22, as an additional TCR antigen discovery strategy (Fig. 4a). One CD8+ T cell clonotype (86333_1456) from participant MS8 demonstrated an exact match to both TCRα and -β sequences with a well-described Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) epitope, EBNA3A193–201 (FLRGRAYGL; Supplementary Table 13), which is restricted by HLA-B*08:01, an allele carried by this individual (Supplementary Table 1). This identical clonotype was also moderately expanded in the CSF from an individual with Alzheimer's disease17. A second CD8+ T cell clonotype (69317_24418) from participant MS6 was a near-exact match to a TCR specific for the EBV epitope BZLF154–64 (EPLPQGQLTAY) restricted by HLA-B*35:01, an allele also carried by this individual.

These TCRs were expressed in primary human CD8+ T cells as described earlier and their specificity was again tested by pMHC I tetramer analysis. TCR 86333_1456 and TCR 69317_24418 showed robust tetramer staining to EBNA3A193–201:B*08:01 and BZLF154–64:B*35:01, respectively (Fig. 5a). To confirm functional reactivity, primary human CD8+ T cells expressing each of these TCRs were stimulated with APC lines expressing cognate HLA and loaded with or without cognate EBV peptide. Each TCR demonstrated clear cytokine production to the relevant EBV peptide (Fig. 5b,c), confirming both CSF-expanded and enriched CD8+ T cell clonotypes are specific to EBV antigens.

Amino-acid differences between cognate EBV peptides (leftmost of each plot) and self-peptide homologs are indicated in red. Each peptide was tested in a minimum of two independent experiments.

In light of these findings, the possibility that additional CSF-enriched and expanded CD8+ T cells may be specific for viral antigens, in particular EBV, was further explored. Note that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 peptides were not tested as all samples were collected previous to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Nineteen TCRs were tested against panels of pMHC I tetramers loaded with previously identified immunodominant viral epitopes restricted by HLA matching that of the TCR donors. A total of 98 peptides restricted by eight different MHC I alleles were screened (Supplementary Table 14). Each TCR was screened with individual pMHC tetramers, except in the case of HLA-A*02:01 where tetramers were pooled in groups of five due to the large number of candidate peptides. Each TCR was tested against the indicated peptides a minimum of two times using two different T cell donors for TCR expression. No specific tetramer signal was observed for any of the TCRs to any of the peptides beyond the two EBV epitopes already identified for TCRs 86333_1456 and 69317_24418 (Extended Data Fig. 7). Although TCR 86333_17042 from participant MS8 showed an identical match for a TCRβ sequence specific for EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigens with corresponding MHC I alleles (Supplementary Table 13), it did not show any notable tetramer binding or cytokine reactivity to either viral antigen (Fig. 5a–c).

Potential reactivity to EBV was further assessed for the other CSF-expanded and enriched CD8+ T cells given the EBV reactivity of two clonotypes. EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were employed to survey a wide array of processed EBV epitopes across a multitude of HLA alleles. NFAT–mCherry-expressing Jurkat cells transfected with the CD8 co-receptor and a single candidate TCR were co-cultured with partially HLA-matched LCLs. Fully HLA-mismatched LCLs and TCR-expressing Jurkat cells from HLA-mismatched patients were used as negative controls. This enabled testing of 16 additional candidate TCRs against at least two different LCLs matching 3–6 MHC I alleles (Supplementary Table 15). Almost all TCRs showed no detectable reactivity; however, TCR 94669_8198 from patient MS27 demonstrated a clear reproducible response to LCLs only when matching the HLA-A*29:02 allele (Fig. 6a–c). No response was elicited from primary B cells from the same donor used to generate the LCLs, indicating this is very likely to be an EBV-specific response rather than a B cell self-antigen or alloreactive response. To identify a potential specific EBV epitope, Jurkat reporter cells expressing TCR 94669_8198 were tested against seven candidate EBV peptides identified from The Immune Epitope Database (FLYALALLL, VFGQQAYFY, AYSSWMYSY, FVYGGSKTSLY, VFSDGRVAC, VSSDGRVAC and ILLARLFLY) presented by HLA-A*29:02-expressing APCs. No functional response was elicited, however, indicating reactivity to a still unspecified EBV epitope (Extended Data Fig. 8).

a, Representative flow cytometry analysis of Jurkat reporter cells expressing the indicated TCR and CD8 co-receptor that were co-cultured with partially HLA-matched (matching allele indicated in red) EBV-transformed LCLs.

Fully HLA-mismatched LCLs and mismatched TCR-expressing Jurkat cells were used as negative controls. a,b, The percentage of cells in the gated regions is indicated. b, Representative flow cytometry analysis of Jurkat reporter cells expressing TCR 94669_8198 were co-cultured with LCLs or primary uninfected B cells from the same donor. c, Summary of all candidate TCRs tested and the corresponding matching MHC I alleles expressed by different LCL lines. The mCherry+CD69+ signal of a given TCR-expressing Jurkat cell line co-cultured with partially MHC-matched LCLs was normalized to the signal observed from completely MHC-mismatched LCLs (left) or mismatched TCR-expressing Jurkat cells (right), which was reported as fold change (FC).

We also explored EBV specificity for CD8+ T cell clonotypes that were aligned to the highly CSF-expanded and enriched CD8+ T cell clonotypes that were EBV-reactive (Fig. 3b). Only GLIPH2-derived TCR sequences from CD8+ T cells that shared the same MHC I allele as that of the aligned EBV-specific clonotype were tested (Supplementary Table 16). Unlike the EBV-specific clonotype 86333_1456, the GLIPH2-aligned TCRs 86333_17042 and 86333_18519 (all from MS8) showed no detectable reactivity to EBNA3A peptide FLRGRAYGL restricted by HLA-B*08:01 (Fig. 3c). TCR 53778_13077 from MS10 was aligned by GLIPH2 to TCR 69317_24418 from MS6, specific for the BZLF1 B*35:01-restricted peptide EPLPQGQLTAY. Strikingly, TCR 53778_13077 was found by VDJdb search to exactly match a TCR previously demonstrated to be specific for EPLPQGQLTAY23. This specificity was validated by stimulating Jurkat reporter cells expressing TCR 53778_13077 with or without EPLPQGQLTAY presented by HLA-B*35:01-expressing APCs. Notably, TCR 53778_13077 was moderately expanded in the CSF (0.35%) and enriched approximately threefold relative to the blood of MS10 (Supplementary Table 2).

These findings indicate that at least three highly expanded CD8+ T cells in the CSF of patients with MS are specific for EBV, but the specificities for most of the enriched T cell clonotypes remain unknown (Fig. 5d). The overwhelming majority of clonotypes were not enriched in the CSF of the 18 study participants (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2) or the three patients with MS and EBV-specific clonotypes (Extended Data Fig. 9a). To assess whether EBV specificity among expanded CD8+ T cells in the CSF was overall enhanced compared with the blood, TCR sequencing alignment (identical V genes, J genes and CDR3 amino-acid sequences for paired TCRα and -β chains) was performed against all expanded CD8+ TCR sequences (>1 TCR per clonotype) in VDJdb20 with CMV used as a comparison. EBV- and CMV-aligned CD8+ TCR sequences in the blood were very similar; however, EBV specificity was markedly increased in the CSF, whereas no CMV specificity was found (Fig. 5e). When the EBV-aligned CD8+ TCR sequences of the MS/CIS and HC/OND groups were compared, EBV-specific TCR alignment was only observed in the patients with MS/CIS (Fig. 5f). This provides additional support that EBV-specific CD8+ T cell expansion is uniquely increased in the CSF in MS.

CD8+ T cells of different viral specificities can exhibit distinct phenotypic characteristics24. The transcriptional profiles of the three CSF-expanded CD8+ T cell clonotypes were therefore compared against all other CSF-expanded and enriched CD8+ T cells. Differential gene expression analysis revealed three genes that were significantly increased in the EBV-specific CD8+ T cells, most notably CXCR5 (Supplementary Table 17), which is associated with migration to B cell follicles and control of chronic infections25. Specific genes associated with memory differentiation, migration and tissue residency were also compared. Consistent with previous reports24, CD27 was particularly abundant in the expanded EBV-specific CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 9b). In addition, KLF2, CXCR4, S1PR1 and CCL4 were more abundant in EBV-specific CD8+ T cells. In contrast, CXCR3, CD69 and CCL5 were more abundant in non-EBV-specific expanded CD8+ T cells. These findings therefore indicate a distinct phenotype of CSF-expanded CD8+ T cells that are specific for EBV. Rather than expressing TRM markers and genes associated with lymphocyte recruitment, these findings suggest that EBV-expanded CD8+ T cells in the CSF are an effector population associated with follicular homing and B cell interactions.

To determine whether the two EBV peptide-reactive CD8+ T cell clonotypes may be cross-reactive against self-antigens, the TCRs were screened against panels of self-peptides with partial sequence homology (Supplementary Table 18). Using NFAT–mCherry-expressing Jurkat cells transfected with the CD8 co-receptor and TCR 86333_1456 or 69317_24418, high reactivity to the respective EBV peptides was confirmed (Fig. 5g,h). Strikingly, no notable reactivity was observed for any of the self-peptide homologs. Although this does not entirely exclude the possibility for self-antigen cross-reactivity, it raises the possibility that the CSF enrichment of these clonally expanded CD8+ T cells may be driven by reactivity to EBV.

To assess for the presence of EBV in CSF, DNA was extracted from the CSF of all study participants and PCR amplified with primers specific for the EBV BZLF1 gene (Extended Data Fig. 10a). The PCR amplicons were Sanger sequenced for further confirmation (Supplementary Table 19). In this manner, EBV DNA was detected in 6/13 MS/CIS samples and 2/5 HC/OND samples (Supplementary Table 20), including patients MS6 and MS8 who also harbored highly expanded EBV-reactive CD8+ T cells in their CSF. The presence of EBV DNA was further quantified by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) via amplification of the EBER2 gene normalized to a housekeeping gene. EBV was detected in the CSF of nearly all patients and control study participants, although the relative abundance varied widely with the highest levels found in patients with MS/CIS (Fig. 7a and Extended Data Fig. 10b). EBV transcripts to several latent and lytic genes were also assessed by complementary DNA quantification. EBER2 cDNA was overall less detectable than DNA and there was no significant difference between MS/CIS and HC/OND (Fig. 7a,b). EBNA3A (latency III gene) and BZLF1 (early lytic gene) were mostly undetectable with no significant difference between the two cohorts (Fig. 7b). Strikingly, a significant increase was observed in BamHI-W transcripts in the MS/CIS cohort, including patients MS6, MS8 and M27 with highly expanded EBV-specific CD8+ T cells in CSF. This therefore suggests that EBV reactivation is enhanced in the CSF in patients with MS/CIS, which may drive the expansion of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells.

Each sample was run in duplicate and each dot represents the average result from each study participant. Data are the mean ± s.e.m. MS/CIS and HC/OND samples were compared using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test with Welch's correction; NS, not significant; n = 13 for MS/CIS for all genes except EBER2 where n = 12 due to lack of sufficient sample for MS27 and n = 5 in HC/OND for all genes except BamHI-W where n = 4 due to a lack of sufficient sample for OND4.

CD8+ T cells are the dominant lymphocyte population in MS lesions2,12, where they are highly clonally expanded4,5,8,9, suggesting reactivity to hitherto unknown local antigens. Although previous studies have explored changes in gene expression and T cell clonal expansion in the CSF of patients with MS10,11,12,26, numerous questions remain regarding the identity of clonally expanded CD8+ T cells and their antigen specificity in MS. Our comprehensive transcriptional and clonal analysis identified CSF-infiltrating T cells with increased expression of genes associated with T cell activation, the TRM phenotype and CNS migration in the MS/CIS cohort, consistent with previous reports10,11,12,27. As clonally expanded CD8+ T cells are present in the CSF in normal physiologic conditions and in CNS pathology10,17,26, identification of MS-specific CD8+ T cell clonal populations remains a challenge. Invoking a strategy used to identify disease-relevant T cells in inflammatory arthritis16,28 and cancer29, a subset of highly clonally expanded and CSF-enriched CD8+ T cells that had the highest frequencies in the patients with MS/CIS was identified. It was noteworthy that more than 70% of the highly expanded and CSF-enriched T cell clonotypes were CD8+ given that more than twice as many CD4+ T cells were analyzed. These CSF-enriched T cell clonotypes were widely characterized by a highly differentiated, antigen-experienced and cytotoxic phenotype with high CNS-trafficking potential, consistent with other reports30. These gene signatures were very similar to GZMB and TRM markers enriched in CD8+ T cells in MS lesions3,31, strongly suggesting these T cell clonotypes are CNS-infiltrating.

Small networks of highly expanded CSF-enriched T cells with shared TCR sequence features to other less-expanded clonotypes were found, which overwhelmingly occurred within the same individual. These findings suggest that distinct, clonally expanded T cells may be contributory to MS pathology, unlike other autoimmune conditions with preferential TCR usage16. Combined with the inherent technical challenges in T cell antigen discovery, these findings highlight the difficulties in identifying the antigen specificity of clonally expanded T cells in MS.

The majority of studies on candidate T cell auto-antigens in MS have focused on CD4+ T cells32,33,34. Through the use of three parallel antigen discovery strategies, our study provides substantial new insight into the antigen specificity of CD8+ T cells in MS. Novel mimotopes to several MS-derived CD8+ TCRs were identified by pMHC yeast display, a powerful unbiased antigen screening tool. Although the majority of mimotopes and naturally occurring peptide homologs were readily detectable by pMHC I tetramers, only one elicited a measurable functional response. The reason for the discrepancy between pMHC tetramer binding and functional reactivity is unclear but could be due to the absence of catch bonds by high-affinity TCR ligands35. Nonetheless, these candidate peptides provide an important framework for identifying TCRs with similar specificities in other individuals.

The methodology of testing individual TCRs in primary human T cells by pMHC tetramer screening, followed by validation with functional reactivity is highly rigorous and ensured only genuine positive results. This approach was particularly important in the case of a TCR that demonstrated an exact TCRβ match to another antigen-specific clonotype yet did not share the same specificity, highlighting the need to validate every TCRαβ individually. Antigen specificity should therefore be interpreted cautiously when based solely on partial TCR sequence matching.

Three distinct CSF-expanded and enriched CD8+ T cell clonotypes specific for EBV antigens were identified from three different patients in the MS cohort. Although EBV-specific CD8+ T cells have been previously reported in the CSF of MS and other neuro-inflammatory conditions36,37,38,39, the present study used paired TCRαβ analysis to unequivocally demonstrate EBV reactivity of highly enriched and clonally expanded CSF CD8+ T cell populations in MS. These findings are particularly relevant in light of recent evidence that EBV infection is a prerequisite for the subsequent development of MS40. Interestingly, the EBNA3A:B*08:01-specific CD8+ TCR identified in one of the patients with MS participating in this study was highly related to expanded CD8+ T cell clonotypes previously found in several patients with Alzheimer's disease17. Our findings therefore provide further support that EBV may be related to multiple forms of CNS pathology.

The mechanism by which EBV is involved in MS pathogenesis remains unresolved. The fact that the EBV-specific CD8+ T cell clonotypes identified here were highly expanded and enriched in the CSF suggests these T cells may be responding to antigen in the CNS. EBV-specific B cells and CD4+ T cells in MS have been suggested to be cross-reactive to CNS autoantigens41,42,43 (that is, molecular mimicry). We were unable to demonstrate cross-reactivity of the two EBV peptide-specific CD8+ T cell clonotypes against partially homologous self-peptides, but this does not completely rule out such a mechanism. Alternatively, the findings of CD8+ T cells reactive against EBV late latent and lytic antigens are consistent with other reports3,36,39 and could indicate EBV reactivation in the CNS44,45. In addition to the detection of EBV DNA in the CSF of most study participants, the increased expression of EBV transcripts in the MS/CIS cohort suggests that EBV reactivation drives expansion of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells. These findings are consistent with other recent results46 and suggest that EBV-specific CD8+ T cell expansion in the CSF could be a protective response to control reactivated EBV in MS.

There are multiple mechanisms by which EBV could gain access to the CNS. In addition to primary infection of cells within the CNS47, a number of studies have described the induction of ‘atypical' T-bet+CXCR3+ B cells by EBV48,49, which could enable their migration into the CNS. EBV expression is highly dynamic, permitting the virus to exist in various latency or lytic programs47. It is plausible that dysregulation of EBV expression is relevant to MS pathology. Clinical trials using adoptive T cell therapies targeting EBV in MS did not show a clear benefit in progressive MS50, however, it remains unclear how such therapies may alter EBV viral loads and expression as well as relapse and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes. It is also important to consider that EBV reactivation in MS may represent an epiphenomenon as memory B cell differentiation into plasma cells is a trigger of EBV reactivation. Thus, it is possible that EBV reactivation and expansion of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells are simply markers of B cell activation, which is ultimately the driver of MS pathology independent of EBV.

This study was limited by the smaller population of control participants. Follow-up studies with larger numbers of well-matched MS and control participants are needed to more clearly identify disease-relevant T cell populations in MS. In addition, longitudinal analyses of T cell clonal expansion in earlier versus later stages of MS are needed. Although the transcriptional phenotyping analyses suggest a pro-inflammatory cytotoxic phenotype of CSF-expanded CD8+ T cells, further in vitro and in vivo analyses are needed to determine what role these cells play in MS. It is also important to acknowledge that despite the rigor of the antigen specificity testing, this approach was not exhaustive and was limited in the breadth of antigens that were tested. Given that various foreign and self-antigens are considered viable antigenic targets in MS, future studies will need to incorporate high-throughput approaches to probe multiple target antigens simultaneously. The detection of EBV in the CSF of individuals without MS probably reflects the fact that the majority of the general population, with or without MS, is chronically infected with EBV. Given that there are only trace B cells in the CSF and CNS of healthy individuals, it is possible that cell-free EBV DNA originated in the blood. Alternatively, there are other cellular reservoirs in the CNS where EBV has been identified even in healthy individuals47.

Elucidating the role of CD8+ T cells in MS requires the assessment of their clonal repertoire in the CNS, identification of their antigenic targets and determination of their in vivo functions. This study provides important progress towards all three aims by demonstrating a small population of predominantly CD8+ T cells that were highly expanded and enriched in the CSF of patients with MS with strongly upregulated genes associated with antigen exposure, CNS migration and cytotoxicity. The finding of EBV specificity of three of these CD8+ T cell clonal populations in the presence of EBV helps to advance the understanding of MS pathogenesis and may permit the development of novel disease biomarkers and therapies.

The studies in this Article have been approved by the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Institutional Review Board research ethics committee (protocol numbers 10-02389 and 14-15278). Informed consent was obtained from all participants in this study. No compensation was provided to the study participants.

The participants, MS/CIS and control, were enrolled through the UCSF ORIGINS or Expression, Proteomics, Imaging, Clinical (EPIC) studies (https://epicstudy.ucsf.edu/). Healthy controls and patients with OND were enrolled in the biobanking study ‘Immunological Studies of Neurologic Subjects'. All enrolled participants with MS or CIS were diagnosed according to the 2017 McDonald criteria51. Basic demographic and clinical information for all research participants is shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1.

Blood and CSF samples were collected from the enrolled participants on the same day during clinical and research procedures after informed consent. CSF (20–30 ml) was collected by lumbar puncture from each individual. Blood and CSF were processed immediately after collection in preparation for single-cell library preparation as previously described15. Unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using CPT mononuclear cell preparation tubes (BD Biosciences) and resuspended in 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The CSF was centrifuged at 400g and 4 °C for 15 min, resuspended in 80 µl supernatant and counted. Single-cell sequencing libraries were prepared using 5′ scRNA-seq and 5′ T cell V(D)J scTCR-seq kits (10X Genomics).

Raw data for both scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq datasets were processed using CellRanger (v3.0.1 and v3.1.0, respectively) by 10X Genomics. The cellranger count and cellranger vdj commands were run with input Ensembl GRCh38.v93 and GRCh38.v94 references for the scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data, respectively. All data were analyzed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline that included Seurat (v3.1.2–v4.3.0), the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) algorithm52 (v2.5.1), SingleR53 (v1.1.7) and DoubletFinder54 (v2.0.2). TCR V(D)J contig assemblies outputted from CellRanger were further annotated and analyzed using Immcantation (v3.1.0). TCR clonal families were identified using Change-O55 (v0.4.6), which generated clone IDs for both TCRα and -β chain assemblies. The scRNA-seq data have been uploaded to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository under BioProject PRJNA549712 (GEO accession number GSE133028) and the scTCR-seq data have been uploaded under BioProject PRJNA1232831 (GEO accession number GSE291328).

Across both RNA-seq and VDJ data, reads present in more than one sample that shared the same cell barcode and unique molecular identifier were filtered using previously described methods15. The R package DropletUtils was used to filter out these reads in the RNA-seq data and SingleCellVDJdecontamination (https://github.com/UCSF-Wilson-Lab/SingleCellVDJdecontamination) was used to apply the same methods to filter out these reads in the VDJ data.

All gene counts from scRNA-seq data were combined using Seurat. Only genes present in two or more cells were included. Only cells containing transcripts of between 700 and 2,500 genes were included. The PercentageFeatureSet function was used to calculate the percentage of mitochondrial transcript expression for each cell. Cells that expressed at least 10% mitochondrial genes were omitted. Gene counts were normalized using the R package SCTransform56. The parameter do.correct.umi was set equal to TRUE and var.to.regess was set to nCount_RNA. All filtered cells were clustered using 20 principal components (PCs) in Seurat. Clusters were formed using a shared nearest-neighbor graph in combination with dimensional reduction using uniform manifold approximation and projection57. Doublet detection and removal were performed for each sample using DoubletFinder54 with expected doublet rates set based on the 10X Genomics reference manual. Cumulative sums were iteratively calculated for each PC to measure the per cent variance accounted for with the data. To determine a reasonable number of PCs, a threshold of 90% variance was applied, which resulted in 12 PCs being inputted when reclustering cells. Clusters of cells with a high expression of platelet markers (PPBP and PF4) or hemoglobin subunits (HBB, HBA1 and HBA2) were omitted. Among the remaining cells, all V gene transcripts (TRAV, TRBV, IGHV, IGKV and IGLV) were removed and an additional round of reclustering was performed with nine PCs.

Assembled TCR contigs outputted from CellRanger were inputted into the Immcantation pipeline for a second round of alignments to the VDJ region using IgBLAST. Contigs containing fewer than three unique molecular identifiers were omitted. Only contigs that aligned in frame (both the FUNCTIONAL and IN_FRAME output fields were TRUE) and across the constant region were retained. Cells in the TCR VDJ data were only kept if these contained one TCRβ chain and one TCRα chain. If cells had multiple chains, TCRα or -β, which passed these thresholds, the contig with the largest number of unique molecular identifiers and or reads was kept.

Cell-type annotations were generated using previously described methods15. Cell types were defined by performing differential gene expression analysis for each cluster. The normalized gene expression profile for each cluster was compared with the remaining cells using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test using the FindAllMarkers function (min.pct = 0.1, logfc.threshold = 0.25, return.thresh = 0.01). The most upregulated genes, with the highest positive average log-transformed fold change, were compared with a custom panel of canonical gene makers (Supplementary Table 21) spanning several key immune cell types—B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, classical monocytes, inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, plasmacytoid dendritic cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells. In addition to these manual cell-type annotations, another set of cell types was determined using the automated cell-type annotation tool SingleR, which used the combined Blueprint and ENCODE reference dataset for fine-tuning predictions53.

A T cell subset was created by filtering for cells that overlap both RNA-seq and TCR VDJ data. All clusters annotated as T cells had their annotations modified by CD8 gene expression. Among the T cells, any cell with CD8A or CD8B expression was annotated as a CD8+ T cell. The remaining T cells were then annotated as CD4+ T cells. Differential gene expression analyses were performed using the FindMarkers command in Seurat with the Wilcoxon test and the following parameters: P-adjusted value cutoff = 0.05 and log(fold change) cutoff = 0.

The TCR contigs outputted from Immcantation were clustered based on similarities between their TCR variable region genes (TRAV or TRBV), TCR joining region genes (TRAJ or TRBJ) and complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) amino-acid sequences. A TCR clonotype was defined as cells containing TCRα and -β chains, each containing identical V and J genes, and CDR3 amino-acid sequences. Cell counts were computed for each clone ID, including separate cell counts for PBMC and CSF samples. Shannon's entropy was calculated between CSF and PBMC samples of different disease groups using the alphaDiversity function in the R package alakazam. Specifically, the exponential of diversity scores (D) from the Shannon–Wiener index were extracted from the output of alphaDiversity by filtering for the diversity order (q = 1). Clonal expansion was defined as clones containing more than one cell. Among the expanded clonal families of TCRs, CSF enrichment of highly expanded clones was determined by the ratio of the CSF to peripheral-blood frequencies. Clones with a CSF frequency of ≥0.75% were annotated as CSF highly expanded. Clones that were expanded in CSF (that is, more than singletons), but with frequencies less than highly expanded, were labeled as moderately expanded. Among the expanded clonal families of TCRs, CSF enrichment of highly expanded clones was determined by the ratio of the CSF to peripheral-blood frequencies. CSF highly expanded TCRs were inputted into GLIPH2 to generate glyph groups, which indicated which TCRs were predicted to target the same epitope. These glyph groups were used to create a network using the R package igraph and graphically displayed using Cytoscape.

HLA sequencing was performed as previously described, adapted to include HLA class II58. For each sample, 100 ng high-quality DNA was fragmented using a Library preparation enzymatic fragmentation kit 2.0 (Twist Bioscience). After fragmentation, the DNA was repaired, and poly(A) tails were attached and ligated to Illumina-compatible dual-index adapters with unique barcodes. After ligating, the fragments were purified with a 0.8× ratio of AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). Double size selection was performed (0.42× and 0.15× ratios) and libraries of approximately 800 bp were selected, at which point libraries were amplified and purified using magnetic beads. After fluorometric quantification, each sample was pooled (30 ng per sample) via ultrasonic acoustic energy. A Twist target enrichment kit (Twist Bioscience) was then used to perform target capture on pooled samples. Sample volumes were then reduced using magnetic beads and DNA libraries were bound to 1,394 biotinylated probes. Probes were designed specifically to target all exons, introns and regulatory regions of the classical HLA loci, including HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1. Next, streptavidin magnetic beads were used to capture fragments targeted by the probes. The captured fragments were then amplified and purified. A BioAnalyzer instrument (Agilent) was then used to analyze the enriched libraries. After evaluation, the enriched libraries were sequenced using a paired-end 150-bp sequencing protocol on the NovaSeq platform (Illumina). Following sequencing, HLA genotypes were predicted using HLA Explorer (Omixon).

The TCR sequences for each α and β gene pair were codon-optimized and used to generate gene blocks (IDT) in which the TCRβ and TCRα sequences were separated by a P2A sequence. Flanking homology arms were included to permit knock-in into the human TRAC locus, as previously described59. The gene blocks were cloned into pUC19 plasmids by Gibson assembly and the sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing.

Primary human CD8+ T cells were isolated from commercially purchased leukopaks (Vitalant or Stemcell; unidentified healthy donors). PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll centrifugation and cryopreserved before each experiment. In all experiments, T cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS, 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin–streptomycin with L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, MEM vitamin solution and nonessential amino acids (all Fisher Scientific). TCR knock-in was performed as previously described59, with minor changes. Briefly, CD8+ T cells were isolated from thawed PBMCs by negative selection (Miltenyi) and rested overnight with 5 ng ml−1 human IL-7. The CD8+ T cells were stimulated 1:1 with anti-human CD3/CD28 magnetic Dyna beads (Fisher Scientific), 20 ng ml−1 human IL-2, 5 ng ml−1 human IL-7 and 5 ng ml−1 IL-15 for 48 h previous to T cell electroporation.

Guide RNAs specific for the human TRAC locus were generated by incubating CRISPR RNA (crRNA; AGAGTCTCTCAGCTGGTACA) 1:1 with trans-activating crRNA (Dharmacon) for 30 min at 37 °C to yield a final concentration of 80 µM. Polyglutamic acid (0.8× volume) was added to the guide RNA as previously described60. Cas9 (QB3; Macrolab) was added 1:1 with the guide RNA and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C to yield a 20 µM ribonucleoprotein, which was used immediately for electroporation.

Dyna beads were removed from the T cell culture using an EasySep separation magnet (StemCell) 48 h after CD8+ T cell stimulation. The T cells were then centrifuged at 200g for 9 min and resuspended in Lonza electroporation P3 buffer with supplement (20 µl per 1 × 106 T cells). The T cells (20 µl) were electroporated with 3.5 µl ribonucleoprotein and 1 µg TCR-encoding plasmid DNA (1–2 µl) using a Lonza 4D Nucleofector 96-well electroporation system and pulse code EH115 (ref. 61). CD8+ T cells were immediately rescued by the addition of 80 µl warmed T cell medium and incubation in a 37 °C incubator for 15 min. The cells were then split into fifths in 96-well round-bottomed plates; T cell medium plus 10 ng ml−1 IL-2 was added to the samples to a final volume of 200 µl. The CD8+ T cells were expanded for a minimum of 96 h before testing for pMHC tetramer binding. The T cells were re-fed with a half volume of fresh medium and IL-2 every 3–4 days.

Ultraviolet photolabile pMHC I monomers for HLA-A*01:01, HLA-A*A2:01, HLA-A*03:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-B*08:01, HLA-B*15:01, HLA-B*35:01 and HLA-B*44:02 were obtained from the NIH Tetramer Core. Custom peptide-loaded MHC I monomers were generated by ultraviolet light–ligand exchange as previously described62. HLA-A*31:01 pMHC monomers (Easymers) were purchased from ImmunAware and loaded with custom peptides according to the supplier's instructions. Tetramerization was carried out using streptavidin conjugated to the fluorophores phycoerythrin and allophycocyanin (Life Technologies). CD8+ T cells were treated with 100 nM dasatinib (StemCell) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by staining with the appropriate tetramers (2–3 µg ml−1) for 30 min at room temperature. All tetramers were used within 3–4 weeks of synthesis. The cells were washed in FACS buffer (1×DPBS without calcium or magnesium, 0.1% sodium azide, 2 mM EDTA and 1% FBS) and stained with anti-CD8 PECy7 (eBioscience; SK1), anti-TCR BV421 (BioLegend; IP26), a PerCP/Cy5.5 dump antibody mixture containing anti-CD4 (BioLegend; RPA-T4), anti-CD14 (BioLegend; HCD14), anti-CD16 (BioLegend; B73.1), anti-CD19 (BioLegend; HIB19; all antibodies at 1:100) and Aqua506 viability dye (1:1,000; Life Technologies) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed and resuspended in FACS buffer, and analyzed by flow cytometry (LSRFortessa). Only experiments where the forward versus side-scatter gate contained at least 10% lymphocytes and CD8+ T cells expressed fewer than 20% TCRs were used for analysis to ensure a large number of T cells with high TCR-knockout efficiency was achieved (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

Yeast libraries were developed as previously described19. Yeast allele libraries were thawed in SDCAA (pH 5) medium, passaged, induced in SGCAA (pH 5) and selected using biotinylated soluble TCR coupled to streptavidin-coated magnetic MACS beads (Miltenyi) as previously described63. Briefly, 2 × 109 yeast cells from all four length libraries underwent negative selection with 250 μl beads in 5 ml PBE (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 1 mM EDTA) for 1 h with rotation at 4 °C. After passage through an LS column (Miltenyi) on a magnetic stand and three washes with 3 ml PBE, the flow-through was incubated with 250 μl beads (pre-incubated with 400 nM biotinylated TCR) for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. The yeast were magnetically separated through an additional LS column, washed three times with 3 ml PBE and the elution was cultured overnight in SDCAA (pH 5) following an SDCAA wash to remove residual PBE. The yeast were induced in SGCAA (pH 5) for 2–3 days before further selection, with subsequent selections using 50 μl beads or TCR-coated beads in 500 μl PBE.

DNA was isolated from 5–10 × 107 yeast cells per selection using a Zymoprep II kit (Zymo Research). Unique barcodes and random eight-mer sequences were added to the sequencing product by PCR and amplified for 25 cycles to allow for downstream demultiplexing and improved clustering. A subsequent PCR added Illumina chip primer sequences, resulting in products containing Illumina P5-Truseq read 1-(N8)-Barcode-pHLA-(N8)-Truseq read 2-IlluminaP7. The library was purified by double-sided SPRI bead isolation (Beckman Coulter), quantified using a KAPA library amplification kit (Illumina) and deep sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument with a 2 × 150 V2 kit for low-diversity libraries.

The genes for HLA-A*31:01, HLA-A*29:02, HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-B*35:01 were codon-optimized and synthesized as gene blocks (IDT). The gene blocks were cloned into the pHR-CMV Lacz lentivirus vector by Gibson assembly and sequences were verified by Sanger sequencing. The vector was expressed in K562 cells by lentiviral transduction and selected by puromycin.

The APCs for all cytokine assays were T2 cells expressing HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*01:01 or HLA-A*03:01, or K562 cells expressing HLA*29:02, HLA-A*31:01, HLA-B*08:01 or HLA-B*35:01. The APCs were pulsed overnight with 10 µg ml−1 peptide or vehicle control in serum-free medium. CD8+ T cells (2 × 105) were stimulated with peptide-loaded APCs (1 × 105 per condition) for 6 h in the presence of 1:500 GolgiStop (BD), 1:500 GolgiPlug (BD) and 1:200 CD28/CD49d (FastImmune; BD). The cells were washed with FACS buffer and stained with the cell surface antibodies as described in the ‘pMHC tetramer screening' section (anti-CD8, anti-TCR, dump channel antibody mixture and live/dead dye). Next, the cells were washed, fixed and stained with anti-human IFN-γ Alexa 647 (BioLegend; 4S.B3) and anti-human TNF-α Alexa 488 (BioLegend; Mab11) in permeabilization buffer (BD). Finally, the cells were washed and collected on an LSRFortessa system.

Jurkat E6-1 T cells (American Type Culture Collection, TIB-152) were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with L-glutamine and 10% FBS. Endogenous TRAC and TRBC1 expression in Jurkat cells were knocked out with synthetic crRNAs designed using the Alt-R system (IDT) containing the following genomic target sequences: TRBC1, 5′-CGTAGAACTGGACTTGACAG-3′ and TRAC, 5′-CTTCAAGAGCAACAGTGCTG-3′. The crRNA was complexed with 1:1 trans-activating crRNA (IDT; 0.2 nmol each), followed by 0.1 nmol recombinant Cas9 protein (Macrolab). The ribonucleoproteins were then transduced into Jurkat T cells using a Amaxa P3 primary cell nucleofector kit (Lonza; pulse code CK116). TRAC knockout was performed first and loss of surface TCRαβ expression was confirmed by flow cytometry. TRAC-knockout cells underwent subsequent knockout of TRBC1, which had previously been shown to lead to loss of TCRαβ expression in line with overexpressed TCRα. To track TCR activation, a lentiviral vector was constructed that contained the NFAT transcriptional reporter NBV64 upstream of a minimal CMV reporter driving mCherry fluorescent marker expression, and constitutive expression of iRFP670 under a Pgk promoter provided a marker of transduction. Jurkat cells lacking endogenous TCRαβ expression were transduced with the vector and sorted for iRFP fluorescence and lack of mCherry background fluorescence. For TCRs corresponding to CD8+ T cells, an additional lentiviral vector encoding human CD8α was expressed in the Jurkat cells and the cells were sorted for uniform CD8α expression before TCR transduction. For TCR expression, lentiviral expression constructs that encode a human Pgk promoter and the coding sequence of each specific TCRα chain with the IRES-neomycin resistance gene or each TCRβ chain with the IRES-blasticidin resistance gene were generated. Lentiviral particles were packaged in HEK293T cells following standard protocols and concentrated 10× using the Lenti-X Concentrator reagent (Takara). Viral particles were added to T cells at a low multiplicity of infection and expression was ensured by passaging cells for 5 days under antibiotic selection with 10 µg ml−1 blasticidin (Gibco) and 1 mg ml−1 G418 (Teknova).

TCR-expressing Jurkat cells (1 × 105) were stimulated for 24 h with HLA-allele-transduced APCs (1 × 105) loaded with 10 µg ml−1 peptide or vehicle control. Antigen-reactive CD8+ cells were identified by coexpression of NFAT–mCherry and anti-human CD69–phycoerythrin (BioLegend; FN50).

A Pan B cell isolation kit (Miltenyi) was used to isolate B cells from frozen PBMCs. The B cells (1 × 106 cells ml−1) were incubated 1:1 with pre-warmed EBV supernatant (B95.8 strain) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by the addition of 1 μg ml−1 R848 and 100 ng ml−1 CD40L. The cells were cultured for two weeks, with medium changes as needed, and expanded into larger plates. The LCLs were cryopreserved for future use in cellular assays.

Jurkat cells expressing the TCR of interest (target TCR Jurkat cells) were co-cultured with LCLs carrying at least one matching MHC I allele (HLA-matched LCLs) at a 1:1 ratio (100,000 cells each per well) in a 96-well plate for 24 h at 37 °C. To assess specificity, negative control conditions included co-culture of (1) target TCR Jurkat cells with HLA-mismatched LCLs and (2) HLA-matched LCLs with Jurkat cells expressing an HLA-mismatched TCR. Jurkat reactivity was assessed by measurement of coexpression of NFAT–mCherry and CD69–phycoerythrin as described in the ‘TCR-expressing Jurkat cell assays' section.

Cell-free CSF supernatant was obtained after centrifugation as described earlier for single-cell sequencing and stored at −80 °C. DNA and RNA were each extracted from 400 µl CSF supernatant using a ZYMO Quick-DNA/RNA pathogen MagBead kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted DNA was eluted in 50 µl nuclease-free water. DNase I treatment was performed on the RNA-extraction samples before elution into 30 µl nuclease-free water. An EBV-transformed LCL was used as a positive control; Jurkat cells and water only were used as negative controls. The DNA concentration and purity were assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The extracted DNA and RNA were stored at −20 °C until use for PCR amplification. Complementary DNA was synthesized using a ProtoScript first strand cDNA synthesis kit (NEB) using 6 µl RNA per 20 µl reaction volume according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The following previously described65 primers (IDT) for the BZLF1 promoter were used: 5′-AGCATGCCATGCATATTTC-3′ (forward) and 5-TTGGCAAGGTGCAATGTTT-3′ (reverse). PCR reactions were performed using a Qiagen Taq PCR core kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each 30-µl reaction contained 1×PCR Buffer with MgCl2, 200 µM dNTPs, 0.2 µM forward and reverse primers, 10–100 ng template DNA, 0.75 U Qiagen Taq DNA polymerase and nuclease-free water to the final volume. Amplification was carried out in a thermal cycler (Bio-Rad thermal cycler with 96-deep-well C1000 block) using the following cycling conditions: an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 34 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. A final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min was performed, followed by a hold at 4 °C. The PCR products were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under ultraviolet light using a gel documentation system (LI-COR Odyssey M Imager). For samples showing positive amplification, the remaining PCR reaction volume was directly submitted to Molecular Cloning Laboratories for Sanger sequencing. CSF samples were considered EBV-positive if sequencing results correctly aligned to the reference sequence of the amplified target.

Primers and probes for ddPCR were synthesized as PrimeTime qPCR assays (IDT). Probes targeting EBV genes were labeled with FAM and probes for the housekeeping reference genes (RPP30 or GAPDH) were labeled with HEX (Supplementary Table 22). Oligonucleotides were used as previously published for EBER2 (ref. 66), BamHI-W67 and RPP30 (ref. 68). A volume of 1.25 μl of each 20× target primers–probe mix in Tris–EDTA was used with 2×ddPCR Supermix for probes without deoxyuridine triphosphate and 10 μl DNA. A total reaction volume of 20 μl was loaded with a 70-μl oil droplet using a QX100 droplet generator (Bio-Rad). The emulsion of approximately 40 μl was slowly transferred to ddPCR 96-well plates (Bio-Rad, 12001925) and heat-sealed with foil. Amplification was carried out in a thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Thermal Cycler with 96-Deep Well C1000 block) using the following cycling conditions: an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min; 39 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C and 1 min at 57 °C, followed by 10 min at 98 °C. Analysis of the ddPCR data was performed using the Bio-Rad QuantaSoftTM software. Data from the droplet reader are given as copies per microlitre and relative expression was calculated as the target gene:reference gene ratio. Any sample that was not detected by the housekeeping gene was repeated and the threshold was set separately according to the negative control with water. All samples were run in duplicate.

Differential gene expression comparisons between groups were performed using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Bonferroni correction. Shannon entropy results were compared using Brown–Forsythe's and Welch's analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using Dunnett T3 corrections. Comparisons of CSF-enriched clonotypes T cell (for example, CD8+ versus CD4+ T cells and MS/CIS versus HC/OND) and ddPCR results were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t-tests with Welch's correction using GraphPad Prism (v10.6.1).

Molecules that facilitate protein–protein interactions are immensely impactful. However, such compounds typically rely on accessory proteins to function, such as E3 ligases for targeted degradation, which may restrict their scope or lead to resistance. We alleviate the need for accessory proteins with a strategy that exploits protein symmetry as a selective vulnerability and is widely applicable because of the ubiquitous nature of homomeric proteins. We target homomeric proteins with PINCHs (polymerization-inducing chimeras)—bifunctional molecules composed of two linked ligands that bridge homomers and trigger their supramolecular assembly into insoluble polymers. We design PINCHs that achieve efficient polymerization of four targets. In cells, we observed that a PINCH targeting Keap1 exhibited a longer duration of action and a PINCH targeting BCL6 displayed selective lowering of B cell viability compared to their monomeric parents. Our results highlight PINCHs as a novel and general strategy to modulate and knock out protein function.

In recent years, the induction of proximity between proteins1,2,3,4,5 has become a prevalent approach in chemical biology and drug discovery6. A number of modalities use bifunctional small molecules that bind a target protein on one end and ‘hijack' a cellular effector on the other end to induce proximity between the two proteins and achieve a desired post-translational modification (PTM) on the target. Prominent examples include proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) to induce proteasomal degradation7,8, lysosome-targeting chimeras to induce lysosomal degradation9, phosphorylation-inducing chimeras to induce phosphorylation10, deubiquitinase-targeting chimeras11 to induce stabilization through deubiqitination and regulated induced proximity-targeting chimeras12 to selectively target essential proteins. Monovalent proximity inducers, also known as molecular glues, are also gaining prominence13,14.

While targeted degradation by PROTACs offers several advantages over traditional inhibition15, these approaches also have a number of drawbacks. The bifunctional molecule has to bind two different molecular targets, which requires, first and foremost, ligands for both proteins and for them to be coexpressed and colocalized in the relevant cellular compartment. In addition, some PTMs have spatial restrictions; thus, solely inducing proximity does not ensure successful modification or degradation of the target16. For example, PROTAC-induced or molecular-glue-induced degradation of the target requires a correct positioning of the different components in such a way that there is an available lysine on the surface of the protein for the E2 unit to ubiquitinate8,17. From a therapeutic perspective, resistance often stems from the recruited effector18. Despite the advances in proximity-based technologies to target proteins of interest19, a major challenge remains in expanding their use in a general way. There is a growing need for methods that can be rationally applied to a large range of proteins, minimizing the lengthy screening campaigns that are usually required for each new protein target.

Protein symmetry has long been leveraged to engineer molecular assemblies20,21,22,23. Recent work has suggested that small chemical changes at the surface of proteins can induce their polymerization, provided that the protein target naturally forms a symmetric complex or homomer24,25,26,27. The robustness of this approach suggested that proteins are naturally ‘on the verge of' oligomerization and formation of higher-order protein assemblies. Notably, monovalent small-molecule modulators of a target's oligomerization state have been mostly discovered serendipitously28, with their mode of action typically discovered separately from their functional effect. One example is trifluoroperazine, initially discovered as an inhibitor of S100A4, a member of the S100 protein family that is associated with several human diseases29. This compound was eventually revealed to inhibit S100A4's activity by stabilizing an inactive pentameric complex of it. Another example is a monomeric degrader of the BCL6 transcription repressor30, which was shown to polymerize the BTB domain of BCL6 and led to its proteasomal degradation. Recently, Diaz et al. reported a rationally designed trivalent inhibitor designed to capture three units of the lipoprotein(a) KIV domain in an inactive trimer19.

Here, we rationally design small molecules that can take advantage of the properties of homomeric proteins to efficiently perturb their function. We aimed to achieve this by linking two identical target ligands with a flexible linker. A key design principle is that the bifunctional ligand should not bind two subunits of the same homomer simultaneously, as this would form a closed, finite complex. Instead, if each ligand moiety binds a subunit of a separate homomer, it would drive the assembly of an extended polymeric structure. This process effectively sequesters the protein in a polymeric state that can inhibit its normal function (Fig. 1a). Importantly, as protein homomers are common in nature, making up 25–50% of proteomes and exhibiting a variety of functionalities31,32, such an approach is expected to have a wide scope and be generally applicable.

We term these compounds PINCHs (polymerization-inducing chimeras) and present them in this work as a new modality for protein sequestration. We apply this approach to four target proteins: the homodimers BCL6, Keap1 and NQO2 and the homotetramer LDHA. We show that PINCHs can induce polymerization in vitro and in cells and precipitate the target proteins from the soluble phase to the insoluble phase. We show that this polymerization is phenotypically different from inhibition or even degradation and can complement current approaches to perturb protein functions in cells.

To evaluate the concept of PINCH as a novel modality, we initially focused on BCL6. The protein BCL6 is a homodimeric transcriptional repressor involved in B cell regulation and its overexpression is correlated with several B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas33,34. Thus, a pharmacological modality to knock down BCL6 is therapeutically relevant and makes it an excellent model system to test the PINCH approach. Several BCL6 inhibitors and degraders have been reported in recent years35,36,37. In addition, a BCL6 PROTAC that is currently under clinical trials demonstrated efficacy in multiple preclinical models of diffuse large B cell lymphoma38. Recently, BCL6 was also recruited by a new modality of bifunctional molecules to selectively repress alternative target genes39,40. Furthermore, it was discovered that BCL6 was able to polymerize using a small-molecular glue30.

A covalent inhibitor of BCL6 that irreversibly binds a tyrosine residue in the BTB domain dimeric interface was previously reported41. We used a close analog of this ligand, w8001 (1; Fig. 1b), which showed rapid binding to recombinant BCL6 BTB domain by intact protein liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) (100% labeling at 2 μM protein and 10 μM compound; incubation time, 90 min; Extended Data Fig. 1a). To create a PINCH targeting BCL6, we synthesized compound EL221 (2; Fig. 1b) composed of two w8001 moieties linked by a PEG13 linker. Importantly, the linker had to be long enough to minimize potential steric clashes between bridged homodimers yet short enough to forbid intramolecular binding of subunits from the same homodimer.

We tested the effects of EL221 on BCL6 levels by western blot (WB) in Mino cells, as BCL6 is mostly expressed in B cells. At concentrations starting from 5 μM and after 20 h of incubation, we observed a reduction in BCL6 in the soluble fraction and an accumulation in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1c). By contrast, the reported BCL6-polymerizing agent BI-3802 (ref. 30) showed no accumulation in the insoluble fraction because of proteasomal degradation7.

To assess the downstream effect of the PINCH-induced polymerization, we monitored the expression of c-Myc (MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor), a prominent target regulated by BCL6 (ref. 42). In the presence of EL221, BCL6 moved to the insoluble phase and c-Myc protein levels were markedly downregulated, suggesting that EL221 may hinder BCL6 cellular functions (Fig. 1c). Surprisingly, although BI-3802 downregulates BCL6, it showed no such effect on c-Myc, underscoring a potential difference in the mechanism of action of these modalities. To further examine the possibility of EL221-induced c-Myc gene downregulation, we followed its mRNA levels in Mino cells after PINCH treatment. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis did not reveal a difference in c-Myc mRNA levels, implying that the reduction observed by WB does not originate in transcriptional regulation (Supplementary Fig. 1b).

Proteomic analysis of EL221-treated cells revealed many additional downregulated proteins (Supplementary Fig. 1d). We attribute this large and systemic effect to the centrality of BCL6 to B cell biology and the long incubation period (20 h).

Theoretically, using shorter linkers43,44,45 or a different linker chemistry in bifunctional molecules may affect the rigidity of the compound and its interactions with the protein, which could modulate the binding affinity. This motivated us to evaluate how changing the length of the PEG-based linker bridging the two binding moieties impacted the PINCH properties. We observed that the linker could be as short as 11 ethylene glycol units, as for EL225 (4; Fig. 1b) but not less (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). The similar potencies we observed for the longer linkers suggest that the PINCHs we examined were not stabilizing a new BCL6–BCL6 interface but rather acted as simple bridges.

To further characterize whether EL221 induces the polymerization of BCL6, we visualized its cellular distribution following treatment in HEK 293 cells expressing GFP fused to BCL6 (residues 1–275; HEK 293 cells were used for ease of transfection). As cells were treated with EL221, the GFP signal accumulated into punctate structures, indicating that BCL6 formed higher-order assemblies. As a control, cells treated with the parent monomeric ligand (w8001) showed no such puncta. Instead, we observed a faint GFP signal spread throughout the cell (Fig. 1e). Indeed, the GFP puncta were significantly overrepresented in EL221-treated cells compared to the monomeric ligand w8001 (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1f). An additional experiment comparing active PINCH EL225 (4; Fig. 1b) and inactive PINCH EL226 (28; Extended Data Fig. 1c), consisting of equivalent concentration of the electrophilic warhead, showed similar significant differences in GFP puncta formation (Supplementary Fig. 1c).

Lastly, given that c-Myc is essential for B cell viability, the marked downregulation in c-Myc levels following PINCH treatment (Fig. 1c) prompted us to evaluate their effect on cellular viability. Comparing active PINCHs EL221 and EL225 and inactive PINCHs EL226 and EL218 (26; Extended Data Fig. 1c), as well as w8001 and BI-3802, we observed that no compound affected the viability of HEK 293 cells, which lack BCL6 expression. However, in Mino and Ramos B cells, both of which express BCL6, EL221 and EL225 showed half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 5.8 μM and 5.0 μM, respectively, while neither inactive PINCHs EL226 and EL218 nor the monovalent degrader and inhibitor showed any visible effects (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 1e). These results are in line with another report showing that BI-3802 exhibits viability effects on longer timescales46.

To assess the broader applicability of the PINCH approach, we examined an additional system: the protein Keap1, a substrate adaptor for the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex Cul3–Rbx1, which has a pivotal role in regulating NFE2-like bZIP transcription factor 2 (Nrf2)47,48,49. Nrf2 serves as a master regulator of the cellular anti-oxidative response, and proper functioning of the Keap1–Nrf2 pathway is essential in various diseases characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation48,50,51. Similarly to BCL6, Keap1 contains a BTB domain that mediates its homodimerization. Bardoxolone (BDX) is a reversible covalent binder of C151 in the BTB domain of Keap1 and is known to activate the Nrf2 pathway52,53. We, therefore, designed a PINCH targeting Keap1 based on BDX, two units of which were coupled by a PEG13 linker, producing EL229 (5; Fig. 2a). We tested the effect of EL229 by WB in OCI-AML2 cells, a hematopoietic cell line with stable Keap1 expression, and showed that it reduced Keap1 in the cell's soluble fraction and induced its accumulation in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 2b).

Source data

As for BCL6, we varied the linker length and composition (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a), which revealed a pronounced structure–activity relationship (SAR). EL152 (9), based on intermediary-length PEG6, showed similar activity to EL229 (Extended Data Fig. 2a; half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 904 nM). EL133 (8), based on PEG2, was the most potent compound with EC50 = 102 nM (Fig. 2c) and led to the accumulation of Keap1 in the insoluble phase at a concentration as low as 500 nM (Fig. 2d). Moreover, this accumulation occurred in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2d). However, similar PEG-based linkers EL147 (6) and EL151 (7), based on PEG1 and PEG3, respectively, showed no activity, highlighting that the PINCH modality can be highly sensitive to linker length (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Given this apparent sensitivity, we designed several compounds based on the PEG2 design. First, EL164 (11) had sulfur atoms replacing the PEG oxygens, and showed good activity in cells, downregulating Keap1 with an EC50 value of 434 nM (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Replacing the middle ethylene glycol unit with a piperazine (EL165, 10) also retained activity in cells (EC50 = 342 nM). In another design, EL132 (12), we used a six-carbon alkyl linker and downregulated Keap1 with an EC50 of 1,024 nM. By contrast, three close analogs of these active compounds, EL163 (13) based on an 8-carbon alkyl linker (the same length as EL133), EL159 (14) with the same length as EL132 but conformationally restricted and EL174 (15), which differs from EL165 by two carbonyl groups, showed no activity (Extended Data Fig. 2a). This subtle SAR mirrors similar trends in bifunctionals such as PROTACs in which small changes in the linker can dramatically impact cellular potency, in part because of cooperative new protein–protein interactions (PPIs) induced by the bifunctional compound44,54,55.

Analyzing the crystallographic symmetry of the Keap1–BDX complex (PDB 4CXT; Supplementary Fig. 5a,b), we identified a neighboring Keap1 monomer from an adjacent unit cell positioned such that the BDX-binding sites were close. We hypothesized that EL133 might bridge this crystallographic interface. We used AlphaFold3 (ref. 56) to model this complex. With only the sequence of two Keap1 monomers and the EL133 ligand given as input and specifying the covalent attachment points, AlphaFold3 indeed predicted the structure of the crystallographic dimer bridged by EL133 (Supplementary Fig. 5c). This suggests a binding mode through which EL133 could stabilize a low-energy, nonnative interface for Keap1 and, therefore, bind cooperatively.

To evaluate the selectivity of EL133, we performed quantitative proteomics. When we lysed cells using RIPA buffer and focused solely on the soluble fraction, Keap1 was significantly downregulated in the treated sample relative to the control (Fig. 2e). Moreover, only a few other proteins were downregulated (Supplementary Data 1), demonstrating selectivity of EL133 for Keap1. To explore the possibility of coprecipitation of the target's binding partners into the PINCH-induced aggregate, we extracted a list of 63 known PPI partners of Keap1 from UniProt (IntActDatabase57; Supplementary Data 1) and analyzed their levels in the proteomics experiment. This revealed only one Keap1-interacting protein (COL1A1) detected as significantly downregulated in the soluble fraction, which suggests that, if interaction partners are ‘pulled' into the aggregates, it is not a common phenomenon.

Keap1 is also a substrate adaptor protein to a Cullin–RING E3 ligase complex and was shown to induce degradation of targets to which it is recruited58,59,60,61. Thus, the Keap1 downregulation we observed may result from its self-degradation in a homo-PROTAC manner. Such self-targeting was previously observed for other E3 ligases62,63,64. To test this possibility, we initially treated cells either with MLN-4924 (a NEDDylation inhibitor) or with bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor), followed by EL133. Inhibiting either of these targets did not rescue Keap1 downregulation by EL133 (Extended Data Fig. 2c), implying that EL133 downregulates Keap1 in a proteasome-independent manner.

We visualized the subcellular localization of endogenous Keap1 following PINCH treatment by immunofluorescence in U2OS cells, which are particularly amenable to microscopy. Similarly to BCL6, we observed bright punctate structures in the EL133-treated cells and not in those treated with the parent ligand BDX (P < 0.0001; Fig. 3a,b) or with an inactive PINCH EL151 (P < 0.0001; Supplementary Fig. 2b,c). To rule out the recently reported65 aggregation because of electrophilic stress, we also performed a colocalization experiment with RAS GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1, showing that EL133 does not induce the formation of its characteristic stress granules (Supplementary Fig. 4).

To follow the cellular localization of the PINCH molecules themselves, we produced a BODIPY-conjugated PINCH EL256 (16; Fig. 3c). Its design was based on the long linker of EL229 to minimize interference of the fluorophore with polymerization. A WB analysis of EL256-treated cells confirmed that it retained such ability (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Immunostaining EL256-treated U2OS cells revealed that endogenous Keap1 puncta were colocalized with the BODIPY signal (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 9), implying incorporation of the PINCH into the Keap1 assemblies and further supporting our proposed mechanism of action for this modality. Taken together, these data indicate that the PINCH downregulates Keap1 by triggering its polymerization into nonsoluble, supramolecular assemblies.

The colocalization also suggests that we may follow the compound's fluorescence signal as a proxy for the formation of Keap1 polymers in cells. We used live fluorescence imaging of U2OS cells and EL256 to follow the protein's higher-order assembly formation in real time. This revealed an initial slow uptake of the compound by the cells, followed by puncta formation at 4.5 h after treatment (Fig. 3d). Over the course of several additional hours we observed the formation and expansion of additional puncta (Supplementary Videos 1–3).

We observed that PINCHs could drive a target protein into forming large macromolecular assemblies, reducing its levels in the soluble fraction and potentially inhibiting its function. This unique mechanism of action prompted us to explore whether it is linked to distinct pharmacodynamic properties, particularly in relation to the duration of action. Keap1 is a negative regulator of Nrf2. We confirmed Nrf2 upregulation by WB, showing a similar effect of BDX and EL133 on its levels (Supplementary Fig. 2e). NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) is a well-established downstream target of Nrf2 (refs. 66,67) and is, therefore, expected to be upregulated when Keap1 activity decreases. NQO1 was significantly upregulated in the soluble proteomics experiment (Extended Data Fig. 2b). We measured NQO1 gene expression levels over a 72-h time course by qPCR after subjecting cells to DMSO, BDX or EL133 for 20 h, followed by washout. At the time of washout, both the BDX-treated and the EL133-treated cells showed a similar ~15-fold increase in the expression level of NQO1. However, 48 h after treatment, NQO1's expression in the BDX-treated cells returned closer to its original level, whereas it remained higher in the EL133-treated cells (48 h, P = 0.0069; 54 h, P = 0.0007; 72 h, P = 0.0370; Fig. 3e). This result suggests a long-lasting effect of the PINCH and differentiates this modality from traditional inhibition of the target. We performed the same comparison with omaveloxolone (OMVX), a derivative of BDX that recently received US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of Friedrich's ataxia68, in which it had similar effects on NQO1 gene expression to BDX (Supplementary Fig. 2d). This observation highlights a potential advantage of the PINCH modality relative to other inhibition modes, whereby the duration of action is typically limited by clearance of the compound or half-life of the protein.

Experiments in cells involve a complex milieu that may affect the PINCH activity. To characterize the mechanism of action of PINCHs independently of potential confounding variables, we evaluated the Keap1–PINCH interaction in vitro with a purified recombinant BTB domain.

We used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to follow the polymerization of Keap1 BTB domain in the presence of EL133. After about 4 h, we observed large molecular species forming that did not appear in samples containing only Keap1, EL133 or BDX (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 7b). As BDX is a reversible covalent binder of Keap1, we hypothesized that EL133-induced polymer formation should be reversible as well, such that the addition of monomeric BDX could dissolve the large assemblies. Indeed, adding two equivalents of BDX led to the disassembly of Keap1 polymers (Fig. 4a). Surprisingly, this phenotype did not reproduce in the cellular environment; when treating cells with EL133 for 20 h and then adding a large excess of BDX, no change in Keap1 levels in the soluble phase occurred, as seen by WB (Fig. 4b).

We tested additional BDX-based PINCHs with recombinant Keap1 in the same manner and observed the formation of large species over time with EL165 and EL132 but not with EL151 and EL159 (Fig. 4c), mirroring these compounds' activities in cells (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 7c). In addition, preincubating Keap1 with BDX before adding EL133 prevented the formation of large Keap1 structures, showing that these are dependent on the BDX-binding site (Supplementary Fig. 7a).

As a complementary approach to follow in vitro polymerization of recombinant Keap1, we used glutaraldehyde (GA) as a crosslinking agent to capture the higher-order state of EL133-induced Keap1. BDX's reversible covalent bond is lost during sample preparation for SDS–PAGE gel; however, GA forms multiple covalent ‘bridges' between protein units along the polymer, allowing us to follow the formation of multimeric states of Keap1, induced by EL133. As expected, Keap1 samples treated with active PINCH EL133 induced the formation of higher-order assemblies (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Reversal of polymer formation through the addition of excess BDX and rescue of polymerization through preincubation with BDX were also reproduced in this setting. This approach allowed us to further clarify a potential ‘hook' effect69,70 of PINCHs, which was not apparent in a cellular setting, potentially because of solubility issues. Both EL133 and EL229 (Extended Data Fig. 3e) exhibit peak polymerization activity around a 1:1 ratio of protein-binding sites to compound-binding moieties, with little to no effect when the compound concentration was tenfold lower or higher than that of the protein.

As BDX and our Keap1 PINCHs covalently engage with C151 in Keap1 (ref. 53), we produced a Keap1 BTB construct with a C151S substitution to follow the dependence of EL133 on covalent binding. DLS experiments revealed that EL133 is able to form large species in solution with the wild-type (WT) protein but not with the mutant (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Similarly when using GA crosslinking, we observed by gel a ‘smear' of high-molecular-weight species when EL133 was incubated with WT Keap1 but not with the C151S mutant (Supplementary Fig. 6b).

To gain additional insight into the supramolecular structure of Keap1 in the presence of EL133, we applied negative-stain electron microscopy. This revealed filaments after incubation with EL133 but not after BDX treatment (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In addition, letting Keap1–EL133 polymers form and then adding an excess of BDX to the sample resulted in the disappearance of these filaments (Supplementary Fig. 8b), recapitulating the DLS results.

As both Keap1 and BCL6 dimerize through a BTB domain, we also synthesized and similarly evaluated PINCHs for two additional homomeric proteins. Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) forms a homotetrameric structure. We functionalized its inhibitor developed by Ward et al.71 to synthesize an LDHA-targeting PINCH OS-47B (17; Fig. 4e). DLS measurements of recombinant LDHA incubated with the PINCH revealed the formation of larger species over time (Fig. 4f). A molar ratio of 1:1 in binding moieties to binding sites resulted in the most effective polymerization in vitro, consistent with expectations. Nonetheless, polymerization was also observed with a twofold excess in favor of either the binding site or the binding moiety. It also persisted with larger stoichiometric differences with an excess of binding moieties (up to eightfold), progressively leading to smaller assemblies, presumably because of saturation of LDHA-binding sites (Supplementary Fig. 7d). Conversely, subconcentrations of PINCH (down to 1:8 binding moieties to binding sites) also led to smaller assemblies, as expected from a lower concentration of ‘crosslinks'. Immunostaining U2OS cells following OS-47B treatment revealed no effect on LDHA localization (Supplementary Fig. 7i).

NQO2 is a homodimeric protein with a role in cellular protection against oxidative stress and has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, making it an age-related metabolic risk factor72,73. We used YB-537, a reported inhibitor of NQO2 (ref. 74), to design a set of PINCHs based on PEG linkers of different lengths (Fig. 4g). Contrary to the case of BCL6, where only longer linker lengths allowed polymer formation, here, PEG10-bearing EL241 (21) showed little to no effect in polymerizing NQO2 (Supplementary Fig. 7f). On the other hand, compounds EL244 (18), EL245 (19) and EL246 (20), comprising PEG1, PEG2 and PEG3 linkers, respectively, all showed the ability to form larger species in solution when incubated with NQO2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4h,i and Supplementary Fig. 7f). In the case of EL244 and EL245, we observed that even a submolar ratio of PINCH was sufficient to induce polymerization. Additionally, even though we would expect binding-site saturation at high PINCH concentration, we observed polymer formation with up to fourfold excess compound. To try and understand the polymerization dependence on the linker length, we followed all NQO2 PINCHs and the parent amine inhibitor using an enzymatic activity assay (Supplementary Fig. 7h). All compounds showed similar IC50 values, suggesting that they are able to monomerically bind NQO2 (as an inhibitor); however, polymerization apparently has additional requirements that were fulfilled only by the short-linker compounds in this set. Using WB to test NQO2 PINCHs active in vitro in U2OS cells at several concentrations revealed no effect on soluble protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 7g), perhaps because of permeability issues.

A question that remains open is what happens to the PINCH-induced polymers that form and precipitate in the cells and how does the cell clear these formations, if at all. To explore this, we treated OCI-AML2 and U2OS cells with EL133 or EL256 for 20 h to induce Keap1 polymerization, followed by washing the cells and probing them over several time points (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Interestingly, these two cell lines exhibited profoundly different behavior in the presence of insoluble Keap1. Following OCI-AML2 cell treatment with 500 nM EL133 or 2.5 µM EL256, Keap1 was absent from the cell's soluble phase and remained accumulated in the insoluble phase for up to the 96 h that we tested (Extended Data Fig. 3a). However, in U2OS cells, Keap1 insoluble accumulation appeared at the initial time point (after 20 h of compound treatment) but did not appear in the following ones (Extended Data Fig. 3b). In both cell lines, soluble Keap1 remained absent from the cell throughout the experiment.

To visualize the fate of the Keap1–PINCH polymers, we treated U2OS cells with EL256 for 20 h, then washed the cells and performed immunostaining imaging after 24, 48 and 72 h. We observed puncta formation when imaging cells after treating them for 20 h (Fig. 3c,d); however, after washing the EL256 away, the cells lost most of the puncta within 24 h, corroborating the WB data. Furthermore, 48 and 72 h after wash, minimal BODIPY and Keap1 puncta signals remained and the endogenous Keap1 signal was diffused in the cell (Supplementary Fig. 10).

An additional difference between cell types in PINCH tolerance was reflected in the viability experiments. Comparing IC50 values of EL133 and BDX through viability measurements, we expected a twofold difference in their respective cellular effects, considering that every PINCH contains two BDX copies. We observed that OCI-AML2 cells were more sensitive to EL133 compared to U2OS (Extended Data Fig. 3c), with fourfold and threefold differences over BDX, respectively, possibly reflecting their difference in ability to clear the polymers. On the contrary, in the case of Mino, Ramos and HEK 293 cells, no additional viability loss was observed when comparing BDX and EL133 (Supplementary Fig. 2f). As recently observed, large polymers of folded proteins do not appear generally toxic; thus, we anticipate that sensitivity to the molecule is dependent on the functional effects of the PINCH rather than presence of the polymer75,76,77.

In certain scenarios, the simultaneous elimination of more than one target is of therapeutic or biological interest. Accordingly, we propose that two homomeric targets could be induced to coprecipitate by a single PINCH. To illustrate this concept, we synthesized a PINCH consisting of BDX and w8001 on either end (Fig. 5a) to bind Keap1 and BCL6 dimers, respectively. Theoretically, this molecule should induce the formation of a polymer consisting of Keap1 and BCL6 dimers in an alternating fashion.

We tested the effect of hetero-PINCH EL230 (22) in Mino cells that express high levels of BCL6 and we observed a reduction in both Keap1 and BCL6 levels in the soluble phase, as well as their corresponding accumulation in the insoluble phase, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5a). To test the dependence of hetero-PINCH activity on the presence of both target proteins, we tested EL230 in two additional cell lines, OCI-AML2 and HEK 293, as the latter does not express BCL6. In OCI-AML2 cells, Keap1 and BCL6 were downregulated simultaneously, whereas Keap1 remained unchanged in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 5b). In addition, monomeric versions of the compounds, consisting of one ligand attached to a linker (compounds 23 and 24) did not induce such effects on either target in Mino cells (Fig. 5c).

We introduce a novel pharmacological modality for inactivating protein targets through a mechanism that relies on their induced sequestration by polymerization. We applied this approach against two homodimeric proteins in cells and against two additional homomeric proteins in vitro.

This modality is reminiscent of PROTACs, which also involve bifunctional ligands and induce the degradation of a protein target. However, PROTACs require binding to a specific E3 ligase, thereby necessitating its coexpression and colocalization with the target protein of interest. By contrast, PINCHs do not require such additional machinery beyond the target itself. Additionally, while PROTACs require a precise interaction geometry to promote ubiquitination, the PINCH modality, in principle, does not require a highly specific interaction geometry to promote high-order assembly and sequestration. This relaxed requirement can be exploited to scout initial activity using long linkers (Figs. 1b and 2b), whereas optimization of the linker length and chemical nature for maximal potency can be performed later (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2a).

While PINCHs are associated with relaxed constraints in terms of the subunit recognition geometry, they do require the bifunctional ligand to (1) act as a bridge between two oligomers and (2) minimize the formation of finite oligomers such as a dimer of dimers (Supplementary Fig. 11) or more generally closed rings. Taking into account the homo-oligomer structure can help in target selection and ligand design for both considerations. Additionally, we anticipate that homo-oligomers with dihedral symmetry will be less susceptible to form closed geometries20,26,78,79. As an example, a recent dimeric binder of Keap1 was reported to inhibit it in cells, without sequestration from the soluble fraction80. On top of these geometric constraints, concentration is an important property to consider, whereby a ligand concentration that is too low or too high would inhibit high-order assembly through the hook effect69,70. Additionally, although we show examples for noncovalent (LDHA and NQO2), reversible covalent (Keap1) and irreversible covalent (BCL6) PINCHs, the role of covalency in promoting efficient polymerization and its interplay with ligand–target stoichiometry and kinetics remain to be fully characterized, as achieved for other covalent proximity inducing modalities81,82,83.

Phenotypically, the PINCHs tested in cells exhibited different functional outcomes compared to their monomeric parent inhibitors. BCL6 PINCHs showed complete elimination of c-Myc, which was not seen with the parent monomeric inhibitor or degrader (Fig. 1c). Similarly, at 72 h, only the active PINCHs induced a viability effect (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 1e) without an apparent effect on cells not expressing the target and in contrast to reported BCL6 degrader BI-3802, which showed no viability effect on either cell type on this time scale. Additionally, Keap1 PINCHs showed a significantly longer duration of action when compared to the monomeric BDX and second-generation inhibitor OMVX (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 2d), perhaps because of the persistence of the aggregate following compound washout. While the precise mechanisms underlying these differences warrant further investigation, these results clearly demonstrate that PINCHs can complement other pharmacological modalities.

The scope of this technology might seem limited by the requirement for symmetrical oligomeric targets. However, our recent analysis84 suggested that 20% of the human proteome fulfills this requirement as homo-oligomers. Moreover, an additional 30% of the proteome participates in symmetric hetero-oligomers that can be targeted by PINCHs in principle. The requirement for symmetry also adds a dimension of selectivity for PINCHs. While the monomeric ligand recruiter might not be very selective (for example, BDX), only a fraction of its off-targets would also fulfill the symmetry and geometry requirements for polymerization. This may be reflected in the relatively few off-targets downregulated by EL133 (Fig. 2e). We should also note that the technology can in theory also be applied to nonsymmetric systems. One could achieve polymerization of heteromeric complexes with hetero-PINCHs harboring different ligands on either end, targeting the two binding partners. In principle, a monomeric protein could also be targeted through two different binding sites, for example, using imatinib85 and asciminib86 to polymerize ABL kinase.

To conclude, we present here a novel modality for eliminating a target protein from the cellular soluble phase by inducing its polymerization. This approach can target a large fraction of the human proteome and complement existing modalities. Its simple design principles should facilitate its adoption and application against a variety of new targets, expanding our pharmacological toolbox along with the space of targetable proteins.

Cells were incubated with DMSO at 0.1% or with compound in concentrations ranging 10–20,000 nM for 20 h unless indicated differently. Following incubation, lysis was performed in RIPA buffer and the samples were measured for total protein quantification by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225). Then, 20–40 μg of each sample was loaded and run on an SDS–PAGE gel, before transferring onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a Trans-Blot Turbo system (Bio-Rad) and blocking using a 5% BSA in TBS-T (w/v) solution for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with primary antibodies (mouse anti-BCL-6 (sc-7388, Santa Cruz, 1:500; overnight at 4 °C), mouse anti-Keap1 (sc-365626, Santa Cruz, 1:500; overnight at 4 °C), rabbit anti-LDHA (4H18L6, Thermo Fisher, 1:1,000; overnight at 4 °C), mouse anti-NQO2 (sc-271665, Santa Cruz, 1:500; overnight at 4 °C), rabbit anti-c-Myc (5605, Cell Signaling, 1:1,000; overnight at 4 °C) and mouse anti-β-actin (3700, Cell Signaling, 1:1,000; 1 h at room temperature) was performed and then the membranes were washed and incubated with a horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (mouse 7076/rabbit 7074, Cell Signaling) at room temperature for 1 h. Imaging of the chemiluminescence signal was performed using a ChemiDoc XRS+ instrument (Bio-Rad). Primary band quantifications were normalized against β-actin bands.

HEK 293 cells were cultured in antibiotic-free medium. At cell confluency of ~70%, transfection was performed using 0.5 μg of plasmid (produced from a bacteria agar stab obtained from Addgene, 169932) per well, to be incubated overnight. The medium was then replaced and compound treatments were introduced as described in the respective experiments.

Cells were incubated with DMSO at 0.1% or with compound for 20 h unless indicated differently, in quadruplicate. Following incubation, the cells were lysed in either a 5% SDS and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution or in a mixed detergent buffer (cells were lysed using detergent based buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% NP-40, 1% Tween-20, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and 1% (w/v) glycerol) and probe-sonicated for the shearing of DNA. Samples were then reduced using DTT, followed by reaction with iodoacetamide. The labeled proteins were then precipitated on a dispersion of glass beads, followed by overnight trypsin digestion and purification of peptides. Samples were analyzed using an EASY-nLC 1200 nano-flow ultrahigh-performance LC system, equipped with a PepMap RSLC C18 column (particle size: 2 µm, pore size: 100 Å, diameter: 75 µm, length: 50 cm), mounted using an EASY-Spray source onto an Exploris 240 MS instrument. LC–MS-grade solvents were used for all chromatographic steps at 300 nl min−1. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (H2O + 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (80% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid). Peptides were eluted from the column into the MS instrument using the following gradient: 1–40% B in 160 min, 40–100% B in 5 min, maintained at 100% for 20 min, 100–1% in 10 min and finally 1% for 5 min. Ionization was achieved using a 2,100-V spray voltage with an ion transfer tube temperature of 275 °C. Initially, data were acquired in data-independent acquisition mode. MS1 resolution was set to 60,000 (at 200 m/z), a mass range of 370–1,450 m/z, normalized automatic gain control of 300% and maximum injection of 20 ms. MS2 resolution was set to 30,000, with 31 isolation windows of 19 Da with a 1-Da overlap, maximum injection time of 50 ms and higher-energy collision-induced dissociation collision energy at 27%. Four samples were analyzed per condition.

Data analysis was performed using Fragpipe87,88 (version 22.0) using the MSFragger search engine (version 4.1), and DIANN 1.9. Analysis was performed using a human proteome database from December 2022 (UniProt) with contaminants added, including streptavidin added manually as a contaminant. MSFragger analysis was performed using trypsin as the enzyme that cuts after arginine and lysine, with up to two missed cleavages, peptide length of 7–50 and the N-terminal methionine removed. N-terminal acetylation and methionine oxidation were defined as variable modifications and carbamidomethyl was defined as a fixed modification. A false discovery rate of 0.01 was used at both the peptide level and the protein level. Label-free quantification was performed using DIANN. After analysis, the quantified protein file was analyzed using Perseus89. Intensities were converted to log2 values, the quadruplicates of each type were grouped and missing values were replaced by 13. Differences and P values were calculated using a double-sided Student's t-test. P values were adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg method90. The MS proteomics data were deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium through the PRIDE91 partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD067656 for Supplementary Data 1.

OCI-AML2 cells were a gift by M. Minden, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University Health Network. All other cell lines were obtained from commercial resources: Mino, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; CRL-3000); Ramos, ATCC (CRL-1596); HEK 293, ATCC (CRL-1573); U2OS, ATCC (HTB-96).

The Keap1 BTB domain (48–180) encoding the single substitution S172A was cloned into pET28-bdSumo vector generating His–bdSumo–Keap1-S172A. A 7.5-L culture of BL21(DE3) was induced with 200 µM IPTG and grown at 18 °C overnight. The cells were harvested and lysed by a cooled cell disrupter (Constant Systems) in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM imidazole and 10% glycerol) containing 0.2 mg ml−1 lysozyme, 20 µg ml−1 DNase, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail. After clarification by centrifugation (38,000g for 30 min), the lysate was incubated with 5 ml of Ni beads (Adar Biotech, prewashed with lysis buffer) for 1 h at 4 °C. After removing the supernatant by centrifugation, the beads were washed three times with 50 ml of lysis buffer and once with lysis buffer containing 50 mM imidazole (1 mM TCEP replacing the DTT). Keap1 eluted from the beads following incubation of the beads with 20 ml of cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol and bdSumo protease) for 2 h at room temperature. The supernatant containing the cleaved Keap1 was concentrated and applied to a size-exclusion column (HiLoad_16/60_Superdex200, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 1 mM TCEP. Fractions containing pure Keap1 were pooled, concentrated and frozen (−80 °C) in aliquots.

The Keap1 BTB domain (48–180) encoding the double substitution C151S;S172A was cloned into a pET28-Sumo vector generating His–bdSumo–Keap1-C151S;S172A. A 4-L culture of BL21(DE3) was induced with 400 µM IPTG and grown at 16 °C overnight. The cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl and 25 mM imidazole) containing 0.1 mg ml−1 lysozyme and protease inhibitor cocktail. After clarification by centrifugation, the lysate was filtered and loaded on a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (Cytiva). The column was washed with 25 ml of lysis buffer and 25 ml of lysis buffer + 10% lysis buffer that had a higher concentration of imidazole (300 mM). The protein was eluted using lysis buffer + 300 mM imidazole and digested with Ulp1 (1:100 molar ratio) overnight at 4 °C while dialyzing against the lysis buffer. The dialyzed sample was passed through the HisTrap HP column again to remove cleaved His–SUMO and His–Ulp1, concentrated and injected into a Hiload Superdex 75 column equilibrated with 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 0.5 M NaCl. Fractions containing pure Keap1-C151S;S172SA were pooled and frozen (−80 °C) in aliquots.

The BCL6 BTB domain (5–129) was cloned into the pET28-bdSumo vector generating His–bdSumo–BCL6 BTB. The cell culture, lysis and capture on Ni beads were all performed as described for Keap1 BTB with the exception that PBS was used as the buffer for lysis and Ni capture. Cleaved BCL6 eluted from the beads following incubation of the beads with 20 ml of cleavage buffer (PBS supplemented with bdSumo protease) for 2 h at room temperature. The supernatant containing the cleaved BCL6 was pooled and diluted threefold with 50 mM Tris pH 8 and loaded onto a Tricorn Q 10/100 GL anion-exchange column. Pure BCL6 eluted at 250 mM NaCl when a linear gradient to 1 M NaCl was applied. The pooled pure protein was supplemented with 5 mM DTT and flash-frozen (−80 °C) in aliquots.

The gene encoding full-length WT human LDHA was cloned into pET28 with an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site and was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Overnight precultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking and used to inoculate 5 L of LB medium. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6, followed by induction with 200 µM IPTG and further incubation for 4 h at 37 °C with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM KCl and 20 mM imidazole) supplemented with 0.2 mg ml−1 lysozyme, 20 µg ml−1 DNase I, 1 mM MgCl2 and protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem set 3). Lysis was performed using a cooled Constant Systems cell disrupter and the soluble fraction was clarified by centrifugation. Purification was carried out by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using a HisTrap HP 5-ml column (Cytiva) on an ÄKTA fast protein LC (FPLC) system (Cytiva). After extensive washing with lysis buffer, LDHA was eluted with lysis buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. Pooled fractions containing LDHA were concentrated and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl. The peak fractions were analyzed by SDS–PAGE, aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

The gene encoding NQO2 was cloned into pET28 with an N-terminal MGSSHHHHHHSAG segment and was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Overnight precultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking and used to inoculate 5 L of LB medium. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6, followed by induction with 200 µM IPTG and further incubation overnight at 15 °C with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 300 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol) supplemented with 0.2 mg ml−1 lysozyme, 20 µg ml−1 DNase I, 1 mM MgCl2 and protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem set 3). Lysis was performed using a cooled Constant Systems cell disrupter and the soluble fraction was clarified by centrifugation. Purification was carried out by IMAC using a HisTrap HP 5-ml column (Cytiva) on an ÄKTA FPLC system (Cytiva). After extensive washing with lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole, NQO2 was eluted with lysis buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. Pooled fractions containing NQO2 were concentrated and subjected to SEC on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol. The peak fractions were analyzed by SDS–PAGE, aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

DLS samples were prepared in the respective protein's elution buffer, to which 0.01% Tween was added, along with the compound from a DMSO stock to obtain a final DMSO concentration of 2%. Samples were prepared at room temperature and measured at a constant temperature of 25 °C. All samples were passed through 0.1-μm filters and then placed in a clear-bottom black 384-well plate. DLS data were recorded using a DynaproPlate Reader III (Wyatt Technology). Data were processed with the supplied DYNAMICS software.

Cells were treated with either DMSO or compound at 250 nM, followed by washing out the treated medium after 20 h and reseeding in fresh medium. Cells were then collected at several time points post washout. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, 74104). RNA concentration and purity were determined by Nanodrop and 500–1,000 ng of RNA per sample was used for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, 4368814). qPCR (10-µl reaction in a 96-well plate format) was performed with Fast-SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems, 4385612), using 1–5 ng of cDNA and the following primers (ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies): NQO1 forward, CCGTGGATCCCTTGCAGAGA; NQO1 reverse, AGGACCCTTCCGGAGTAAGA; GAPDH forward, ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGA; GAPDH reverse, CTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGT. PCR amplification was carried out in Step-One Plus thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantification was performed using standard curves. GAPDH was used for normalization.

Cells were treated for 20 h with the indicated concentrations. RNA concentration and purity were determined by Nanodrop and 1,000 ng of RNA per sample was used for cDNA synthesis using high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, 4368814). qPCR (10-μl reaction in a 96-well plate format) was performed with Fast-SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems, 4385612), using 1 ng of cDNA and the following primers (ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies): MYC forward, GGCTCCTGGCAAAAGGTCA; MYC reverse, CTGCGTAGTTGTGCTGATGT; GAPDH forward, ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGA; GAPDH reverse, CTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGT. PCR amplification was carried out in Quant-Studio 5 (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantification was performed using standard curves. GAPDH was used for normalization.

Cells were seeded in a transparent-bottom, black 96-well plate, at 15,000 cells per well in sixfold replications. in 90 µl of medium and left to adhere for at least 4 h. The cells were then treated with the respective compound by adding 10 µl of medium–-compound mixture for a final volume of 100 µl in each well. Cell-Titer blue reagent was used to measure viability according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plate reader measurements were performed on a Tecan Spark Control 10 M fluorescence system.

For spinning disk confocal microscopy, cells were allowed to adhere to a 14-mm glass-bottom plate (MatTek P35G-1.5-14-C), followed by fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde for 5 min and permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were then blocked with 5% BSA for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with primary antibody, at a concentration of 1:100, for 3 h at room temperature and were then subjected to a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor, at a concentration of 1:100–500, for 1 h at room temperature. Lastly, cells were also stained with DAPI for 10 min at room temperature.

Imaging of the cells was performed using a Dragonfly spinning disk confocal system (Andor Technology) connected to an inverted Leica Dmi8 microscope (Leica Microsystems). The signals were detected using a scientific complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor Zyla (Andor) 2,048 × 2,048 camera and the bit depth was 16. At the specified intervals, Z stacks (0.17 µm) of selected cells were acquired with an HC PL APO ×63/1.3 GLYC CORR CS2 objective (506353, Leica Microsystems).

Total aggregate volume was calculated per cell using Imaris software (version 10.2). Automatic aggregate segmentation was conducted using the surface module with manual threshold fixed for all images of the same experiment (default 2-pixel smoothing, background subtraction with 0.9-μm largest sphere, morphological split with 0.5-μm seed point diameter). Analysis was conducted per cell by manually selecting regions covering the individual cell and not overlapping with neighboring cells.

To assess endogenous Keap1 puncta colocalization with BODIPY puncta, we segmented each type of aggregates as sphere of variable size with an estimated diameter of 1 μm in the xy plane and 2 μm along the z axis, using the Spots module of Imaris (version 10.2), and performed spot-based colocalization. Spots were considered colocalized if their centers were up to 1 μm apart. We manually segmented each cell in 3D using the Surface module and quantified the number percentage and the total puncta volume percentage of colocalized spots for each cell.

U2OS cells were seeded on a 35-mm WiLLCo-dish (WillCo Wells, HBST-3522) and incubated in growing conditions overnight. Before imaging, the cells were stained with LysoTracker red DND-99 (1:1,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, L7528) for 30 min in growing conditions. Compound EL256 was added, followed by the start of imaging. Live-cell imaging was performed using a Lattice Lightsheet 7 microscope (Carl Zeiss) under controlled conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2). LysoTracker and EL256 signals were simultaneously captured in two channels with a dual-camera setup, using bandpass filters of 505–545 nm and 575–618 nm. Excitation was achieved with a combination of 488-nm and 561-nm lasers, using a Sinc3 15 × 650 light sheet. Imaging volumes were acquired with 1,001 slices at a 0.2-µm step size and a pixel size of 0.145 µm. Time-lapse recordings were taken at 30-min intervals over 24 h. Data processing, including deskewing, cropping and orthogonal projection, was performed in ZEN Blue 3.10 software, while final visualization and video export were completed using Imaris 10.2 (Bitplane). The LysoTracker signal was used as a reference for cell location and focus during imaging and analysis and its signal was not reported in this work.

Recombinant Keap1 samples were incubated at room temperature in desired conditions in a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl pH 8, 1 mM TCEP and 0.01% Tween. At the selected time point, each sample was treated with a 7.5% aqueous solution of GA (prepared fresh) for a final GA concentration of 0.125% and mixed gently. The crosslinking reaction was left at room temperature for 40 min, followed by addition of NuPage gel sample buffer with 20 mM DTT and boiling at 95 °C for 5 min. Lastly, 2–3 μg of each sample was loaded and run on an SDS–PAGE gel. Bands were visualized using a Coomassie blue solution.

Assay ready plates were prepared by acoustically dispensing stock solutions of the test compounds, in a dose–response series (nine-point assay, threefold dilution, with 10 µM as the upper limit, in triplicate), into a black, low-volume 384-well plate (Greiner Bio-One) using an Echo 555 (Labcyte). The enzymatic activity of QR2 was measured as previously described74. Briefly, 7.5 µl of menadione alone (200 µM) or a mixture of menadione and QR2 (200 µM of menadione and 10 nM of QR2) was dispensed into the assay-ready plates, using a Multidrop Combi reagent dispenser (Thermo Fisher) and allowed to incubate with the compounds for 10 min. Dihydrobenzylnicotinamide (200 µM) was then added (7.5 µl) to the reaction and the fluorescence intensity (excitation, 360 nm; emission, 470 nm) was measured after 10 min of incubation in a PHERAstar FS multimode plate reader (BMG Labtech).

Recombinant Keap1 BTB was incubated at a concentration of 50 µM with compound at indicated times, in a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and 0.01% Tween, at room temperature. Then, samples were diluted tenfold and applied to glow-discharged carbon/formvar-coated grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences), stained with 2% uranyl acetate and imaged using a Tecnai T12 transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV and equipped with a TemCam-XF416 camera (TVIPS).

We used AlphaFold3 to predict the structure of two Keap1 monomers in the presence of EL133. The input to AlphaFold3 included the amino acid sequence of Keap1 (explicitly specifying that the predicted complex should contain two monomers), a pregenerated 3D conformer of the reacted form of EL133 with ideal geometry and specification of the four atoms involved in covalent attachment (two PINCH atoms each form a bond with C151 of a different Keap1 monomer). A single seed was used, yielding five diffusion models. We present the top model according to the AlphaFold3 ranking score.

Electrons in solids owe their properties to the periodic potential landscapes they experience. The advent of moiré lattices has revolutionized our ability to engineer such landscapes on nanometre scales, leading to numerous ground-breaking discoveries. Despite this progress, direct imaging of these electrostatic potential landscapes remains elusive. Here we introduce the atomic single electron transistor (SET), a new scanning probe that uses a single atomic defect in a van der Waals material as an ultrasensitive, high-resolution potential sensor. Built on the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) platform1, this probe leverages the capability of the QTM to form a pristine, scannable two-dimensional interface between vdW heterostructures. Using the atomic SET, we present the first direct images of the electrostatic potential in a canonical moiré interface: graphene aligned to hexagonal boron nitride2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. The measured potential exhibits an approximate C6 symmetry, minimal dependence on carrier density and a substantial amplitude of approximately 60 mV, even in the absence of carriers. Theory indicates that this symmetry arises from a delicate interplay of physical mechanisms with competing symmetries. The measured amplitude significantly exceeds theoretical predictions, suggesting that current understanding may be incomplete. With 1 nm spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect the potential of even a few millionths of an electron charge, the atomic SET enables ultrasensitive imaging of charge order and thermodynamic properties across a wide range of quantum phenomena, including symmetry-broken phases, quantum crystals, vortex charges and fractionalized quasiparticles.

The behaviour of electrons in a lattice is governed by the periodic potential of the host material. In naturally occurring materials, this periodicity is determined by the atomic length scale, making it extremely challenging to directly image the local electrostatic potential. Over the past decade, moiré engineering has emerged as a powerful approach to create tunable periodic potentials at van der Waals (vdW) interfaces, achieving length scales substantially larger than those of atomic lattices. A canonical example is the interface between aligned graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (G/hBN), in which their lattice mismatch produces a moiré superlattice that alters the electronic properties through its periodic potential. This moiré interface has enabled numerous discoveries, including the observation of the Hofstadter butterfly3,4,5 and Brown–Zak oscillations11. More recently, when coupled with graphene multilayers, this aligned G/hBN interface has played a crucial role in stabilizing even more exotic phases, such as ferromagnetism in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene12,13, unconventional ferroelectricity in bilayer graphene14,15 and the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene16.

Despite its pivotal role, so far the G/hBN moiré potential has only been inferred indirectly from transport17,18 and optical19,20 measurements. Unlike in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), whose band edges can serve as direct markers for potential variations21, mapping the moiré potential in a vdW interface such as G/hBN requires a new imaging technique that combines nanometre resolution with exceptional potential sensitivity. The most sensitive tool currently available for imaging electrostatic potentials is the scanning single electron transistor (SET)22,23,24,25, which uses transport through a small island in the Coulomb blockade regime for detection. However, the spatial resolution of existing scanning SETs is constrained by their lithographic dimensions (>100 nm), preventing them from resolving potentials within a moiré unit cell. Although STM experiments with a graphene sensor layer26,27 have achieved intermediate spatial resolution, and recent advancements in AFM-based techniques have led to high-resolution imaging of molecules28,29,30, direct visualization of moiré potentials within vdW heterostructures remains an unmet challenge.

In this work, we develop the atomic SET, a new scanning probe that uses a single atomic defect31,32,33,34,35,36 as a scanning potential sensor, achieving 1 nm spatial resolution, two orders of magnitude better than existing SETs, and a potential sensitivity of 5 μV Hz−1/2. This remarkable sensitivity corresponds to detecting variations of a few parts per million of the potential produced by a single electron charge at the distance given by the spatial resolution (Supplementary Information section 17). Using this tool, we directly image the potential at the G/hBN moiré interface. Our measurements show that even at zero carrier density, the peak-to-peak potential amplitude is large (about 60 mV) and exhibits an approximate C6 symmetry around the moiré centre. Although this symmetry can be explained by a subtle interplay of competing mechanisms, the magnitude of the measured potential is about twice that predicted by existing theory, highlighting that our understanding of even this simple moiré interface remains incomplete.

The working principle of the scanning atomic SET is shown in Fig. 1a. A single atomic defect embedded in a thin TMD layer acts as a quantum dot, the energy level of which shifts with small changes to the local electrostatic potential ϕ(r). The system of interest is placed on the QTM tip, so scanning the tip across the stationary defect modulates the potential of the defect and, in turn, shifts its Coulomb blockade peak. By monitoring this shift, we directly image ϕ(r). This inverted geometry, in which the system of interest is on the tip, enables selecting an optimal defect from a large pool of natural defects within the flat TMD layer.

a, Schematic of the atomic SET geometry: the system of interest (purple), positioned on a QTM tip, is scanned across a fixed atomic defect (yellow) embedded in an insulating barrier (blue) above a graphene electrode (grey). At low temperature, the defect functions as a quantum dot (QD) exhibiting single electron transport (white arrows). As the tip scans across this defect, the spatially varying electrostatic potential ϕ(r) of the system on tip gates the defect, and by monitoring its Coulomb blockade peak, we directly map this potential. b, Illustration of an experiment to image individual atomic defects in WSe2: a bias voltage (Vb) is applied to the bottom graphene electrode and the current (I) through the tip is measured while scanning. When the tip does not overlap a defect (off-defect), the current arises from momentum-conserving tunnelling processes. However, when the contact area of the tip (white dashed line) overlaps a defect (on-defect), an additional defect-assisted tunnelling pathway opens. c, Defect imaging experiment using a QTM tip comprising aligned G/hBN layers. As the tip is scanned across trilayer WSe2 on a graphene electrode at Vb = –0.7 V, the measured I map shows multiple replicas of the tip contact area, each produced by a different defect. Within each replica, the G/hBN moiré superlattice appears as periodic modulations of I and the sharp edges (arrows) demonstrate a spatial resolution of approximately 1 nm. d, Schematic energy diagrams (top) and corresponding current maps (bottom) measured with a different G/hBN tip at T = 0.2 K and at three biases: Vb = –1.25 V (left), –0.9 V (centre) and –0.35 V (right), all within the same scan window. The energy diagrams show the interface along the z-direction: a graphene source electrode (grey), defects (yellow and grey) in a bilayer WSe2 barrier (blue) and a G/hBN moiré drain electrode (purple). As |Vb| decreases, the range of transport-accessible defects (highlighted in yellow) is narrowed, resulting in fewer observed tip-shape replicas. At the lowest bias, only a single replica remains in the entire scan window. Scale bars, 50 nm (c); 400 nm (d).

To locate suitable defects, we map the tunnelling current (I) at a fixed bias voltage (Vb) while scanning the tip across the TMD layer (Fig. 1b). When the tip does not overlap a defect, the current reflects only background momentum-conserving elastic1 and inelastic (phonon-assisted)37 tunnelling. However, when it overlaps a defect, an additional tunnelling channel opens, allowing electrons to tunnel preferentially through the defect. This results in an increased \(I\) when the contact area of the tip (white dashed line) coincides with a defect.

Figure 1c shows a room-temperature measurement using a trilayer WSe2 barrier. The scan shows several oblong shapes of increased I, each corresponding to a separate atomic defect imaging the contact area of the tip. Their identical spatial structure and increase in I suggest that these defects have the same chemical origin. In this experiment, the QTM tip consists of aligned G/hBN, forming a moiré superlattice2,3,4,5 that the defect imaging remarkably resolves even at room temperature. This measurement demonstrates extremely high spatial resolution, apparent from the sharpness of the tip image edges (about 1 nm; Supplementary Information section 6). Although we might expect that transferring a moiré heterostructure onto the QTM tip would result in significant strain that would be magnified by the moiré superlattice38, this measurement (Fig. 3a) instead shows minimal moiré heterostrain, typically less than ±0.3% (Supplementary Information section 7).

Another important aspect of the defects is their energetics, which we investigate by imaging at different bias voltages at low temperature (T = 0.2 K). Figure 1d presents maps taken with another tip containing aligned G/hBN (λm = 14 nm) scanned over a bilayer WSe2 barrier and graphene electrode. All subsequent data use this tip and are taken at this temperature. At high bias, the defect-assisted current is small compared with the Fowler–Nordheim tunnelling background through the WSe2 conduction band39. Nevertheless, numerous lungs-shaped replicas of the tip contact area appear, reflecting the large set of defects accessible at this energy. As the bias is reduced, progressively fewer defects contribute, and at the lowest bias, only a single low-energy defect remains within the scan window, with minimal residual background tunnelling. We use these relatively rare, low-energy defects for imaging: their sparse distribution ensures single-defect imaging, and their low energies allow us to operate near zero bias, avoiding hot-electron and phonon injection that could interfere with measuring the thermodynamic ground state of the system.

In the measurements so far, the defects served only as localized pathways for current. Now we aim to harness an individual defect as a fully functional quantum dot that can probe the local electrostatic potential and thermodynamic quantities at a specific position. This is accomplished by adding top and bottom gates to the QTM junction (Fig. 2a). In a prototypical quantum dot, applying a gate voltage Vgate linearly shifts the electrostatic potential of the quantum dot, producing a characteristic Coulomb diamond diagram (Fig. 2b). At zero bias, there is a specific Vgate in which the N and N + 1 charge states of the quantum dot are degenerate, permitting current to flow. At finite bias, the conduction window expands linearly with Vb, creating a diamond shape in the Vgate–Vb plane.

a, Cross-section of the QTM junction: the tip comprises an aligned G/hBN moiré interface, an hBN layer and a graphite top gate. The sensor device contains a defect-bearing bilayer WSe2 barrier, a graphene electrode, an hBN layer and a metal bottom gate. b, Prototypical quantum dot Coulomb diamond conductance diagram versus gate voltage (Vgate) and source–drain bias (Vb), showing a central conduction region (blue) and Coulomb-blockaded regions with fixed charge states (labelled N and N + 1). c, Electrostatic relations in the junction: for each graphene layer, µ = V – ϕ. The defect potential is ϕD = αϕT + (1 – α)ϕB with α= zB/(zT + zB), where zB and zT are the distances of the defect from the bottom and top layers, respectively. The defect energy ED is referenced to ϕD. d, Because the system of interest lies between the gate and the defect, gate voltages are screened by the electronic compressibility of the system. This leads to curvature in the Coulomb diamond lines, reflecting the density-dependent µ(n) of the two graphene electrodes. e, Off-defect differential conductance (dI/dV) versus top gate voltage (VTG) and Vb at T = 0.2 K and B = 0 T. Curves of reduced dI/dV correspond to the charge neutrality points (CNPs, n = 0) of the top (purple dashed) and bottom (white dashed) graphene layers. Additional suppression for |Vb| < Vth ≈ 65 mV (horizontal cyan dashed lines) arises from nonlinear contact resistance (see text). f, Off-defect measurement at \({B}_{\perp }=5\,{\rm{T}}\) showing reduced dI/dV along Landau level gaps in the top (\({\nu }_{{\rm{T}}}^{\mathrm{LL}}=\pm 2,\,\pm 6\), purple) and bottom (\({\nu }_{{\rm{B}}}^{\mathrm{LL}}=\pm 2\), white) graphene layers. g, On-defect dI/dV versus VTG and Vb at B = 0 T, exhibiting a Coulomb diamond diagram with curved boundaries that separate blockaded regions with near-zero dI/dV and fixed quantum dot charge (N and N + 1) from a high-conductance region. Arrows mark the deflection points at the CNPs of the top G/hBN (purple) and bottom graphene (white) layers. h, On-defect measurement at \({B}_{\perp }=5\,{\rm{T}}\), where the diamond edges exhibit step-like features due to Landau level gaps in both electrodes. White and purple dashed lines in e–h are fits to the electrostatic model (Supplementary Information sections 2 and 5).

In our experiment, the system of interest is situated between the gate and the defect, so the defect directly senses the local chemical potential of the system. As shown in Fig. 2c, the electrochemical (V), electrostatic (ϕ) and chemical (µ) potentials of the two graphene layers satisfy µ = V – ϕ for each layer. Consequently, when both layers are grounded (VT = VB = 0), their local electrostatic potentials directly track their local chemical potentials. The defect experiences an electrostatic potential ϕD = αϕT + (1 – α)ϕB (Supplementary Information sections 2 and 3), with α = zB/(zT + zB) set by its relative distances to the top and bottom layers (zT, zB). The response of ϕD to a gate voltage V (top or bottom) is thus a weighted sum of the inverse electronic compressibilities dµ/dn of the top and bottom layers \(\frac{{\rm{d}}{\phi }_{{\rm{D}}}}{{\rm{d}}V}=\alpha \frac{{\rm{d}}{\mu }_{{\rm{T}}}}{{\rm{d}}{n}_{{\rm{T}}}}\frac{{\rm{d}}{n}_{{\rm{T}}}}{{\rm{d}}V}+(1-\alpha )\frac{{\rm{d}}{\mu }_{{\rm{B}}}}{{\rm{d}}{n}_{{\rm{B}}}}\frac{{\rm{d}}{n}_{{\rm{B}}}}{{\rm{d}}V}\), where dnT/dV and dnB/dV are capacitive factors determined by the junction electrostatics (Supplementary Information section 2). Consequently, the Coulomb diamond lines will curve in a way that reflects the Dirac-like µ(n) of both layers33,35,40,41,42,43 (Fig. 2d).

Before performing tunnelling measurements through a defect, we first establish the electrostatics of the QTM junction, which is controlled by the top gate (VTG), the bottom gate (VBG) and the bias (Vb) voltages. Figure 2e shows the tunnelling conductance, dI/dV \(\equiv \) dI/dVb, measured off-defect as a function of VTG and Vb. The two curved lines of reduced dI/dV correspond to the charge neutrality points of the top (nT = 0) and bottom (nB = 0) graphene layers, in agreement with the electrostatic model (dashed lines, Supplementary Information section 2). For |Vb| < Vth ≈ 65 mV, there is a pronounced suppression of dI/dV. Detailed measurements (Supplementary Information section 9) indicate that this suppression is device-specific and arises from a large contact resistance that persists until the threshold bias Vth, then drops sharply. Therefore, for |Vb| < Vth, the bias primarily drops across the contact rather than across the QTM junction itself and the nT, nB = 0 lines remain vertical (essentially unaffected by bias). A similar measurement done in a perpendicular magnetic field of 5 T (Fig. 2f) shows suppressed dI/dV features associated with the Landau level gaps of the top (\({\nu }_{{\rm{T}}}^{\mathrm{LL}}=\pm 2,\,\pm 6\)) and bottom (\({\nu }_{{\rm{B}}}^{\mathrm{LL}}=\pm 2\)) layers, consistent with the electrostatic model. With additional measurements as a function of VBG (Supplementary Information section 5), we fully establish how the three voltages control the carrier densities in the QTM junction.

We now measure tunnelling through a low-energy defect as a function of VTG and Vb (Fig. 2g), observing an order of magnitude higher conductance. The conductance forms a curved Coulomb diamond: along its two branches, the defect level is resonant with either the top or bottom electrode (Supplementary Information section 2), whereas outside of this region, dI/dV is strongly suppressed, corresponding to fixed quantum dot charge (labelled as N and N + 1 for generality). For |Vb| < Vth, the Coulomb blockade peak is nearly vertical, consistent with the earlier off-defect observation that the bias drops primarily on the contact in this regime. For |Vb| > Vth, the curvature of the diamond edges reflects the µ(n) of the top and bottom layers. Specifically, two deflection points (arrows) correspond to the charge neutrality points of the two layers, in which the defect potential responds more strongly to gate voltage (that is, higher slope) due to the reduced compressibility of the top or bottom layer. In a similar measurement at B = 5 T (Fig. 2h), the Coulomb diamond edges show steps reflecting the Landau level gaps. Additional calibration experiments are presented in Supplementary Information section 16.

Having shown that a defect can measure µ(n) at a single point, we now turn to imaging potentials in real space. Figure 3a shows a high-resolution map of I(x, y) measured through a single low-energy defect at Vb = –0.35 V, revealing the detailed moiré structure of the tip. To extract the electrostatic potential, we monitor how the zero-bias Coulomb peak shifts as the tip is scanned across the defect. Figure 3b shows the zero-bias dI/dV(x, VTG) measured along the white dashed line in Fig. 3a. A narrow Coulomb blockade peak is observed at each x, whose gate-voltage position \({V}_{\mathrm{TG}}^{\mathrm{peak}}(x)\) oscillates with the moiré periodicity, following \({V}_{{\rm{T}}{\rm{G}}}^{{\rm{p}}{\rm{e}}{\rm{a}}{\rm{k}}}(x)=c\cdot \phi (x)+{\rm{c}}{\rm{o}}{\rm{n}}{\rm{s}}{\rm{t}}\) (c is determined by the junction electrostatics; Supplementary Information sections 2 and 3). This scan, therefore, directly tracks the moiré electrostatic potential (Fig. 3b, right axis).

a, High-resolution current map I(x, y) at Vb = –0.35 V and T = 0.2 K, showing the shape of the contact area of the G/hBN tip and the detailed moiré structure within. b, Zero-bias dI/dV versus x and VTG, measured at filling v = 3.2 ± 1. The narrow Coulomb-blockade peak oscillates with the moiré periodicity; its gate-voltage position \({V}_{\mathrm{TG}}^{\mathrm{peak}}(x)\) is converted to the electrostatic potential at the moiré interface, ϕ(x) (right y-axis), using the junction electrostatics (Supplementary Information sections 2 and 3). This measurement cuts through the high-symmetry sites of the moiré superlattice with the highest ϕ(r) (white dashed line in a). c, Extension of b to two spatial dimensions (blue dotted region in a), showing dI/dV measured versus x, y and VTG for a few slices of constant VTG. At the lowest VTG, dI/dV is practically zero everywhere. As VTG increases, rings of conductance appear and repeat with the moiré periodicity, corresponding to equipotential lines that expand and merge with increasing VTG. From the full three-dimensional dataset (Supplementary Video 1), we extract \({V}_{\mathrm{TG}}^{\mathrm{peak}}(x,y)\) (Supplementary Information section 4) and from the junction electrostatics directly determine the moiré potential, ϕ(x, y). d, ϕ(x, y) of aligned G/hBN, measured at fillings v = 0 ± 0.15 (left), v = 1.3 ± 0.2 (centre) and v = 4 ± 1 (right). These maps are obtained by averaging over several moiré sites (uncertainties in v arise from the VTG adjustments used to meet the quantum dot resonance condition; Supplementary Information sections 4 and 13). We set ϕ = 0 at the potential minimum. The centre and right maps use defect D1 at zero bias; the left map uses defect D2 at Vb = –0.21 V. The potential exhibits an approximate C6 symmetry, changes minimally with carrier density (about 10%) and has a substantial amplitude even at zero carrier density. High-symmetry stacking sites are indicated by red, blue and grey dots. Scale bar, 50 nm (a).

We can now apply this technique to obtain a full 2D map of the moiré potential. Figure 3c shows the zero-bias dI/dV measured as a function of x and y (Fig. 3a, dotted box) and at several values of VTG. At the lowest VTG, dI/dV is practically zero at every (x, y) position. With increased VTG, conductance appears along rings, which repeat in the (x, y) plane with the moiré periodicity. These rings correspond to equipotential lines within the moiré unit cell. Further increasing VTG increases the radius of the rings until they merge and disappear. From a full three-dimensional map of dI/dV(x, y, VTG) (Supplementary Video 1), we extract \({V}_{\mathrm{TG}}^{\mathrm{peak}}(x,y)\) (Supplementary Information section 4), and from the relation above, directly determine the 2D moiré potential.

Figure 3d shows the 2D moiré potential ϕ(x, y) across a single moiré unit cell at three fillings, ν = 0 ± 0.15, 1.3 ± 0.2 and 4 ± 1 (with ν = 1 corresponding to one electron per moiré cell). Several key features emerge. First, the moiré potential amplitude is large, ranging from 52 mV to 62 mV (Supplementary Information section 18). Second, this amplitude varies only minimally (about 10%) with moiré filling. The maps also show three distinct high-symmetry points: a central maximum (red) and two minima separated by 60° (grey and blue). The difference between these minima, Δϕminima ≈ 4 mV, is a small fraction of the overall scale. This indicates that although a minor C3 component is present, consistent with the underlying symmetry of the moiré lattice, the overall symmetry is close to C6.

To interpret our observations, we consider various mechanisms that have been theoretically proposed to induce potential. Following ref. 10, the moiré Hamiltonian can be decomposed into three terms: an effective pseudoelectric potential (H0), a pseudomagnetic field (Hxy) and a local mass term (Hz), each associated with a corresponding sublattice Pauli matrix (Supplementary Information section 13). The dominant H0 term arises from two effects: (1) the spatially varying stacking potential generated by changes in the local G/hBN alignment within the moiré cell and (2) the in-plane relaxation of the graphene lattice, which stretches and compresses the C–C bonds, leading to local variations in the Dirac point energy relative to the vacuum level and captured by the deformation potential9,44.

Figure 4 shows the predicted stacking (Fig. 4a) and deformation (Fig. 4b) pseudopotential terms comprising H0, along with the pseudomagnetic field Hxy (Fig. 4c), with the three high-symmetry CB (carbon above boron), CN (carbon above nitrogen) and AA (carbon above both boron and nitrogen) stacking sites marked. Generally, a pseudoelectric potential may reflect energy changes that are not electrostatic in nature. However, theory44 and density functional theory calculations45,46 suggest that the pseudopotentials in Fig. 4a,b are directly accounted for by charge polarization perpendicular to the layers and therefore manifest as real electrostatic potentials.

a, Stacking pseudopotential due to the relative stacking of G and hBN, which varies within the moiré unit cell. The three high-symmetry points corresponding to local CB, CN and AA stacking are marked. b, Deformation pseudopotential due to atomic relaxation within the graphene layer. The terms in a and b both appear in the H0 part of the Bloch Hamiltonian, corresponding to the identity matrix in the sublattice basis. c, Magnitude of the pseudomagnetic field, which appears in the Hxy part of the Hamiltonian, corresponding to the σx and σy Pauli matrices in the sublattice basis. d–f, Self-consistent electrostatic potentials obtained after considering the screening by the graphene carriers, calculated by including a self-consistent Hartree potential response using a carrier density corresponding to v = 4. All terms show strong C3 symmetry around the moiré centre, in contrast to the C6 symmetry observed in the experiments. g, Self-consistent stacking and deformation potentials are plotted along a linecut through the moiré centre (dashed white line, bottom inset). The CB, CN and AA high-symmetry points are labelled. Visibly, each of the two terms (blue, pink) shows a strong C3 symmetry. However, owing to cancelling contributions, their sum (purple) exhibits an approximate C6 symmetry, with only a small difference between the potential minima at the CB and AA stacking sites. h, Total self-consistent potential calculated for v = 0. This potential resembles the experiment in terms of the approximate C6 symmetry, but its magnitude is half of that measured experimentally.

Graphene carriers redistribute to screen these pseudopotentials, producing the self-consistent electrostatic potential measured by our detector. We model this using self-consistent Hartree calculations (Supplementary Information section 13). The resulting screened potentials from the components in Fig. 4a–c are shown in Fig. 4d–f. Notably, screening preserves the shape of the pseudoelectric potentials but reduces their magnitude by approximately 2.2, consistent with the predicted random-phase-approximation dielectric constant ϵ = 1 + πα/2 ≈ 2.0, where \(\alpha =\frac{{e}^{2}}{4{\rm{\pi }}\kappa {{\epsilon }}_{0}\hbar {v}_{{\rm{F}}}}\) is the fine-structure constant of graphene, vF is its Fermi velocity and κ = 3.5 is the hBN dielectric constant47. Furthermore, we find that electronic screening converts the pseudomagnetic field Hxy into an electrostatic potential (Fig. 4f). This potential is small compared with the other two, scales linearly with ν, and becomes identically zero at v = 0 (same for Hz; Supplementary Information section 13). As our experiments show only a minor v dependence, we omit the Hxy and Hz terms in further discussions.

Both leading potential terms (Fig. 4d,e) exhibit a clear C3 symmetry around the central CN site, in contrast to the approximate C6 symmetry observed experimentally. However, examining the minima at the CB and AA sites shows that these C3 symmetries are inverted—for the first term ϕAA > ϕCB and for the second term ϕCB > ϕAA. The two terms compensate each other to form an almost C6-symmetric total potential with a pronounced central peak (Fig. 4g). The resulting total self-consistent potential (Fig. 4h) strongly resembles the experimental result, with one notable exception—the experimental potential scale is double the theoretical prediction. One explanation might be that theory underestimates strain in the moiré interface21. However, increasing strain alone would yield a more C3-symmetric potential, contrasting our observations. This large discrepancy demonstrates that, despite G/hBN being one of the most relevant and extensively studied moiré interfaces, there are substantial gaps in its theoretical understanding, which has direct consequences for recent experiments that use this interface to design new states of matter (for example, FQAHE in moiré pentalayer graphene).

Finally, we show the dependence of the moiré potential on the distance from the moiré interface. Extended Data Fig. 1 presents potential traces measured by two defects, located at approximately 0.8 nm (D2) and 1.5 nm (D1) from the interface (Supplementary Information section 3). The measured potential decays rapidly, even over these small distances. This significant drop suggests that if the detector were at a moiré distance (h = λm) away from the interface, it would have detected only \({{\rm{e}}}^{-\frac{4{\rm{\pi }}}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\frac{h}{{\lambda }_{{\rm{m}}}}\right)\sqrt{\frac{{{\epsilon }}_{\parallel }}{{{\epsilon }}_{\perp }}}}\) ≈ 10–4 of the potential, underscoring the importance of our atomic SET operating at extremely close standoff distances. At the same time, these measurements also demonstrate that in thin flakes, such as pentalayer graphene, electrons can still experience a significant moiré potential (tens of mV) even in the farthest graphene layer.

The atomic SET scanning probe technique demonstrated here has a combination of features that are extremely powerful for studying a wide range of quantum materials. Its QTM geometry allows it to scan within the pristine interfaces of a variety of vdW materials. Similar to existing SETs, this technique will allow quantitative measurements of thermodynamic properties such as the electronic compressibility24,25,48 and entropy49, but now with two orders of magnitude improved spatial resolution—below the Fermi wavelength, magnetic length and moiré scales of many systems. This advance extends this powerful imaging method to a much broader class of physical phenomena occurring on small scales such as Wigner crystals, topological edge states, vortex charges, symmetry-broken phases and fractionally charged quasiparticles.

Linecuts along high-symmetry points of the moiré potential, \({\phi }_{m}^{D}\), measured as a function of position, x, using two defects (D1 and D2). These defects are located at different heights from the G/hBN interface (1.5 nm and 0.8 nm, respectively) and measured at moiré fillings v = 4 ± 1 and v = 3.2 ± 1. We also plot the potential at the moiré interface (ϕ(x), dashed lines) deduced using the calibrated junction electrostatics (Supplementary Information sections 2 and 3) from the measurements with both defects. The potentials are offset along the y-axis for clarity. These measurements demonstrate that even at such small heights, the decay of the moiré potential amplitude is substantial (~60% measured decay from 0.8 nm to 1.5 nm).

This file includes Supplementary Information sections 1–18, Supplementary Figs. 1–29 and additional references.

Full measurement of conductance compared with position and top gate voltage. Video showing full three-dimensional measurement of conductance dI/dV as a function of position (x, y) within the moiré superlattice and top gate voltage VTG. The data were obtained using defect D2 at zero d.c. bias Vb and bottom gate voltage VBG = 0 with an a.c. bias excitation of 1 mV root mean square.

Deep mantle melting marks the onset of Earth differentiation1, yet a unifying framework for how buoyancy-driven mantle upwellings initiate melting and how such incipient melts evolve within the asthenosphere has remained elusive. Here we show that the first melts generated in any solid-state mantle upwelling are kimberlitic CO2-rich silicate melts that form at about 250 km depth through oxidation of elemental carbon to CO2 (refs. 2,3). Our experiments force a range of surface melts, derived from mantle plumes4 or broad upwellings5 (kimberlites, ocean island basalts and mid-ocean ridge basalts), into equilibrium with fertile mantle at adiabatic and super-adiabatic conditions at 7 GPa. The results define a framework in which redox melting at depth universally yields kimberlitic melts, which, while ascending through the asthenosphere by reactive porous flow6,7, evolve to higher degrees of melting, lesser volatiles and incompatible elements, but higher SiO2. Channelized flow7 in the lithosphere may then enable direct extraction of these melts, leading to kimberlites, where the lithosphere commences just above the C → CO2 redox front, to alkaline Si-undersaturated intraplate magmas where lithospheric thicknesses are 150–100 km, and to tholeiitic basalts below mid-ocean ridges where voluminous ‘dry' melting becomes overwhelming. This framework is consistent with the widespread seismic low-velocity zone at about 250 km beneath mid-ocean ridges8,9 and aligns with ocean island and mid-ocean ridge basalts sampling the various geochemical mantle components at different degrees of melting in different proportions10,11.

Silicate Earth primarily differentiates through mantle-derived magmatism1, which shapes the modern surface of our planet and generates many economic resources. Mantle-derived magmas are grouped into three main suites that occur (1) at constructive plate margins, in which mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) form oceanic crust; (2) within tectonic plates, in which they span a wide spectrum from diamond-carrying kimberlites to ocean island basalts (OIB) to flood basalts; and (3) at destructive plate margins, in which predominantly calc-alkaline magmas generate continental crust1,12. The latter series is intrinsically linked to subduction, in which descending plates provide surface-derived volatiles that lead to H2O- and SiO2-rich arc magmas. The other main magma suites form in the asthenosphere in deeply rooted mantle upwellings, which are fed by either giant convection cells below mid-ocean ridges5 or finger-like plumes that may originate as deep as the core–mantle boundary4,13. Buoyancy in these upwellings arises principally from temperature differences14. On an adiabatic pressure–temperature trajectory with a potential mantle temperature TP of 1,350 ± 50 °C, representative of the modern ambient mantle15,16, the dry (volatile-free) mantle solidus is intersected only at shallow depths of 40–70 km (refs. 17,18). Yet analyses of basaltic glasses and melt inclusions in olivine have shown that oceanic basalts contain variable, in part elevated concentrations of CO2 and H2O (refs. 19,20), which enable melting at higher pressures.

In the asthenospheric mantle, CO2 and H2O are not readily available as neither carbonates nor hydrous phases are stable at adiabatic temperatures2,21,22, and hence volatile-assisted melting requires a mechanism different from overstepping a carbonate-saturated solidus. Instead, melting is triggered by a carbon-related redox reaction2,3. Below approximately 230 km depth, the ambient mantle contains FeIII-rich majoritic garnet, a metal alloy with dissolved carbon and diamond23,24. In upwellings, the majoritic garnet component destabilizes on decompression25, which releases FeIII, causing first any Fe-metal to comproportionate to FeOolivine and immediately after causing carbon to oxidize through C0 + 2Fe2O3majorite = CO2melt + 4FeOolivine (refs. 2,3). This reaction consumes excess FeIII, leaving the mantle at the C0–CO2melt oxygen fugacity buffer and completes between 9 GPa and 7 GPa, that is, at latest at about 230 km depth2,3. Most importantly, this process oxidizes reduced carbon (in metal alloy and diamond), which is insoluble in silicate melts, to CO2, which lowers the peridotite solidus by 400–450 °C, from about 1,750 °C to 1,300 °C at 7 GPa (refs. 26,27), that is, from well above to below an average adiabatic or super-adiabatic28 temperature (1,420 °C and ≤1,670 °C at 7 GPa for a TP of 1,350 °C and 1,600 °C, respectively).

Here we show through a new type of ‘forced multiple saturation' high-pressure experiments that any mantle upwelling will produce carbonated silicate melts of kimberlitic composition through the above redox reaction, regardless of the buoyancy flux and depth of origin of such upwellings. These melts transform thermal buoyancy-driven solid-state upwellings into melt-bearing ones and represent a rather uniform beginning of melting for intraplate and mid-ocean ridge settings. To demonstrate the general validity of this concept, multi-anvil experiments (Extended Data Table 1) were undertaken at 7 GPa, equivalent to the top of the redox-front depth. These experiments identify the precursor melts to kimberlites, OIBs and MORBs. We select compositions representing (1) a primitive silica-undersaturated OIB (basanite) with 5.4 wt% CO2 and 1.9 wt% H2O based on melt inclusion studies20, confirmed by model calculations29; (2) an MORB composition (tholeiite) with 1 wt% CO2 as in the Atlantic popping rocks19, and 0.5 wt% H2O, characteristic of enriched MORB30; and (3) a kimberlitic melt with 10 wt% CO2 and 2.5 wt% H2O (ref. 31), including a correction for alkali loss (Methods and Supplementary Table 1). To perform reverse-engineering of the mantle melting process, we use an experimental strategy that forces these melts to equilibrate and saturate with the four principal mantle phases—olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and garnet—maintaining mineral compositions akin to those of the mantle (Supplementary Table 2). As the resulting carbonated silicate melts are unquenchable and do not form glasses, large melt pools are required for measurements averaging across the quench crystallites. This meant that experimental mineral to melt ratios could not exceed 2–3, and mineral proportions, melt fraction and melt composition had to be iteratively adjusted such that the final melts were in equilibrium with all four mantle minerals (Supplementary Fig. 1). Highly incompatible elements were set so that equilibrium clinopyroxene compositions correspond to those observed in fertile mantle rocks (Methods). As mantle upwelling temperatures are adiabatic or hotter, we use 1,400–1,420 °C at 7 GPa (corresponding to a TP of 1,350 °C) and super-adiabatic temperatures of 1,480–1,630 °C at the same pressure, covering most of the range proposed for mantle plumes32,33.

The principal result is that all three surface melt types—kimberlites, alkaline basanites (OIBs) and tholeiitic basalts (MORBs)—equilibrate to carbonated silicate melts of broadly kimberlitic composition at 7 GPa when saturated with the four mantle phases (Fig. 1). Specifically, these melts have about 23–27 wt% SiO2, 21–23 wt% MgO, 13 wt% CaO, 4.4–6.1 wt% total alkalis and 14–24 wt% H2O + CO2 at 1,400–1,420 °C; and about 35–39 wt% SiO2, 23 wt% MgO, 9 wt% CaO, 3.7–4.9 wt% total alkalis and 3–9 wt% H2O + CO2 at 1,630 °C—that is, at 210 °C excess temperature compared with a TP of 1,350 °C (Fig. 2, Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). Al2O3 contents are only 1–3 wt% for all temperatures. This fundamental major element characteristic of these incipient mantle melts can be related to a self-regulatory mechanism in peridotites, the dominant upper mantle lithology, in which the olivine–orthopyroxene pair buffers SiO2, FeO and MgO contents (for a given temperature), MgO–CaO is buffered by the pyroxene pair, and Al2O3 is controlled by the garnet–pyroxene equilibrium, limiting Al2O3 to remarkably low values. Na and K are regulated by partitioning between melt and clinopyroxene, and only the minor elements P (phosphorus) and Ti are controlled by mantle heterogeneities.

The experiments of this study (large diamonds) simulate redox melting at 7 GPa for potential mantle temperatures TP of 1,350–1,560 °C, yielding a narrow field of redox melts irrespective of whether a kimberlite, basanite (OIB) or tholeiite (MORB) starting melt is used. The redox melts overlap with the low-Mg, low-Si end of the kimberlite field (Methods), in which higher Mg and Si mirror assimilation of lithospheric mantle wall rocks. Kimberlites then form from asthenospheric melts extracted directly from 6 GPa to 7 GPa following redox melting. Asthenospheric melt evolution with decreasing pressure is modelled to 3 GPa (grey lines ending in a star) using appropriate melting reactions26 and mineral compositions (Methods). The expected increase in the degree of melting F from 7 GPa to 3 GPa from about 1.5% to about 10% for TP values of 1,560 °C and from 0.5% to 3–5% for TP values of 1,350 °C (tick marks are increments of 1% and 0.5%, respectively). Volatile-free experimental peridotite melts at 1–4 GPa are also plotted (red crosses indicate those with residual clinopyroxene and white crosses without residual clinopyroxene; Methods), the dotted curve labelled ‘cpx' marks the stability limit of clinopyroxene, which exhausts at F = 20–25%, much higher than the melting degrees permissible for any OIB composition. A comparison with primitive (XMg > 0.65) OIBs worldwide (n = 747), including primitive rejuvenated (n = 123) and shield stage (n = 225) Hawaiian lavas, shows that these can stem from neither low pressure nor dry melting, but require high-pressure CO2-rich (kimberlitic) carbonated silicate melts that evolve through porous reactive flow to the asthenosphere–lithosphere boundary. For reference, high-Mg MORBs (XMg > 0.65, black circles, n = 715) are given; pyroxenite melts have even lower MgO and higher Al2O3 contents. Yet any small pyroxenite contribution would be eradicated in terms of major elements through equilibration with peridotite. Bars are 1σ s.e.

a,b, Diagrams of total alkalis (a) and Al2O3 (b) compared with SiO2. The redox melts evolve to the observed array of OIB melts by progressive equilibration during asthenospheric rise (see Fig. 1 caption for details of plotted symbols and curves). The high alkalis in Si-undersaturated OIB melts testify to low-degree melting (a), whereas the low Al2O3 contents indicate high pressures of melting (b). The largely tholeiitic Hawaiian shield stage lavas also have low Al2O3 contents, such that parent melts akin to our 7 GPa melts are required (see also Extended Data Fig. 1). Their higher SiO2 compared with OIBs elsewhere is likely to be attributed to partial equilibration in the lithospheric mantle. Note that kimberlites do not preserve magmatic Na2O contents36; reconstructed values are of the order of 3–5 wt% (ref. 54) and total alkalis accordingly higher. Bars are 1σ s.e.

Experimental melt volatile contents partly depend on the initial starting compositions. Nevertheless, in nature, H2O in the carbonated silicate melt arises from partitioning with the nominally anhydrous minerals. With a bulk partition coefficient DHmelt/mantle of about 0.004 and average mantle H2O contents of 80–200 ppm (ref. 34), 2–5 wt% H2O are expected in the 7 GPa melts, which we match in the experiments (Table 1). Because CO2 behaves perfectly incompatible in the adiabatic mantle, the main role of CO2 is then to control melt fraction (F), with higher bulk CO2 corresponding to higher F. The amount of carbon available in the convective mantle is 100–400 ppm (ref. 29). Although most of this carbon is primordial, some carbon is added through redox freezing above deeply subducted plates, where slab-derived CO2-rich melts and fluids migrate into metal-bearing mantle and CO2 is reduced to C0 according to CO2melt or fluid + 2Fe0 = C0 + FeOolivine (ref. 2). This process, which is widely documented in the formation of sub-lithospheric diamonds based on their carbon isotope systematics typical of subducted biogenic carbon35, adds carbon and net-oxidizes these carbon-enriched mantle domains. These metasomatized volumes would be the first to undergo the inverse process of redox melting as described above. The range of 100–400 ppm carbon for depleted to enriched mantle can then be combined with 9–16 wt% CO2 in the incipient melts (for a TP of 1,350 °C), which results in 0.3–0.9 wt% incipient melting, which probably redistributes towards a characteristic average value of 0.4–0.7 wt%.

The first carbonated silicate melts form locally in the most oxidized volumes with the highest carbon and the lowest metal contents. These melts would then begin to migrate upwards, but will undergo redox freezing if they encounter metal-bearing, C-poorer reduced rocks during upward percolation. Multiple redox-melting and redox-freezing cycles are, therefore, likely and may continue until either the FeIII-bearing majorite garnet component or the elemental iron and carbon are entirely consumed. Only when no metal-bearing mantle hinders further percolation, these carbonated silicate melts can begin their way to the surface. This depth corresponds to 7 ± 1 GPa (ref. 25) and is the shallow limit of majoritic garnet stability. The lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary at kimberlite eruption sites occurs at about this depth36, which explains why the melts forming natural kimberlites correspond to the experimental incipient carbonated silicate melts identified here (Fig. 3).

Redox melting, which completes with the exhaustion of metal at about 7 ± 1 GPa, yields (kimberlitic) carbonated silicate melts at a degree of melting F of about 0.4–0.7 wt% for a potential temperature of 1,350°C and about 1.5 wt% for 1,550 °C. Experimentally, these melts equilibrate with 0.5 mm mantle minerals within hours, suggesting that porous flow in the asthenosphere leads to full equilibration at increasing degrees of melting until the rising melts reach the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary. With lithospheric thicknesses of 6–7 GPa (ref. 36), kimberlitic melts may be directly extracted from the redox melting depth. Ocean islands with highly Si-undersaturated primitive melts (for example, Cape Verde, Canary and rejuvenated Hawaii) remain equilibrated to lithospheric thicknesses corresponding to about 3 GPa (ref. 39), hence evolving in the asthenospheric mantle towards higher SiO2 and lower alkali and CO2 contents than kimberlitic melts. Within the lithosphere, channelled flow may shield these melts from interaction with wall rocks and avoid lower-pressure equilibration. However, this isolation is much less likely for the higher-temperature melts of the most intense plumes, such as for the Hawaiian shield stage. Below mid-ocean ridges, the melting column reaches to <10 km depth. At about 2 GPa, the dry solidus is overstepped and the degree of melting increases substantially, leaving only a faint signature of deeper melting. The pressure of 7 GPa also corresponds to the depth of 230 km of the low-velocity zone below mid-ocean ridges and ocean islands8,9, linking redox melting to a worldwide geophysical anomaly.

In all other cases (that is, with a thinner lithosphere), the incipient kimberlitic melts will evolve when rising in the asthenosphere by reaction with peridotitic ambient mantle (Fig. 3). This modification explains how the rather uniform incipient melt composition proposed here transforms into the very diverse surface magmas forming above mantle upwellings. As asthenospheric melts migrate by grain boundary percolation in porosity waves6,7, melt compositions will equilibrate with decreasing pressure while melt fractions increase. First, the major element systematics of mantle peridotite melting is such that decreasing pressure and CO2 shift equilibrium melts to higher SiO2 and lower (Mg,Fe)O (refs. 37,38). Second, the dT/dP slopes of high-pressure silicate-melt liquidi26 are steeper than the mantle adiabat (of about 10 °C GPa−1; ref. 16), which implies that rising melts overheat and dissolve further material, leading to an increase in the degree of melting. The combined effect is that melt CO2 and alkali contents decrease while the melts become less Si-undersaturated and their incompatible trace elements more diluted. Melts are thus expected to evolve from kimberlitic to basanitic and then to tholeiitic basalts, spanning compositions from strongly alkaline and Si-undersaturated when erupting over thick oceanic lithosphere (for example, the Cape Verde and Canary hotspots with a lithosphere of about 90 km thickness39), to largely tholeiitic above thin oceanic lithosphere (20–30 km at Galapagos and Ascension39). Finally, in the extreme case of shallow asthenospheric melting below mid-ocean ridges, the dry solidus is overstepped, and the approximately 0.5 wt% incipient kimberlitic melts are completely blurred out by the 10–15% melting at depths of <30 km (ref. 7), which yields tholeiitic, comparatively Si-rich MORBs.

Furthermore, contrasting the Cape Verde and Canary plumes, for some plumes, excess temperatures of up to 250 °C have been proposed28, most prominently for Hawaii. The ensuing higher degrees of initial melting, mirrored by our 1,630 °C OIB experiment, cause higher initial silica (about 35 wt%), and more dilute volatiles (CO2 + H2O = 9.9 wt%; Table 1) and alkalis (Na2O + K2O = 4.9 wt%) with respect to the 1,420 °C OIB melts. The tholeiitic character of the Hawaiian shield stage, thought to represent the highest potential temperature in plumes28, has been related to various factors, including increased H2O contents, thinned lithosphere and consequent shallower continuation of melting, or higher degrees of asthenospheric melting due to higher excess temperatures28,40. Our experiments define the incipient melt compositions arising from redox melting for a TP of 1,560 °C (or 1,630 °C at 7 GPa). We then model their evolution to 3 GPa, the pressure at the base of the lithosphere below Hawaii39, by using appropriate melting equations26 (Methods). This modelled melt constitutes a suitable parent for the Hawaiian shield stage basalts (Figs. 1 and 2). By contrast, high-degree melting at 1–3 GPa does neither fit the characteristically high MgO/CaO ratios of the Hawaiian shield stage nor their SiO2/Al2O3 ratios or alkali contents (Figs. 1 and 2). Thus, based on major elements, we postulate that the tholeiitic melts produced during the Hawaiian shield stage probably form through a three-stage process: (1) low-degree melting at the redox front near 7 GPa of about 1.5% (that is, threefold that of an upwelling with a TP of 1,350 °C), (2) melt evolution during upward percolation from 7 GPa to 3 GPa to form a suitable parent for the shield stage magmas within the asthenosphere (Figs. 1 and 2 and Table 1); and (3) partial re-equilibration within the lithosphere, driven by the large excess temperature. Yet the post-shield or rejuvenated magmas from Hawaii are similar to the highly Si-undersaturated plume melts of, for example, Cape Verde, that is, melts produced at a TP of about 1,350 °C, suggesting that these tap the margins of the main plume.

A complementary perspective on the common parentage of kimberlites and oceanic basalts is provided by the Sr–Nd–Hf–Pb isotope geochemistry and by trace element patterns, which show that kimberlites, intracontinental mafic magmas and OIBs share (1) the same sources in the convective mantle10,41,42 and (2) a continuum in trace elements with melt fractions increasing from kimberlites to OIBs41,42. Furthermore, it is well established that the higher melting degrees associated with MORBs compared with OIBs diminish the role of mantle heterogeneities in the trace element and isotopic compositions of MORBs, which are geochemically more depleted and less variable than OIBs10. The similarities and differences in isotopic composition between kimberlites, OIBs and MORBs testify to sampling several mantle components in different proportions, mainly a dominant peridotite with minor pyroxenite. Pyroxenites are generally considered to play an important part in deep melting10 as they are enriched in incompatible trace elements and may carry distinct isotopic signatures such as enriched mantle and high U/Pb compositions prominent in OIBs. These signatures could be acquired during incipient melting or en route to the surface when the incipient melts percolate through heterogeneous mantle containing pyroxenites.

Owing to higher alkalis and a lower XMg, dry pyroxenites have slightly lower melting temperatures (by around 30 °C) than dry peridotitic mantle43,44. However, fertility in the deep mantle is not governed by these subtle differences but by redox potential and carbon content because CO2 lowers the melting point of peridotites and pyroxenites by about 400 °C. The subducted igneous oceanic crust, ultimately forming pyroxenites, is more oxidized than the ambient mantle, in particular, when carbonate is added through hydrothermal seawater circulation. Yet the oceanic crust loses most of its carbonates during ongoing subduction at depths of 300–500 km (refs. 45,46), at the latest when relaxing to ambient mantle temperatures47, leaving a carbon-poor recycled crust to enter into large-scale mantle convection at greater depths48,49. As both metal and carbon are unlikely to be substantial in typical pyroxenites (that represent recycled oceanic crust) entrained in mantle upwellings, a fertility inversion is probable. Consequently, metal- and carbon-bearing peridotites are expected to melt earlier and to a larger degree than C-free pyroxenites. This does not preclude a contribution of pyroxenite melts (as documented by specific traces and isotopes10). However, in terms of major elements, this contribution will rapidly vanish because of equilibration with the overwhelmingly peridotitic mantle during porous flow.

Our experiments indicate that kimberlitic melts also feed the mantle column, which ultimately generates MOR tholeiites at low pressure, a conclusion supported by independent petrological and geophysical arguments. First, it has long been known that MOR basalts contain a melt component that stems from the garnet stability field50, corresponding to >50–70 km at adiabatic conditions (Fig. 3). A solution often proposed is that melting is triggered by H2O that is shed from the nominally anhydrous minerals on decompression34. However, for typical mantle H contents of 100–200 ppm (ref. 25), this does not happen at depths greater than 60–90 km (refs. 34,51), and hence H-assisted melting will be preceded by C-assisted redox melting. Second, the geophysical low-velocity zone, thought to be caused by a small melt fraction, reaches down to 200–250 km depth8,9, which is consistent with the depth of redox melting triggered by carbon. We hence posit that incipient melting beneath mid-ocean ridges is due to carbon oxidation2,3, with hydrogen playing a passive role controlled by partitioning between nominally anhydrous minerals and the carbonated silicate melt. Also, H2O-assisted melting causes melt compositions to shift towards higher SiO2 compared with volatile-free melting37 (as characteristic for arcs), whereas the compositions of kimberlites and alkaline basalts require the opposite effect, namely, a strong decrease in SiO2 as caused by CO2 (refs. 36,38).

In summary, we postulate that there is no principal difference in the initial melting mechanism of mantle-derived magmas from intraplate settings and divergent plate margins. The concept of similar kimberlitic incipient melts that evolve as a function of depth while rising in the asthenosphere provides an overarching theoretical framework for melting in mantle upwellings, regardless of buoyancy and potential temperature. Decompression of carbon-bearing peridotites induces majoritic garnet to liberate FeIII that oxidizes C0 to CO2, triggering the formation of kimberlitic melts. The widespread occurrence of this process is illuminated by the occurrence of seismically detected low-velocity zones below mid-ocean ridges at depths of 200–250 km (refs. 8,9), which corresponds to the conditions of carbon oxidation along a typical mantle adiabat21. The occurrence of kimberlites, that is, carbonate-rich silicate melts extracted from the convective mantle from depths of 200–250 km before being channelized along translithospheric fractures and erupted at the surface, provides direct evidence for the formation of these melts by carbon oxidation36.

The formation of compositionally similar incipient kimberlitic melts that vary as a function of the excess temperature of the upwelling provides a unifying concept of deep mantle melting on a global scale and explains the various surface expressions of intraplate magmatism as well as the precursor melts to mid-ocean ridge magmatism. The variability in erupted magmas ultimately arises from the equilibration of this incipient melt to the uppermost limit of the asthenosphere, varying from about 250 km beneath continental cratons to <10 km depth at mid-oceanic ridges. Although a similar lid effect has been previously postulated to explain correlations between lithospheric thickness and Si-content or alkalinity of both OIBs39,52 and continental intraplate magmas53, our study shows the origin of these melts and the role of incipient kimberlitic melt as the starting composition of the vast range of magma types associated with mantle upwellings. Increasing melt fraction with decreasing depth and equilibration with peridotite minerals control the major element composition of erupted magmas, whereas part of the incompatible element and radiogenic isotope variability is dictated by mantle heterogeneities, including those arising from subducted material.

All experiments were conducted in a 6–8 multi-anvil apparatus with 32 mm edge length WC cubes featuring 11 mm truncations and 18 mm edge octahedra, calibrated against the transitions of quartz–coesite, garnet–perovskite in CaGeO3, and coesite–stishovite. The assembly consists of a Cr-doped MgO-octahedron, a zirconia sleeve, a stepped graphite furnace, inner MgO parts and a PtRh B-type thermocouple. Full details, including pressure calibration, are provided in ref. 24. Based on previous experience with similar temperatures and melt compositions, equilibrium is typically achieved within 1–2 h. Consequently, our run times ranged from 2 h to 8 h, increasing with decreasing temperature. The starting mixtures were loaded into Re capsules folded from foil, placing a thin graphite layer at the bottom and top. These were then inserted into a Pt capsule, which was welded shut to contain the volatiles. The graphite–CO2melt pair yields the appropriate oxygen fugacity for redox melting, in which C0 oxidizes to CO2.

The experiments (Extended Data Table 1) equilibrate erupted surface melts with a lherzolite mantle at 7 GPa and temperatures of 1,420–1,630 °C. These conditions correspond to mantle potential temperatures (TP) of 1,350–1,560 °C, encompassing a typical mid-ocean ridge adiabat15,16 and an excess temperature of 210 °C, similar to the hottest mantle plumes32,33. Initial starting materials (Supplementary Table 1) include an average primitive ocean-island basanite (APB, see below) and an average of close-to-primitive MORBs, corrected for olivine fractionation (MBB). The OIB composition contains 5.4 wt% CO2 and 1.9 wt% H2O, based on melt inclusion data20. For the MORB, we selected the maximum observed CO2 content of 1.0 wt% as in the popping rocks19 and 0.5 wt% H2O, which is in the upper range of the MORB average (0.28 ± 0.24 wt% H2O; ref. 30). As erupted melts are largely degassed, reconstituting their volatile concentrations was necessary. Moreover, we extended our previous study on kimberlites31 to 1,580 °C, using a 1,400 °C experimental melt31 derived from a starting bulk composition with 7.5 wt% CO2 and 3.5 wt% H2O (JER1555).

All starting compositions were mixed by weight from previously dried chemicals, that is, SiO2, TiO2, Cr2O3, NiO, MgO, Al2O3, MnO and Na2SiO3, and from synthetic leucite, wollastonite, apatite and fayalite. All iron was present as FeII in the starting material. H2O and CO2 were introduced as Mg(OH)2, synthetic CaCO3 and natural magnesite. Powders were mixed in an agate mortar and homogenized in alcohol in a planetary mill. The starting materials were then kept in a desiccator and again dried at 110 °C before use.

The starting melt compositions were iteratively equilibrated with a four-phase lherzolite (olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and garnet) modelled after peridotite KLB-1. Capsules were loaded either in a sandwich configuration with the melt placed in between two layers of synthetic powders representing mantle peridotite or as homogeneous mixtures of both components. Multiple iterations were necessary to (1) saturate the melt in all four lherzolite mantle phases and (2) to obtain large melt pools rather than interstitial melts (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for back-scattered electron images of the experiments). Melts rich in CO2 + H2O rarely quench into glass but rather form intergrown crystallites, requiring measurement areas larger than the crystallites to ensure accurate melt compositions. To address these challenges, subequal melt/peridotite starting proportions are required, and a suite of 13 and 11 experiments were conducted on the MORB and OIB compositions, respectively, to obtain equilibrium melt compositions at 1,420 °C, 1,480 °C and 1,630 °C (7 GPa). During these iterations, the peridotite component was adjusted by modifying the relative proportions of olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and garnet, counteracting complete dissolution of any single mineral. Simultaneously, the melt composition was progressively refined (MBB → MORB2 → MORB10 and APB → OIB5 → OIB11; Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1) until saturation in all four mantle minerals was reached and mineral compositions closely resembled those found in the mantle. A further experiment was run on a kimberlitic composition at 1,580 °C, which is complemented by the 1,400 °C melt composition previously obtained for kimberlites using a similar method31.

The CO2 + H2O-bearing melts quench into a mixture of clinopyroxene, calcite and Na-rich interstitial carbonate-rich material and some interstitial voids, well observable (see detailed images in Supplementary Fig. 1). When left in the open, this quench material grows whiskers of several mm length within hours or days, leading to the destruction of the experimental charge. Thus, all preparation of the experimental run products was done minimizing the presence of humidity and avoiding water. Samples were exclusively handled in a purpose-built glove box that maintains a <2% relative humidity environment. Grinding and polishing were achieved using first dry SiC abrasive paper and then dry diamond powder. The very final polish was done using kerosene, after which samples were immediately coated and loaded either into the scanning electron microscope (for first imaging) or electron microprobe (for element quantification). Immediately after measurement, samples were impregnated with an epoxy droplet, protecting them from humidity. For any re-measurement, the polishing procedure was then repeated.

To measure melt compositions, large melt pools are required. The low-viscosity melts migrate into the warmest part of the capsule, such that they form a girdle or belt in the equatorial region of the capsule or, when melt fractions are large, the crystals are found in an hour-glass-shaped zone at the colder ends of the capsule. These textures resulted irrespective of whether a homogeneous mix or a layered melt-peridotite starting configuration was used.

Melt interstitial to equilibrium minerals quenches into a combination of growth rims on equilibrium silicate minerals and sparitic intergrowth, leading to an overestimation of carbonate content when measuring the interstitial quench crystallites only. Large melt pools quench to fine-grained (with crystallites of typically 3–30 μm) or even glassy quench textures in their centre, and the margins of the melt pool develop coarse quench with abundant voids between the larger quench crystals (typically 50–150 μm). Whenever possible, we thus measured the fine quench. Experiments without any melt pools were discarded. Supplementary Fig. 1 provides an overview of the entire capsule for each experiment (polished to the centre axis, oriented E–W in the images) and detailed images of the quenched melt and the mineral-rich region.

Mineral and melt compositions were measured with a JEOL JXA-8230 electron microprobe equipped with five wavelength-dispersive spectrometers and one energy-dispersive spectrometer. For minerals, 15 kV and 20 nA and a focused beam were used. For melt analyses, a maximum size defocused electron beam (20 μm) and 4 nA beam current were used. Most mineral and melt compositions were averaged from 5 to 25 measurements (Supplementary Table 3). Calibration standards included albite (Si and Na), anorthite (Al and Ca), forsterite (Mg), fayalite (Fe), synthetic rutile (Ti), chromite (Cr), microcline (K), synthetic pyrolusite (Mn), synthetic bunsenite (Ni) and apatite (P). Furthermore, natural hornblende and basaltic glass standards were used to monitor the accuracy of the calibration.

Melt compositions are given as measured by electron microprobe in Supplementary Table 2. CO2 and H2O cannot be directly measured in the quenched melt, and, despite completely water-free preparation of the experimental charges, measured alkali concentrations in the melt fall 20–50% below the values expected from mass balance. Thus, CO2, H2O, Na2O and K2O concentrations in the melt were determined from mass balance. Using the perfect incompatibility of CO2, H2O and K2O, we calculate their contents in the melt using, for example, CO2melt = CO2bulk/melt fraction. For Na2O, compatible in clinopyroxene and present in minor amounts in garnet, the mineral Na concentrations were considered when mass balancing for Na2Omelt. This approach yields experimental melt alkali contents, from which we determined DNacpx/melt. Using this partition coefficient, we then calculated the Na2Omelt that would be in equilibrium with a lherzolitic clinopyroxene containing, on average, 1.27 wt% Na2O (ref. 55), thus simulating the incipient melts as they would occur in fertile mantle (Table 1; original measurements in Supplementary Table 2). In general, CO2 and H2O estimates from mass balance closely match those derived from the difference-to-100 method from electron probe microanalysis, with discrepancies mostly within ±2 wt%. Discrepancies up to −5 wt% were encountered when either the melt quench was relatively coarse-grained or quite porous, or the surface was irregular—all factors leading to lower microprobe totals. Finally, the mass balance assumes a closed system, although some leakage of hydrogen through the capsule walls is possible. Nevertheless, this leakage leads to a net Fe oxidation and hence increase of XMg in all phases, which is not observed. We thus posit that hydrogen loss is minor.

The experimental melts are compared with 747 primitive OIB compositions selected from the GEOROC (Geochemistry of Rocks of the Oceans and Continents) database, using 0.65 < XMg < 0.75 and 200–700 ppm Ni as main criteria56, singling out the rejuvenated (n = 123) and the shield stages of Hawaii (n = 225). For the starting material, an average was taken from the 13 ocean islands, which have >10 primitive melt compositions, excluding the tholeiitic shield stage of Hawaii. The MORB starting composition represents a composite average using analyses with XMg > 0.6 from the largest available MORB compilation57, corrected for equilibrium with mantle olivine of XMg = 0.89 by stepwise addition of olivine (MBB). In detail, the fine-tuning of the initial starting compositions is inconsequential, as these compositions were equilibrated with the four-phase mantle lherzolite—that is, they adjust themselves to equilibrium with the peridotitic mantle. Yet, the closer the starting material to the equilibrium melt composition, the fewer iterations are required.

Kimberlitic rocks do not represent melt compositions, but the product of low-degree asthenospheric mantle melting, lithospheric contamination, degassing and alteration on emplacement, the latter two removing almost all Na2O (refs. 36,41). The kimberlite fields in Figs. 1 and 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1 are derived from a compilation of coherent kimberlites58. We use the 50% envelope of the kernel density distribution of these data to exclude the most altered and modified samples.

Apart from our own experimental data, we plot the volatile-free peridotite melts at 1 GPa (refs. 59,60) (MgO/CaO ≈ 1) and at 3 GPa (ref. 26) (MgO/CaO > 1.5) to degrees of melting at which clinopyroxene melts out, which exceeds by far the degrees of melting relevant for OIBs and MORBs (Fig. 1).

We model the evolution of the 7 GPa OIB-type melts to the characteristic asthenosphere–lithosphere boundary (LAB) depth of about 90 km (ref. 39) for oceanic crust aged >120 Ma (as, for example, applicable to Hawaii, the western Pacific, Cape Verde and the Canary Islands). For a potential temperature TP of 1,560 °C, representing plumes with 200 °C excess temperature, we start with the 1,630 °C OIB melt with 7.3 wt% CO2 (corresponding to about 1.5 wt% melting) and model melt evolution to a melt fraction of 10 wt%, as estimated for the Hawaiian shield stage61. This increase would reduce CO2melt to about 1 wt%, consistent with the upper bound found in Hawaiian shield melt inclusions62. For comparatively cooler plumes (for example, Cape Verde and Canary) with a TP of 1,350 °C, we model the evolution of the 7 GPa, 1,420 °C OIB-type melt with 15.4 wt% CO2 (corresponding to about 0.5 wt% melting) to a melt fraction of 4 wt%, based on CO2 contents of 3–5 wt% in primitive melts of these hotspots29,63.

For a TP of 1,560 °C, we apply the melting equations and mineral compositions for dry peridotite melting26 obtained at similar temperatures, which are, for melt fractions ≤10% (in wt units): 26 olivine + 50 clinopyroxene + 24 garnet = 100 melt (7 GPa) and 7 olivine + 68 clinopyroxene + 25 garnet = 84 melt + 16 orthopyroxene (3 GPa).

Using these equations for our moderately volatile case is justified as CO2 and K2O in the melt remain fully incompatible from 7 GPa to 3 GPa. Na2Omelt concentrations are calculated using melt–clinopyroxene partitioning, with adjustments at melt fractions >4% for the decreasing Na2Ocpx. For a TP of 1,350 °C, we use the same melting equations, as no others are available, but mineral compositions as adequate for 1,420–1,350 °C, 7–3 GPa (this study; refs. 21,64). The results are aggregate melts that approximate the evolution of redox melts in the asthenospheric melting column from 7 GPa to an LAB at 3 GPa.

As melt fraction increases continuously from the depth of redox melting to the base of the lithosphere, we linearly combine the two melting reactions to reach 10 wt% and 4 wt% melt, respectively, calculating melt compositions stepwise in 0.01% increments. This approach is justified because melt compositions and melting reactions must evolve continuously with depth. In the absence of more information, a linear combination remains the best approximation.

Clinopyroxene Ca contents are a considerable uncertainty as the conditions for a TP of 1,350 °C straddle the flat pigeonite–high-Ca clinopyroxene saddle on the pyroxene miscibility gap. We therefore use different CaO contents of 13–16.5 wt% in clinopyroxene for 7–3 GPa (this study; refs. 21,64), producing a range of model melt compositions diverging in CaO and MgO/CaO (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1).

The green field represents the redox melts formed at 7 GPa, i.e. ca. 230 km depth. Melt evolution with decreasing pressure is modeled to 3 GPa (grey lines ending in a star) via stepwise equilibration with ambient mantle using appropriate melting reactions26 and mantle mineral compositions (see Methods). The open star represents the expected increase in the degree of melting at 3 GPa to ≈10% at a TP of 1560 oC (as likely for the shield stage of Hawaii) and to 4% for a TP of 1350 oC (as characteristic for the Cape Verde and Canary hot spots). Tick marks are 1 and 0.5 % melting increments, respectively. Volatile-free experimental peridotite melts at 1-4 GPa (crosses, for details see Methods) are also plotted. The dotted curve labelled ‘cpx' marks clinopyroxene exhaustion at melting degrees of 20–25%, much higher than permissible for any OIB composition. A comparison to primitive (XMg > 0.65) OIBs worldwide (pale green circles), including primitive rejuvenated (blue) and shield stage (orange) Hawaiian lavas, shows that the natural OIB melts can neither stem from low pressure nor dry melting, but require high-pressure CO2-rich kimberlitic melts that evolve through porous reactive flow to the asthenosphere-lithosphere boundary. For reference, high-Mg MORBs (XMg > 0.6, black circles) are also plotted57. Note that kimberlites do not preserve magmatic Na2O contents36, reconstructed values are in the order of 3-5 wt%54. For further explanation see also main Figs. 1 and 2 and Methods.

Civil engineer Zheng Hehui invented Lego-like blocks, used in the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge pylons, as part of his practical PhD.Credit: Cynthia Lee/Alamy

Last month, Zheng Hehui gave an oral defence of his PhD in civil engineering at Southeast University in Nanjing, China. But Zheng had not written a thesis. Instead, he talked about a product he had developed: a set of Lego-like blocks, made with reinforced steel, that fit together to form a bridge pylon.

Zheng is among the first cohort of Chinese doctoral students to be assessed on the basis of practical achievements that lead to new products, techniques, projects and installations. His invention is being used in a huge cable-stayed rail and road bridge built across the Yangtze River.

Since September, at least 11 such ‘practical PhD' students, all engineers, have obtained their doctoral degrees through this route. Their work includes the development and application of a welding technique and its equipment, and the creation of a fire-fighting system for a large seaplane. Universities in other countries offer ‘industrial PhDs', where students work closely with a company, but many of these degrees still require a written thesis. 

Practical PhDs are part of the Chinese government's broader education reforms, which started in 2010, to cultivate ‘elite engineers' that can help boost innovation in the country. In 2022, the government instructed top-tier universities to team up with major companies to set up graduate colleges for engineers.

A law passed in 2024 allows universities to let master's and PhD students graduate on the basis of practical achievements. At present, only students in engineering-related subjects are eligible for this no-thesis arrangement.

This alternative degree-granting model is important and urgently needed, says Guo Tong, a civil engineer at Southeast University. “[It] can guide students to carry out real research that can solve real-life problems in those industries that carry strategic importance or have technological choke points in China.”

For Li Jiang, an information scientist at Nanjing University, the new evaluation model addresses a problem that has dogged the education of engineers: “There is a big gap between the theoretical knowledge they learn from books and the hands-on ability our society needs from them.”

Candidates for the practical PhDs have to make prototypes and prove that their inventions can be used in real-life and at scale, according to Sun Yutao, who researches innovation policy at Dalian University of Technology in Dalian, China.

The programme is part of China's effort to build a talent pool for key and emerging industries, such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors, to drive innovation, Zhu Xiumei, a deputy director at the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said at a press conference in December. 

Over the past three years, 50 graduate colleges for engineers have been established in China to bring the policy into practice. Students at these colleges work with two supervisors simultaneously: one with an academic background, the other with solid practical experience. During oral examinations, they are evaluated by a panel comprising both scholars and practising engineers.

“Many engineering professors in Chinese universities have always been academics and never worked in the industry. That is why it is important to pair them up with experts from the industry to teach those PhDs,” Li says.

Tsinghua University, for example, has partnered with 56 companies in 14 key sectors over the past three years, its vice-president Wu Huaqiang said at the press conference. Under the programme, the university has recruited 1,430 graduate students, who have solved many industrial problems and received more than 100 patents, Wu said.

Some of the universities offering the programme have courses with strong links to national defence. One, Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xi'an, is working with 16 major Chinese groups, including China North Industries Group, which makes weapons and military equipment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How iPhones Made a Surprising Comeback in China","https://www.wired.com/story/how-iphones-made-a-surprising-comeback-in-china/","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

After a prolonged slump, Apple's business is suddenly thriving again in China. The tech giant said in its latest earnings report last week that revenue from the country rose 38 percent year over year in the last quarter, primarily driven by surging demand for iPhones. The rebound came after Apple's China sales had declined for 18 consecutive months between 2024 and early 2025.

In a call with analysts, CEO Tim Cook said Apple set a new record for iPhone upgrades among Chinese customers and saw double-digit growth in the number of users switching from other operating systems to iOS. “Overall, a great quarter in China. We could not be happier with it,” Cook concluded in his signature monotone voice.

Apple's fantastic performance came as a surprise to many observers of the Chinese smartphone market. In recent years, homegrown brands like Huawei and Xiaomi have chipped away at Apple's market share by releasing premium, feature-packed devices that directly compete with the iPhone. Huawei, for instance, stunned the tech industry when it released a $2,800 smartphone with a trifold screen in September 2024, long before competitors put out similar products.

The most striking thing about Apple's comeback in China is how it pulled it off. Instead of trying to compete by developing flashier tech, it simply released a new iPhone that is both powerful and competitively priced, experts tell WIRED. Even though there are devices from local brands that technically have better cameras and more sophisticated artificial intelligence capabilities (Apple Intelligence is not yet available in mainland China), many buyers still opted for Apple's iPhone 17 line.

That suggests Chinese consumers continue to care more about Apple's brand power and design features than marginal technical improvements. “It's a good story if you're Apple. It's the same old story if you're not Apple,” says Gerrit Schneemann, a senior analyst covering Apple at Counterpoint, a global technology research firm.

Apple owes much of its success in China last quarter to sales of the baseline iPhone 17 model. Traditionally, consumers who buy iPhones at launch tend to gravitate toward the higher-end Pro and Pro Max devices But in 2025, the baseline iPhone 17 represented a much bigger step up from the iPhone 16 than usual, including features traditionally only associated with the Pro series. That may have motivated more people to upgrade sooner than usual after the new phones came out, Schneemann says.

But Apple's product strategy wasn't the only important factor here. The iPhone 17 was priced low enough to qualify for a massive electronics subsidy program launched by the Chinese government last year. To help stimulate the economy, Beijing spent some $43 billion subsidizing domestic purchases of electronics, appliances, and cars in 2025. Smartphones sold for less than 6,000 RMB (about $860) were eligible for up to a 15 percent discount. Apple listed the iPhone 17 in China for 5,999 RMB, ensuring price-sensitive buyers would be able to benefit from the government policy.

The state subsidy also arrived at a moment when many Chinese iPhone users were likely due for an upgrade anyway. “Apple's last peak sales period came with the iPhone 13 series, and after a span of three to four years, its existing users have gradually entered the upgrade cycle this year,” says Arthur Guo, a Beijing-based research manager at IDC, a global market analysis firm.

None of these explanations indicate that Apple's Chinese competitors are doing anything wrong. Guo notes that domestic brands have also experienced significant growth recently. Expensive flagship models from brands like Xiaomi, Vivo, and Oppo have “remained strong across the board—with even more notable growth recorded for the higher-priced Pro/Pro Max variants,” Guo says.

The only exception is Huawei, which lost out on sales during much of the last quarter after releasing its flagship phone later than usual, at the end of November. Initial supply shortages also limited availability of the device. Huawei is Apple's most formidable competitor in the high-end Chinese market, and its absence almost certainly contributed to Apple's win.

Apple's growth in China mirrors its success in other parts of the world. The company's share of the US smartphone market rose to 69 percent last quarter, a record high, according to a market analysis published by Counterpoint on Monday. As the smartphone industry heads into a potentially tumultuous period caused by a shortage of memory chips, Apple is setting itself up for a smoother 2026 than its rivals.

Apple's recent track record in China offers a bitter lesson for Chinese competitors: Despite all the rhetoric about supporting domestic brands and their increasingly impressive phone models, Chinese shoppers are sticking with Apple. The Chinese tech giants may have folding phones and fancy AI, but all it took for Apple to regain its momentum was to upgrade the iPhone's screen display and make some other relatively small tweaks. “I'm not too sure how somebody like Oppo or Vivo or Xiaomi can break that kind of stranglehold,” says Schneemann.

An insurrectionist robot unleashed by a mad inventor in Fritz Lang's Metropolis. HAL 9000 sabotaging a manned mission to Jupiter in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Skynet, the self-aware global defense network that seeks to exterminate humanity throughout the Terminator franchise.

Hollywood has never wanted for audacious depictions of artificial intelligence or the ways in which it could alter the fate of our species. But the rapid integration of AI into the studio system and our now unavoidable interactions with it have severely compromised the genre, not to mention film as a medium.

On the one hand, it's perfectly understandable that screenwriters and studios would return to the subject of AI in recent years, particularly since it provokes such fierce debate within the industry. (A major cause of the 2023 labor strikes was the threat that AI posed to creative jobs.) Still, the novelty faded fast.

Consider M3GAN, a campy horror flick about an artificially intelligent doll who starts killing people, released just a week after the debut of ChatGPT in 2022: It was a surprise box-office smash. Last year's sequel? A critical and commercial flop. Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning (2023) introduced a rogue AI called The Entity as a final adversary for Ethan Hunt and crew. The resolution of its cliff-hanger ending and blockbuster finale for the spy saga, Mission: Impossible—The Final Reckoning (2025), underperformed its predecessor, and neither quite justified their expense.

The latest AI-themed bomb is Mercy, a crime thriller starring Chris Pratt as an LAPD detective strapped into a chair who has 90 minutes to pull enough evidence from security cameras and phone records to convince a stern judge bot (Rebecca Ferguson) that he didn't kill his wife—or else face instant execution. Despite releasing in January, one reviewer has already declared it “the worst movie of 2026,” and judging by its mediocre ticket sales, many US moviegoers decided as much from the trailer alone. It's almost as if nobody cared whether a fictional software program might be capable of sparing a life when real health insurance claims are being denied by algorithms already.

For those few who did see it, Mercy fell far short of its dystopian premise, failing to grapple with the ethics of such a surveillance state and its medieval-modern justice system in favor of cheap relativism. Spoiler: Pratt's character and the AI ultimately team up to stop the real bad guys as the bot begins to show signs of unrobotic emotion and doubt, which manifest as glitches in the program. By the end, Pratt is delivering a true groaner of a we're-not-so-different speech to the holographic Ferguson. “Human or AI, we all make mistakes,” he says. “And we learn.”

While the naive belief in AI's progress toward enlightenment feels dated on arrival, you are also reminded of how prophetically cynical something like Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop, now almost 40 years old, was in addressing a future of cybernetic fascism. Contrary to that kind of pitch-black, violent satire, the current trend seems to be propagandistic narratives about how AIs are scary at first but secretly good. (See also: Tron: Ares, Disney's wildly misguided attempt to leverage an old IP for the era of large language models, another cinematic train wreck of 2025.)

In fact, the insistence on some inborn value or honor to artificial intelligence may be the driving force behind the new Time Studios web series On This Day…1776. Conceived as a blow-by-blow account of the year the American colonies declared independence from the British crown, it consists of short YouTube videos generated in part by Google DeepMind (though actual actors supply voiceovers). The project has drawn serious attention and scorn because acclaimed director Darren Aronofsky served as executive producer via his creative studio Primordial Soup, launched last year in a partnership with Google to explore the applications of AI in filmmaking. It probably doesn't help that Aronofsky and company are valorizing the country's founders in the same aesthetic that has defined the authoritarian meme culture of Donald Trump's second term.

The YouTube replies are, to put it lightly, brutal. “If I was a professional director and I released this I would be suicidal,” reads a top-voted comment on the first installment. “Pure dogshit,” another person observed. Time Studios limited engagement to channel subscribers only; some commenters claimed they had subscribed simply to condemn the “slop” they were looking at. In addition to the uncanny faces and dead glossy eyes of the founding fathers, viewers noted constant quick cuts, presumably meant to limit visual errors. Yet, when called upon to render a historic document for a scene, DeepMind rendered the word “America” as “Aamereedd.”

Audiences have proven equally hostile to digitally altered versions of existing entertainment. On social media, at least, you won't find many defenders of a certain nostalgia-baiting Xfinity commercial directed by Taika Waititi and scheduled to air during the Super Bowl this weekend. That's because it creepily de-ages Jurassic Park stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum, all for a sequence of gags about the dinosaur zoo-resort functioning perfectly thanks to a solid Wi-Fi signal. In the grotesque close-ups, they're barely recognizable.

The irony of appropriating a film that was technologically astounding for its time and adding a layer of ugly deepfakery is hard to miss. The ad was also made possible through extreme media and telecom consolidation, as Xfinity is a division of the multinational conglomerate Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, which owns Jurassic Park as well as NBC, which is broadcasting the Super Bowl. The result is a necrotic ode to brand synergy. Wisely, Xfinity has not allowed any comments whatsoever on the YouTube upload of the commercial, though the reactions elsewhere have not been enthusiastic. “That ‘de-aging' technology just makes them look like melting wax figures,” wrote a horrified user on X, where breathless hype for visual effects achieved with generative AI is usually plentiful.

The entertainment world can't move as quickly as Silicon Valley startups or the public perception of smart appliances and virtual assistants. Nevertheless, Hollywood could soon notice an AI backlash that hurts its bottom line so long as studios are pushing it as both a half-baked dramatic theme and a transformative tool.

Thread is a protocol designed to connect smart home devices in a wireless mesh network. It works much like Wi-Fi but requires less power. With Thread, devices from any manufacturer can create a separate low-latency mesh and share encrypted data. Thread enables supported devices to connect and speak to each other without any configuration or management on your part, and it works locally without going back and forth to the cloud.

You can use various application layers on top of Thread, including Matter. I go into more detail about the unifying smart home standard in my Matter guide. If you're setting up a smart home, you'll likely run into terms like “Thread” and “Matter” now that the technologies are baked into more and more products. Here's what you need to know.

Thread is a way for smart home gadgets to connect and share data. It is a low-power, low-latency, low-bandwidth alternative to Wi-Fi. Thread is especially important for small gadgets like water leak detectors, motion sensors, smart locks, smart shades, and smart bulbs. Think devices that only need to connect intermittently and have limited power and bandwidth needs.

Based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.15.4 radio technology on the 2.4-GHz spectrum, Thread is designed to connect low-power devices to a Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN). Thread works in much the same way as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (Wi-Fi is IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth is IEEE 802.15.1). Several protocols are based on the same IEEE 802.15.4 tech, including Zigbee, WirelessHART, MiWi, and a few others.

While Thread enables supported devices to form a mesh, you need a Thread Border Router to connect that mesh to your Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or any other home network. Without this connection, the Thread mesh is closed and cannot connect to the internet. Most Thread Border Routers are also Matter controllers, and you have multiple Thread Border Routers in your setup. Here are some of your options:

Originally developed by Nest (before the Google acquisition), Thread has existed since 2011. Devised as a power-efficient mesh networking technology for internet-of-things (IoT) products, Thread gathered pace after the 2014 formation of the Thread Group, which develops the technology and drives its adoption as an industry standard. Founding members like ARM, Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm have been joined by Apple, Amazon, and many other big companies over the years.

The Thread specification is available for free, but there is an end-user license agreement (EULA) for adopters. Thread has evolved, with new versions and features rolling out every couple of years. New versions are backward compatible, so new devices can work alongside older ones. Sometimes older Thread devices can be upgraded to the latest version, but not always.

The latest version, Thread 1.4, landed in 2024, bringing credential sharing, which allows for networks formed in different ecosystems (such as Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa) and different Thread Border Routers to form one big mesh, instead of several separate meshes. Unfortunately, although the Thread 1.4 specification is available, it takes a while for manufacturers to adopt it and go through certification.

To learn more about Thread, check out the official Thread Group website.

Thread is what enables devices to connect to each other, and Matter is the language they use to communicate. Thread actually supports various application layers, like Matter, that sit on top. It can even support multiple application layers simultaneously. Matter uses Thread, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet for device connectivity. If the device is battery-powered and bandwidth requirements are low, it will pick Thread. For high-bandwidth and always-on (plugged-in) devices (like security cameras), it will choose Wi-Fi. Matter also uses Bluetooth LE for the initial setup of some devices. You can find out more in my Matter guide.

Zigbee has been around longer than Thread and is based on the same wireless technology. It can also create robust mesh networks, features secure encryption, and is great for low-power devices. Because Zigbee has its own application and network layers, it requires a proprietary hub that acts as a gateway for connections, whereas Thread is IPv6, so it can seamlessly integrate with existing IP-based networks through any Thread Border Router. Thread is also lower latency than Zigbee, so smart home devices respond more quickly.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","I Didn't Care for Dildos Until I Tried This One From Lelo","https://www.wired.com/story/i-didnt-care-for-dildos-until-i-tried-this-one-from-lelo/","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 09:00:00 GMT","

My first sex toy was a bright blue dildo. I was about 19, and as a college student in New Hampshire, I did what anyone in my position would do: hotfooted it to the closest city to find a sex shop. With my best friend in tow, I jetted in and out of the Condom World on Newbury Street so fast that I only had time to grab the first sex toy I saw and pay for it, keeping my head down the whole time. To say the early 2000s were different when it came to sex toy acceptance would be a gross understatement.

In my small-town mind, they were something that shouldn't be discussed and the very definition of the word taboo. But they weren't taboo enough to keep me from buying that battery-operated blue monstrosity with its exaggerated veins and head. I was embarrassed by it from day one, even more so after I used it, with zero understanding of what I was supposed to get out of it.

As I got to know my body better, exploring on my own or during partnered sex, with other toys I purchased, I came to a realization. As much as I love penetration with my partner(s), I didn't particularly enjoy dildos. I found most impersonal, poorly designed, and because it wouldn't be until my late 30s that I'd finally have an orgasm from G-spot simulation, on a pleasure level, they weren't for me. This didn't stop me from trying to get something out of them, especially as I started writing about sexual wellness and suddenly had a world of sex toys and the newest innovations at the tip of my fingers.

My feelings on dildos changed drastically with the Lelo Gigi 3. Finally, an internal dildo with a head that was flattened, as opposed to cone-shaped, meaning it covered more of the G-spot area. Breaking news, that's exactly what I needed after all this time. While so many other dildos have rounded heads, which many people love, the flat head of the Gigi 3 is what really sets it apart.

It's not just the shape of the head, but the way it disperses stimulation. Because the eight vibration modes are delivered through the flattened head, the sensations are more intense and rumbly, meaning I can feel them branching out and reaching more nerve endings. People with vulvas are far too often taught that when it comes to sexual pleasure, the focus should be on the clitoris or the G-spot—or both at once—but the reality is that the entire region is chock-full of nerve endings. Hence, the reason people with vulvas can experience orgasms outside these two zones, like via the A-spot (anterior fornix) and the U-spot (urethral sponge).

I'm not a size queen. I'm the first to admit that smaller is better when it comes to external vibrators. However, when it comes to internal vibrators, the size and shape of the shaft matter. The Gigi 3 is the ideal size for G-spot stimulation. Even those who have yet to officially find their G-spot can't possibly miss it when using the Gigi 3 because the length and slight arc of the shaft puts that flattened head exactly where every person with a vulva wants it. For me, I love to put a few drops of water-based lube on the head and shaft of the Gigi 3, get myself comfy, then slide it inside. From there, I can melt into the moment without fumbling with buttons (the Gigi 3 is app-controlled).

When I'm not in the mood for internal play, the flat head of the Gigi 3 is great for direct clitoral stimulation or teasing other parts of my vulva. As I've learned, just because the labia doesn't have as many nerve endings as the clitoris doesn't mean it likes to be ignored.

Is the Lelo Gigi 3 my favorite sex toy? No. Depending on the day and my mood, my favorite sex toys and vibrators change. But, if you're someone with a vulva who has never liked dildos, the Gigi 3 could be your ticket to sexual pleasure. It could also hit the spot if you prefer clitoral stimulation, but want the vibrations to encompass more than just the external tip of the clit. Although the Gigi 3 can be used anywhere, internally and externally, if you have a vulva, this is a must-have.

After using the Galaxy XR for about 2 weeks, it quickly became evident that Samsung built the device to make premium mixed reality feel less like a tech demo and more like a product you can live with.

It aims to deliver the core promise of XR in a practical way. You get big screens wherever you want them, a flexible workspace without physical monitors, and a strong entertainment experience that feels private and immersive.

The question is not whether the Galaxy XR is impressive, but whether it fits into everyday life often enough to justify the cost, setup, and friction of wearing it.

At its best, Galaxy XR sells a new kind of convenience. It lets you create a large-screen experience without owning one, and it enables you to place multiple windows around you without buying a multi-monitor setup. These are clear benefits for travelers, small-space households, and people who like to move between rooms.

It also appeals to anyone who wants more screen without more clutter. This pitch is easy to understand, which is a big deal for mainstream adoption.

Mainstream users will not tolerate discomfort. If a headset feels heavy, presses on the face, or gets hot quickly, it becomes something you use occasionally rather than daily.

Galaxy XR moves the ball forward with a lighter, better-balanced feel than earlier premium headsets. You can wear it longer without feeling like you are fighting the device. Still, it remains a headset, and even a good one can cause pressure points over time, especially if you wear glasses or you move around a lot.

The Samsung Galaxy XR headset weighs 545 grams, plus a 302-gram external battery, while the Apple Vision Pro headset weighs 600 to 650 grams (Apple also lists 750 to 800 grams depending on configuration and accessories), plus a 353-gram external battery.

The Galaxy XR shines when you treat it like a private cinema and a floating monitor wall.



The text looks sharp enough to work in documents and to browse the web without squinting. Movies and shows feel large and vivid, making a tablet feel small.

This capability is the closest thing the product has to a universal wow moment because it is instantly understandable. Most people can try it once and immediately get why “a big screen anywhere” has appeal.

Mixed reality is only practical if you can still exist in your room. You want to see your coffee, check your phone, glance at a door, and talk to someone without feeling disoriented.

Galaxy XR's passthrough is good enough to support that kind of normal behavior. It does not feel like natural vision, but it feels functional and stable most of the time.

The remaining friction is that the real world still feels mediated by cameras, and that subtle layer can fatigue some users during long sessions.

Galaxy XR leans on hand tracking, eye tracking, and voice, and when everything clicks, it feels elegant. You look where you want to interact, make a simple gesture, and keep moving.

Mainstream users have very low tolerance for input mistakes. A missed gesture, a selection that lands on the wrong icon, or a cursor that feels imprecise can quickly break trust.

Samsung offers controllers as an option, and that matters because controllers still deliver the most reliable precision for games and other tasks that require accuracy. The trade-off is obvious. If most people end up relying on controllers, the headset feels less effortless and more like a specialized device.



The Galaxy XR benefits from running a wide range of familiar apps. That helps avoid the empty platform problem that has killed many new device categories. Even so, the difference between “apps that run” and “apps that shine” is huge.

Mainstream users do not just want phone-style apps floating in front of them. They want experiences that feel designed for the headset, with layouts, controls, and workflows that make use of the available space. Galaxy XR is moving toward that, but the category still needs more software that makes you think, I cannot go back to a flat screen after this.

Even Apple has not been able to conjure up a comparable killer must-have VisiCalc or Lotus 1-2-3 app that had users and businesses busting down computer store doors for the Apple II or IBM PC during the 1980s.

Samsung positions AI as a core part of the experience, making it one of the more credible mainstream arguments for XR.

A good assistant can reduce friction. It can help you find things, summarize information, launch tasks, and navigate without a maze of menus. The best version of this feels like you have a helpful guide sitting beside you, not another feature you have to learn.

The challenge is that most people already have AI on their phones. For the headset to matter, AI inside XR has to feel meaningfully more useful because it is contextual and hands-free, not just because it is present.

At $1,799, priced $1,700 less than the Apple Vision Pro, the Galaxy XR includes an external battery pack, which keeps the headset lighter while adding one more thing to manage.

In practice, it changes how people use the device. You plan sessions rather than living in it all day. You charge more often than you'd like. You become aware of cables, pockets, and placement, which is not how mainstream devices typically work.

None of this is a deal-breaker for enthusiasts, but it is a real barrier to adoption for everyday buyers who want frictionless convenience.

From a performance perspective, I wasn't able to run benchmark tests against the original Apple Vision Pro, which I've had for over a year, but I don't think the Galaxy XR will have any difficulty running XR apps in the Google Android store.

Galaxy XR undercuts the premium leader on price (Apple's Vision Pro is $3,499), and that matters because the category needs a more accessible entry point.

Yet mainstream shoppers still compare it to everything else they could buy. A great TV, a new laptop, a tablet, a phone upgrade, or simply keeping the money.

A headset also competes with the comfort of habits people already like. Watching TV on a couch is easy. Working on a laptop is familiar. A headset must deliver a clearly better outcome, not just a different one.

Galaxy XR feels most compelling for a few types of mainstream buyers:

For those users, the headset can feel like a practical luxury rather than a gimmick.

Galaxy XR can be a great alternative to Apple Vision Pro in the ways that matter most on paper. It comes in at a better price point. It can feel lighter and easier to wear for longer sessions. It can also make sense for people who do not want to depend on an iPhone or a MacBook to unlock the full value of the experience.

Those are real advantages, and they make Galaxy XR easier to recommend than many premium headsets that came before it.

Yet the bigger question is not whether Galaxy XR beats another headset. It's whether XR has found a strong enough mainstream pull to generate excitement.

Outside of a private theater experience and a floating multi-monitor workspace, how many everyday routines become genuinely better? How many routines become better enough that people want to put a headset on after dinner instead of picking up their phone or turning on the TV?

Galaxy XR proves the hardware can be excellent. The next step for the category is to demonstrate that everyday usage models are essential, not merely impressive.

That remains the quandary for both Apple and Samsung in their attempts to make the XR category something more than just another pricey gadget.

The 12s have long been celebrated in the Pacific Northwest for their vocal support of the Seattle Seahawks. Could those fans also band together as a collective ownership force?

That's the vision of Arrived, a Seattle-based tech startup that is typically associated with helping everyday investors gain a stake in rental homes.

After a week in which reports made a sale of the Seahawks seem especially imminent, and just days before the team competes in its fourth Super Bowl, Arrived launched a new initiative to gauge fan interest in participating in the next potential ownership group. Fans can use the website, which is not affiliated with the Seahawks or NFL, to share their hypothetical investment amount and learn more.  

The company's idea is buoyed by a 2024 move by NFL owners that allows private equity funds to buy stakes in teams. Arrived would act as such a fund.

“We built our [home] platform around a $100 minimum investment and making that very accessible. We'd love to do the same with this,” Arrived co-founder and CEO Ryan Frazier told GeekWire.

Arrived would put together a special purpose investment vehicle where it would collect fan investment through its platform and then serve as a single private equity investor in the Seahawks.

Frazier pictures bringing together 100,000 or more fans to help Arrived's fund get closer to a stake of between 3% and 10% — especially considering rising franchise values and the expectation that the Seahawks could fetch as much as $8 billion.

“These teams' valuations are so high, there's so few people that can actually step up and acquire these teams,” Frazier said. “I really see this model working well where there's a lead owner and then other minority investors that can help provide a more stable capital base.”

Frazier has been aware for years of the wishes of late Seahawks owner and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen when it comes to selling the team, as has been done with other Allen assets. But reports from ESPN and The Wall Street Journal last weekend claimed that a sale could happen sooner rather than later. Allen's estate, chaired his sister Jody Allen, denied that a sale would be put in motion soon after Super Bowl LX.

“I think we definitely felt the sense of urgency this week with some of the news breaking about the imminent potential for sale,” Frazier said. “Seeing Jody Allen speaking to how she thinks about the importance of the team to the fans of the city, we felt like maybe this is something that she would be supportive of as well.”

Although a different model, the NFL's Green Bay Packers are the only major professional sports team in the U.S. owned by the community rather than a single billionaire or corporate entity. Established as a publicly held, non-profit corporation in 1923, the team is currently owned by over 538,000 shareholders who collectively hold more than 5 million shares. The shares do not pay dividends, cannot be traded for profit, and provide no equity interest.

Private equity owners that take stakes in NFL franchises aren't allowed to have voting power. NFL.com columnist Judy Battista noted in 2024 that “it is not going to be like flipping real estate.”

“We'd want the shares to be participating in appreciation alongside other shareholders,” Frazier said. “We see this as an equity stake and getting exposure to value growth.”

Three teams — the Bills, Dolphins and Chargers — have added private equity investors so far.

Frazier said it's inevitable that the model will spread as team valuations continue to grow across sports leagues and there's a greater need for minority investors. If the plan with the Seahawks doesn't pan out, he can see Arrived trying it elsewhere.

Frazier, who came to Seattle from Arkansas in 2014, and Arrived co-founder Alejandro Chouza, who came from Mexico around 2010, both moved during a surge in success and popularity for the Seahawks. Like homegrown and transplant 12s across the city and region, they've become obsessive fans, and they want to know what it feels like to have even a fraction of a stake in owning the team.

“You see these people, we bleed in and out every day for these teams, because it's so exciting,” Chouza said. “There would be nothing better, even if it's 50 bucks, if I had a tiny sliver, and my son had a tiny sliver of a team — that's priceless.”

Founded in 2019, Arrived (formerly Arrived Homes) lets people buy fractional shares of single-family rental homes and vacation rentals for as little as $100. It's pitched as an alternative way to gain exposure to real estate without taking on a full mortgage or managing a property.

The company identifies and acquires rental properties, then handles financing, renovations, property management and tenant relationships. Investors can buy shares in individual homes or pooled funds through the Arrived website. They earn quarterly dividends from rent plus a share of any appreciation when the property is sold after a multi-year holding period.

Nearly 1 million registered investors have invested more than $375 million on the Arrived platform. The company says it has distributed more than $63 million and funded more than 550 properties across 65 markets in the U.S.

Arrived raised $27 million in new funding last November and $25 million in a Series A round in 2022. The company, which employs 51, declined to share its current valuation.

The startup's leadership includes Frazier (formerly with Simply Measured and Sprout Social); Chouza, the COO (Oyo and Uber); and CTO Kenny Cason (Simply Measured).

Investors include Neo, Forerunner Ventures, Bezos Expeditions, Core, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Match Group CEO Spencer Rascoff, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi.

ElevenLabs co-founder and CEO Mati Staniszewski says voice is becoming the next major interface for AI – the way people will increasingly interact with machines as models move beyond text and screens.

Speaking at Web Summit in Doha, Staniszewski told TechCrunch voice models like those developed by ElevenLabs have recently moved beyond simply mimicking human speech — including emotion and intonation – to working in tandem with the reasoning capabilities of large language models. The result, he argued, is a shift in how people interact with technology. 

In the years ahead, he said, “hopefully all our phones will go back in our pockets, and we can immerse ourselves in the real world around us, with voice as the mechanism that controls technology.”

That vision fueled ElevenLabs's $500 million raise this week at an $11 billion valuation, and it is increasingly shared across the AI industry. OpenAI and Google have both made voice a central focus of their next-generation models, while Apple appears to be quietly building voice-adjacent, always-on technologies through acquisitions like Q.ai. As AI spreads into wearables, cars, and other new hardware, control is becoming less about tapping screens and more about speaking, making voice a key battleground for the next phase of AI development. 

Iconiq Capital general partner Seth Pierrepont echoed that view onstage at Web Summit, arguing that while screens will continue to matter for gaming and entertainment, traditional input methods like keyboards are starting to feel “outdated.”

And as AI systems become more agentic, Pierrepont said, the interaction itself will also change, with models gaining guardrails, integrations, and context needed to respond with less explicit prompting from users. 

Staniszewski pointed to that agentic shift as one of the biggest changes underway. Rather than spelling out every instruction, he said future voice systems will increasingly rely on persistent memory and context built up over time, making interactions feel more natural and requiring less effort from users. 

That evolution, he added, will influence how voice models are deployed. While high-quality audio models have largely lived in the cloud, Staniszewski said ElevenLabs is working toward a hybrid approach that blends cloud and on-device processing — a move aimed at supporting new hardware, including headphones and other wearables, where voice becomes a constant companion rather than a feature you decide when to engage with. 

ElevenLabs is already partnering with Meta to bring its voice technology to products including Instagram and Horizon Worlds, the company's virtual reality platform. Staniszewski said he would also be open to working with Meta on its Ray-Ban smart glasses as voice-driven interfaces expand into new form factors. 

But as voice becomes more persistent and embedded in everyday hardware, it opens the door to serious concerns around privacy, surveillance, and how much personal data voice-based systems will store as they move closer to users' daily lives — something companies like Google have already been accused of abusing.

While Spotify users face yet another price hike, book lovers have some exciting developments to look forward to that could help cushion the blow.

Spotify announced several updates for its audiobook business on Thursday, notably its expansion into physical books. Users in the U.S. and the UK will soon be able to purchase physical copies of their favorite audiobooks directly through the app, marking a significant pivot for the once digital-only platform. 

The company also introduced two features designed to make the audiobook experience smoother and more flexible, including a new tool called “Page Match” that lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook. 

Additionally, “Audiobook Recaps”—a previously iOS-only feature—is coming to Android devices in the spring. This feature provides bite-sized recaps tailored to the last section users stopped listening to.

​Spotify's decision to sell physical books through its app positions it as a competitor to major booksellers, including Amazon and Barnes & Noble. The company also recognizes that many readers still value physical books, and by offering both print and digital formats, Spotify is trying to turn itself into a one-stop shop for book lovers. 

Spotify has partnered with Bookshop.org on the new offering, an online marketplace that supports local, independent bookstores. This partnership is great news for indie booksellers, as every purchase made via Spotify will directly benefit local book communities. Spotify then earns an affiliate fee on sales. 

The ability to purchase physical books will roll out this spring and appear on audiobook pages in the app as a button labeled “Add to your bookshelf at home.” Clicking it takes users to Bookshop's website, which handles the pricing, inventory, and shipping.

To bridge the gap between formats, Spotify is also launching a feature called Page Match, which is currently available to premium subscribers and will roll out to all audiobook users by late February. The feature was initially spotted by Android Authority last month. 

Spotify's new Page Match feature lets users scan a page from a physical or e-book using their phone camera. The tool analyzes the page content and directs users to the exact spot in the audiobook. It's powered by a combination of Spotify's in-house and third-party computer vision and image scanning technologies.

When users want to switch to the audiobook, they can select the “Scan to Listen” button and click the “Scan to Read” button to return to the physical book, making it easy for users to pick up where they left off, whether they're reading at home or switching to audio while on the go.

Page Match is currently available for most English-language titles, with plans for future expansion. There are now more than 500,000 titles on the platform.

In the two years since Spotify first introduced audiobooks, the platform has experienced significant growth. The company reported in October that the number of users listening to audiobooks rose 36% over the past year, and listening hours increased 37%. Plus, more than half of Spotify's 281 million premium subscribers have engaged with an audiobook.

Spotify is expected to release its fourth-quarter earnings results February 10.

A data breach at government technology giant Conduent appears to affect far more people than first disclosed, with the number of victims potentially stretching to dozens of millions of people across the United States.

The January 2025 ransomware attack, which knocked out Conduent's operations for several days, is now known to affect at least 15.4 million people in Texas alone, accounting for about half of the state's population. Conduent said in October that 4 million people across the state were affected.

Another 10.5 million people are affected across Oregon, per the state's attorney general. 

Conduent has also notified hundreds of thousands of people across Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and other states, according to data breach notifications seen by TechCrunch.

The stolen data includes individuals' names, Social Security numbers, medical data and health insurance information.

One of the largest government contractors today, Conduent handles and processes large amounts of personal and sensitive information on behalf of large corporations, government departments, and several U.S. states. The company says its technology and operational support services reach more than 100 million people in the United States across various government healthcare programs.

When contacted with several questions about the data breach, Conduent spokesperson Sean Collins provided a boilerplate statement that did not address the questions, nor did they answer if Conduent knows how many individuals are affected by the cyberattack. The spokesperson would not say if the breach affects more than 100 million people.

Collins said that the company has been working to “conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information” taken in the breach, but would not say how many data breach notifications the company has sent out to date.

Little else is known about the breach, and the company has disclosed few details. Conduent disclosed the cyberattack in April, months after hackers knocked out the company's systems, which resulted in outages to government services across the United States.

The Safeway ransomware gang took credit for the breach, claiming to have stolen over 8 terabytes of data.

In a later SEC filing, the company said that the stolen data sets “contained a significant number of individuals' personal information associated with our clients' end-users,” referring to its corporate and government customers.

Conduent also said it is continuing to notify individuals whose data was stolen in the breach, and plans to conclude alerting individuals by early 2026. The company did not give a more specific timeline.

Newsletter platform Substack has confirmed a data breach in an email to users. The company said that in October, an “unauthorized third party” accessed user data, including email addresses, phone numbers, and other unspecified “internal metadata.” 

Substack specified that more sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, passwords, and other financial information, was unaffected.

In an email sent to users, Substack chief executive Chris Best said that the company identified the issue in February that allowed someone to access its systems. Best said that the company has fixed the problem and started an investigation.

“I'm reaching out to let you know about a security incident that resulted in the email address and phone number from your Substack account being shared without your permission,” said Best in the email to users. “I'm incredibly sorry this happened. We take our responsibility to protect your data and your privacy seriously, and we came up short here.”

It's not clear what exactly the issue was with its systems, and the scope of the data that was accessed. It's also not yet known why the company took five months to detect the breach, or if the company was contacted by hackers demanding a ransom. TechCrunch asked the company for more details, and we will update our story if we hear back.

Substack did not say how many users are affected. The company said that it doesn't have any evidence that users' data is being misused, but did not say what technical means, such as logs, it has to detect evidence of abuse. However, the company asked users to take caution with emails and texts without any particular indicators or direction.

On its website, Substack says that its site has more than 50 million active subscriptions, including 5 million paid subscriptions — a milestone it reached last March. In July 2025, the company raised $100 million in Series C funding led by BOND and The Chernin Group (TCG) with participation from a16z, Klutch Sports Group CEO Rich Paul, and Skims co-founder Jens Grede.

An AI lab called Fundamental emerged from stealth on Thursday, offering a new foundation model to solve an old problem: how to draw insights from the huge quantities of structured data produced by enterprises. By combining the old systems of predictive AI with more contemporary tools, the company believes it can reshape how large enterprises analyze their data.

“While LLMs have been great at working with unstructured data, like text, audio, video, and code, they don't work well with structured data like tables,” CEO Jeremy Fraenkel told TechCrunch. “With our model Nexus, we have built the best foundation model to handle that type of data.”

The idea has already drawn significant interest from investors. The company is emerging from stealth with $255 million in funding at a $1.2 billion valuation. The bulk of it comes from the recent $225 million Series A round led by Oak HC/FT, Valor Equity Partners, Battery Ventures, and Salesforce Ventures; Hetz Ventures also participated in the Series A, with angel funding from Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Brex co-founder Henrique Dubugras, and Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel.

Called a Large Tabular Model (LTM) rather than a Large Language Model (LLM), Fundamental's Nexus breaks from contemporary AI practices in a number of significant ways. The model is deterministic — that is, it will give the same answer every time it is asked a given question — and doesn't rely on the transformer architecture that defines models from most contemporary AI labs. Fundamental calls it a foundation model because it goes through the normal steps of pre-training and fine-tuning, but the result is something profoundly different from what a client would get when partnering with OpenAI or Anthropic.

Those differences are important because Fundamental is chasing a use-case where contemporary AI models often falter. Because Transformer-based AI models can only process data that's within their context window, they often have trouble reasoning over extremely large datasets — analyzing a spreadsheet with billions of rows, for instance. But that kind of enormous structured dataset is common within large enterprises, creating a significant opportunity for models that can handle the scale.

As Fraenkel sees it, that's a huge opportunity for Fundamental. Using Nexus, the company can bring contemporary techniques to Big Data analysis, offering something more powerful and flexible than the algorithms that are currently in use.

“You can now have one model across all of your use cases, so you can now expand massively the number of use cases that you tackle,” he told TechCrunch. “And on each one of those use cases, you get better performance than what you would otherwise be able to do with an army of data scientists.”

That promise has already brought in a number of high-profile contracts, including seven-figure contracts with Fortune 100 clients. The company has also entered into a strategic partnership with AWS that will allow AWS users to deploy Nexus directly from existing instances.

They had a talented team of developers who were mostly Mac experts and just starting to get a grip on Windows.I was known at the time as a ""Windows expert"", so they hired me to help the team get the Windows version into shape.My typical day started with ""house calls"". People would ping me with their Windows questions and I'd go door to door to help solve them - and to make sure they understood how to do things on Windows.In the afternoon, I would work on my own code, but I told everyone they could always call on me for help with a Windows problem, any time of day.One colleague asked me: ""Mike, how can you afford to be so generous with your time?""Then in a performance review, I got this feedback:""Mike, we're worried. Your productivity has been OK lately, but not great. And it's surprising, because the productivity of the rest of the team has improved a lot during this time.""I bit my tongue, but in retrospect I should have said:""Isn't that what you hired me for?""

I, too, teach a lot in my position and mentor ~half-dozen younger people at a time. I do not work for a ""cutthroat culture"" company, thankfully! All of my protégés have moved from Production Support roles into SRE roles in the past 3 years.My 36 years of experience allows me to see things someone with far less will not, or cannot yet see. My XP is valued.I hold monthly SRE Learning sessions where I demonstrate SRE-centric solutions using Python and other tooling. I teach brand new developers what it is to be on a development team and how to function more efficiently on a day-to-day basis. I also got invited to sit in on our company's AI Dev Assist working group after they saw the prompts I was writing and using to implement new and maintain existing systems.I must also mention that, early on, I won a company trivia contest at my company that included 1,400 participants, and 15 questions where speed mattered. After that, I got a lot of respect from the younger crowd. ;)If you are practicing ageism in your hiring practices, then maybe you are interviewing the wrong older persons.We mature (<-key word!) folks have a lot to offer back - you just need to be capable of seeing that in the one you are interviewing. Beware the Grousing Grey Beards!

I am in my 50's and I think the biggest discrimination I notice is not specifically age-related but cost-related. I am very expensive, a recent grad is not. Lots of companies think (some are right) that they can do well with the recent grads and are unwilling to shell out what it costs to hire me.

In 2022, I interviewed with a company... in crypto.I was the oldest in the company by a decade at least. They kept telling me they wanted experience. I have plenty, of experience. I was cautiously optimistic.They eventually failed me on a test of reactJS. The funniest part was when I asked for feedback, the reason they gave me, were showing poor engineering technique on their end; a lack of understanding of what makes it down the wire.So they wanted experience, but not the experience that prevents them from making mistakes of their own; not an experience that threatened their views. I realised this later. Young rock-star developers want experienced people around them, maybe, but they want to be free to reinvent the wheel on a whim.Now when I interview some place and I eerily feel old, I just bow out respectfully. No point wasting everyone's time.

I was especially annoyed by recruiters that couldn't do math. They loved all my experience, but ghosted me, as soon as they realized it came with gray hair. I guess the place is crawling with 35-year-olds with 30 years of experience.As it turned out, I ended up giving up, and just retiring. I had the means, but wanted to keep working for at least another decade. I really enjoyed adding value. I was especially interested in helping small companies get on their feet, as my particular skillset would have been almost ideal for that, and my “nest egg” gave me a pretty good risk tolerance, along with a willingness to take a lower base.Turns out that these were the exact companies that didn't want me, though.Also turned out that I really loved being retired. I have been doing more work in the last eight years, than in a couple of decades previously. I just don't get paid for it, and I'm fine with that. In fact, I actively resist pursuing a paycheck, as I don't want to deal with knuckleheads, anymore.I just had to have my hand forced. I would not have voluntarily done this.

Having experience usually means that you've acquired a holistic view of software development.  Usually the hard way.
But they want solutions, not advice or opinions.I've met a few devs that makes a living like that. Get in, solve problems. Keep quiet. Get out. Wait for them to call back in a couple of years.

Ironically, the only people who have social permission to do that are extremely expensive Big Name outside consultants. Who will then do one of two things: either speak to the staff, collate what they have to say, and launder it back to the boss; or produce a thinly veiled adaptation of whatever business book the CEO last read in an airport.

reply

Usually those kind of companies won't hire old employees, while at the same time will gladly pay for consulting knowledge to solve their problems.Also while product companies tend to hire folks that the very last thing they worked on checks all bullet points on the HR job ad, agencies will gladly throw people at a problem regardless of the skills list, as long as the team learns to swimm fast enough.

I did a few years at a company which was ""product development consultancy"", and this aspect of it was really enjoyable. We got a set of diverse challenges through the door, often ""virtual startups"" (CEO hiring consultants rather than staff in order to do v1 of a product). The company was basically a single room, and we had two senior guys (the founders) to review work and support us. Plus one ""smartest guy in the room"" who served as mathematician fire-support for things like signal processing or the rare actual DS&A problem.

reply

Also the bit about companies with more older workers performing better, and the bit about older people often losing jobs due to layoffs, sound like they could also fit together as high firm performance permitting long tenure rather than having to show only that experienced employees cause higher firm performance (although of course the examples demonstrate the latter via other means, so it can't be that it doesn't happen at all).

Being older is just part of the formula. Being good is another part, and having a good relationship with the company and coworkers, is just as important. That comes from longevity in the job, and also, a sense of security.Companies love to have workers that are constantly afraid they'll lose their jobs. That doesn't really encourage a productive, quality-focused mindset.There's a lot of negative stuff, said about older employees. Maybe some of it is true, but I suspect that a lot of it, is an inevitable response to years of being treated like shit.

Nevermind that work has become significantly more precarious, the cost of living higher, the wages lower.Ageism is just a dick move in general.  It's gotten to the point where job candidates in their 30s and early 40s are dropping work history and education to appear as if they're in their 20s to potential employers - and even considering plastic surgery[1].  It's gotten completely out of control, but I'm quite glad to see more of my peers and younger colleagues taking a firm stance against it in any form.As long as the work gets done, everything else is irrelevant.

It's also self-defeating. Yes, there are greybeards who are stuck in their ways and refuse to learn anything new. But more often than not, the greybeards are super good team members in ways that the younger employees can't hope to compete with, because all that experience has taught them a ton about what works and what doesn't. But rather than trying to harness that valuable knowledge, companies shoot themselves in the foot by ignoring it. It's ridiculous.

Those domain experts were working with young dumbasses who would burn 60+ hour weeks to make sales deadlines and keep current with ever shifting platform tech that breaks all the time.  SMEs baked into the core development loop, DDD-made-flesh essentially, with cheaper more junior devs supporting scale for less money and maximizing the SMEs vision/contributions.It's an obvious and effective strategy. I'd speculate the management skills it takes to setup are what keep it as a rarity.

I think the idea of making physical workplaces better accessible for older people also benefits the young as well. So many companies just assume “oh hey our factory workers/laborers are strong dudes they can handle XYZ repetitive task no problem.”But really, you're just making everyone less productive.I also think that companies underestimate the quality loss they get when they refuse to cultivate an environment that employees who have the wisdom of older age and perhaps more options to go elsewhere will tolerate.9/9/6 burnout shops chase away families with kids and older employees who know the value of time and bias themselves toward inexperience, working harder not smarter, and a general lack of diversity in life experience.

For example, I spent the better half of a Sunday making my Nespresso machine easier to use. I moved the pods from a zipped bag in a drawer to a 3D-printed holder on the side of the cabinet. I made a similar holder for some disposable coffee cups. Unsurprisingly, now I finally use the machine I paid good money for. Yet, my family recoiled. “You're so lazy you can't just open the drawer?”, and other similar sentiments were repeated.Life is about friction and incentives. Make the good things easier to do (put vegetables in nice containers in an easy-to-see part of the fridge) and the bad things harder to do (charge your phone in another room to avoid using it in bed).This is all to say, however much willpower you think you have in a day, you have less than that. And you should spend your time building a life where the tired, exhausted version of you can do great things. The same applies to businesses. Design a business effectively, and lazy/tired/stressed employees will still be able to contribute.

I started using Typst instead of Pandoc Markdown->LaTeX->PDF recently. I had a reluctance to change because I didn't really see the point, it looked like Markdown, and who cares if Typst compiles faster, how much time is really spent compiling? I had a watch script set up to start recompiling on a change and it worked well enough.But eventually I decided to give it a try, and it sort of changed my entire perspective.  Large LaTeX compilations could take upwards a minute, which doesn't sound that long, but similar documents could compile in milliseconds, from scratch, and it also supports incremental compilation.  It was categorically faster and it wasn't really any harder than Markdown and if you use the Latin Modern font it doesn't look significantly different than LaTeX. [1]Suddenly I found myself experimenting with and tuning my formatting way more than I did with LaTeX.  I make my documents look nicer, make sure that the spacing look nicer, have better-placed page breaks, move text around more frequently to make my writing flow a bit nicer and better.  I keep Evince open to the right, tmux with Neovim and `typst watch` on the left and my changes automatically load instantly, and as such I end up making my documents nicer.I still use LaTeX for stuff that has a lot of math formatting, but for everything else I use Typst and I find myself doing a lot more as a result.[1] Before you say ""Use MS Word or LibreOffice"", yeah you're not necessarily wrong but I really hate ""hidden formatting"" that you get with rich text. Also I almost never like the way that documents end up looking with MS Word.

You can teach things to an unexperienced person, but you cannot unteach an experienced person. What experience an older person has greatly varies, and this experience could be very useful or useless, depending on what the person has done in life.Unfortunately there is one experience/wisdom which almost all people learn with age, and that is being a knave. Just as our bodies and our minds generally deteriorate with age, so does the soul and the moral fibre - unfortunately. People seem to think that they have to fight the younger generations with deceit and manipulation. And employers aren't too keen to deal with such persons.But things might also be changing. The people aging right now are of a higher quality than the current generation of old.Also, many times your best employees will be old people. But they're harder to find.

They're also as I understand it, used to handle things like sending everyone voter IDs for elections in advance; this is how the government knows who to send the voting cards to.Bafflingly, the US does NOT have a national identification method that works like this. There's no country-wide identity document that provides the same assurances. As a result, most US entities (government branches & corporations) have settled on a ""closest possible""... which is the social security number. A number that's used to identify every person with attachment to the US in some form since social security is something every US citizen has to interact with. (It also includes a ton of non-citizens since as I understand it, social security is something foreign workers also have to interact with, but that's besides the point.) It's a 9 character long numeric string that identifies you as a person... and has almost no revocation mechanism, even if it ends up in a data breach.Yet in spite of this, it's still used as a country-wide ID mechanism for a lot of different things and replacing it with a proper ID mechanism has as I understand it (not American) very poor support as it's a culture war issue.

SSA told the court that all DOGE access to personally identifiable information (PII) was revoked by March 24, 2025.That turned out to be false: a DOGE member ran PII searches the morning of March 24, stopping only around 9:30 a.m.; access was not fully cut until about noon.2) Sent SSA data to a DOGE official outside SSA.On March 3, 2025, an SSA DOGE member emailed an encrypted file believed to contain names and addresses of ~1,000 people to Steve Davis, a senior advisor to the U.S. DOGE organization (and a DOL employee).The file likely contained data derived from SSA systems of record.It is unknown whether Davis received the password or accessed it.3) Was given PII access during the TRO even though this was barred.One DOGE member was granted access to 10 PII databases from March 26 to April 2 (never used, but still improper).Another received a call-center profile that could access PII from April 9 to June 11; whether PII was viewed is unknown.4) Had broader systems access than the court was told.
SSA discovered additional access that had not been disclosed earlier, including:Systems containing SSA employee records.Systems controlling building/IT badge access.Shared workspaces that could pool sensitive data.A data-visualization tool that could reach PII.Additional data-warehouse schemas.5) Engaged in partisan election-related work inside SSA.In March 2025, a political advocacy group asked two DOGE members to analyze state voter rolls to try to overturn election results.One DOGE member signed a “Voter Data Agreement” as an SSA employee with that group on March 24, without agency approval.SSA later referred this conduct to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel for possible Hatch Act violations.6) Used an unapproved third-party server to share SSA data.From March 7–17, 2025, DOGE members used Cloudflare links to transfer data.Cloudflare is not authorized for SSA data storage; SSA still does not know what data were sent or whether it remains on that server.

it seems conventional wisdom (for good or bad) would say 32"" at 1440p isn't that great for productivity and one wants a full 4k monitor at that size for productivity use, and 8k at 85"" would be about the same pixel density of 1440p at 32""

I agree, but that is still the case here. The difference is that the ""full picture"" no longer occupies the whole monitor.The amount of windows and content you arrange on a normal office monitor is about one third of my available space. I can arrange my windows in that space and not have to move my neck.But at a glance, I can also see the contents of 4 other code files in my project that are also visible, as well as my notes, the documentation, the team chat.Or if I want, I can also see twice the amount of code in any file by having my editor take up the full height of the center third of this monitor.Basically the monitor goes from being the ""full picture"" to a canvas where you are free to create any collection of a ""full picture"" you want, and you can have the leftover building blocks visible on the sides, optionally.I am sure that if you let all knowledge workers in the world test this setup for a day, a vast majority of them would want to keep it. But since even 8k tv's are going away now, most will never know.Curved gaming monitors costing more than my TV are being deployed everywhere lately, for productivity work. Most people are used to 27"" or 24"" low-res monitors and they are getting an upgrade, but i's not a very good one.Had the panels from 8k tv's been used in monitors and marketed to corporations it would have been so much better!Perfect for open offices too - no need for desk dividers if everyone is behind a huge screen! ;-)

Of these I think Windows has the best solution with a utility called Fancyzones (part of a collection called Powertoys). I can define areas of any size and shape and easily move windows around so they occupy the defined spaces.In Linux I have used KDE, which has at least one similar mechanism which works fine too, but was more trickly to set up and configure.Lately I have also been running hyprland more often and the setup actually works well with a tiling WM. You can tile many times before the windows get too small to be useable!One thing worth mentioning is that it's kinda tricky to get 8k/60hz working under linux since the TV only does HDMI. I tried several 8k DP to HDMI adapters before I found one that worked. Windows and Mac work fine with a normal 8k HDMI cable.On the mac I just use manual window management, since most of what I do on the mac tends to just use one main window anyway (garage band, lightroom, photoshop and such).

My 55 is borderline too big already, and the main issue is actually the height. Tilting your head or rolling your eyes back to see the top gets noticeably uncomfortable pretty quickly.I made a special mount so the lower edge basically rests on the desk surface which basically solved that issue, but I don't think I could have made it work if it was any bigger.Also at 65 the pixel density is much lower, so you'd probably want it mounted further away. But if you do, the monitor will cover the same FOV as a smaller monitor anyway.My dream is that someone starts making 8K 50"" monitors with displayport inputs (HDMI is a mess) and sells them for the same price as these tv's used to cost!

While the step from 1080p 1440p to 4K is a visible difference, I don't think going from 4K to 8K would be a visible since the pixels are already invisible at 4K.However the framerate drop would be very noticeable...OTOH, afaik for VR headsets you may want higher resolutions still due to the much larger field of vision

There was no hope of actual 8k gaming any time soon even before the AI bubble wrecked the PC hardware market.Attempting to render 33 million pixels per frame seems like utter madness, when 1080p is a mere 2 million, and Doom/Quake were great with just 64000. Lets have more frames instead?(Such a huge pixel count for movies while stuck at a ‘cinematic' 24fps, an extremely low temporal resolution, is even sillier)

reply

So anyone who wants only ""real frames"" (Non upscaled, non generated) will need to lower their settings or only play games a few years old. But I think this will be something that becomes so natural that no one even thinks about it. Disabling it will belike someone lowering AA settings or whatever. Something only done by very niche players, like the CS community does today where some are playing 4:3 screens, lowering AA settings for maximum visibility not fidelity and so on.

I even doubt that. My experience is, on a 65"" TV, 4K pixels become indistinguishable from 1080p beyond 3 meters. I even tested that with friends on the Mandalorian show, we couldn't tell 4K or 1080p apart. So I just don't bother with 4K anymore.Of course YMMV if you have a bigger screen, or a smaller room.

Without HDR the differences are negligible or imperceptible at a standard 10' viewing distance.I'll take it one step further: a well-mastered 1080p Blu-Ray beats 4K streaming hands down every time.

It really isn't.What you are likely seeing is HDR which is on most (but not all!) 4K content. The HDR is a separate layer and unrelated to the resolution.4K versions of films are usually newly restored with modern film scanning - as opposed to the aging masters created for the DVD era that were used to churn out 1st generation Blu-Rays.The difference between a 4K UHD without HDR and a 1080p Blu-Ray that was recently remastered in 4K from the same source is basically imperceptible from any reasonable viewing distance.The ""visible difference"" is mostly better source material, and HDR.Of course people will convince themselves what they are seeing justifies the cost of the upgrade, just like the $200 audiophile outlet and $350 gold-plated videophile Ethernet cable makes the audio and video really ""pop"".

Depending on whether you want a TV experience sitting further back or Cinema is coming Home as Sony's tag line. I believe there is room for something greater than 4K. Especially when TV industry trend suggest TV purchase size is increasing every year. 40"" used to be big, then it became entry level, now all top of the line TV dont even offer anything before 50"", and the median is moving closer to 65"". 
80""+ price will come down in the next 5 years as LCD takes over again from OLED. I dont understand why but also wont be surprised if median size move pass 70"".In 2015 I wrote on AVSforum how 8K makes zero sense from Codec, computation, network, transport and TV. However I would never imagine median TV size moved up so quickly, and also I cant see how we could afford 100""+ TV at the time. Turns out I am dead wrong. TCL / CSOT will produce its first 130"" TV in 2 years time. For those ultra wealthy they could afford 160"" to 220"" MicroLED made out of many panels. There will be 10% of population who could afford ultra large screen size. And I am sure there is a market for premium 4K + content.There is definitely a future with 4K+ content and panel. I just hope we dont give up too early.

The median (and roughly 99th percentile for that matter) TV as well as being 65"" is being used with Netflix et al. though, and that content already looks worse than you can buy on disc.8k doesn't need to wait for TV sizes any more, right, but now it needs to wait for home internet speeds (and streaming provider infrastructure/egress costs) for it to make sense.

I'm sure there's plenty of content (especially streaming content in mediocre bitrate) where people would be hard-pressed to tell the difference.But I think if people went back to 1080p _panels_; they'd actually rather quickly notice how much worse the text-rendering is, and that the UI looks off for them.Moving up to 8k would definitely be a smaller step-change in clarity than 1080p->4K and many people wouldn't feel it's worth spending extra; but I don't think it would be literally indistinguishable.

I mean my local cable TV is sending crap that's way worse than 720p YouTube videos and most people don't care at all.I guess the primary benefit of an 8k display is that stuck or dead pixels are much less annoying than on a 4k panel of the same size.I'm fine with 4k for my living room. Give me more HDR, less chroma subsampling and less banding.

It's good that we have better swapping now, but I wish they'd address the above. I'd rather have programs getting OOMKilled or throwing errors before the system grinds to a halt, where I can't even ssh in and run 'ps'.

An interactive system that does not interact (terminal not reactive, can't ssh in, screen does not refresh) is broken. I don't understand why this is not a kernel bug.On my system, to add insult to injury, when the system does come back twenty minutes later, I get a ""helpful"" pop-up from the Linux Kernel saying ""Memory Shortage Avoided"". Which is just plain wrong. The pop-up should say ""sorry, the kernel bricked your system for a solid twenty minutes for no good reason, please file a report"".

If the machine is swap trashing, all i/o goes to the same congested queue. .bash_history read or write access, memory allocation, stuff your terminal program does, stuff your wayland compositor or X11 stack does, bash accessing data in its memory that has been swapped out, etc etc. And each of those could be waiting for a while to issue their IO request since the IO system is flooded by swap IO.There should be a tool that can show the interdependent graph of pending, blocking io operations.

That'd require some new capabilities added, and some substantial shifts in how distro maintainers & users operate, so it's extremely unlikely. It's much closer to how things like Android operate, though still not quite as secure as giving each application its own user & dedicated storage for data.

systemd OOMScoreAdjust has existed for at least a decade. /proc/*/oom_adj since Linux kernel 2.6.11 - two decades. cgroups are also two decades old. SSH by default has OOMScoreAdjust=-1000 and is entirely protected from OOM.

To be honest I don't know why it's such an issue on Linux. Mac and Windows don't have this issue at all. Windows presumably because it doesn't over-commit memory. I'm not sure why Mac is so much better than Linux at memory management.My eventual solution was to just buy a PC with a ton of RAM (128 GB). Haven't had any hard reboots due to OOM since then!

edit: I wrote all this before realizing I overlooked that you answered it yourself, so below is my very elaborate explanation of what you said:> Windows presumably because it doesn't over-commit memory.I'm no expert but from what I've gathered this ultimately boils down to how Linux went with fork for multiprocessing, vs Windows focused on threads.With fork, you clone the process. Since it's a clone it gets a copy of all the memory of the parent process. To make fork faster and consume less physical memory, Linux went with copy-on-write for the process' memory. This avoids an expensive copy, and also avoids duplicating memory which will only be read.The downside is that Linux has no idea how much of the memory shared with the clone that the clone or the parent will modify after the fork call. If the clone just does a small job and exits quickly, neither it or the parent will modify a lot of pages, thus most of them are never actually copied. The fastest work is the work you never perform, so this is indeed fast.However, in some cases the clone is long-lived and thus a lot of memory might eventually end up getting copied. Well, Linux needs to back those copies with physical memory, and so if there's not enough physical memory around it has to evict something. While Linux scrambles to perform the copy, the process which triggers it has to wait.AFAIK one can configure Linux to reserve physical memory for a worst-case scenario where it has to copy all the cloned memory. However in almost all normal cases, this grossly overestimates the required memory and thus leads to swapping when technically it is not needed.On Windows this is very different. Instead of spawning a cloned process to do extra work, you spawn a thread. And all threads belonging to a process shares the same memory. Thus there is no need to clone memory, no need for the copy-on-write optimization, and thus Windows has much better knowledge about how much free physical memory it actually has to work with.Of course a thread on Windows can still allocate a huge amount of memory and trigger swapping that way, but Windows will never suddenly be in a situation where it then also needs to scramble to copy some shared pages.

To be fair, my Windows system grinds to a halt (not really, but it becomes very noticably less responsive in basically anything) when JetBrains is installing an update (mind you I only have SSDs with all JetBrains stuff being on an NVMe). I don't know what JetBrains is doing, but it consistently makes itself noticable when it is updating.

Linux doesn't have anything like that. KDE seems to have a somewhat functional Ctrl-alt-del menu - I have been able to access it when the rest of the shell gets screwed up (not due to OOM). But inexplicably the only options it has are Sleep, Restart, Shutdown or Log out!! Where is the ""emergency shell"", or ""process manager"" or even ""run a program""? Ridiculous.I think Linux GUIs often have this weird fetish with designing as if nothing will ever go wrong, which is clearly not how the real world works. Especially on Linux. I've genuinely heard people claim that most Linux users will never need to use a terminal for example.

Similarly, on a server where you might expect most of the physical memory to get used, it ends up being very important for stability. Think of VM or container hosts in particular.

Either you're going to never exhaust your system ram, so it doesn't matter, minimally exhaust it and swap in some peak load but at least nothing goes down, or exhaust it all and start having things get OOM'd which feels bad to me.Am I out of touch? Surely it's the children who are wrong.

There's a common rule of thumb that says you should have swap space equal to some multiple of your RAM.For instance, if I have 8 GB of RAM, people recommend adding 8 GB of swap. But since I like having plenty of memory, I install 16 GB of RAM instead—and yet, people still tell me to use swap. Why? At that point, I already have the same total memory as those with 8 GB of RAM and 8 GB of swap combined.Then, if I upgrade to 24 GB of RAM, the advice doesn't change—they still insist on enabling swap. I could install an absurd amount of RAM, and people would still tell me to set up swap space.It seems that for some, using swap has become dogma. I just don't see the reasoning. Memory is limited either way; whether it's RAM or RAM + swap, the total available space is what really matters. So why insist on swap for its own sake?

The proper rule of thumb is to make the swap large enough to keep all inactive anonymous pages after the workload has stabilized, but not too large to cause swap thrashing and a delayed OOM kill if a fast memory leak happens.

That rule came about when RAM was measured in a couple of MB rather than GB, and hasn't made sense for a long time in most circumstances (if you are paging our a few GB of stuff on spinning drives your system is likely to be stalling so hard due to disk thrashing that you hit the power switch, and on SSDs you are not-so-slowly killing them due to the excess writing).That doesn't mean it isn't still a good idea to have a little allocated just-in-case. And as RAM prices soar while IO throughput & latency are low, we may see larger Swap/RAM ratios being useful again as RAM sizes are constrained by working-sets aren't getting any smaller.In a theoretical ideal computer, which the actual designs we have are leaky-abstraction laden implementations of, things are the other way around: all the online storage is your active memory and RAM is just the first level of cache. That ideal hasn't historically ended up being what we have because the disparities in speed & latency between other online storage and RAM have been so high (several orders of magnitude), fast RAM has been volatile, and hardware & software designs or not stable & correct enough such that regular complete state resets are necessary.> Why? At that point, I already have the same total memory as those with 8 GB of RAM and 8 GB of swap combined.Because your need for fast immediate storage has increased, so 8-quick-8-slow is no longer sufficient. You are right in that this doesn't mean you need 16-quick-16-slow is sensible, and 128-quick-128-slow would be ridiculous. But no swap at all doesn't make sense either: on your machine imbued with silly amounts of RAM are you really going to miss a few GB of space allocated just-in-case? When it could be the difference between slower operation for a short while and some thing(s) getting OOM-killed?

You are of course highlighting the problem that virtual addressing was intended to over abstract memory resource usage, but it provides poor facilities for power users to finely prioritize memory usage.The example of this is game consoles, which didn't have this layer. Game writers had to reserve parts of ram fur specific uses.You can't do this easily in Linux afaik, because it is forcing the model upon you.

Cgroup limits and OOM scores allow to prioritize memory usage on a per-process and per-process group basis. madvise(2) syscall allows to prioritize memory usage within a process.

The reason you want swap is because everything in the Linux (and all of UNIX really) is written with virtual memory in mind. Everything from applications to schedulers will have that use case in mind. That's the short answer.Memory is expensive and storage is cheap. Even if you have 16 GB RAM in your box, and perhaps especially then, you will have some unused pages. Paging out those and utilizing more memory to buffer I/O will give you higher performance under most normal circumstances. So having a little bit of swap should help performance.For laptops hibernation can be useful too.

This has far worse degradation behavior than normal swapping of regular data pages. That at least gives you the breathing space to still schedule processes when under memory pressure, such as whichever OOM killer you favor.

The “paging space needs to be X*RAM” and “paging space needs to be RAM+Y” predate hibernate being a common thing (even a thing at all), with hibernate being an extra use for that paging space not the reason it is there in the first place. Some OSs have hibernate space allocated separately from paging/swap space.

You can ask your favourite search engine or language fabricator about the differences between RAM and disk storage, they will all tell you the same thing. Frankly, it's kind of astonishing that this needs to be explained on a site like HN.

It does note main differences (speed, latency, permanence). How does that limit what data disk can be used for?What would one use optane DIMMs for?Also, if my program requires  huge working set to process the data, why would I spend the effort and implement my own paging to templrary working files, instead of allocating ridiculous amount of memory and letting OS manage it for me? What is the benefit?

Note that simply buying more RAM than what you expect to use is not going to help. Going back to my post from earlier, I had a laptop with 8GB of RAM at a time where I would usually only need about 2-4GB of RAM for even relatively heavy usage. However, every once in a while, I would run something that would spike memory usage and make the system unresponsive. While I have much more than 8GB nowadays, I'm not convinced that it's enough to have completely outrun the risk of this sort of behaviour re-occuring.

Like always, the left's problem is that their proposed solutions read like they were written by teenagers, based on emotions and dismissive of the reasons why their supposed “enemies” disagree with them.Most Americans would support having ICE operate perhaps even entirely with nonlethal weapons. That would be a smart thing to push for! And popular too. But the party line is instead “Abolish ICE.” And of course nobody (who isn't pro-open-borders) trusts that there's any Democratic plan besides look-the-other-way and maybe amnesty.

This makes a great talking point, but those immigrants eventually assimilated into the culture, and also importantly, they were specifically allowed to come because the US needed more people in order to power its economy. The Chinese came to build the railroad, the Irish and Italians and Germans came over and worked in factories and as police and many other industries. This was badly needed 100 years ago.Today most illegal immigrants are uneducated and are either working in the unofficial economy or in service-sector jobs, which depresses wages for everyone with low education. We don't need every restaurant to have an unending stream of desperately poor would-be busboys and dishwashers, or for Uber to have a stream of poor drivers. Or for rich people to have an ample supply of housekeepers paid in cash. All that does is keep wages in the toilet for working people.But about open borders, why are so many Latin American countries such bad places to live that so many of their people want to come to the US? Open borders just means anyone can walk right in and bring all of their problems with them, not to mention their drug and human trafficking operations and the criminal gangs that operate them. We already have enough of that as it is.No Western country can stay civilized with open borders. Anyone with half a brain can see how it is going in the UK and France, where they are only a bit more ""open borders"" than the US has been. Thankfully for Americans, Latin-American culture is more compatible with Western culture than Islamic culture is.

This is completely orthogonal to the conversation, but I think you misunderstood that slogan. It does not mean “immigration rules must not be enforced”.It means differentiating between a potentially illegal action (illegal entry/overstaying) and the person itself. You never talk about an illegal driver, or an illegal drinker, but people talk about illegal immigrants, with the implication that the person itself is illegal.It's subtle but it's a step towards dehumanizing a person, or making infractions to their rights “count less” in the public eye.

Is it? I'm not aware of legislation introduced by the democrats, either when they were in power or today, that proposed anything resembling this. There are individual congresspeople calling for ICE to be abolished (which is not the same as having no immigration enforcement) but leadership within the democrats is very clear that they support extremely minor reforms like making ICE agents wear masks less frequently. This is considerably more minor than disarming ICE agents, which you claim would have nationwide support.

If I want what I believe is a reasonable policy and the enforcers of that policy start doing the worst job ever, it is my duty to call them out, not to call out the opposing side for mostly imaginary reasons.Abolish ICE is not a unreasonable take. If the agents working in this agency have become some ultra politicized paramilitary, it makes sense to abolish it and create a new agency altogether.

If the goal is to decrease money going into advertisement budgets, then the best thing you can do is buy store brand when possible.

Thankfully I don't live in the US and I don't work for anything even remotely related to this. I don't know if I would have the fortitude in the current US job market (based on what I read here) to threat the well being of the wife and daughter by taking principled stances.

If many were to sacrifice their morals out of financial pressure easily (the control over which is in increasingly few hands) the path the US is treading becomes pretty deterministic...

One of the reasons I chose to move to Europe is because I value the mininal safety nets and labor protections on this side of the pond. Yes, I make less money and pay more taxes but I believe this is how society should work, I reject the hyper individualism that ignores any sort of collective.But I am also not naive. Expecting individuals to take the burden for decisions way beyond their control is silly. It takes immense fortitude to threaten the well being of those dear to you based on principle, when the only outcome is your own suffering (the company will likely find another employee right away anyway).

It's an extremely unfair system based on coercion - you are beaten down into submission by the implicit threat that without work you won't be able to make ends meet.Maybe you have a family that can support you financially. Maybe you already own the place where you live and could save up money over an extended period that you can weather a storm. If you are in these situations, that's great, but it is also an extremely privileged position to be in.

At the time I was still paying rent and needed employment to keep my visa. I also had little savings, and an ill parent that depended on me. I certainly couldn't take the principled stance of ""fuck this, I'm out"".My point is that if you are in the position to take a principled stance, good for you. Maybe you already own your home, maybe you had time to accumulate savings, maybe you can do a few interviews and land a less evil job even in the current market (and perhaps a pay cut won't be a massive blow in you life). All that is awesome, but also a position of relative privilege.Prescribing principled stance as universal without recognizing this is just cruelty though.

None of the individual acts seem evil. Conducting a census isn't evil. Collating the data isn't evil. Arresting people with the wrong papers isn't necessarily evil. Driving a train isn't evil. Operating a switch isn't evil. Processing paperwork isn't evil.Look what's proposed now: Adtech has the data, this would feed into ICE systems leading to arrests, flights are conducted, and people get put into prison camps like CECOT where they have no recourse and where people are already talking about forced labor.So no, I'm not saying to these folks ""you're literally causing Auschwitz"". That's a famous Vernichtungslager, and that's not true yet.But people getting locked up in Concentrationslager or Arbeitslager (like historically : Mittelbau-Dora, Flossenbürg, Mauthausen, and Monowitz).  I think we're getting there.I guess the question is: at which point do you decide maybe to wear extra layers or skip a meal instead? We're not there yet. The chain has many links.

I reject that societal and systemic issues can be fixed by individual action, unless as an individual you are extremely powerful (and the ones that are typically are the ones causing the societal and systemic harm).As an common man you can do small things. Do a lousy job when processing the paperwork of evil. Malicious cooperation to the powers that be. Small acts of charity. That sort of thing.Systemic change can only be achieved through collective action. Easier said than done.The world is cursed. Life is tough even at the best of times. The system as it is ensures compliance through coercion and threats.I honestly believe we would agree more than disagree on the current state of things. I just reject the approach that individual action is a way out of this sort of mess.

No one becomes a cop because they want to be nice and help vulnerable people. Some might say they did but that is some coping technique. Being a cop involves exerting violence towards people who are vulnerable and desperate, and to become one you have to be fine with this. Some would say that this alone is enough to deem a person ethically dubious.Even if one would accept the premise that society requires some degree of organised violence towards its members, one would also have to handle the question of accountability. Reasonably this violence should be accountable in relation to the victims of it, and police institutions inherently are not.I think that we should also note that the other person above used ""childishly"" to denote something negative, apparently they don't think of kids as the light of the world and childish as something fun and inspiring. This is something that makes me quite suspicious of their morals.

Perhaps the conflict is that you just want to make people who work in ad tech feel bad, and don't care whether or not they enable ICE? That's fine, I suppose, there's industries I feel the same way about. But then we don't have much to talk about and I'm not sure what you hope to gain from being here. To me opposing ICE is very important - I think tobacco companies are pretty bad too, but if ICE sent out a request for cartons of cigarettes I'd shovel praise on them for declining.

Someone loses their Youtube account they built for years due to algorithm misfiring, someone loses their developer account on an App Store and can't even get a reason for it.The tech world is very used to operate in a fascist high efficiency environment that enshittifies everything that touches but keeps improving on some selected KPI.

People are banned, shadow banned or rate limited when don't behave or don't say the right stuff. Preserving order and increasing engagement is above everything, even those who claim that they came to make ""speech free again"" quickly turned into just changing what speech to be allowed.Anything controversial that is attracting negativity is hidden away unless it is feeding the narrative of the platform, then it is actively promoted.Therefore, I don't think that IT workers have any remorse or any problem with this new reality.

The recent tragedies are indeed thoroughly depressing for all of us, but we shouldn't let our emotional reactions destroy our ability to reason and think objectively about history and statistics. We can feel and think. Some of us believe enforcement of laws is the villain in this. Some feel the laws themselves or the idea of borders and sovereignty are to blame. Others that a surge of violent criminals such as those who killed Jocylan Nungary or Laken Riley is the cause of the recent tragedies. None of these views are inherently evil. All of these views have some merit. Truth is manifold. Don't be narrow minded, we need broad thinking not simplistic pathos driven dogmas and references to nazis. Grow up.

The many smaller, but in total larger donations given to Obama was contrasted with Hillary Clinton who had larger individual donations but less in total, and the commenters attributed this to the use of Facebook and finding and meeting a younger audience on those online platforms.People thought that targeted advertisement was a good thing and politicians looked on the techniques from that election and saw the potential for power. It was mostly just those privacy advocates, free software advocates and security experts that expressed doubt and warned about the dangers.

There has been a few news articles (and court cases) where this question has been raised and it is not strict true. Employee actions are only actions for which the employee has been given as an task as part of their employment and role. Actions outside of that is private actions. When this end up in court, the role description and employee contract becomes very important.A clear case example is when a doctor is looking up data on a patient. Downloading patient records from people who they are not the doctor for can be criminal and not just a breech of hospital policy, especially if they sell or transfer the data.

To some, METR's “time horizon plot” indicates that AI utopia—or apocalypse—is close at hand. The truth is more complicated.

MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more from the series here.

Every time OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic drops a new frontier large language model, the AI community holds its breath. It doesn't exhale until METR, an AI research nonprofit whose name stands for “Model Evaluation & Threat Research,” updates a now-iconic graph that has played a major role in the AI discourse since it was first released in March of last year. The graph suggests that certain AI capabilities are developing at an exponential rate, and more recent model releases have outperformed that already impressive trend.

That was certainly the case for Claude Opus 4.5, the latest version of Anthropic's most powerful model, which was released in late November. In December, METR announced that Opus 4.5 appeared to be capable of independently completing a task that would have taken a human about five hours—a vast improvement over what even the exponential trend would have predicted. One Anthropic safety researcher tweeted that he would change the direction of his research in light of those results; another employee at the company simply wrote, “mom come pick me up i'm scared.”

But the truth is more complicated than those dramatic responses would suggest. For one thing, METR's estimates of the abilities of specific models come with substantial error bars. As METR explicitly stated on X, Opus 4.5 might be able to regularly complete only tasks that take humans about two hours, or it might succeed on tasks that take humans as long as 20 hours. Given the uncertainties intrinsic to the method, it was impossible to know for sure. 

“There are a bunch of ways that people are reading too much into the graph,” says Sydney Von Arx, a member of METR's technical staff.

More fundamentally, the METR plot does not measure AI abilities writ large, nor does it claim to. In order to build the graph, METR tests the models primarily on coding tasks, evaluating the difficulty of each by measuring or estimating how long it takes humans to complete it—a metric that not everyone accepts. Claude Opus 4.5 might be able to complete certain tasks that take humans five hours, but that doesn't mean it's anywhere close to replacing a human worker.

METR was founded to assess the risks posed by frontier AI systems. Though it is best known for the exponential trend plot, it has also worked with AI companies to evaluate their systems in greater detail and published several other independent research projects, including a widely covered July 2025 study suggesting that AI coding assistants might actually be slowing software engineers down. 

But the exponential plot has made METR's reputation, and the organization appears to have a complicated relationship with that graph's often breathless reception. In January, Thomas Kwa, one of the lead authors on the paper that introduced it, wrote a blog post responding to some criticisms and making clear its limitations, and METR is currently working on a more extensive FAQ document. But Kwa isn't optimistic that these efforts will meaningfully shift the discourse. “I think the hype machine will basically, whatever we do, just strip out all the caveats,” he says.

Nevertheless, the METR team does think that the plot has something meaningful to say about the trajectory of AI progress. “You should absolutely not tie your life to this graph,” says Von Arx. “But also,” she adds, “I bet that this trend is gonna hold.”

Part of the trouble with the METR plot is that it's quite a bit more complicated than it looks. The x-axis is simple enough: It tracks the date when each model was released. But the y-axis is where things get tricky. It records each model's “time horizon,” an unusual metric that METR created—and that, according to Kwa and Von Arx, is frequently misunderstood.

To understand exactly what model time horizons are, it helps to know all the work that METR put into calculating them. First, the METR team assembled a collection of tasks ranging from quick multiple-choice questions to detailed coding challenges—all of which were somehow relevant to software engineering. Then they had human coders attempt most of those tasks and evaluated how long it took them to finish. In this way, they assigned the tasks a human baseline time. Some tasks took the experts mere seconds, whereas others required several hours.

When METR tested large language models on the task suite, they found that advanced models could complete the fast tasks with ease—but as the models attempted tasks that had taken humans more and more time to finish, their accuracy started to fall off. From a model's performance, the researchers calculated the point on the time scale of human tasks at which the model would complete about 50% of the tasks successfully. That point is the model's time horizon. 

All that detail is in the blog post and the academic paper that METR released along with the original time horizon plot. But the METR plot is frequently passed around on social media without this context, and so the true meaning of the time horizon metric can get lost in the shuffle. One common misapprehension is that the numbers on the plot's y-axis—around five hours for Claude Opus 4.5, for example—represent the length of time that the models can operate independently. They do not. They represent how long it takes humans to complete tasks that a model can successfully perform.  Kwa has seen this error so frequently that he made a point of correcting it at the very top of his recent blog post, and when asked what information he would add to the versions of the plot circulating online, he said he would include the word “human” whenever the task completion time was mentioned.

As complex and widely misinterpreted as the time horizon concept might be, it does make some basic sense: A model with a one-hour time horizon could automate some modest portions of a software engineer's job, whereas a model with a 40-hour horizon could potentially complete days of work on its own. But some experts question whether the amount of time that humans take on tasks is an effective metric for quantifying AI capabilities. “I don't think it's necessarily a given fact that because something takes longer, it's going to be a harder task,” says Inioluwa Deborah Raji, a PhD student at UC Berkeley who studies model evaluation. 

Von Arx says that she, too, was originally skeptical that time horizon was the right measure to use. What convinced her was seeing the results of her and her colleagues' analysis. When they calculated the 50% time horizon for all the major models available in early 2025 and then plotted each of them on the graph, they saw that the time horizons for the top-tier models were increasing over time—and, moreover, that the rate of advancement was speeding up. Every seven-ish months, the time horizon doubled, which means that the most advanced models could complete tasks that took humans nine seconds in mid 2020, 4 minutes in early 2023, and 40 minutes in late 2024. “I can do all the theorizing I want about whether or not it makes sense, but the trend is there,” Von Arx says.

It's this dramatic pattern that made the METR plot such a blockbuster. Many people learned about it when they read AI 2027, a viral sci-fi story cum quantitative forecast positing that superintelligent AI could wipe out humanity by 2030. The writers of AI 2027 based some of their predictions on the METR plot and cited it extensively. In Von Arx's words, “It's a little weird when the way lots of people are familiar with your work is this pretty opinionated interpretation.”

Of course, plenty of people invoke the METR plot without imagining large-scale death and destruction. For some AI boosters, the exponential trend indicates that AI will soon usher in an era of radical economic growth. The venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, for example, recently put out a post titled “2026: This is AGI,” which used the METR plot to argue that AI that can act as an employee or contractor will soon arrive. “The provocation really was like, ‘What will you do when your plans are measured in centuries?'” says Sonya Huang, a general partner at Sequoia and one of the post's authors. 

Just because a model achieves a one-hour time horizon on the METR plot, however, doesn't mean that it can replace one hour of human work in the real world. For one thing, the tasks on which the models are evaluated don't reflect the complexities and confusion of real-world work. In their original study, Kwa, Von Arx, and their colleagues quantify what they call the “messiness” of each task according to criteria such as whether the model knows exactly how it is being scored and whether it can easily start over if it makes a mistake (for messy tasks, the answer to both questions would be no). They found that models do noticeably worse on messy tasks, although the overall pattern of improvement holds for both messy and non-messy ones.

And even the messiest tasks that METR considered can't provide much information about AI's ability to take on most jobs, because the plot is based almost entirely on coding tasks. “A model can get better at coding, but it's not going to magically get better at anything else,” says Daniel Kang, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In a follow-up study, Kwa and his colleagues did find that time horizons for tasks in other domains also appear to be on exponential trajectories, but that work was much less formal.

Despite these limitations, many people admire the group's research. “The METR study is one of the most carefully designed studies in the literature for this kind of work,” Kang told me. Even Gary Marcus, a former NYU professor and professional LLM curmudgeon, described much of the work that went into the plot as “terrific” in a blog post.

Some people will almost certainly continue to read the METR plot as a prognostication of our AI-induced doom, but in reality it's something far more banal: a carefully constructed scientific tool that puts concrete numbers to people's intuitive sense of AI progress. As METR employees will readily agree, the plot is far from a perfect instrument. But in a new and fast-moving domain, even imperfect tools can have enormous value.

“This is a bunch of people trying their best to make a metric under a lot of constraints. It is deeply flawed in many ways,” Von Arx says. “I also think that it is one of the best things of its kind.”

Elon Musk has spent recent days on his social media site X trying to explain why he exchanged so many emails with Jeffrey Epstein. The billionaire Tesla CEO insists that Epstein was the one pursuing him. But the more Musk explains, and the more emails are surfaced from the gigantic cache of so-called Epstein files, the stranger his defense seems to get.

Musk has denied any wrongdoing and says he never went to Epstein's private island in the Caribbean, known as Little St. James. And while there doesn't seem to be any concrete evidence that Musk went to the island, it's pretty clear from the emails that Musk was itching to party with Epstein. Musk was engaged in long back and forth chats in 2012, 2013, and 2014 about a visit to the island.

A series of emails from Dec. 2012 that talks about a “ratio” at Epstein's parties is particularly concerning, if only because it's not entirely clear what he means. Musk talked about bringing his then-wife Talulah Riley, the British actress who he was married to from  2010-2012 and then again from 2013-2016.

Epstein: you are welcome to stay or just come for the day, plenty of rroom i will=send heli to get you

Musk: Do you have any parties planned? I've been working to the edge of sanity th=s year and so, once my kids head home after Christmas, I really want to hi= the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose. The invitation is=much appreciated, but a peaceful island experience is the opposite of what=l'm looking for.

Epstein: Understood, , I will see you on st Barth, the ratio on my island might m=ke Talilah uncomfortable

Musk: Ratio is not a problem for Talulah

In other emails from Nov. 2012, Musk asks “What day/night will be the wildest party on =our island?”

Ever since the new Epstein files were released on Jan. 30, roughly 3.5 million pages in total, Musk has also been going back and forth with LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman online, each man accusing the other of being more implicated by the files.

“The big difference between you and me, Reid, is that you went and I did not. In fact, you went multiple times. First time was maybe a mistake, but not the second time you went,” Musk wrote.

“And, as the email shows, I obviously didn't anticipate anything actually shady, as I was bringing my wife at the time (Talulah). Nonetheless, UNLIKE YOU, I came to my senses and declined to go. Epstein tried to get me to go to his island so many times that eventually I just blocked him,” Musk continued in another tweet.

The phrasing here is curious, obviously. What does Musk mean that he came to his senses?

Does it imply that Musk always knew Epstein was engaged in child sex trafficking, wanted to party with him, and then decided against it? Or does it mean that Musk only learned in the process of emailing back and forth in 2012, 2013, and 2014 that Epstein was a predator, which then changed Musk's mind about hanging out with him?

So many things that Musk says can be confusing, largely because he's not a reliable narrator of his own actions. The billionaire previously wrote in Sept. 2025 that he “refused” to go to Epstein's island, though the emails we now have don't suggest that at all. What the publicly available emails show is that Musk and Epstein were communicating about hanging out.

Even if you don't count a potential visit to the island, there were other communications between the men about other meet-ups, including one from February 2013 that refers to a “facility,” where Epstein says he'll bring four “assistants.”

Again, Musk denies any wrongdoing. But it seems like every time he decides to chime in on the controversy, things get a little more weird. And it's not just about Epstein. Early Wednesday morning, Musk responded to a tweet from a user called @PubWanghaf.

“It breaks my heart to say but in order to save this country we are probably going to have to do things that make women sad :(” the X user wrote.

Musk responded with “true words,” without elaborating.

Google's AI assistant Gemini App now has more than 750 million monthly active users, CEO Sundar Pichai said at parent company Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call.

That's roughly 100 million more users than the 650 million monthly active users the company reported in its third-quarter earnings report. That report was released just three weeks before the company's Gemini 3 debut upended the AI world.

“We are also seeing significantly higher engagement per user, especially since the launch of Gemini 3,” Pichai said. “[Gemini 3] has seen the fastest adoption of any model in our history.”

Google's AI story experienced a major turnaround in mid-November thanks to Gemini 3, the company's latest AI model. AI enthusiasts praised the capabilities of the model far and wide on social media, with even some long-time ChatGPT fanboys like Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff admitting to converting to Gemini. AI benchmarking firm LMArena's cofounder Wei-Lin Chiang even called the release “more than a leaderboard shuffle.”

Gemini 3 was so well-received that only a couple of weeks later, OpenAI leadership declared “code red” at the company. Even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose company has significant business with OpenAI, reportedly raised worries over the competition Google now poses to OpenAI's market dominance.

Despite the huge jump in users for Gemini, there might still be a long way to go until it can suprpass ChatGPT to become the chatbot leader. OpenAI doesn't report regular data on ChatGPT active users, but a The Information report from December claimed that ChatGPT was nearing 900 million users weekly at the time.

Either way, Google's catch-up effort is impressive. With high-profile launches like Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro, Google has been able to save its once-battered AI reputation following the failed launch of Gemini image generation in early 2024.

“I think we are in a very, very relentless innovation cadence, and I think we are confident about maintaining that momentum as we go through '26,” Pichai said in the earnings call. Executives shared that they are planning to double capital expenditures in 2026, with the majority going towards AI.

Google has big plans for Gemini this year. Apple recently tapped Gemini to power its AI revamp of Siri that is set to launch later this year, and Samsung announced last month that it was planning to double the amount of its Gemini-infused mobile devices. The company is also preparing to make Gemini more “shoppable” with checkout experiences infused directly into the app.

You might also want to start preparing to have your Gemini chats plagued by ads, but that might still be further on the horizon.

“Ads have always been part of scaling products to reach billions of people,” Google's chief business officer Philipp Schindler said. “But as we've said, we're not rushing anything here.”

The human body is a complex machine that's been fine-tuned—through millions of years of evolution—to operate here on Earth. So what happens to that machine when you put it inside a box and fling it far beyond the safety of our planet's atmosphere?

This, in vastly oversimplified terms, is the question that biomedical researchers at NASA have been asking for decades. These scientists study the health impacts of spaceflight to develop methods that protect astronauts' bodies and minds, using ground research facilities, analog environments, and the International Space Station to conduct cutting-edge studies.

Now that NASA is finally sending humans back to the Moon, these scientists are preparing for the research opportunity of a lifetime.

The Artemis 2 mission will send NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jeremy Hansen farther from Earth than any human has gone before. During their 10-day flight around the Moon, they will encounter high levels of space radiation and reach a maximum distance of 250,000 miles from Earth. The mission is currently on track to launch as early as the first week of March.

“I often talk about the most complicated system on this vehicle is going to be the human,” Steven Platts, chief scientist of the Human Research Program at NASA's Johnson Space Center, told Gizmodo. “We need to understand exactly what's going to happen in order to prevent anything bad from happening and keep them safe and healthy.”

If Platts and his colleagues have learned anything from their decades of research, it's that spaceflight puts a lot of strain on the human body. He explained that there are five primary health hazards associated with spaceflight: radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, gravity (or lack thereof), and hostile, confined environments.

These hazards manifest differently depending on the mission profile, Platts said. The Artemis 2 crew will spend a far shorter period of time in microgravity than astronauts on standard ISS missions, for example. Still, 10 days is long enough to trigger certain physiological changes, such as fluid shifts and vestibular disruption.

When it comes to radiation, the Artemis 2 astronauts will get a much higher daily dose than those aboard the ISS. They will travel through the Van Allen belts—two donut-shaped zones of particle radiation trapped inside Earth's magnetic field—and then enter the galactic cosmic radiation environment beyond the magnetic field.

The Orion spacecraft—which will carry the Artemis 2 astronauts on this journey—is designed to shield its crew from most of this radiation, but measuring how much breaks through and how human cells and DNA respond to it is crucial.

Galactic cosmic radiation can be particularly damaging. When looking at individual cells that have been exposed to these high-energy particles, “you can literally see the tracks that the radiation makes through the cell and the damage that it creates,” Platts said.

Orion is equipped with thousands of sensors that will measure radiation levels inside the spacecraft. Each crew member will also carry a sensor called a Crew Active Dosimeter in their pockets to closely monitor their exposure levels.

Understanding how the human body responds to the unique hazards of the deep space environment will be essential to future lunar landings and Mars missions. Artemis 2 will investigate this in several different ways.

During this mission, crew members will act as both researchers and test subjects, gathering data that will help NASA build interventions, protocols, and preventative measures to protect astronaut health. One study, called ARCHeR (Artemis Research for Crew Health and Readiness), will investigate how the deep space environment affects sleep, stress, cognition, and teamwork, all of which are key to astronaut health and performance.

Participating crew members will wear wristbands that continuously monitor their movement and sleep patterns throughout the mission. This data will support real-time health monitoring and safety assessments, while pre- and post-flight evaluations will provide insight into any cognitive, behavioral, and sleep quality changes.

The Artemis 2 astronauts will also provide wet saliva samples before and after the mission, as well as dry saliva samples during the mission. While in flight, they will blot their saliva onto a special type of paper in pocket-sized booklets, eliminating the need for a wet-sample refrigeration system on board the Orion spacecraft.

Saliva is an excellent indicator of human health, as it contains a rich mixture of biomarkers that signal immune system function. “We can see hormones, we can see viruses, we can see other chemicals in the blood… And with this technique, we can see changes in cortisol,” Platts said. Measuring how this stress hormone fluctuates over the course of the mission will be critical, as stress is linked to many of the adverse health outcomes of spaceflight, he explained.

These aren't the only biological samples NASA will collect from the Artemis 2 crew, however. They will be the first astronauts in deep space to participate in the Spaceflight Standard Measures study, which has been collecting blood, urine, and saliva samples from astronauts aboard the ISS and elsewhere since 2018. These samples help researchers evaluate astronauts' nutritional status, cardiovascular health, and immunological function.

Then there's the AVATAR, the most groundbreaking biomedical study flying aboard Artemis 2. Short for “A Virtual Astronaut Tissue Analog Response,” AVATAR involves USB-sized “organ chips” that contain living human cells cultured inside microscopic, fluid-filled channels. These chips are designed to simulate the structure, function, and physiological responses of human organs.

To make them, the Artemis 2 astronauts first donated blood platelets to a local healthcare system. The cells remaining from their samples contained a small amount of bone marrow-derived stem cells, which NASA researchers then purified and placed into the chips next to blood vessel cells and other supporting cells.

“The chip will function essentially like our bone marrow does,” Platts explained. Flying these chips on the Artemis 2 mission—alongside the astronauts who created them—will allow NASA scientists to compare changes in the chip to changes in the astronauts' actual bone marrow.

“Imagine future flights,” Platts said. “If I'm going to fly in two years, [NASA] can fly a tissue chip of me—my avatar—ahead of time and then bring it back and see what's going to happen so that they can design the countermeasures for me, for my personal use.” Artemis 2 will be the first mission to fly with this biotechnology.

Together, these studies will produce a wealth of data, helping to pave the way for NASA's return to the lunar surface and extend humanity's reach deeper into the solar system. “It's just amazing how many things we're going to be able to find out just from this one mission,” Platts said.

Update: February 5, 2026, 11:16 a.m. ET: This article has been updated to reflect the new target launch window for NASA's Artemis 2 mission, which opens on March 6.

The Exorcist: Martyr has added another huge name to its cast. Chris Hemsworth discusses the surprise of Avengers: Doomsday adding an extra Chris to its cast. Plus, get a very early look at season 9 of Rick & Morty. Spoilers get!



A new report from The InSneider alleges that a return to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is a high priority for newly installed CEO and President team Josh D'Amaro and Dana Walden, with the next project purportedly combining prior plans for a Margot Robbie-led female spinoff and a mainline Pirates film to create a new film that will feature Robbie's character and the young son of Jack Sparrow.

Bloody-Disgusting reports Sophia Wilde is attached to star in Soon You Will Be Gone and Possibly Eaten, a sci-fi thriller based on the short story by Nick Antosca (Channel Zero) from director Egor Abramenko. Written for the screen by Luke Piotrowski and Ben Collins (Hellraiser 2022, The Night House), the story concerns Rob and Sabile, “a young engaged couple who head to a secluded mountain resort to take their vows and step into the new chapter of their shared lives. What was planned as a joyous wedding attended by family members takes a different turn when unexpected guests crash the ceremony.”

Deadline also has word Chiwetel Ejiofor has joined the cast of The Exorcist: Martyr in a currently undisclosed role.

Speaking with GamesRadar+, Chris Hemsworth stated it was “pretty cool” when Chris Evans' Steve Rogers unexpectedly returns on a motorbike in Avengers: Doomsday.

It was pretty cool when [Chris] Evans comes up on the motorbike, and because no one knew he was going to be in the film, and then there he is. I just thought it was cool. And he had a baby in real life and in Marvel life.

Relatedly, Mark Ruffalo addressed rumors he's been fired by Disney in a recent interview with The News Movement (despite the actor appearing in the upcoming Spider-Man: Brand New Day).

Not that I know of. People keep going, ‘Did you get fired?' I'm like, ‘Not that I know of.'

Yeah, I'll be there as long as they have me. I have a good relationship with them. You know, who knows, there might be things I'm already doing that are…I'm around. Let me just say that.

Variety reports the new Faces of Death has been acquired by IFC and Shudder.

Deadline reports filming has begun on Rule of Three, the intended first part of a new horror trilogy starring Thomasin McKenzie, Chloe East, Jimmi Simpson, Sutton Foster, Tom Everett Scott, and Bilal Hasna. Based on the novel by Sam Ripley and Psych‘s James Roday Rodriguez, the story concerns a girl trying to escape a deadly familial curse. 

According to Deadline, Alfie Allen has joined the cast of The Institute as Nolan Reeves, “an eccentric European tech billionaire and one of the Institute's financial backers with an ambitious agenda all his own.”

Alan Ritchson, Dennis Quaid, Stephan James, Jai Courtney, Esai Morales, Blake Richardson, Keiynan Lonsdale, and Daniel Webber star in the trailer for War Machine, a new sci-fi/action movie in the vein of Predator in which a training exercise for US Army Rangers “turns into a fight for survival against an unimaginable threat.”

Spoiler TV has a synopsis for “The Others,” the February 26 episode of Ghosts. Images at the link.

Sam and the ghosts face The Others, a new group of spirits from one ghost's past. Meanwhile, Trevor tries to deal with a demanding Patience, who seeks a committed relationship in the wake of their holiday hookup.

Finally, Adult Swim has released an animatic from Rick and Morty's ninth season.

Goodbye, camera bump? That appears to be what Google is suggesting in a preview for the Pixel 10a phone launching on Feb. 18.

In typical Google fashion, the company just randomly dropped a video on YouTube announcing its next midrange Android phone. The 15-second preview shows the Pixel 10a off in full, leaving nothing to the imagination. As the successor to the Pixel 9a, the Pixel 10a should be priced similarly at around $500 (it's currently available for $400 direct from Google).

See Pixel 9a at Amazon

Don't expect too many cosmetic differences between the Pixel 10a and the Pixel 9a. The only major visual change might be that even flatter—maybe flush?!—camera bump? The Pixel 9a had a nearly flat bump, but the Pixel 10a might actually have no bump at all? You tell me what you think based on these screenshots.

As for specs, the Pixel 10a will likely be a watered-down version of the Pixel 10, the same way the Pixel 9a was to the Pixel 9. Leaks have suggested the Pixel 10a might stick with the Tensor G4 chip that was in the Pixel 9 series instead of using the Tensor G5 chip found in the Pixel 10, 10 Pro/10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold. RAM and storage configurations could also come in the same 8GB RAM + 128GB storage and 12GB RAM + 256GB storage as the Pixel 9a. However, the ongoing memory and flash storage shortage, which has been driving up prices across all consumer electronics that require those components, could affect how many models Google launches with.

It'd be great to see some kind of bump up to the Pixel 9a's dual-lens camera system. The Pixel 9a has a 48-megapixel main and 13-megapixel ultrawide. An upgrade to the Pixel 9's 50-megapixel main and 48-megapixel ultrawide would be welcome. I don't have my hopes up, though, since the Pixel 10 actually got a downgrade to the Pixel 9a's lower-resolution cameras.

Instead of hardware, Google will most likely focus the Pixel 10a's mesaging around affordability and Gemini. AI features like “Magic Cue,” which suggests information or actions within select Google apps, and “Help me edit,” which uses Gemini to edit photos with only a text prompt, were big selling points for the Pixel 10 series last year. Expect to see the Pixel 10a pushed as more of an “AI phone” that helps you get more things done (and quicker) than yet another affordable midrange Android phone.

It's not every day that Lego manages to truly surprise with its licensed crossovers, but today, they've got us: one of the most exciting upcoming sci-fi films of 2026, Project Hail Mary, is getting the brick-built treatment.

This morning Lego announced a new 830-piece set inspired by the new film, itself an adaptation of the novel of the same name by The Martian‘s Andy Weir. The set includes a buildable version of the titular ship, the Hail Mary—the longshot hope for humanity on a mission to try and figure out why almost every star in the universe is suddenly dying, including our own sun—which can be rotated on its display stand and features a moving crew module to create the ship's centrifugal gravity system.

See Project Hail Mary at LEGO

As well as the ship, the display base includes a small detachable vignette featuring a minifigure of Ryan Gosling's unlikely astronaut, Ryland Grace, and a small, appropriately brick-built version of the alien he encounters on his mission, Rocky.

It's a great-looking little set, even if it doesn't initially seem like the kind of license Lego would go after. But of course, the company has a long history with space sets, licensed or otherwise, and an interest in the real-world history of human spaceflight. So given Project Hail Mary‘s more grounded approach to interstellar travel, it's not really all that surprising that Lego would see a kinship there with its past space-themed sets. A surprise to be sure, and definitely a welcome one considering the huge buzz the film has been getting.

The Lego Icons Project Hail Mary set will release on March 1 for $100, and is available to preorder now.

Western Digital this week outlined its near-term and mid-term plans to increase hard drive capacities to around 60TB and beyond with optimizations that significantly increase HDD performance for the AI and cloud era. In addition, the company outlined its longer-term vision for hard disk drives' evolution that includes a new laser technology for heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), new platters with higher areal density, and HDD assemblies with up to 14 platters. As a result, WD will be able to offer drives beyond 140 TB in the 2030s.

 




Western Digital plans to volume produce its inaugural commercial hard drives featuring HAMR technology next year, with capacities rising from 40TB (CMR) or 44TB (SMR) in late 2026, with production ramping in 2027. These drives will use the company's proven 11-platter platform with high-density media as well as HAMR heads with edge-emitting lasers that heat iron-platinum alloy (FePt) on top of platters to its Curie temperature — the point at which its magnetic properties change — and reducing its magnetic coercivity before writing data.

These edge-emitting lasers are efficient enough to make HAMR possible, but are mechanically and optically constrained, according to Ahmed Shihab, chief product officer at Western Digital. These lasers waste part of the generated light and are physically tall. That height forces additional spacing between platters, while optical losses limit how much thermal energy can be delivered to the media — both factors directly restrict areal density scaling.

 




More importantly, edge-emitting HAMR lasers are made with low yields as they rely on mechanical cleaving, precision optical alignment, and thermal screening, which prevents wafer-level testing. As a consequence, they can only be tested as part of the final head assembly, which greatly reduces yield (something that killed RDRAM years ago, as these memory chips must be tested only as part of the module assembly).

""Everybody in the industry, us included, use what is called an edge-emitting laser,"" Shibab said. ""It is the gray box that you see sitting on the top [see the image above]. They work really well. They are the ones powering HAMR today, but they have three challenges. The light produced sometimes is wasted, so they waste a bit of energy that could be better used elsewhere. They're quite tall, so we have to make sure the platters are some distance apart from each other. And during the hard drive manufacturing process, the yields are not as good as we'd like them to be.""

To remove these limitations, Western Digital spent six years developing a patented vertical-emitting laser. Unlike conventional designs, it emits light straight down onto the magnetic media, couples more energy onto the disk, and is significantly shorter in the Z-dimension. This change enables two parallel advances: higher areal density (up from today's four terabytes per platter all the way to 10 TBs per platter) as well as a thinner head assembly that allows more disks to be packed into the same 3.5-inch drive. Furthermore, Western Digital's new vertical laser is made using a lithography process and can be tested on a wafer independently of the head, so the company also expects meaningfully higher manufacturing yields.

""By emitting more light, harnessing more of that light into the recording technology, we will increase the aerial density of the HAMR platters from four terabytes all the way to 10 terabytes by 2028 per platter,"" said Shihab. ""This technology is not theoretical. It is actually already in the labs. We have watched it during the recording.""

Alongside its new vertical laser technology, Western Digital is also working on an HDD platform capable of housing up to 14 platters, another part of the equation enabling the company to increase the capacity of its hard drives significantly over the next 10 years or so.

 




The 12-platter platform will first be used with 60TB ePMR drives in 2028. While Western Digital does not disclose how many platters the company's 60TB HAMR HDD will use, it says that its ePMR and HAMR drives will use the same platform, which suggests that HAMR products will also use generally the same design.

 ""We also borrowing some of the ideas from Hammer,"" said the CPO of Western Digital. ""So, to get to 60, we will go to 12 platters. We are packing more capacity inside the same three and a half inch, all without changing the power profile of the drive. The customers don't have to spend more energy doing what we do.""

Which is perhaps why Shihab carefully frames the new vertical laser technology not as a one-time capacity boost, but as a structural reset of HAMR's scaling curve that will aggressively grow starting in 2028 and is expected to enable 100TB HDDs in 2029 ~ 2030. In fact, once the vertical laser technology reaches its apex with granular media, sometime in the 2030s, Western Digital will be able to offer drives with an up to 140 TB capacity.

""10 terabytes, 14 platters, that sounds like 140 terabytes,"" Shihab teased.

 




Interestingly, but Western Digital's dual-actuator Dual Pivot HDDs that promise to double both bandwidth and sequential I/O IOPS performance also enter the scene at a 60TB capacity, though the company is tight-lipped whether these hard drives use ePMR or HAMR recording technology.

 ""Dual Pivot technology helps customers focus their software effort on improving more performance for AI versus having to deal with how the hard drives work,"" Western Digital's chief product officer said. ""We will introduce this at the 60 TB mark. […] So we are starting to put High Bandwidth drive technology in our customers hands today [and] my biggest problem is finding them enough material so they can start testing. Dual Pivot technology will be in their hands in late 2027 and in 2028.

After that 140 TB milestone (which is pretty contingent), the company will have to move on to ordered granular (OG) and eventually bit patterned media (BPM), which is when HDD disks will be patterned using highly sophisticated etching, nanoimprint lithography, e-beam lithography, or even photolithography.

With BPM, hard drive technology will be dealing with very localized heating, which must be controlled with extreme accuracy. Excess energy can disturb neighboring bits, while insufficient energy prevents reliable writes, which is why somewhere along the line, HDD makers will have to invent next-generation laser designs that will combine heating performance with extreme precision.

When Valve unveiled the Steam Machine and Steam Frame in November 2025, many expected them to arrive during the first quarter of 2026, even though the company hadn't given a specific date yet. However, it seems that this is no longer the case, as Valve said on its blog that the current memory shortage is forcing it push back the planned launch schedule and look at the pricing for the living room PC console.

“When we announced these products in November, we planned on being able to share specific pricing and launch dates by now. But the memory and storage shortages you've likely heard about across the industry have rapidly increased since then,” Valve said on the Steam Hardware blog. “The limited availability and growing prices of these critical components mean we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing (especially around Steam Machine and Steam Frame).”

Still, the company says that it plans to ship all three products — the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller — during the first half of the year. However, it also said that it is “being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change.” The current memory shortage, driven by AI data centers' massive demand for HBM, is pushing many PC makers to the edge, with both manufacturers and system integrators announcing price hikes to deal with the situation.

Furthermore, smaller industry players without deep pockets would likely have a hard time acquiring chips from the big three manufacturers, with one memory chip maker rep saying that, “relationships with memory suppliers matter in a crunch.” And while Valve's Steam Deck single-handedly revived the handheld PC gaming market, it's still a relatively niche manufacturer compared to traditional PC makers like Asus and Dell (which have already announced massive price hikes).

The company has previously said that it won't subsidize the consoles and that it's priced close to an entry-level PC. Before the chaos of the memory shortage, this meant it would've cost around $550 to $600. But with the price of DRAM and NAND skyrocketing, especially affecting RAM kits, SSDs, and discrete GPUs, we're no longer sure if this would still be possible. There have been leaks showing the Steam Machine priced at more than $1,000 for the 1TB version, but this came from a third-party retailer and not directly from Valve.

At the moment, the final price of the Steam Machine is still up in the air. However, we still expect it to land in retailers sooner rather than later. After all, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said during the company's earnings call that “from a product standpoint, Valve is on track to be shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year.” So, hopefully, we'll just have to wait a few more weeks or months before we finally know the retail price of the much-awaited PC console and it becomes available from our favorite store.

There's a rare but persistent issue with Socket AM5 processors where, occasionally, they burn out. The name that has come up the most in discussions of this issue is ASRock, which might make you think that ASRock has had the most failures. That's not necessarily a given; the tracking of the problem started on the /r/ASRock sub-Reddit, and that's why many of the failure reports are on ASRock motherboards. Given its proximity to the problem, you might expect that ASRock would have already put out a statement about it. Well, it hadn't — until now, anyway.

In an official statement published on its website's ""News"" section, ASRock says it is ""closely monitoring recent discussions regarding the performance and behavior of AMD Ryzen™ 9000 series processors on ASRock AMD platforms."" No mention of exactly what the issues are, and no specific mention of Ryzen 9 or X3D processors, either — simply, 'we heard there's a problem, and we're looking into it.' Ten-four, ASRock. This echoes a similar statement from ASUS recently, and MSI has also released remarks on the issue.

 




In most reports, these chips normally get so hot that they leave scorch marks on the CPU and socket. Well, they don't normally fail at all, but you understand. We don't want to overstate the frequency of this issue; at the time of writing, there are around 350 reports, which sounds like a lot until you consider both that reports are not the same as verified, root-caused failures, and also the hundreds of thousands of Socket AM5 CPUs that are out there. This problem affects an infinitesimally tiny fraction of Socket AM5 users — but that doesn't make it any less frustrating, of course.

The ""burnt CPUs"" issue initially plagued the Ryzen 7000 series processors way back in 2023, and last year, it was frequently framed as an issue specifically affecting AMD's ""X3D"" gaming processors with 3D V-Cache. While the pictures of burned processors and melted CPU sockets are certainly evocative, it's not really clear that this problem is indicative of any kind of design flaw or reproducible fault in the processors or the motherboards. ASRock issued BIOS updates aimed to minimize the issue after community outrage, but some insist that the problem persists to this day.

 




Hardware YouTubers Gamers Nexus have put quite a few hours into trying to intentionally cause this kind of failure, and their efforts have largely been in vain, even when using a motherboard that was known to have already killed a processor once. Much like the situation with Intel's 13th/14th-generation CPUs, it's possible there is an element of ""CPU vendor offers wide range of possible values; motherboard vendor picks the most extreme possible values"" here. Who's actually at fault in that case is difficult to say, but AMD is replacing CPUs that die in this manner under its standard warranty, so it's hard to find fault there, anyway.

ASRock says it is ""working in seamless coordination with AMD continuously to further validate system performance across a wide range of hardware configurations, while optimizing BIOS and enhancing overall system stability."" While some users see the company silently shipping BIOS updates that modify voltage behavior and power profiles as an admission of guilt, it's just as likely that ASRock wants to minimize the amount of support requests it has to field and the number of processors AMD has to replace. Given the relatively low frequency of the faults, this one is probably better filed under ""unfortunate manufacturing issues"" and moved away from.

DLSS 4.5 has proven to be an impressive upgrade over DLSS 4.0 in some areas. Not only does the new model provide superior upscaling quality, but it can also outright improve the visual fidelity of 3D graphics. Building on the latter, Digital Foundry discovered that both DLSS 4.5 Presets M and L are capable of reconstructing ray-traced reflections almost perfectly (depending on the game), as long as in-game denoisers are turned off.Digital Foundry saw this behavior in Crysis 3 and Silent Hill 2, where DLSS 4.5 produced noticeably better ray-traced image quality with each game's denoiser turned off compared to with them turned on. In Crysis 3, turning off the engine's denoiser resulted in less boiling, and in Silent Hill 2, turning off the denoiser resulted in a night-and-day difference in reflection quality — to the point where there was almost no image blurring or boiling to be seen.

Boiling and image noise are problems that ray-traced effects naturally produce. Game developers use denoisers to remove these artifacts. However, one caveat with these filters is that they generally do not produce a perfect image. This is why you'll find objects or textures in ray-traced reflections looking oily or smeared. NVIDIA introduced DLSS Ray Reconstruction to help solve this problem, and Ray Reconstruction itself generally provides better image quality with AI, compared to the capabilities of traditional denoisers. This has especially been the case with DLSS 4's Ray Reconstruction transformer model, which produces noticeably superior image quality compared to the initial DLSS 3.5 version.What we are seeing with DLSS 4.5 is very unique. NVIDIA has tuned the transformer model of its DLSS upscaler so well that it alone can remove the aforementioned artifacts that ray tracing effects generate naturally. Also, DLSS 4.5 is doing this without Ray Reconstruction — since Ray Reconstruction has not yet been updated to support the newer DLSS 4.5 model.If Nvidia can fully leverage this feature and improve it, we could very well see it stop supporting Ray Reconstruction (or, rename it and bake it into the upscaler portion of DLSS instead, at a future date). This would simplify DLSS and make life potentially easier for developers to incorporate DLSS into ray tracing games, as they would not need to worry about Ray Reconstruction integration. However, this will all depend on how effective DLSS 4.5 is at denoising. Digital Foundry is the only outlet we've seen so far that's covered this behavior in-depth, and it has only covered it in just two titles. There could be issues with DLSS 4.5's denoising capabilities in other ray tracing games and/or effects that we are not aware of at this point. Also, DLSS 4.5 handles upscaling with in-game denosing turned on worse, compared to DLSS 4. This is critical since not all ray-tracing games officially allow gamers to disable a game's built-in denoiser.

Edited by Archita Rai

Worsening of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome was associated with an increased risk for developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), with stage 4 disease linked to a 48% higher risk for the retina disorder than stage 0 disease; genetic risk for AMD did not appear to substantially modify the association.

“Although we did not observe a significant interaction between CKM [cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic] syndrome and genetic predisposition on incident AMD, joint analyses revealed that participants with CKM stage 4 and high genetic predisposition showed the highest risk of AMD,” the researchers reported. “Taken together, the current study highlights the importance of routine screening and management of CKM syndrome, regardless of genetic predisposition.”

The study was led by Fengyue Wu and Kun Xu of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University in Shenyang, China. It was published online on January 22, 2026, in the American Journal of Ophthalmology.

The observational design could not establish that cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome caused AMD. Participants were mostly White and from healthier and more affluent community settings, which may have limited the generalizability of findings. Diagnoses of AMD relied on records, registries, and self-reports, which may have missed some cases and introduced recall bias.

The study received support from the Liaoning Provincial Science and Technology Plan Joint Program. The authors reported having no financial disclosures.

“Parkinson's disease is the fastest-growing neurological disorder,” commented Daniela Berg, MD, president of the German Neurological Society (DGN), at a press conference held at the DGN Congress 2025.

In Germany, an estimated 300,000-400,000 people are living with the disease. Worldwide, about 11.8 million people were affected in 2021, and this number is estimated to reach 25.1 million by 2050. “We are almost dealing with a pandemic,” said Berg.

The congress discussed approaches to better understand the disease from its biological causes and what benefits this could have for prophylaxis, diagnosis, and therapy.

Jannik Prasuhn, MD, of University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein in Lubeck, Germany, and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, described the current situation as precarious. There are currently no disease-modifying therapies, and diagnosis relies on clinical criteria that cannot definitively identify the disease. A pathologically confirmed diagnosis is still only possible postmortem, he noted.

The clinical criteria capture only the consequences, not the causes of the disease, Prasuhn said. Heterogeneous disease courses, clinical overlaps, and differential diagnoses such as multiple system atrophy with parkinsonism or other synucleinopathies further complicate diagnosis.

Even in expert centers, there is only about an 80% agreement between clinical and neuropathologic diagnoses, the researcher pointed out. “The clinical definition simply falls short,” he stated. “And it is only of very limited use — if at all — for interventional studies.”

The pathology, such as the deposition of alpha-synuclein, remains invisible for decades until the first symptoms finally appear. However, the clinical phase only begins when 70%-80% of the dopamine-producing neurons have already been lost.

This represents a lost window of opportunity for disease-modifying therapies currently under development. Prasuhn therefore posed the question: “Can we also define Parkinson's disease biologically and not just describe it at the onset of symptoms?”

A biological definition of Parkinson's disease depends on the ability to detect misfolded alpha-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood. This is now possible with a seed amplification assay (SAA). This technique allows patients to be identified even in the prodromal phase of the disease, as well as asymptomatic carriers of the mutation.

Samples for SAA can be obtained from skin, blood, CSF, or tears, depending on the disease context. In Parkinson's disease, CSF is used. Alpha-synuclein is then isolated from the sample. This serves as the “seed.”

According to the prion hypothesis, misfolded protein from samples taken from patients with the disease can induce other alpha-synuclein monomers to misfold. Over time, this leads to increasing aggregation of misfolded protein in vitro. Using thioflavin T, a dye that binds protein aggregates, this process can be visualized in real time as a fluorescence intensity-time curve.

Patients who test positive in the assay are considered to have a synucleinopathy, whereas those who test negative do not.

In Germany, the assay is currently used exclusively within the context of clinical trials.

Following the example of Alzheimer's disease (amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration system) or Huntington disease (Huntington Disease Integrated Staging System), a biological definition can now supplement or replace the clinical syndrome designation for Parkinson's disease. The guiding principle of this paradigm shift, Prasuhn said, is simple: “Biology is the disease; the clinical presentation is only its manifestation.”

A biological classification would be based on three core markers:

On the basis of these markers, two classification systems have been proposed:

One primary goal is to define a homogeneous cohort for studies. However, only an estimated 10%-15% of patients likely have a monogenic background. Carriers of the pathogenic SNCA gene, in turn, make up only a fraction of these. The fully penetrant variants are even rarer.

Each patient is classified by combining these parameters. This system is intended to capture heterogeneity while making biological subtypes recognizable. According to this classification, the “classic” patient with sporadic Parkinson's disease would be designated as S+/N+/G-.

Patients who meet the criteria for NSD represent a small subset of the patients who meet the SynNeurGe criteria.

“The biological definition opens, for the first time, the possibility of identifying patients before they develop symptoms and preventing disease progression or even averting the onset of the disease through prevention and early therapy,” Prasuhn summarized.

Berg revealed an insider detail at the end of the lecture: A framework concept developed by the DGN, not yet published, will integrate these two new disease concepts as well as clinical diagnoses.

Early-stage Alzheimer's disease poses unique diagnostic and management challenges, as subtle cognitive and functional changes might be mistaken for stress, mood disorders, or normal aging. However, evolving evidence and guideline recommendations stress the importance of catching Alzheimer's disease early to deliver optimal outcomes for these patients.

Alzheimer's disease is considered early-onset when it presents before age 65 years. Although modern practice guidelines emphasize the importance of early diagnosis for achieving optimal long-term outcomes, the latest recommendations from the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not find sufficient evidence to support routine cognitive impairment screening in older adults. 

Learn more about the epidemiology of early-onset Alzheimer's disease.

The A-IADL-Q is sensitive to early Alzheimer's symptoms, which are known to manifest as mood changes and progressive difficulty in activities of daily living. Specifically, the A-IADL-Q monitors subtle changes in functional capacity over time and is less influenced by demographic factors compared to other assessments. 

The FAST is another functional assessment. However, it might underestimate disease severity compared to other similar assessments. The QRDS and Mini-Cog are both cognitive tests, with QRDS being highly reliable and valuable for those in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. The Mini-Cog has a high sensitivity and specificity rate, but it is not the most known for early-stage Alzheimer's disease.

In the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, episodic memory, executive function, visuospatial function, and language are typically the most affected cognitive domains. Although sensory perception, pain perception, and sexual arousal can all be affected by Alzheimer's disease, these are not identified as typical manifestations in the early stages.

Medial temporal lobe atrophy is known to be the best MRI marker for early-stage Alzheimer's disease because this region is among the first to show neurodegenerative changes. Atrophy alone, however, is not enough to make a diagnosis; cognitive and functional assessments also should be used to confirm diagnosis. 

Although other brain abnormalities may be present in Alzheimer's disease, diffuse frontal lobe atrophy is more indicative of frontotemporal dementia. Similarly, periventricular white matter hyperintensities are more strongly associated with ischemia, and basal ganglia volume loss is indicative of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease.

Learn more about MRI in Alzheimer's disease.

A clinical practice review suggests that patients diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease should be regularly assessed for symptom progression every 6-12 months, with additional follow-up if symptoms worsen. Routine cognitive and functional assessment helps clinicians identify unexpected trends in prognosis.

Children with high blood lead levels throughout childhood and by age 8 were significantly more likely to report symptoms of depression at age 12, based on a new study published in JAMA Network Open.

Lead exposure remains a persistent public health problem, with no known safe level. However, the reference value that should prompt intervention in children is 3.5 μg/L, representing the 97.5th percentile of blood lead concentrations among the pediatric population in the US between 2015 and 2018, according to the US CDC.

Although lead exposure in relation to cognition, defiance, hyperactivity, and conduct disorder has been well studied, far less is known about its association with depression and anxiety in late childhood and early adolescence, said Christian Hoover, MPH, PhD student in epidemiology at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, who led the study.

“We hope that clinicians take away the message that lead exposure remains a contemporary problem, even at levels that are often considered low,” Hoover told Medscape Medical News.

The findings underscore the importance of screening for environmental risk factors and mental health symptoms in pediatric care, he said.

Hoover and colleagues examined low-level, repeated lead exposure across childhood in relation to later mental health symptoms. They conducted a prospective study of 121 children (55% girls; 64% White) recruited via caregivers between 2003 and 2006 in Cincinnati and were followed from the second trimester to age 12. Their serum blood lead concentrations were measured at regular intervals. Self-reported and caregiver-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using various scales.

By blood lead concentration, the adjusted mean differences in self-reported depression scores increased from a nonsignificant 1.82 at age 1 to a significant 3.22 at age 8.

Hoover and his team also found a significantly increased risk for elevated child-reported depressive symptoms with each doubling in mean childhood blood lead concentrations (relative risk, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.00-3.66; P = .05). Every SD change in lead exposure was associated with a 2.7-point higher score (95% CI, -0.27 to 5.61; P = .08).

The study findings are consistent with results of a 2021 study that suggested children aged 8 years were especially susceptible to the negative effects of exposure.

Overall median concentrations decreased from age 1 to age 8, with the highest concentrations in subgroups of boys and Black children and among those with caregivers who had less education.

No significant associations appeared between blood lead concentrations and anxiety.

Although childhood lead poisoning has been greatly reduced in the US through public policy interventions and improved surveillance, the current study broadens clinicians' understanding of lead toxicity, said Noah Buncher, DO, pediatrician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, and former director of the Boston Medical Center Lead Clinic, which treats children with possible lead poisoning.

The study shows a critical window of vulnerability in later childhood and early adolescence in which lead exposure has a stronger association with depressive symptoms, he said.

Pediatric clinicians should consider the risk for lead exposure throughout childhood, not just in infancy and early childhood, Buncher said.

“Children with autism, developmental delay, or those exhibiting pica behaviors are all at higher risk for lead exposure due to increased hand-to-mouth behaviors,” he said.

Hoover said he and his colleagues plan to follow the study cohort over a longer period to examine whether these associations persist into young adulthood, as well as to evaluate additional and emerging sources of lead exposure.

The study was funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Hoover and Buncher disclosed having no financial conflicts of interest.

Only around 1 in 8 nurses, midwives, and nursing associates in the UK would recommend a career in their profession, a national survey has found.

Just 12% said they would encourage others to join the profession, despite 58% reporting that they were satisfied in their current roles.

The findings come from the Nursing and Midwifery Council's (NMC's) professionals survey of 37,961 registrants, conducted in March and April last year. Most respondents (91%) were nurses, and 26% were aged 56-65.

Seven in 10 respondents (71%) said they had experienced harassment, bullying, or abuse in the past year.

Members of the public were the commonest perpetrators (58%). However, incidents involving colleagues (41%) and managers (35%) were also reported. Nearly half of those affected (46%) said the incident was not reported.

The survey found that 40% of respondents had experienced discrimination, most often linked to ethnicity or age. This was more common among internationally educated professionals (53%) than those trained in the UK (35%).

The public, colleagues, and managers were reported to be equally likely sources of discriminatory behaviour. 

The NMC said the findings were particularly concerning given that the nursing register is “more ethnically diverse than ever,” with Black, Asian, and minority ethnic nurses, midwives, and nursing associates now accounting for about a third of the workforce.

“Our findings are a stark reminder of the urgent need to tackle unacceptable behaviours that drive people out of work they love,” said Emma Westcott, NMC executive director of strategy and insight.

“A zero-tolerance approach to discrimination, bullying, and harassment is needed across the sector,” she added.

Around a quarter of respondents said they were struggling with their workload. Many reported being unable to cope each week and frequently working beyond their contracted hours, particularly midwives.

Almost a third of respondents (32%) — including 45% of midwives — said they had witnessed situations where patient safety or care was compromised.

These incidents were often linked to inadequate staffing levels and excessive workload pressures, which were also cited as key drivers of job dissatisfaction and barriers to delivering safe, effective, and compassionate care.

“This report shows the dashboard is flashing red for a workforce drowning under unmanageable workloads, unsafe staffing levels within toxic environments,” said Lynn Woolsey, chief nursing officer at the Royal College of Nursing (RCN).

With patient safety being compromised and burnout risks rising, it was unsurprising that so few professionals would recommend nursing as a career, she said.

Respondents who said they were satisfied in their roles cited making a difference to people's lives and positive relationships with patients and colleagues as key motivators.

Higher levels of satisfaction were reported among professionals aged 66 and over, those educated outside the UK and EU/EEA, Asian and Black professionals, and those newly registered.

“It's encouraging that a majority of the professionals on the register remain energised by the most positive aspects of nursing and midwifery practice,” Westcott said.

The findings come amid ongoing workforce shortages. In November last year, the RCN said there were more than 29,000 registered nursing vacancies across the UK NHS.

Its State of the Profession report found that four in ten respondents were considering or actively planning to leave their roles.

“Our insight suggests that employers who take their duty of care for our registrants seriously are more likely to retain their nursing and midwifery staff,” Westcott said.

In a real-world cohort of patients with a recent myocardial infarction and overweight or obesity, prediabetes with A1c levels of 6.0%-6.4% was associated with a markedly higher risk for progression to type 2 diabetes (T2D) within 5 years than normal glucose levels.

""Taken together, [the study] results indicate that treatment with semaglutide may be particularly advantageous for patients with prediabetes, preexisting cardiovascular disease, and overweight or obesity — combining its proven benefits on cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality with a potential major reduction in the progression to type diabetes with all the associated patient, health care and surveillance benefits of fewer patients with type 2 diabetes,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Pernille Tilma Tonnesen, MD, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. It was published online on January 24, 2026, in Cardiovascular Diabetology.

High A1c levels at admission may have prompted additional testing and introduced surveillance bias. The exclusion of SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy from the diabetes definition may have slightly underestimated the incidence of diabetes. In addition, residual confounding was possible given the cohort design.

This study was funded by a grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation. Some authors reported having equity in Novo Nordisk; receiving support from the Danish Cardiovascular Academy, which is funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation; receiving consulting fees, speaker honoraria, research grants, and travel support; and having other relationships with several pharmaceutical companies, including Novo Nordisk.

Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) increase the risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) by 80% compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in pregnant women with depression or anxiety. Among 3471 eligible pregnancies, venlafaxine showed a 58% higher risk for hypertensive disorders than sertraline.

“These findings align with evidence supporting the norepinephrine-mediated increase in vascular tone associated with SNRIs and reinforce the role of pharmacologic mechanisms in HDP development, considering the effect of underlying depression,” wrote the authors of the study. “When antidepressant therapy is indicated during pregnancy, SSRIs may represent the lower-risk alternative,” they added.

The study was led by Anick Bérard, PhD, Research Center, Sainte-Justine Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was published online in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

SNRI users were comparable to SSRI users except that they had fewer visits to psychiatrists in the year before pregnancy, which could indicate differences in disease severity or management patterns that might influence outcomes.

Bérard disclosed serving as a consultant for plaintiffs in litigations on antidepressants between 2012 and 2018. The remaining authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

In patients with HER2-positive breast cancer brain metastases, treatment with trastuzumab deruxtecan was associated with a 10% incidence rate of interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, with 2% of patients experiencing events of grade 3 or higher and 11% discontinuing treatment. Although no fatal lung complications occurred, the findings highlight the need for careful monitoring in this high-risk population.

“This meta‐analysis provides essential safety data specific to this population, confirming that ILD/pneumonitis remains a prevalent and clinically significant TEAE, leading to treatment discontinuation in a fraction of patients,” the authors wrote. Although no fatal ILD events were observed, “the potential association between [brain metastasis] and heightened susceptibility to ILD/pneumonitis highlights the essential need for vigilant monitoring and proactive management to improve survival outcomes in these patients.”

The study, led by Yiwen Ma, PhD, Cancer Hospital of Dalian University of Technology, Shenyang, China, was published online in Cancer.

The included studies were predominantly retrospective or subgroup analyses of larger trials, which might have introduced potential selection bias in ILD/pneumonitis monitoring and management protocols. The analysis showed moderate-to-high heterogeneity in pooled estimates, whereas some studies had relatively short median follow-up times that might have underestimated late-onset ILD/pneumonitis events. Additionally, potential confounding factors such as brain metastases activity, proportion of lung metastases, and prior anti-HER2 treatment strategies could not be assessed through subgroup analysis due to inconsistent reporting across studies.

The study received support from multiple grants, including Liaoning Provincial Key R&D Projects, Shenyang Public Health R&D Special Project, Shenyang Breast Cancer Clinical Medical Research Center (2020-48-3-1), Liaoning Province Joint Fund Project, and Liaoning Cancer Hospital Oncology+ Project.

Alarming reports by the Canadian media highlight how procedures are being canceled or delayed because of a shortage of anesthesiologists, particularly in rural or remote areas. The problem is not new for Canada, Giuseppe Fuda, MD, president of the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society (CAS) and vice president of the Association des Anesthésiologistes du Québec, told Medscape News Canada. Fuda is an anesthesiologist at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal.

“This is not the first time we are in shortages,” said Fuda. “It's cyclical.… I remember when residents [were] almost crying to me, ‘I'm not going to find a job. Everything is so full everywhere!' And here we are, a little less than a generation later, and it is the complete opposite.”

“Multiple factors are contributing to this shortage,” said Beverley A. Orser, MD, chair of anesthesiology and pain medicine at the University of Toronto in Toronto. “We have seen an expansion of service requirements due to the increase in the population size, the aging Canadian population, and the availability of additional procedures, diagnostic interventions, and so forth [that require anesthesiologist support]. We simply have not trained enough positions in Canada, and the funding hasn't been there from the provinces to train people.… We're seeing a workforce that's proportionally older, and the working patterns of physicians has changed.” Gone are the days when physicians worked 100-hour weeks and never saw their families.

Burnout is another contributor. Anesthesiologists are relatively isolated within the medical system, and the increasing complexity of patients eligible for surgery has made their jobs more stressful. These issues are compounded in remote or rural settings where support is limited.

Canada failed to address these changes preemptively. “One thing that we've done badly in Canada is…predict the demand from the population and how we should supply it,” said Fuda. 

“In Canada, we do not have good healthcare workforce data,” Orser agreed. “Figuring out supply chains is not that difficult. Figuring out need and the gap is difficult.”

The problem has not been ignored completely. Residency programs across Canada have dramatically increased their numbers of spaces. Barriers to licensing for international medical graduates are being addressed, particularly for those trained in countries where the academic rigor is comparable to that in Canada.

The Canadian Health Workforce Network and the efforts of people such as Orser are improving healthcare workforce metrics. In a position statement, the CAS outlined a multipronged approach to addressing the shortage. Fuda initiated the Anesthesia Taskforce to look for creative solutions.

Canada has unique and underexploited resources. “Family practice anesthetists (FPAs) like myself work in rural areas because the volumes are low,” explained Nadia Alam, MD, who has worked in remote regions of Ontario. Canadian anesthesiologists are typically paid on a fee-for-service basis, so many do not want to work in an area where the need for anesthesia services is sporadic. Conversely, FPAs “have translatable skills. They can work as family doctors. They can work in the emergency room. They can work on the inpatient wards.”

Anesthesiology assistants (AAs), typically respiratory therapists or nurses who undergo additional training in anesthesia, are another underutilized resource. Flexible, team-based models of care that give a bigger role to AAs can take the pressure off of anesthesiologists. “The big thing is making sure we're doing this intelligently, intentionally, and safely,” said Orser.

The efficient use of a limited workforce remains hampered in Canada because healthcare workers can provide care only in the province in which they are licensed. Medical societies are lobbying to reduce or remove this barrier. In addition, although the Canadian healthcare workforce is keen to work collaboratively, there is no established system of nationwide communication to share creative solutions.

As a result, provinces are largely working independently to address the shortage. Quebec employs a “hub-and-spoke” approach in which urban hospital systems sponsor rural hospitals and supply anesthesiology services. British Columbia and Ontario are focused on community building in remote areas so that FPAs feel less isolated. These efforts include not only mentorship, skill building, and networking programs but also support for finding schools for FPAs' children and jobs for their spouses.

In the US, anesthesiology services in rural areas are largely provided by certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), and many have questioned why Canada has resisted taking the same approach.

Mike MacKinnon, DNP, FNP-C, a Canadian nurse who moved to the US to train as a CRNA and currently works in rural Arizona without the oversight of an anesthesiologist, would love to do the same in Nova Scotia, where he was born and where his family still resides.

“I don't think Canada has as much of an anesthesia problem as it has a workforce model problem,” he told Medscape News Canada. “A lot of that is trade protectionism.” He pointed to the rigorous 3-year training in anesthesia that CRNAs undergo (compared with 1 year for FPAs or AAs) and their solid safety record in the US.

But Fuda, Orser, and Alam are adamant that an “American solution” should not be imported to solve a “Canadian problem.” “We already have a nursing shortage in Canada,” said Fuda. “So if you train some of the nurses [to deliver anesthesia], you're cutting even more nurses [from areas of higher need].”

Perhaps the biggest barrier is the need to develop training and licensing programs for CRNAs when it is already a struggle to fulfill the needs of current anesthesiology, FPA, and AA programs. It would be far better to maximize the potential of existing AAs and FPAs than to introduce a new stream, argued Alam and Orser.

Fuda and Orser are optimistic about the future of anesthesiology care in Canada. Since the beginning of the COVID pandemic, said Fuda, “I can safely say that things did get better. So I'm very optimistic that within just a few years, things are probably going to get better to the point where we might go back to not having any shortage at all.”","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

In a pooled post hoc analysis, the administration of subcutaneous inclisiran for 540 days led to significantly greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels than that of placebo in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or its risk equivalent. This effect was observed even in patients with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as low as 15 mL/min/1.73 m2.

""Inclisiran, administered twice-yearly (after initial and 3-month doses) with maximum-tolerated statins or other oral lipid-lowering therapies, provide sustained and effective LDL cholesterol lowering with favorable safety for a broad range of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease including those with advanced CKD [chronic kidney disease],"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Ulf Landmesser, Deutsches Herzzentrum der Charité, Berlin, Germany. It was published online on January 28, 2026, in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.

This study included very few patients with severe kidney disease. Data on the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio or urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio were not collected, limiting the evaluation of kidney damage markers. Additionally, cardiovascular outcome data were not captured in these trials, preventing the assessment of long-term cardiorenal benefits.

Classified as an altered state of consciousness alongside meditation and self-hypnosis, self-induced cognitive trance (SICT) is increasingly being studied for its underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. Emerging evidence suggests that SICT may offer a complementary therapeutic approach for selected psychiatric conditions when used in conjunction with standard treatments. These perspectives were discussed during a presentation at the Brain Congress 2026, featuring Corine Sombrun and three physicians.

Research on SICT is closely linked to Corine Sombrun's personal history. During a session dedicated to this topic at the Congress, she briefly outlined her path.

In 2001, while working as a journalist and ethnomusicologist filming a BBC documentary on shamanic rituals in Mongolia, Sombrun experienced what she described as a crisis, where she began to move, scream, and howl like a wolf, a state induced by the sounds of the drums.

Recognized by a shaman as having shamanic gifts, she was invited to undertake an apprenticeship, which she accepted, eventually becoming the first Western woman to receive the status of udgan (female shaman).

Upon returning to France, Sombrun sought scientific collaboration to demonstrate that the trance state was neither psychopathology nor simulation.

Here is a clear, smooth American English rendering that preserves the meaning and tone, following the medical news style:

“But performing an EEG or brain imaging requires remaining completely still, and using a drum is not an option. To do this, I had to adapt to laboratory constraints and induce a trance state without a shamanic drum.”

After medical tests showed that Sombrun had a healthy brain, she continued the experiments with her intuition: “To demonstrate that this trance state represents a cognitive potential accessible to everyone, not only to shamans.”

This work led to the development of SICT, a method that relies on body movements and vocalizations or sound sequences acting as inducers, without the need for ritual context, psychoactive substances, or reported adverse effects. A key feature is voluntary control, including the ability to autonomously stop the trance.

Under Sombrun's impetus, SICT has been studied scientifically through collaboration with research laboratories in Canada, Belgium, and France. In 2019, she cofounded the TranceScience Research Institute in Marseille, France, with Francis Taulelle, PhD, professor of physical chemistry at KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. This was followed in 2021 by the establishment of the TranceScience Research Institute and the TranceLab Training Institute , dedicated to training and knowledge dissemination.

Although studies remain limited, early data suggest measurable neurologic changes during trance. In one study involving 15 regular practitioners of shamanic dance, the brain regions involved in processing external information and self-awareness functioned differently during trance than during ordinary consciousness.

Another study showed altered activation of the sensory cortices, particularly in the auditory and visual regions. EEG studies in Sombrun, as a voluntary participant, demonstrated changes in beta rhythms, especially in the frontal, parietal, and occipital regions associated with self-perception.

The first studies on the phenomenological and neurophysiological characteristics of SICT are compiled here.

More recent studies presented at the congress by Agnès Trébuchon, MD, PhD, a neurologist and neurophysiologist at Hôpital de la Timone in Marseille, confirmed that cerebral changes during SICT appear to modulate the autonomic nervous system.

“The trance state seems to induce a decrease in vagal tone and increased sympathetic activity,” Trébuchon said. These findings align with subjective reports of heightened self-focus, reduced awareness of the external environment, mild dissociation, altered perceptions of space and time, decreased pain, increased muscle strength, and changes in sensory perceptions.

SICT is simple and can be rapidly induced in patients. This does not involve the use of any substances. The reported benefits of this technique include stress reduction, pain modulation, and improved quality of life. For these reasons, researchers are exploring its therapeutic potential under controlled scientific conditions within the TranceScience framework.

Several areas of research have been explored. In oncology, a study at the University of Liège, Liège, Belgium, evaluated the quality of life of patients in cancer remission. Psychiatry is a key area of interest.

Two psychiatrists trained in TranceLab presented early clinical approaches to mental health issues. Valérie Picard, MD, a psychiatrist and cognitive behavioral therapist at Clinique Belmont in Geneva, Switzerland, reported preliminary observations on SICT used as an adjunct to psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy in a patient with pathological dissociation. 

David Da Fonseca, MD, PhD, professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at Aix‑Marseille University and hospital practitioner in child and adolescent psychiatry at Assistance Publique Hôpitaux Universitaires de Marseille in Marseille, discussed potential benefits in autism spectrum disorders. He proposed that SICT offers a different perspective on stereotyped behaviors, often viewed solely as symptoms to be eliminated.

“In a neurodevelopmental disorder where verbal psychotherapy has limited engagement, SICT could help restore a sense of safety and regulate anxiety and sensory overload, allowing the patient to manage these behaviors independently,” he said.

Although promising, these case studies require confirmation through large-scale clinical trials.

Sombrun participated in several case studies, including those of Canadian researchers Pierre Flor-Henry and Pierre Etévenon. She then collaborated actively with the team at the University of Liège and University Hospital of Liège, particularly under Steven Laureys, MD, PhD; Olivia Gosseries, PhD; and Audrey Vanhaudenhuyse, PhD, GIGA-Consciousness, University of Liège, before cofounding the TranceScience Research Institute in 2019 with Taulelle. She is also the author of several books related to her life story, including The Diagonal of Joy.

The European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO) classification system identified difficult-to-treat tumours in transplant patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) on the basis of resectability, multiplicity, and spread, according to a retrospective analysis.

""Using EADO alongside AJCC and BWH [Brigham and Women's Hospital] improves management of DTT [difficult-to-treat] cSCC by making difficulty explicit and linking anatomical stage to management pathways, thereby complementing anatomical staging and potentially broadening intralesional options in difficult disease,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Javier Lara-Trigo, Department of Dermatology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain. It was published online on January 27, 2026, in the Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology & Venereology.

Although case series described clinical benefit from conventional intralesional therapies and emerging treatments, evidence remained limited, necessitating dedicated trials to define optimal regimens that balanced tumour control with graft tolerance.

There have been 36 clinical reports of children developing symptoms consistent with toxin poisoning linked to recent baby formula recalls, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed to Medscape News UK.

The agency and partner bodies received 24 notifications in England, seven in Scotland, three in Wales, one in Northern Ireland, and one from the Crown Dependencies. All involved children who had consumed affected products.

On 5 January, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) confirmed that Nestlé had begun a precautionary recall of several batches of SMA Infant Formula and Follow-On Formula in the UK. The action followed concerns about possible cereulide contamination. The recall was updated on 9 January to include additional expiry dates.

On 24 January, Danone recalled one batch of Aptamil First Infant Formula after cereulide contamination was identified.

Details of the affected Nestlé batches can be found here, and the affected Danone batch here.

The FSA said the contamination in both cases originated from a shared, third-party ingredient supplier. Arachidonic acid oil, added to infant formula to support development, was identified as the affected ingredient. 

“We received 36 clinical notifications of children developing symptoms consistent with cereulide toxin, after consuming potentially affected batches,” said Gauri Godbole, deputy director for gastrointestinal infections, food safety and one health at the UKHSA. “Given the widespread availability of the products, this is not unexpected.”

Bacillus cereus is a spore-forming bacterium that can contaminate a range of foods. Some strains can produce cereulide toxin if allowed to grow, the UKHSA said.

Cereulide is a heat-stable emetic toxin that is unlikely to be destroyed by heat treatment.

Symptoms of Bacillus cereus food poisoning and cereulide toxin poisoning typically include vomiting and may also include stomach cramping and diarrhoea. Onset is usually rapid, from 15 minutes to 6 hours after ingestion, and symptoms usually resolve within 24 hours if exposure does not continue.

More serious illness is rare. However, the UKHSA said that a “few” cases have involved liver or kidney injury, muscle breakdown, and multi-organ failure.

Young children and people who are immunocompromised are considered at higher risk of complications.

Healthcare professionals have been advised to carry out clinical assessment and stool culture for toxigenic Bacillus cereus in patients with compatible symptoms. Testing for cereulide should also be considered where available. 

“Surveillance indicators do not show unusual increases in reports of vomiting in children under the age of 1 for this time of year,” Godbole said.

The FSA advised parents and carers with affected products to stop using them and switch to an alternative. Medical advice should be sought if a baby has already consumed the formula.

Where infant formula is prescribed, parents should speak to a pharmacist or doctor before changing products, the agency said.

The UKHSA said it will continue to investigate the incident with UK and international public health and food safety partners to limit any wider public health impact.

The FDA has updated some information about the December recall of certain Abbott FreeStyle Libre 3 and 3 Plus glucose sensors.

In December 2025, FDA posted an early alert that Abbott Diabetes Care was recalling certain FreeStyle Libre 3 and FreeStyle Libre 3 Plus sensors due to incorrectly low glucose readings. Since then, Abbott has reported an additional 124 adverse events, totaling 860 serious injuries and seven deaths as of January 7, 2026. No additional deaths have been reported since November 14, 2025, and none of those were in the US.

The affected products haven't changed, but the list of affected lots has been modified for clarity. They are:

FreeStyle Libre 3 Sensor

FreeStyle Libre 3 Plus Sensor

FreeStyle Libre 3 readers and mobile apps are not affected, nor are any other Libre products (FreeStyle Libre 14 day, FreeStyle Libre 2, FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus, or Libre Pro sensors) or Abbott biowearables.

The following advice to clinicians remains the same:

An artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tool that characterizes lung nodules has earned clearance from the FDA, according to a press release from manufacturer RevealDx.

The RevealAI-Lung software incorporates AI and radiomics to help radiologists characterize lung nodules on imaging more quickly and with fewer false positives, according to the company. The tool analyzes nodule images and generates a malignancy score called the Malignancy Similarity Index to assess risk and identify malignant nodules, which may promote earlier intervention and reduce unnecessary procedures.

The RevealAI-Lung CADx was validated in more than 1500 patients from a range of populations, according to the press release, and it is designed to integrate with the Picture Archiving and Communication System to improve workflow.

Although data are limited, a recent retrospective study in the UK of 100 control individuals and 100 cancer patients with confirmed diagnoses showed that RevealAI-Lung would have upgraded 44% of the patients with cancer, thereby significantly reducing delayed cancer diagnoses from 45% to 25%, according to the researchers.

The clearance allows for Medicare reimbursement via codes 0721T and 0722T and follows the company's MDR certification from the EU for the technology in November 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Too many antioxidants may negatively affect future offspring","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260204/Too-many-antioxidants-may-negatively-affect-future-offspring.aspx","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:57:00 GMT","

Antioxidants have been marketed as miracle supplements, touted for preventing chronic diseases and cancers; treating COPD and dementia; and slowing aging.

While antioxidant therapies are widely used to treat male infertility, a new study from the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (VMBS) found that regularly consuming high doses of antioxidants negatively influences sperm DNA and may lead to offspring born with differences in craniofacial development.

In a study, published in the journal Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, a team of researchers led by Dr. Michael Golding examined the effects of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and selenium (Se) - two widely used antioxidants - in mouse models.

They found that offspring of male mice exposed to antioxidants for six weeks exhibited skull and facial shape differences, even while the father's health didn't change.

These findings suggest that men should exercise caution when consuming high doses of antioxidants, especially if they're planning to have children in the near future.

Antioxidants like NAC - which is a key ingredient in many nutritional supplements, including multivitamins - are often used to treat oxidative stress, which can be caused by excessive alcohol consumption.

Because Golding's lab has been studying the effects of parental alcohol consumption on offspring - and has successfully correlated this consumption to a whole host of issues in children born to males who consumed excessive amounts of alcohol, including craniofacial abnormalities - his team was interested in the impacts of adding NAC or Se to a male mouse's diet.

We know alcohol causes oxidative stress and we were looking to push back on it by adding a supplement known to lower oxidative stress. When we realized that offspring born to males that had only been given NAC were displaying skull and facial differences, it was a surprise because this molecule is universally thought to be good.

When we sat down to think it through, we realized that it makes sense - you take a multivitamin to ensure that you're in balance, but if the thing that you're taking to ensure you're in balance is unbalanced (the dose of antioxidants is too high), then you're not doing a good thing.""

Dr. Michael Golding, professor, VMBS' Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology

It is well established that high doses of antioxidants can have negative impacts; research has proven that antioxidants can diminish the effects of exercise in endurance athletes, for example, and, in the case of professional athletes, can lead to negative outcomes in performance metrics.

""Sperm health is another performance metric; it's just not one that we think about in everyday life,"" Golding said. ""If you're taking a high dose antioxidant, you could be diminishing your reproductive fitness and part of the journey toward the bad outcome is going to be the effects on the offspring.""

Among their unanticipated findings was that female offspring, in particular, exhibited significantly closer-set eyes and smaller skulls, which are also symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome.

""There's a very commonly accepted truism in pediatric medicine that the face mirrors the brain, because the brain and the face form at the same time,"" Golding said. ""When your face migrates (during gestation), it's using cues from your brain to know where to go, and if the two things are not aligned, there's either a delay or some kind of abnormality in brain development.

""So, if you see abnormalities in the midline of the face, you're probably going to see midline abnormalities in the brain,"" he said. ""People with these abnormalities typically have problems with impulse control, neurological conditions like epilepsy, and other developmental issues.""

Whether the offspring in this project will exhibit central nervous system dysfunction will require further study.

While the lab continues to research this ""unexplored frontier,"" Golding says in the case of antioxidants, too much of a good thing can, in fact, be too much, especially in the absence of a medical reason to take an antioxidant supplement.

Because many men regularly take high doses of these supplements - including products that contain antioxidant-rich ingredients - it's important to pay attention to how much of these compounds are listed on the label. This includes NAC, which is one of the key ingredients in many multivitamins and is often found in high doses in these pills.

""The larger message here is that there's a balance,"" Golding said. ""Think of yourself as a plant - if you stick your plant out in the sun too long, it's going to get dehydrated. If you overwater your plant, it gets root rot. But if you have the right balance of sunshine and water, that's when growth occurs. Health is in that domain.

""If your vitamins are providing 1,000% of the recommended daily amount, you should be cautious,"" he said. ""If you stick to the 100% range, then you should be OK.""

New research explores how attention difficulties, sleep disruption, and cognitive control challenges intersect with internet use patterns, highlighting lifestyle factors like exercise that may help reduce risk while underscoring the need for cautious interpretation of cross-sectional findings.



Study: The interplay between attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and internet addiction: executive dysfunction and insomnia as mediators and the role of physical activity. Image Credit: Melinda Nagy / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Psychiatry, researchers assessed the relationship between ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) symptoms, insomnia, executive dysfunction, and IA (internet addiction) in college students.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hyperactivity, inattention, cognitive deficits, emotional impulsivity, and learning difficulties. IA has also emerged as a substantial public health concern. IA and ADHD are closely related, with individuals showing ADHD symptoms more likely to report IA. Despite evidence of co-occurrence, the precise directional relationship remains unclear. Because this study used a cross-sectional design, causal relationships cannot be established, and the findings should be interpreted as associations rather than cause-and-effect relationships.

Executive dysfunction is a common comorbidity in ADHD, affecting domains such as attention control, working memory, inhibitory control, and planning. Executive function (EF), which broadly refers to cognitive processes involved in self-regulation, organization, and goal-directed behaviour, plays a key role in impulse control. Deficits in EF may elevate the risk of IA among individuals with ADHD. Insomnia, which is also common in people with ADHD, may further aggravate executive dysfunction. These relationships may be bidirectional, as problematic internet use itself can worsen sleep patterns.

Previous studies have reported that physical activity can reduce IA symptoms and improve mental health outcomes. Physical activity may also alleviate executive dysfunction and insomnia. However, most prior research has examined these factors in isolation, with limited attention to their combined effects. Consequently, the complex interactions among physical activity, sleep, executive function, and IA remain underexplored, particularly in non-Western educational settings such as Chinese universities, where digital engagement patterns may differ.

In the present study, researchers evaluated associations among ADHD symptoms, IA, insomnia, and executive dysfunction. Students aged 16 years and older from six universities in Hunan, China, were recruited, and surveys were administered in June 2024. The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) was used as a screening tool, comprising hyperactivity and inattention subscales, with scores ranging from 0 to 9.

A total ASRS score greater than nine indicated clinical-level ADHD symptoms rather than a formal diagnosis, as the scale functions as a screening instrument. Executive dysfunction was assessed using the Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale, Short Form (BDEFS-SF), with higher scores indicating more severe impairment. Insomnia was assessed using the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), which ranges from 0 to 24, with scores of 6 or higher indicating increased risk of insomnia.

IA was assessed using the Chinese IA Scale, Revision (CIAS-R), which evaluates compulsive use and withdrawal, tolerance, time management problems, and interpersonal and health-related concerns. A total CIAS-R score above 53 indicated clinically significant IA symptoms. Information on physical activity, including duration, frequency, and type, was also collected.

Participants were categorized into high-, moderate-, and low-physical-activity groups and compared with inactive individuals. Group differences were assessed using chi-squared tests for categorical variables, and Mann–Whitney U tests for continuous variables. Mediating effects of insomnia and executive dysfunction in the relationship between ADHD symptoms and IA were evaluated using structural equation modelling. This method identifies statistical associations but cannot confirm causality or temporal ordering.

The study initially recruited 2,188 students, of whom 263 were excluded due to incomplete responses, yielding an analytic sample of 1,925 participants. Among these, 14 percent met criteria for IA symptoms, and 12.5 percent met criteria for ADHD symptoms. No significant differences in age, sex, or academic grade were observed between participants with and without IA symptoms.

Participants with IA symptoms had higher ASRS, BDEFS-SF, and AIS scores than those without IA. They also reported lower exercise intensity, fewer exercise habits, poorer adherence to exercise routines, and shorter exercise duration per session.

ADHD symptoms were associated with IA symptoms, with executive dysfunction and insomnia statistically mediating this relationship. Because the data were cross-sectional, these mediation findings should be interpreted cautiously, as temporal sequencing cannot be confirmed. Participants who reported regular exercise habits had lower CIAS-R, BDEFS-SF, and AIS scores and were more likely to be male and in lower academic grades.

Compared with no physical activity, moderate physical activity was negatively associated with IA symptoms, and this association was stronger at high levels of physical activity. These relationships were also mediated by executive dysfunction and insomnia. Low levels of physical activity were not significantly associated with IA symptoms. Unmeasured factors such as stress, mood symptoms, or academic pressure may also have influenced these associations.

Overall, ADHD symptoms were associated with IA symptoms in Chinese college students, with insomnia and executive dysfunction acting as mediating factors. Moderate and high levels of physical activity were associated with lower IA risk, with the association mediated by sleep quality and executive function. These findings suggest that interventions for IA may benefit from addressing sleep, physical activity, and executive functioning. However, reliance on self-reported data, regional sampling, and a cross-sectional design limits generalizability and causal interpretation. Longitudinal and interventional studies are needed before firm clinical recommendations can be made.

Testing menstrual blood for human papillomavirus (HPV) could be a ""robust alternative or replacement"" for current cervical cancer screening by a clinician, finds a study from China published by The BMJ today.

The researchers say using menstrual blood for HPV testing is convenient and non-invasive, allowing women to collect samples at home, and therefore could offer a practical pathway to expand access to screening.

Certain types of HPV infection can develop into cervical cancer and HPV testing is a key part of cervical screening. But not all women attend screening appointments for reasons including fear of pain, concerns about privacy and stigma, and lack of awareness.

Testing menstrual blood for HPV infection shows promise as a convenient, non-invasive alternative to screening, but evidence is limited.

To address this gap, researchers in China compared the diagnostic accuracy of menstrual blood versus clinician collected cervical samples for detecting high grade (CIN2+ / CIN3+) cervical lesions, which typically require treatment.

Their findings are based on 3,068 women aged 20-54 years with regular menstrual cycles, enrolled between September 2021 and January 2025 at four urban and three rural communities in Hubei Province, China.

Each participant provided three samples for testing: a menstrual blood sample collected using a minipad - a sterile cotton strip attached to the absorbent area of a standard sanitary pad (index test), a clinician collected cervical sample (comparator test), and an additional clinician collected cervical sample for laboratory processing.

A WeChat mobile app (Early Test) was also available to participants to access test results and advice from healthcare providers.

The main outcome measure was diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the tests. Sensitivity indicates how well a test picks up people who have a disease and specificity indicates how well a test picks up those who don't.

Minipad collected samples for HPV testing showed a sensitivity of 94.7% for detecting CIN2+ which was comparable to clinician collected samples (92.1%).

Although minipad samples showed a lower specificity than clinician samples (89.1% v 90.0%), the negative predictive value - the probability that a person with a negative test result truly does not have the disease - was identical (99.9%) for both collection methods.

There was also no significant difference in positive predictive value - the probability that a person with a positive test result truly has the disease - between both collection methods (9.9% v 10.4%) and referral for further testing (colposcopy) was comparable (10.1 v 9.6 referrals per CIN2+ detected).

Integration with the Early Test mobile app further streamlined result reporting and patient communication, enhancing the feasibility of large scale implementation of screening, note the authors.

These are observational findings so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, and the authors acknowledge several study limitations that warrant careful consideration.

However, they say: ""The results of this large scale community based study show the utility of using minipad collected menstrual blood for HPV testing as a standardised, non-invasive alternative or replacement for cervical cancer screening.""

A Case Western Reserve University professor has developed an innovative card deck designed to help children manage stress and build emotional resilience in today's challenging world.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic-and amid ongoing global and societal stressors-Jennifer King, an associate professor and co-director of the Center on Trauma and Adversity at the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve, realized that people needed to know the fundamentals of stress management. She created ""Take a Break"" micropractice cards in 2022 to help people relax, calm, or reenergize their bodies and minds.

And now King has developed a children's version.

The new ""Take a Break KIDS"" edition transforms evidence-based, stress-management techniques into simple one- to three-minute activities that kids can use anywhere, anytime.

With children facing unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the card deck offers practical solutions for parents, teachers and mental health professionals seeking effective tools to support children's emotional wellbeing.

Kids aren't struggling because there's something wrong with them. They are responding to a world that is increasingly asking too much of their nervous systems. When kids learn how to take small breaks in moments of stress, they build skills that support regulation, resilience and connection over time.""

Jennifer King, associate professor and co-director of the Center on Trauma and Adversity at the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences, Case Western Reserve

""Take a Break KIDSs"" represents a significant evolution from traditional mindfulness tools. The deck features 40 diverse practices organized into color-coded categories-movement, breath, self-touch and partner activities-making it easy for users to find the right technique for any situation.

For younger children, each card includes memorable rhyming instructions that leverage rhythm to support learning and emotional regulation. QR codes on every card link to detailed digital resources, allowing tweens and teens to access the practices independently. Adults receive comprehensive background information and implementation guidance to understand the science behind each technique.

The deck's development was inspired by feedback King, who has extensive experience working clinically with children, adolescents, families and adults, received from educators and mental health professionals using the original adult version with children.

""I heard from many teachers and mental health professionals who were using the original 'Take a Break' card deck with their students and clients,"" King said. ""While the kids found the practices helpful, the professionals were unsure how to explain the benefits to parents. I needed to create something that was both kid- and parent-friendly.""

Designed to grow with children from early childhood through adolescence, Take a Break KIDS supports the development of lifelong skills for stress management, emotional regulation, and connection.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study reveals what drives PFAS exposure in firefighters and how risks may be reduced","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260204/Study-reveals-what-drives-PFAS-exposure-in-firefighters-and-how-risks-may-be-reduced.aspx","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:52:00 GMT","

New research in U.S. firefighters reveals how workplace practices, personal factors, and environmental exposures shape PFAS levels, offering insights into practical strategies to reduce long-term chemical exposure risk.



Study: Predictors of serum per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) levels among U.S. career firefighters. Image Credit: Rapit Design / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, researchers investigated factors predicting serum concentrations of multiple per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) among American firefighters. The findings identified distinct personal and workplace predictors for specific PFAS analytes rather than uniform effects across all compounds, reflecting differences in chemical subclasses and exposure pathways and highlighting potential targets for exposure-reduction interventions.

PFAS are synthetic chemicals widely used for their water- and grease-resistant properties and are often referred to as “forever chemicals” due to their environmental persistence. They are present in numerous consumer and industrial products, including aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF), textiles, cookware, and food packaging, resulting in widespread contamination of air, water, soil, and food.

As a consequence, nearly the entire U.S. population has detectable PFAS levels, with these compounds accumulating in human tissues over the years. Exposure has been associated with adverse health outcomes, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, endocrine disruption, and accelerated biological aging.

Firefighters may experience elevated PFAS exposure through occupational use of AFFF, combustion of PFAS-containing materials, contaminated dust, and contact with protective gear. Previous studies have reported higher serum PFAS concentrations among firefighters and identified limited predictors such as years of service and blood donation. However, knowledge of modifiable individual- and organizational-level predictors remains limited.

Researchers evaluated agency-level, occupational, lifestyle, and demographic predictors of serum PFAS concentrations in a large, multi-state cohort of United States firefighters. This cross-sectional analysis included 2,056 participants from the Fire Fighter Cancer Cohort Study (FFCCS), a national cohort established to examine occupational exposures and health outcomes.

Participants provided blood samples between July 2023 and October 2024 during baseline or follow-up visits and were employed at fire agencies across seven states. Individual-level data were collected via electronic surveys covering demographics, lifestyle behaviours, health history, firefighting practices, and occupational exposures. Agency-level data, including departmental policies and resources, were obtained from designated fire service liaisons.

Blood samples were processed and analysed for 20 PFAS analytes using a standardized CDC laboratory method. Eight analytes with concentrations above the limit of detection in at least 75% of participants were included in the primary analyses. Serum PFAS concentrations were log-transformed, and values below detection limits were imputed using standard approaches.

Associations between predictors and PFAS concentrations were assessed using adjusted linear regression and linear mixed-effects models, accounting for demographic covariates and clustering by fire agency where appropriate. Results were reported as percent changes in geometric mean concentrations with corresponding confidence intervals.

The cohort was predominantly male, White, and non-Hispanic, with a mean age of 40 years and an average firefighting career length of 14 years. All eight primary PFAS analytes were detected at high frequencies. Age was positively associated with all measured compounds, while female firefighters exhibited significantly lower concentrations across analytes.

Several non-occupational predictors were identified. Blood and plasma donation were strongly associated with lower PFAS levels, particularly among plasma donors. Drinking water source also influenced exposure: bottled water was associated with lower concentrations of certain PFAS (notably PFOA-related measures and PFNA), whereas well water use was associated with higher concentrations. Military service was associated with elevated PFAS-related measures.

Occupational factors played a substantial role. Longer service duration, higher rank, and current AFFF use were primarily associated with increased concentrations of PFOA-related analytes rather than uniformly higher PFAS levels. Protective practices such as on-scene decontamination and participation in hood swap or cleaning programmes were associated with lower concentrations of some PFAS, particularly PFOA-related compounds.

Agency-level policies also mattered. Practices such as washing gear before storage, providing gear bags, frequent dusting of living quarters, and the use of reverse osmosis water filtration were associated with reduced concentrations of specific PFAS analytes, for example, PFNA. Conversely, carpeted station living areas were linked to higher levels. Some findings were unexpected, including higher PFHxS levels in departments with marked contamination zones and higher PFHpS concentrations under less frequent dusting schedules, suggesting complex, potentially compound-specific exposure pathways.

This study identified multiple individual- and department-level predictors of serum PFAS concentrations among United States firefighters, underscoring the importance of both personal behaviours and workplace practices. Associations with age, sex, military service, drinking water source, and AFFF use were consistent with prior research, while novel findings emerged for firefighter rank and specific agency policies.

Notably, blood and plasma donation were strong predictors of lower PFAS concentrations, supporting evidence that these practices may reduce body burden. Protective occupational practices and station policies were associated with lower concentrations of selected analytes rather than across all PFAS, highlighting heterogeneity between subclasses and exposure routes and pointing to actionable intervention opportunities.

Strengths of the study include its large sample size, multi-state design, and integration of individual- and agency-level data. Limitations include the cross-sectional design, reliance on self-reported data, and potential regional influences on generalisability. Despite these constraints, the findings provide valuable evidence to guide PFAS exposure-reduction strategies. Longitudinal and intervention studies are needed to confirm causality and evaluate the effectiveness of targeted policy and behavioural changes within the fire service.

PC-based audiometry has seen significant advancements in recent years. It offers improved features, increased user support, and an increasing capacity to integrate seamlessly into clinical practice. PC-based audiometry also stores data rapidly and easily, helping to prepare for further stages of a subject's rehabilitation.

Despite these many benefits, many operators still rely on hardware-based audiometers to perform audiometry. Non-PC-based audiometers are familiar to many professionals and offer a rapid testing solution; however, these instruments do not integrate into current EMR systems, slowing down the process by adding further steps to the workflow.

Using software and hardware allows hearing health experts and clinicians to access better, more flexible, and more cost-effective solutions. This results in a more connected, efficient, and streamlined clinical workflow.

The transition to PC-based audiometry is straightforward, offering a number of key advantages.

Conventional audiometry leverages manually controlled devices and often requires significant time-consuming paperwork. PC-based audiometers streamline these tasks via the upfront preparation and automation of a range of behaviors before prompting the next steps.

Hearing health professionals can focus less of their attention on the technology and more on the subject. PC-based software can also automatically change test frequencies and intensities, saving setup time and maintaining consistent test conditions.

Traditional audiometers typically have high upfront costs, particularly in the case of models designed for bone conduction testing or speech audiometry that boast many features or special abilities.

Users can update PC-based systems more easily and with reduced financial outlay versus hardware-based systems. It is often possible to perform software updates, troubleshooting, and repairs rapidly and remotely, including the addition of new features.

PC-based audiometers generally feature user-friendly interfaces, including simple menus, touch screens, and clear instructions. This user-friendliness allows occupational health professionals and audiologists to learn how to operate the system with minimal training, as well as allowing them to explain test results to the patient in an easy-to-understand manner.

The introduction of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) guidelines has seen increased regulations in the areas of data collection and storage, along with an increased emphasis on digitizing this data.

While a historic focus has been on physical reports and record files, these hardcopy data formats were not easy to access across larger systems. The advent of cloud storage and remote data locations for servers now offers a range of advantages:

Each patient has individual needs, and PC-based systems can better accommodate personal preferences by making the overall workflow more tailored to specific patient requirements. For instance, an audiologist working with a child may alter a tests' loudness, pitch, duration or use more detailed tests when working with older patients.

It is also possible to apply test protocols and parameters across wide computer system installations, ensuring that all users in an organization perform tests in the same way.

Conventional audiometric testing typically requires that the operator interpret results during the testing process, potentially introducing inconsistency or bias. Many PC-based audiometric systems have built-in tools, however, allowing hearing data to be analyzed and presented in various formats.

PC-based audiometers enable rapid visualization of relevant audiometry and tympanometry data in graphical form, minimizing human bias in interpreting thresholds and allowing more objective findings.

PC-based audiometers also enable simpler communication of the results to subjects and healthcare providers, and the digital storage of test data allows audiologists to more easily track changes in a patient's hearing over time.

Long-term data is highly beneficial when looking to track hearing loss, as well evaluating the success of treatments like surgeries or hearing aids.

PC-based systems also tend to facilitate the generation of customized reports, reducing administrative workload by allowing the easy printing, emailing, or uploading of these reports to the subject's digital health record.

The integration of PC-based audiometers with office management systems and EMR (Electronic Medical Records) helps to streamline data management by reducing the manual entry requirements and the risk of potential errors.

Seamless connectivity via PC-based systems allows instant access to patient data, allowing timely and informed decision-making. Ultimately, this integration is key to facilitating a bespoke, task-focused end-to-end workflow.

The benefits of PC-based audiometers reflect a more general trend toward the integration of advanced technology into audiometric practices, with the goal of enhancing accuracy, efficiency, and patient care.

A new study, jointly led by Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and the Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases (CRID) in Cameroon, has detected a DNA marker in a gene encoding for a key enzyme, known as cytochrome P450, that helps mosquitoes to break down and survive exposure to pyrethroids, the main insecticides used for treating bed nets.

This new finding, published in Science Translational Medicine, will help to better implement insecticide resistance management strategies and contribute to reducing the burden of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, home to 90% of cases globally. 

Our study designed field-applicable tools to easily track the spread of metabolic resistance in the major malaria mosquito species and assess its impact on control interventions. These important findings can help to maintain the effectiveness of insecticide-based tools such as bed nets which remain a cornerstone of malaria prevention.""

Professor Charles Wondji, Professor of Genetics and Vector Biology at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and lead author on the study

Bed nets and indoor residual spraying have been critical to controlling the spread of malaria, but progress has slowed over the last decade because of increased insecticide resistance, notably through metabolic resistance processes in mosquitoes through the production of detoxification enzymes.

This growing global threat must be addressed to improve the effectiveness of current and future vector control strategies and further reduce the malaria burden, with 200 million cases and 600,000 deaths annually worldwide. 

Previous studies have identified genetic markers for other forms of resistance, but identifying DNA-based mechanisms in mosquitoes that cause metabolic resistance has proven more challenging.

This new research is the first to identify a DNA marker for metabolic pyrethroid resistance in West and Central African populations of Anopheles gambiae, one of the main malaria-carrying mosquito species.

Based on this marker, the researchers developed a reliable diagnostic test that will enable the detection and monitoring of pyrethroid resistance, the assessment of potential cross-resistance to new insecticides, and ultimately better inform choice of bed nets according to the genetic make-up of targeted mosquito populations.

Announcing a new article publication for BIO Integration journal. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound nanoparticles secreted by cells and have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for osteoarthritis (OA).

These vesicles exhibit high biocompatibility and the intrinsic ability to traverse physiologic barriers, delivering bioactive molecular cargo to recipient cells to exert regulatory effects. To enhance therapeutic efficacy, EVs can be bioengineered to improve biological activity and targeting capacity toward specific cells or tissues. Strategies for EV engineering primarily involve modifications to cargo, membranes, or the pretreatment of parental cells. In recent years advances in EV engineering have led to growing interest in the application of engineered EVs for OA treatment, offering new possibilities for clinical translation. This review summarizes the fundamental characteristics of EVs and examine the factors limiting the current therapeutic efficacy in OA.

An overview of existing engineering strategies and a discussion of the therapeutic applications of engineered EVs in OA models is also provided. Finally the remaining challenges and future directions necessary to advance EV-based therapies toward clinical use in OA are outlined.

Giving the clot-busting medication alteplase at the site of a blocked brain artery after blood clot removal may increase the number of patients who fully recover, according to preliminary late-breaking science presented at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference 2026. The meeting, Feb. 4 - 6, 2026, in New Orleans, is a world premier meeting for researchers and clinicians dedicated to the science of stroke and brain health.

Large-artery ischemic (clot-caused) strokes account for about 1 in 4 ischemic strokes, according to study author ángel Chamorro, M.D., Ph.D., professor of neurology at the University of Barcelona and head of the Comprehensive Stroke Center Hospital Clinic in Barcelona.

These types of strokes can cause death and long-term disability because they block large arteries that supply blood to significant areas of the brain.

2026 Guideline for the Early Management of Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke, from the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association, notes that removing clots directly from blocked brain arteries, a procedure called thrombectomy, is a powerful treatment for major strokes caused by large-vessel blockages in select patients.

However, more than half of stroke survivors who have their large artery successfully cleared do not achieve full recovery 90 days later. Stroke treatment continues to improve, and getting the right care quickly can make a real difference in a patient's recovery and return to their everyday life. Even when doctors successfully reopen a blocked brain artery, novel treatment strategies such as adding alteplase to thrombectomy can further improve outcomes after a stroke.""

 ángel Chamorro, M.D., Ph.D., professor of neurology, University of Barcelona

In the CHOICE2 trial reported today, more than 400 adults with large-artery ischemic stroke were treated at stroke centers in Spain within 4.5 to 24 hours of their first stroke symptoms, making it possible to both remove the clot in the large artery and to have the option of treatment with alteplase to the same location immediately after. Patients were randomized to receive either clot removal (219 people) or clot removal plus infusion of alteplase into the artery (214 people).

At 90 days after treatment, participants who received clot-busting medication in addition to clot removal:

""Mechanical thrombectomy alone is often not enough to fully restore blood flow to the injured brain, even when the blocked artery appears successfully reopened. Standard imaging can miss persistent blockages in the brain's smallest blood vessels. Intra-arterial alteplase given after successful thrombectomy significantly increased the chances of an excellent recovery,"" Chamorro said.

In an earlier study, preliminary results from CHOICE, published in 2022, revealed significantly better outcomes in stroke survivors who were treated with alteplase in addition to thrombectomy. However, the number of patients in the study was relatively small (121), and the trial was halted early due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which interfered with patient recruitment and the supply of placebos.

Similar research (the ANGEL-TNK trial) that used the clot-dissolving agent tenecteplase was presented last year at the International Stroke Conference and had comparable results. The PEARL trial used alteplase and had comparable results.

The limitations of this study include the requirement for non-contrast CT scanning during the follow-up period, which reflects real-world clinical practice but may not provide detailed information about brain tissue injury and recovery.

Although the study was conducted only in Spain, participants were from 20 countries across three continents; therefore, the results should be generalizable to many populations.

""These results are practice-informing but not yet practice-changing on their own,"" Chamorro said. ""While CHOICE2 strengthens the evidence that intra-arterial alteplase given after successful thrombectomy can improve recovery, broader adoption will require confirmation in additional studies, guideline review and careful consideration of patient selection. Importantly, this approach should not be viewed as a 'one-size-fits-all' treatment. It is most likely to benefit patients who, despite large-vessel reopening, have evidence of inadequate blood flow in their microcirculation. However, if future studies and meta-analyses confirm the safety of this strategy, it may eventually reduce the need to rely on advanced imaging techniques to identify patients with persistent perfusion abnormalities appropriate for this treatment.""

In addition to confirming the findings of CHOICE2, future research will focus on ways to treat the underlying causes leading to the disruption of blood flow in the microcirculation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New survey reveals widespread myths about Hands-Only CPR","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260204/New-survey-reveals-widespread-myths-about-Hands-Only-CPR.aspx","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 03:02:00 GMT","

New consumer survey findings from the American Heart Association show that nearly six in every ten American adults still incorrectly believe only those with special training should perform Hands-Only CPR. The perpetuation of this myth can be the difference between life and death as science tells us immediate CPR is proven to improve outcomes. Because most cardiac emergencies happen outside of a hospital setting, the fastest way for anyone to be a ""first responder until help arrives"" and save a life is to call 9-1-1 and immediately take action with Hands-Only CPR. Research indicates Hands-Only CPR can double or even triple a person's chance of survival.

Launching this February during Heart Month 2026, the Heart Association's theme, You Are the First Responder Until Help Arrives, reinforces a simple truth: you don't need medical credentials to save a life; all you need is basic knowledge, courage and the willingness to act. Today, bystanders step in with CPR only about 41% of the time. The American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health for all, is working to change that.

People tell us they're afraid they'll 'do it wrong' or think CPR requires having a certification or taking class before they can help. Here's what matters - if a teen or adult collapses: call 911, then push hard and fast in the center of the chest. Your hands can keep blood flowing until professionals arrive.""

Stacey E. Rosen, M.D., FAHA, volunteer president of the American Heart Association and senior vice president of women's health and executive director of the Katz Institute for Women's Health of Northwell Health, New York City

Each year in the United States, more than 350,000 cardiac arrests happen outside of a hospital and about 90% are fatal. Most occur at home, where a loved one may be the only one nearby to help. Kristen Walenga, 47 at the time, of Frankfort, Ill., was the only adult at home when she collapsed from sudden cardiac arrest while making breakfast one Saturday morning. Her 15-year-old son, Eddie, who had learned CPR from the American Heart Association's Kids Heart Challenge program when he was in middle school, knew what to do and immediately took action. With his other siblings calling 911 for help, he started chest compressions until paramedics arrived. Kristen survived because of her child's preparation and courage.

To bust the ""special training"" myth, it is important to understand that Hands-Only CPR for teens and adults has two simple steps: (1) call 911; and (2) push hard and fast in the center of the chest at 100–120 beats per minute, about the tempo of ""Stayin' Alive"" or ""Uptown Funk."" If an automated external defibrillator (AED) that can shock a heart back into a normal rhythm is available, turn it on and follow the voice prompts. For infants and children, CPR must include breaths.

You can learn CPR today with fast, flexible options for everyone. During American Heart Month, the Heart Association invites people to choose the path that fits their life, at home, at work or at school.

Many people hesitate and some groups, including women and Black adults, are still less likely to receive CPR. The Heart Association's focus specifically addresses barriers such as concerns about doing it ""wrong,"" fear of legal ramifications and worries about inappropriate contact, as well as the persistent belief that special training is required, a perception that is even more common in historically excluded communities.

""CPR is a civic duty. Heroism is not limited to uniforms, it is everyday people stepping up for others,"" said Rosen. ""Strong communities are built by preparedness. Whether you're at home, the gym, or a child's soccer game, cardiac arrest can happen anywhere, and you will most likely be saving the life of someone you know and love. Being prepared and willing to help strengthens the fabric of our nation.""

""You Are the First Responder"" aligns with the Heart Association's Nation of Lifesavers initiative, sponsored nationally by Walgreens, to turn more bystanders into lifesavers and double survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by 2030.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Newsom walks thin line on immigrant health as he eyes presidential bid","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20260205/Newsom-walks-thin-line-on-immigrant-health-as-he-eyes-presidential-bid.aspx","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 10:52:00 GMT","

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is eyeing a presidential bid, has incensed both Democrats and Republicans over immigrant health care in his home state, underscoring the delicate political path ahead.

For a second year, the Democrat has asked state lawmakers to roll back coverage for some immigrants in the face of federal Medicaid spending cuts and a roughly $3 billion budget deficit that analysts warn could worsen if the artificial intelligence bubble bursts. Newsom has proposed that the state not step in when, starting in October, the federal government stops providing health coverage to an estimated 200,000 legal residents — comprising asylees, refugees, and others.

Progressive legislators and activists said the cost-saving measures are a departure from Newsom's ""health for all"" pledge, while Republicans continue to skewer Newsom for using public funds to cover any noncitizens.

Newsom's latest move would save an estimated $786 million this fiscal year and $1.1 billion annually in future years in a proposed budget of $349 billion, according to the Department of Finance.

State Sen. Caroline Menjivar, one of two Senate Democrats who voted against Newsom's immigrant health cuts last year, said she worried the governor's political ambition could be getting in the way of doing what's best for Californians.

""You're clouded by what Arkansas is going to think, or Tennessee is going to think, when what California thinks is something completely different,"" said Menjivar, who said previous criticism got her temporarily removed from a key budget subcommittee. ""That's my perspective on what's happening here.""

Meanwhile, Republican state Sen. Tony Strickland criticized Newsom for glossing over the state's structural deficit, which state officials say could balloon to $27 billion the following year. And he slammed Newsom for continuing to cover California residents in the U.S. without authorization. ""He just wants to reinvent himself,"" Strickland said.

It's a political tightrope that will continue to grow thinner as federal support shrinks amid ever-rising health care expenses, said Guian McKee, a co-chair of the Health Care Policy Project at the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs.

""It's not just threading one needle but threading three or four of them right in a row,"" McKee said. Should Newsom run, McKee added, the priorities of Democratic primary voters — who largely mirror blue states like California — look very different from those in a far more divided general electorate.

Americans are deeply divided on whether the government should provide health coverage to immigrants without legal status. In a KFF poll last year, a slim majority — 54% — were against a provision that would have penalized states that use their own funds to pay for immigrant health care, with wide variation by party. The provision was left out of the final version of the bill passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump.

Even in California, support for the idea has waned amid ongoing budget problems. In a May survey by the Public Policy Institute of California, 41% of adults in the state said they supported providing health coverage to immigrants who lack legal status, a sharp drop from the 55% who supported it in 2023.

Trump, Vice President JD Vance, other administration officials, and congressional Republicans have repeatedly accused California and other Democratic states of using taxpayer funds on immigrant health care, a red-meat issue for their GOP base. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz has accused California of ""gaming the system"" to receive more federal funds, freeing up state coffers for its Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal, which has enrolled roughly 1.6 million immigrants without legal status.

""If you are a taxpayer in Texas or Florida, your tax dollars could've been used to fund the care of illegal immigrants in California,"" he said in October.

California state officials have denied the charges, noting that only state funds are used to pay for general health services for those without legal status because the law prohibits using federal funds. Instead, Newsom has made it a ""point of pride"" that California has opened up coverage to immigrants, which his administration has noted keeps people healthier and helps them avoid costly emergency room care often covered at taxpayer expense.

""No administration has done more to expand full coverage under Medicaid than this administration for our diverse communities, documented and undocumented,"" Newsom told reporters in January. ""People have built careers out of criticizing my advocacy.""

Newsom warns the federal government's ""carnival of chaos"" passed Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he said puts 1.8 million Californians at risk of losing their health coverage with the implementation of work requirements, other eligibility rules, and limits to federal funding to states.

Nationally, 10 million people could lose coverage by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Health economists have said higher numbers of uninsured patients — particularly those who are relatively healthy — could concentrate coverage among sicker patients, potentially increasing premium costs and hospital prices overall.

Immigrant advocates say it's especially callous to leave residents who may have fled violence or survived trafficking or abuse without access to health care. Federal rules currently require state Medicaid programs to cover ""qualified noncitizens"" including asylees and refugees, according to Tanya Broder of the National Immigration Law Center. But the Republican tax-and-spending law ends the coverage, affecting an estimated 1.4 million legal immigrants nationwide.

With many state governors yet to release budget proposals, it's unclear how they might handle the funding gaps, Broder said.

For instance, Colorado state officials estimate roughly 7,000 legal immigrants could lose coverage due to the law's changes. And Washington state officials estimate 3,000 refugees, asylees, and other lawfully present immigrants will lose Medicaid.

Both states, like California, expanded full coverage to all income-eligible residents regardless of immigration status. Their elected officials are now in the awkward position of explaining why some legal immigrants may lose their health care coverage while those without legal status could keep theirs.

Last year, spiraling health care costs and state budget constraints prompted the Democratic governors of Illinois and Minnesota, potential presidential contenders JB Pritzker and Tim Walz, to pause or end coverage of immigrants without legal status.

California lawmakers last year voted to eliminate dental coverage and freeze new enrollment for immigrants without legal status and, starting next year, will charge monthly premiums to those who remain. Even so, the state is slated to spend $13.8 billion from its general fund on immigrants not covered by the federal government, according to Department of Finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer.

At a press conference in San Francisco in January, Newsom defended those moves, saying they were necessary for ""fiscal prudence."" He sidestepped questions about coverage for asylees and refugees and downplayed the significance of his proposal, saying he could revise it when he gets a chance to update his budget in May.

Kiran Savage-Sangwan, executive director of the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, pointed out that California passed a law in the 1990s requiring the state to cover Medi-Cal for legal immigrants when federal Medicaid dollars won't. This includes green-card holders who haven't yet met the five-year waiting period for enrolling in Medicaid.

Calling the governor's proposal ""arbitrary and cruel,"" Savage-Sangwan criticized his choice to prioritize rainy day fund deposits over maintaining coverage and said blaming the federal government was misleading.

It's also a major departure from what she had hoped California could achieve on Newsom's first day in office seven years ago, when he declared his support for single-payer health care and proposed extending health insurance subsidies to middle-class Californians.

""I absolutely did have hope, and we celebrated advances that the governor led,"" Savage-Sangwan said. ""Which makes me all the more disappointed.""

Crystal Dunn won a World Cup and multiple Olympic medals with the USWNT. Brace Hemmelgarn / Getty Images

Crystal Dunn won a World Cup and multiple Olympic medals with the USWNT. Brace Hemmelgarn / Getty Images

Crystal Dunn is one of the most versatile players in American soccer history. Her career will, and should, be remembered as such.

And yet, as I reflect on the legacy of the 33-year-old New Yorker, whose vast soccer intellect and abundance of fly dance moves saved her teams countless times, I find myself desperate to wedge some distance between Dunn and the word versatile.

It is, of course, a coveted quality in elite sports. The more weapons an athlete can pack in their arsenal, the more difficult it is to beat them. Versatility also widens the door of opportunity in modern soccer, where center backs are expected to capitalize on offensive set pieces, strikers to defend in a high press and fullbacks to be as technically flamboyant as wingers.

But in the context of Black athleticism and Black excellence, versatility carries a different connotation.

A Black soccer player's athletic prowess, combined with a desire to get past doors that have historically and systemically been more narrow for them, can conceal an institution's lack of planning or player development.

U.S. Soccer failed to develop high-caliber, left-footed fullbacks on the women's side for years, and when the 2019 World Cup came around, they didn't have one to call upon. But they did have Dunn, who could do it all, even when she didn't necessarily want to.

As a field player, she found success in every region of the pitch throughout her decorated career. Classified as a midfielder at the University of North Carolina, Dunn was crowned ACC Defender of the Year as a freshman. In 2012, when the Tar Heels were in a pinch as a swath of its roster hobbled back from the U-20 and U-17 World Cups, former head coach Anson Dorrance deployed Dunn to the backline to soften the blow of his thin bench.

Dorrance told ESPN at the time that Dunn “corrected that immediately. But as you can (imagine), at a collegiate level, we waste her at the back. Why would you ever have a player with this extraordinary dribbling ability as your center back?”

In UNC's quarterfinal against BYU that year, Dunn played the No. 10, scored the team's only two goals in the game (including the extra time go-ahead), and preserved their lead with an end-line save off her head in their 2-1 victory. (Dunn's height is somewhere between 5-foot-1 and 5-foot-2, depending on who you ask.) North Carolina went on to win the NCAA championship that year, and Dunn earned the Mac Hermann trophy, awarded to the top college soccer player.

Even then, Dunn was playing out of her preferred role.

“If I had to choose a position, I would definitely choose an outside mid position,” Dunn said back then in the same ESPN story. “I like freedom, and I like to take players on. For me, it fits my personality better because, as an outside mid, you have to worry about attacking and defending as a whole. For me, it's my comfort zone.”

Freedom, comfort, time, and space are luxuries seldom afforded Black people — let alone Black athletes, let alone Black American soccer players. Dunn has been clear about what she wanted for more than a decade. As we celebrate her retirement, we must also consider what the game may have lost because she wasn't always listened to — and what she still managed to accomplish despite that.

When Dunn went pro in 2014, she needed just one season in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) to earn both the Golden Boot and MVP awards. Her 15 goals in 20 regular-season games with the Washington Spirit set a league record at the time, as did the age at which she achieved the feat (23). Yet when then-U.S. women's national team head coach Jill Ellis named her roster for the 2015 World Cup in April of that year, Dunn was not on it. She was the last player to be cut.

The most valuable player in the premier women's professional soccer league in the U.S. did not represent her country at that year's World Cup. That the USWNT won that World Cup campaign is beside the point; an omission like that would simply be unfathomable today. Dunn's brilliance outpaced U.S. Soccer's imagination.

Dunn relocated from the NWSL to the WSL in 2017, joining Chelsea. Emma Hayes, five years into her more than a decade with the club, employed Dunn as a left back. Dunn then returned to the NWSL and her comfort zone at midfield with the NC Courage, winning back-to-back shields and championships with them in 2018 and 2019.

Dunn's star shone too brightly to be overlooked, yet her status on the USWNT was essentially set as a defender.

The 2019 World Cup was a watershed moment in equality for women's soccer as the U.S. women were locked in a legal battle with U.S. Soccer over equal pay during their campaign and still managed to win a fourth title.

From a sporting perspective, however, Dunn was arguably the most vital player on that roster. She played every minute of six of the USWNT's seven matches in that tournament at left back and put on consistent game-saving performances, including a defensive masterclass against hosts France in the quarterfinal.

Back and forth she went over the next few years as a club midfielder and a national team fullback. She earned a bronze medal with the U.S. at the 2021 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and added one more NWSL Championship and shield each to her trophy case with the Portland Thorns in 2022; she subbed on in the final that November, six months after giving birth to her son Marcel.

“Crystal is so special to me. She is, in a lot of ways, like a big sister to me,” said Thorns and USWNT star Sophia Wilson. “I feel like she kind of took me under her wing early on and was someone that I connected with really well.”

After winning Olympic gold as one-third of the iconic “Triple Espresso” alongside Trinity Rodman and Mallory Swanson, Wilson took a year off from soccer to have a baby. She gave birth to her daughter, Gianna, last September, and in December Wilson agreed to a record-setting $1 million option year on her current contract to stay in Portland and play for the Thorns in 2026.

“I saw Crystal go through a lot of things. I saw her have a baby, go through that. I feel like I've known Marcel for his whole life, so she is one of the main reasons I knew that I could do the same thing. I could have a baby and come back and play because I saw Crystal do it, and she's just such an inspiration.”

As the 2023 World Cup approached, the question of Dunn's position on the USWNT naturally resurfaced. In a GQ profile published in February that year, she was open about the emotional toll of her predicament. At a national team camp held shortly after, she remained open about her commitment to transparency.

“It's really important that I'm always going to be my most authentic self,” Dunn said from a national team camp mixed zone in Nashville. “It's not a secret that I've always struggled with identity on the field. It's not to say that I don't tackle and embrace that challenge, but it's not something that is necessarily easy, or something that I absolutely love at all times.”

Her transparency was as much an act of loyalty to her current self as it was a corrective to her younger self.

“I think when I was younger it was easier to say, ‘Oh I'm happy to always play wherever the coach needs me,'” she added. “I think I've embraced my role 100 percent on this team, always competing to be the absolute best outside back I can possibly be. But the reality is I almost sometimes feel like I'm a part-time outside back, and I think that it's important that people know my story.”

Dunn's accomplishments are all the more impressive considering the emotional fatigue she likely endured from not only working in less-than-ideal positions but excelling in them. It also begs the question of what might have been if she hadn't had to endure so much.

Up until her move to Paris-Saint Germain, after her contract with Gotham FC ran short last year, Dunn seemed poised to remain a part of the USWNT project that had since been taken over by Hayes, with whom she already had a relationship from their Chelsea days. In 2024, she played a key role in the U.S.'s Olympic success; Dunn played all but 75 minutes of the tournament. She continued to receive national team call-ups after that, the last being in May 2025 for friendlies against China and Jamaica.

“I was shocked to hear the news,” Washington Spirit and USWNT midfielder Croix Bethune told Soccer Girl Probs in reaction to the announcement. “Like, OK, you're an OG, but, like, girl. You still got it.”

Bethune said she grew closer to Dunn at the 2024 Summer Olympics and valued being able to have “a couple of serious conversations with her just to, like, pick her brain and let her get to know me as well,” in addition to the lighter, goofier moments. “Her retiring, I just feel like isn't right,” Bethune added.

And then there's the word that's impossible to overlook in Dunn's retirement announcement posted on Instagram last week.

“This decision has not come easily, but I am at peace and deeply fulfilled with all that I have accomplished,” she wrote. “I've achieved nearly everything I dreamed of in this sport and gave all I had to give.”

Nearly. It does not negate her plans to spend more time with her family and be a more present mom, as she also wrote, but it also suggests that she is leaving the pitch with unfinished business.

That reality is not unique to the arc of an athlete's career; rarely is there ever a right or satisfying time to retire, but Dunn's contract with PSG was set to run through 2027. The question of how close she was to achieving that “nearly” will linger forever, and for a player of Dunn's expansive skillset, that feels tragic.

USWNT legend Hope Solo returns to the pitch once again for TST, this time fielding teams in both the Women's 7v7 competition and Mixed 7s. 

It took almost everything to get Hope Solo to come down from the mountains of North Carolina and back onto a soccer field.

Last year, she returned to the game through The Soccer Tournament (TST), a 7v7, winner-take-all competition that offered Solo something she hadn't felt in years: a reason to come back.

Now 44, the former U.S. Women's National Team goalkeeper remains one of the most decorated players in the history of the sport. Solo was suspended by U.S. Soccer for her comments toward Sweden at the 2016 Rio Olympics, calling them “a bunch of cowards.” Soon after, her contract with the national team was terminated.  It was a spiral effect, as fallouts between teammates and dark times followed Solo for years to come. As a result, she stepped away from the game.

TST changed that.

After forming Solo FC and stepping back into goal last spring, Solo returns this year, fielding teams in both the women's competition and the newly introduced Mixed 7s. The tournament itself also returns expanded, with men's, women's, and mixed competitions set to take place May 27–June 1 at WakeMed Soccer Park in Cary, N.C..

Ahead of the tournament, GOAL caught up with Solo to discuss the evolution of TST, the introduction of the new format, and her ambitions for Solo FC in this year's competition.

Headlining the women's and mixed competition will be Solo FC. 

Last spring, Solo's team fell in the quarterfinals. Solo played in goal and fielded a diverse team of current professional, collegiate, and semi-retired talent. 

The U.S. Women's team, made up of USWNT greats like Heather O'Reilly, Carli Lloyd, and others are back-to-back champions, and Solo returns with unfinished business.

“You know, it was really hard to get me to come down from the mountains last year,” Solo told GOAL. “And back on the field, and the pressure and the stress of building a team that you hope and pray will be successful. So, it was quite the year.” 

Solo didn't want to roster a team with just anyone - she wanted to provide opportunities to players from other countries. 

“I mean, this isn't easy. You have to find the funding. You have to find the sponsorship. So the idea is great, but now it takes money to travel all these players from around the world, and that's so stressful,” she told GOAL last year. 

“I'm making this more of a global team, and showing fans these players that they've never heard of from around the world who are kind of diamonds in the rough.” 

Solo plans to do the same thing this year – but now has the added challenge of fielding a mixed team. 

“History still has to be made because the U.S. team can't continue to win it every year,” Solo said. 

The U.S. Women are a team made up of Solo's former national teammates. Solo reunited with Lloyd, O'Reilly, and others last year, and when asked how that was catching up, she said, “It was a blast from the past.”

In Cary, N.C., more than 30 teams made up of some of the world's biggest stars, like Sergio Aguero, Luís Nani, and Carli Lloyd, all gather around WakeMed Soccer Park to compete in TST. The fields are all set for 7v7 matches, and surrounding the fields, teams have gathering areas to camp out, rest, eat, and hang out between and after games. I

“It was a trip,” Solo said. “Just to see [how it] was the same thing. It just felt like deja vu going up the elevators [having the same conversations].” 

Solo didn't just make her return to the field last year, but also to conversations and interactions with teammates she hadn't seen in 10-plus years. Fans from all over the country flooded in to see her take the field once again – and it was like everything, but also nothing had changed. Solo was still the dominant force in goal - eyes locked on the game in front of her, body language to be feared, and the utmost leadership in her delivery. 

“When I went on the field, I think my instincts [kicked in] – the natural ability of my positioning and angles and leading my defense and knowing where players would be – that felt so good.  It was just kind of in my soul, you know, in my blood and very natural,” Solo said.

While last year was about Solo returning to the pitch after a long time away, this year she insists this tournament is about giving younger players an opportunity to showcase their skill. 

“Really looking into this year, it's not about me coming back in that respect. You know, it's really uplifting to all these younger goalkeepers who are fantastic and better than me.” Solo said she's going to do far less playing this year; a combination of protecting her body, but also to allow for other keepers to get valuable playing time. 

“I think I have to be mindful this year of knowing when to take myself out, but really making sure I'm giving those other players an opportunity because the players on our [team], you know, our second string goalkeeper, our third, they were [all] better than me.” 

Solo didn't name anyone that would be on either of her rosters yet, but gave a little insight into what creating these teams has been like. 

“You know, it's not an instant yes from people. It's many conversations. We're looking at a Palestinian who plays on the Palestinian national team, but she plays in Europe right now as well. We're just finding out that we're being backed into a corner, but we're trying to work with our local senators and things like that again, but there's no guarantee. We also are looking at a Somalian refugee. So, we'll see. It's very important to me to field a very diverse team.""

Solo's husband, Jerramy Stevens, a former NFL player, and children are all along for the ride. Last year, they were at all the games, and Solo said that her daughter cried when she told her she may not be on the field this upcoming year. Solo's husband has been dusting off his cleats to take shots at Solo in goal.

“I've tried to explain to her that mama's had a lot of tournaments and a lot of games and [it's] somebody else's turn,” Solo explained. “So now she's getting to know the players and the other goalkeepers. It really is just this beautiful kind of family journey, you know, that we help build the team that my players know my kids and my kids know the players.” 

The family-like culture at TST is also important to Solo, who maintains she wouldn't get involved in soccer again unless it was a vision she believed in. 

“I've said from Day 1, and I'm not sure anybody could have got me down from the mountains back into the soccer world if it weren't for Jon [Mugar] and everybody at TST. I think about this all the time, the reason why I'm back in the game here in America. I probably wouldn't be back in the game if it weren't for TST.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Ranking best NWSL offseason moves: Trinity Rodman, Sophia Wilson lead the way","https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/ranking-nwsl-offseason-moves-uswnts-trinity-rodman-lindsey-heaps-sophia-wilson/","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:47:12 GMT","

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

After a whirlwind free agency period highlighted by the situations of Trinity Rodman and Sophia Wilson, the 2026 NWSL regular season is nearly a month away.

While the league will welcome a new season, two expansion teams, and its first-ever 16-team, 30-game campaign, clubs will celebrate roster moves as they build during preseason camps. Expansion sides Denver Summit FC and Boston Legacy FC are obvious teams that made new player acquisitions for their inaugural seasons, while Portland Thorns FC and Washington Spirit made key signings to retain their biggest stars. 

The primary transfer window closes on March 16, leaving the door open for more announcements ahead of the regular season. NWSL clubs can also complete interleague transfers until October. The introduction of the HIP rule also presents a new financial mechanism for teams to sign marquee players who meet specific criteria.

With the new season just 37 days away, which new signings broke the internet during this offseason?

Here are the best NWSL player signings of the offseason:

Naturally, there will be plenty of perspectives that will claim that certain players should be ranked higher, or that there's someone not ranked here at all. With that in mind, let's start with a few honorable mentions. 

Ally Schlegel, North Carolina Courage: Real invested NWSL viewers will be familiar with Ally Schlegel's game. Schlegel opted into free agency, and North Carolina now have a player who can contribute in attack, is effective on aerials, and is unafraid to get physical.

Alyssa Naeher and Katie Lind, Chicago Stars FC: The longest tenured player for Chicago Stars FC is back once again on a one-year contract for her 11th season. Having an iconic goalkeeper you can trust in Alyssa Naeher, while locking in a player who can contend for a starting spot with Katie Lind, means the Stars will feel secure in net throughout the long season.

Brooklyn Courtnall, Bay FC: It'll be year three for Bay FC after joining the league in 2024. New head coach Emma Coats is already using her U23 England credentials to recruit youth internationals to the NWSL, but it might be the players with NWSL experience who need to lead the way. Bay FC made things official by making Brooklyn Courtnall's loan more permanent with a new three-year deal. 

Now on to the rankings:

If you're the gambling type, make sure you bet on yourself with the same confidence as forward Midge Purce. 

The 30-year-old two-time NWSL champion re-signed with the club on another one-year deal after a late season comeback from an ACL injury she sustained in 2024. The 2023 NWSL Championship final MVP gets another chance to run it back with the club she's helped rebuild as the team's third leading scorer with 17 goals. 

There's always a mix of anticipation and grace whenever an expansion side builds out its inaugural roster. When Boston Legacy FC signed Brazilian international Amanda Gutierres, it immediately placed some expectation on their attacking game ahead of their debut season.

The 24-year-old was a 2025 Ballon d'Or nominee, thanks to her proficient goal scoring. She was the co-leading goal scorer for Brazil at the 2025 Copa America Femenina and is a two-time Golden Boot winner in Brazil (2023, 2024) with Palmeiras.

When news broke that San Diego Wave FC acquired Brazilian international Ludmila in a trade with Chicago Stars FC, it seemed like a mutually beneficial move that boosted the Wave's attack and sent a large fee to a rebuilding Chicago. 

San Diego then parted ways with winger Delphine Cascarino, their 2025 NWSL MVP finalist, and simmered some of the reaction. There's no use crying over what could've been, and if anything, there's still plenty to look forward to as the move reunites her with Brazilian teammate Dudinha. The 31-year-old will also be an asset to younger players coming up the ranks, as Trinity Byars is now off the season-ending list, along with midfielder Melanie Barcenas. 

Utah Royals made an early offseason move in a trade with the Washington Spirit for Japanese international midfielder Narumi Miura. The deal was completed in exchange for $180,000 in allocation money. Miura has played in the league since 2023 and has quickly risen as a starting-caliber central midfielder. 

She often is a ball-possession player with the ability to set the tempo. With connective passing and defensive efforts, she's often the link between her defensive teammates and the attacking line. Her addition to Utah's roster could alleviate some of the playmaking responsibilities from Japan national teammate Mina Tanaka.

One day, we will all look back on this past offseason and laugh that the first player announced with the intent to use future HIP money was Lindsey Heaps, not Rodman. The U.S. national team captain will be with the expansion club through 2029, and it's not unrealistic to associate her return to the NWSL with the latter stage of her career.

Back when the club introduced Heaps, general manager Curt Johnson clarified that conversations with Heaps began before the HIP rule was introduced. With the player's arrival set for June and a debut potentially as late as July, the mechanism could very likely be in play. The move means they'll start life on the pitch without her, but they'll get quite a boost later this season, even if it is just for half of the season. While making the playoffs will be a tall task, she has the quality to lift them into contention.

The Denver expansion team has made multiple roster building moves, but acquiring Eva Gaetino from Paris Saint-Germain is a pickup for the club's present and the future. There needs to be a balance between experienced veterans and promising prospects, and Gaetino will fit that mold. 

The 23-year-old defender joined PSG following a standout college career at Notre Dame and won the Coupe de France, making 45 appearances. She also made UEFA Women's Champions League history by becoming the youngest American to score in the knockout rounds at 21. Her move to NWSL comes off a stint with the U.S. women's national team programs in 2025, alternating between the U23 squad and the senior side. 

Perhaps a move made ahead of a player departure, the Pride made an early offseason move and signed defender Hailie Mace on a new contract through the 2028 season. Mace was a key figure for Kansas City Current, especially during their 2025 NWSL Shield campaign. 

A versatile defensive piece who can function as both center and outside back, Mace often contributed to a historic season where Kansas City led the league and set a record for regular-season clean sheets, and she was named to the NWSL Best XI second team in 2025.

In a major intraleague move, Angel City bolstered their backline and traded for Orlando Pride defender Emily Sams. The $650,000 intraleague transfer fee is a record for the highest fee ever paid for a defender in the NWSL and signals a clear trajectory for Angel City moving forward.

Sams signed with her new club through 2028 and had requested a trade to pursue new challenges in the league. She'll be getting one as Angel City conceded 41 goals last season (third most in the league) and struggled on set-piece defending. The move immediately pairs Sams with club captain Sarah Gorden, an NWSL veteran who is sturdy and realiable.

One-third of the U.S. women's national team's attacking trio, dubbed ""triple espresso,"" Wilson has made one of the more intriguing free-agent moves this offseason. The club had periods of navigating ownership changes and rotating head coaches, but with enough talent on the roster, they have found a way into consecutive playoff appearances, and the Thorns were able to maintain that with and without Wilson.

The USWNT striker exercised her player option (a first-of-its-kind contract mechanism) and opted in for one more year with the club after she and her husband, NFL Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Michael Wilson, welcomed their daughter, Gianna, in September. She's back in training after maternity leave with the Thorns and is aiming to return in time for the club's opener in March.

No other player in the world had a contract status that captivated the globe this offseason more than Rodman. In the buildup to the postseason, during the playoffs, and through the NWSL Championship, attention on Rodman's free agency reached unprecedented heights. 

Washington Spirit were always in the mix, but European clubs were reported as interested, and in between contract vetoes and two grievances filed, a new deal was finally announced by the Spirit last month. Rodman signed with the club on a three-year deal through 2028, with a record-breaking payout, and anticipation for the next marquee signing for the league.

Jack of All Trades, Difference Maker: Weston McKennie's Moment Has Arrived

The USMNT will rely on key players to step up and perform at a high level at the World Cup. Christian Pulisic will need to create and score goals, the midfield will need to be controlled by Tyler Adams, Folarin Balogun has to lead the attacking line, and Chris Richards is going to be tasked with leading the defense. However, Weston McKennie is capable of doing all of this and how he performs may very well determine the level of success the USMNT has this summer.

McKennie has always been a talented player and has shown that he can fill nearly any position on the field. That has been helpful as he's able to fill gaps in the lineup but at times kept him from establishing himself as a starter in a single position in his club career. Every season there seems to be speculation about his future with his club. That began to change last season with Juventus, but this season he is proving that a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one. His versatility was recognized as he was named the Juventus' player of the Month for January after scoring three goals in seven games.

His managers over the years have described his ability to play in different roles over his career. Current Juventus boss Luciano Spalletti says “McKennie is a perfect central striker.” He noted that, “he fights, he's strong in the air and he can jump high. He plays to get results because he makes decisions. He would be a perfect striker.” This speaks to McKennie's understanding of the game and how to exploit space to support this team in the attack.

Last year, Thiago Motta talked about McKennie's ability to play multiple positions, noting “he has played fullback, holding midfielder, attacking midfielder, winger. He's a top-level player.” Motta went on to note that, “Weston plays everywhere, and he has to be on the field. It's hard for me to leave him out. Maybe not as a goalkeeper, but in every other position, it's difficult to put him on the bench. That's what being a top-level player means.”

What's exciting about McKennie is that the USMNT has never had a player like him playing at this high of a level and unique talents like him have made the difference for championship winning sides. McKennie has a chance to add his name to the likes of similar players like James Milner and Federico Valverde. Currently, he is solidly in the prime of his career and playing the best soccer of his life for Juventus.

Wes' work-rate and ability to play everywhere make him the kind of player who can be the engine for the USMNT. That aspect of his game is well known, but his versatility and ability to play anywhere also make him the kind of player who can make a lung busting run to break up an attack or find space to score while opponents are focused on shutting down Pulisic and Balogun.

If McKennie plays the kind of soccer he's playing for his club in the World Cup, he has the ability to push the team to play up to the level of teams considered contenders to win the tournament. He's always been a special player with unique skills, this summer those abilities will be on the world's stage and give the team a chance to exceed expectations and change the way the world looks at American soccer.

GOAL sat down with the midfielder to discuss the upcoming World Cup and what kept him motivated in the years between USMNT appearances

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - As Cristian Roldan prepares for his 12th season in MLS, American soccer has generally formed its opinion of the Seattle Sounders star. There are very few things a 30-year-old veteran can do to change those opinions. At this point, Roldan's game is established, and while refinements remain, they are unlikely to alter how he's perceived.

Roldan isn't playing for the masses, though; he's playing for something more personal. It's not the opinions of many that are fueling his late surge towards the U.S. Men's National Team's World Cup; it's the opinion of one. That ""one"" isn't Mauricio Pochettino, it isn't Sounders' manager Brian Schmetzer, and it isn't any one of U.S. Soccer's powerbrokers. No, at this point, the one person Roldan is really playing for is a one-and-a-half-year-old girl who does not yet have a real concept of what he's doing or achieving.

""I think I've had this late surge because I've had my daughter around,"" Roldan told GOAL at MLS Media Day. ""It doesn't matter how I compete. I come home, and she just wants to see me. She doesn't care if I win or lose, but part of my motivation to extend my career and to continue to play at a high level is because I want her to watch me play. I really want her to be able to watch Daddy play. I want her to be able to see her dad actually on the field. I don't want her to see Daddy as just a bench player.""

That late surge that the Seattle Sounders star referred to has him pushing for a second consecutive World Cup. It was a concept that was almost unthinkable just a few short months ago. Even Roldan himself saw hope dwindling after spending two years away from the national team, but after a standout fall that came together somewhat by chance, Roldan is right back in the USMNT's mix. That fact isn't lost on him, and, with the World Cup just a few short months away, Roldan is determined to seize his opportunity to prove something to himself and that little girl that matters so much.

Roldan never truly accepted it, but as the days went by, he got closer and closer to acknowledging reality. That reality said that a 2023 Gold Cup loss to Panama on July 12 would surely be his last USMNT call-up. After a year had gone by, hope started to disappear. When Pochettino was brought in, it became much harder to find. The USMNT had seemingly moved past Roldan, despite the feeling he had deep inside that there was still something left to give.

""I had a glimmer of hope that I'd be there someday,"" Roldan says. ""I had some part of me that was telling myself that I still had a chance, but obviously it was dwindling down every time I didn't get called in. It was 700 days or so in between call-ups. In that time, you reflect on a lot of those things, and you get to appreciate it once it's taken away from you.

""For me, I just wanted to have that moment again. I knew that if I did get called in, I wouldn't take it for granted.""

The call came in the fall. After spending much of the 2025 season as one of MLS's standout players, Roldan was called in to the USMNT's September camp. A late replacement, he arrived at camp just two days before the USMNT's match against South Korea. He came on in the 62nd minute anyway. Just three days later, he started and played all 90 minutes against Japan, solidifying his place back among his longtime USMNT teammates.

""I always had a lot of motivation to get back onto the team,"" he says. ""I didn't lose hope, though, and because of that, it was a dream come true to be able to get called in again after such a long time away.""

Roldan, as it turns out, became a dream come true for Pochettino, who immediately understood the midfielder's impact, on and off the field.

In the moments following the USMNT's October win over Australia, Pochettino couldn't help himself. Roldan, a player he had never worked with until just a few weeks prior, had just put together a two-assist masterclass. Pochettino believed in Roldan before, but it was solidified that night. Ultimately, the message was clear: Pochettino really likes this guy.

“He is what we need,” Pochettino said postgame. “We need a player with confidence, with self-belief, with a little bit of arrogance, with a little bit of being naughty, being competitive. Maybe Cristian Roldan is an example of how you want to build your perfect player. He has a little bit of everything.

“I don't say that he's going to be in the next roster or is going to be in the World Cup, but I think, at the moment, or so far, after last camp and now, it's a player that we wanted to give the opportunity, we gave the opportunity, and look what is going on.”

It was a special moment for Roldan, no doubt. This was a coach who has worked with Lionel Messi, Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, all world-class stars, yet Roldan was the one being described as perfect. If hope was dwindling before, it was fully reignited on that night with Roldan's own performance and Pochettino's praise afterwards.

""For me, it was always nice to hear that from the national team coach,"" Roldan says. ""With his experience, the players he's coached, to hear that, obviously it means a whole lot. For me, it's just being an example, right? You can not have a call-up in a long time and still come in and make an impact. You can still potentially make the squad even if you aren't called in today. That's my mentality going into camp. I treat every situation and every game situation very competitively and I hope that he appreciates that. It seems like he does.""

His teammates do, too. Every player around USMNT camp is quick to praise Roldan for what he offers off the field, which is why so many were so glad to see him back this fall.

Ask around about Roldan, and you largely get the same answer. For the USMNT's players, he's the first teammate you choose to go talk to if you need help with something. For newcomers, he's the perfect person to show you how the USMNT is supposed to work. For coaches, he's the model professional, the one who sets a tone in a way that allows everyone else to buy in and follow.

""He has so many relationships within the national team,"" Brenden Aaronson said of Roldan. ""When you see him at camp, it's like seeing a big brother. It's a guy that you look up to, and he's done amazing things. It's just refreshing to see him at camp.""

That aspect of Roldan has never gone overlooked. Gregg Berhalter, Pochettino's predecessor as USMNT boss, spoke about it often, particularly when explaining Roldan's role at the 2022 World Cup. Teammates, like Aaronson, have reflected on it, too. Roldan might not be the USMNT's de facto leader, but he is the guy that the team's leaders go to when they themselves need a little bit of help.

Roldan loves that role. He relishes it. He does not, however, want to be defined by it. That's what made the fall so important to him. During that window, he showed he can make a difference as a player, too.

After impressing against Japan in September, Roldan dazzled against Australia in October, assisting both of Haji Wright's goals in the 2-1 win. Then, in November, he was strong against a good Paraguay team, too, further solidifying his place in the team. Roldan isn't just a cheerleader or a mentor; he's a midfielder, one who believes he can contribute between the lines, too.

""That was part of my goal going into those camps: making an impact on the field,"" he says. ""It was about making sure I gave myself the best chance to get called in again. I make a lot of impact off the field during training sessions in the moments people don't see, but it's really important to be able to do the stuff during the 90 minutes that you're called upon, too. For me, it was extra rewarding to be able to do that. Then, you're playing a part in wins and big games and, hopefully, we can make many more memories like that.""

There's no mystery about the big games to come. The biggest ones are on the horizon, and now, after so long away, Roldan believes he has a chance at being a part of them.

The 2022 World Cup remains one of the most treasured moments of Roldan's life. The moments at the team hotel, the anticipation of gameday, the look on his family's faces as the USMNT took the field - all were life-defining memories. They're all something Roldan is so eager to live again this summer.

Just four months are remaining from the start of the World Cup. It's a short time, but a long one, too. Roldan knows that better than most. Just a few short months ago, he was counting past day 700 without a USMNT appearance. Now, he's wondering if he might get a few this year in games that matter the most.

""It seemed like I was going to make the 2022 roster, but I also got surgery right before, so I was still unsure if I was going to make that squad,"" he says. ""Now, three months ago, I was looking like I definitely wasn't making this squad. Soccer can just change so fast, is basically what I'm saying. You have to be prepared for that on a human level, whether it goes your way or it doesn't.""

If it does go his way, if Roldan does complete his late resurgence from written-off to two-time World Cup veteran, it's safe to assume who he'll hug first.

The countdown to the 2026 FIFA World Cup continues, and we're just months away from seeing the world's biggest sporting event hit the shores of North America.

The U.S. men's national team take on Paraguay in its opener on June 12 in Los Angeles, so that leaves plenty of time to talk about who will be in the starting XI for Mauricio Pochettino's squad.

We all have our thoughts, but let's turn to FOX Sports soccer analyst Stu Holden on how he thinks the USA could line up for the World Cup:

Matt Freese has solidified his spot as the starting goalkeeper since last summer after a stellar showing at the 2025 Gold Cup. The NYCFC keeper looks to be the favorite for Pochettino and has the inside track over 2022 World Cup starter Matt Turner or other veteran options. 

But what about the defensive backline? That's where things get interesting amid debate about whether the team is better suited with three defenders or a more traditional four-man look.

Holden predicts a three-man lineup with Alex Freeman (newly signed to Spanish side Villarreal), Crystal Palace center-back Chris Richards, and 38-year-old Tim Ream. 

""If you look at my back three, the thing I love about this lineup is it has a lot of flexibility. We've seen Pochettino play with four in the back, three in the back. He likes to build out with four. … But don't get lost in the semantics of how the formation looks because that changes in and out of possession,"" Holden said.  

Flanking those three as wing-backs are Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson and Tim Weah. It's been encouraging for USA supporters to see Jedi return to Fulham amid a knee injury that kept him out for most of the season. Opposite to him is Weah, whose versatility may give him the inside edge over Sergiño Dest at the moment. 

""Antonee Robinson is back and healthy, so great to see. I'm going to have him in the left wing-back position,"" Holden said. ""And then on the other side is Tim Weah, who's been playing really well for Marseille. I like that he can get up, get back defensively. But also, with his speed, he's a threat for opponents.""

Who does Pochettino lean on in the midfield? That will depend on if Tyler Adams, who has been out of action for his club Bournemouth due to an MCL injury, can get back into the mix. If so, Holden has him paired up with Lyon's Tanner Tessmann, a surprising choice over all-everything midfielder Weston McKennie.  

""[Midfield] is where it gets a little bit iffy. Tyler Adams, if we get him back and healthy, I love him in the middle of the field. But next to Tanner Tessmann – I love his size, his passing from that position. And maybe I thought about putting McKennie there, but if you've watched McKennie recently, man, the guy's playing like a striker, scoring goals, assisting.""

That means Holden has McKennie, who has been in incredible form for Juventus, further up in the attack alongside scoring threats Christian Pulisic and Folarin Balogun.

""I love that little triangle the three of them can form. But also I've seen with McKennie, a little bit of flexibility, a little bit of freedom. You're starting to see the best of him and man, the guy can score some goals and make some stuff happen.""

Pulisic has battled some lingering injuries with AC Milan of late, but he'll be a surefire starter in the summer for the USA. Balogun, now in his second full season at Monaco, will have some stiff competition from PSV's Ricardo Pepi, currently nursing a broken arm and was on the verge of a move to Fulham. And don't sleep on a pair of English Championship strikers in Patrick Agyemang (Derby County) and Haji Wright (Conventry City) who have been on fire lately. 

""Balogun is still up front. And then Christian Pulisic, I like him being on the left, cutting inside, can also get in and out,"" Holden said. ""This formation, for me, is a team that I would feel really confident about rolling out game one against Paraguay and getting the win.""","{'href': 'https://www.foxsports.com', 'title': 'FOX Sports'}","soccer"

Atlético Madrid has announced Johnny Cardoso will miss out against former side Real Betis on Thursday, Feb. 5 due to a muscle injury.

The U.S. men's national team midfielder did not make the trip to Seville for the Copa del Rey quarterfinal after suffering an injury in training.

""Johnny will be unavailable due to discomfort he felt in the final training session before the match against Real Betis, which forced him to leave yesterday's session,"" Atlético said on social media.

""Medical staff carried out tests on the midfielder, confirming a low-grade muscle injury.""

It's been a frustrating debut campaign with Atlético for Cardoso, who joined last summer after a season and a half with Betis.

The 24-year-old has played in 14 of a possible 34 games with the La Liga club, missing time with multiple injuries. Cardoso suffered an ankle injury early in the season, then dealt with a knee issue in December.

The injuries have harmed Cardoso's chance to make an impression on USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino ahead of the World Cup.

Cardoso is on the roster bubble despite his success in Spain over the past two years. He has yet to fully impose himself at the international level, turning in a series of underwhelming displays with the USMNT.

In 2025, Cardoso made four appearances for the U.S. as he dealt with an injury that limited him to just two brief cameos at the Gold Cup.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

Lionel Messi's fiercest rival, Portuguese icon Cristiano Ronaldo, may be spending much of the 2026 World Cup in Messi's backyard.

Well, not exactly his backyard, but somewhere in South Florida, not far from where Messi and his Inter Miami teammates live and train.

The Argentine federation announced on Wednesday that its team will have its World Cup base camp in Kansas City. Meanwhile, indications are that Ronaldo will be in or near Miami.

Two media outlets, the Record in Portugal and O Jornal, a bilingual publication serving the Portuguese-speaking communities of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, reported in the past week that Portugal national team coach Roberto Martinez said Miami was chosen as their World Cup base camp.

“I can't confirm, because FIFA will only confirm it in two weeks, but I can say that our idea is to stay in Florida, in Miami,” Martinez revealed in a Jan. 30 interview at the Portuguese Soccer Congress that was held in the City of Football sports complex, where he was a panelist.

“We have two games in Houston, but in a closed stadium. So, the idea is not to train in Houston, it's to train in the conditions of the third game, which is against Colombia, in Miami. So, it makes sense that our base camp is in Miami and we can go to Houston for the first two games, come back, and work with the conditions of the third game.”

It is unclear if Martinez meant Miami or the Miami area, which would include Broward and Palm Beach Counties.

Considerations for base camps include proximity/easy travel to and from game sites, distance from the airport, privacy, security, quality of training fields and fitness equipment, accommodations for fans and media, and recreational opportunities.

Curacao, the smallest country to qualify for the World Cup, will be based in Boca Raton and train at Florida Atlantic University.

A facility that might attract a team like Portugal is the Gardens North County District Park in Palm Beach Gardens, which is where Real Madrid trained during the 2025 Club World Cup. It has 10 lighted grass fields that were built to FIFA regulations and plenty of posh lodging options nearby.

Another option would be Beyond Bancard Field, on the campus of Nova Southeastern University in Davie, at the site of the former Miami Dolphins training facility. The $7 million, 7,500-seat soccer specific stadium is the home of Fort Lauderdale United, the women's professional USL team.

The Nova complex includes seven fields (most of them natural grass), locker rooms, film rooms, training rooms, gym and a boot room. Among the teams that have trained there are Egyptian club team Al Ahly, the Vancouver Whitecaps, the men's national teams of Trinidad and Tobago and Puerto Rico, and the women's national teams of Argentina and Colombia.

A source with knowledge of the World Cup team site visits said England, Netherlands, Scotland and Ecuador had inquired about the Nova facilities and that Beyond Bancard Field could host training for Portugal or Colombia on the eve of their June 27 match at Hard Rock Stadium.

Another obvious site for a World Cup base camp is Inter Miami's state-of-the-art Florida Blue Training Center, a 50,000-square-foot facility in Fort Lauderdale, adjacent to Chase Stadium. It cost $60 million and the 30-acre complex features seven professional fields (six natural grass, one turf). It has locker rooms, recovery areas with hydrotherapy pools and an underwater treadmill, a player lounge, a kitchen, and office space.

Several national teams and club teams have used Inter Miami's training grounds over the years, including Argentina, FC Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund, but it seems unlikely Ronaldo's team would wind up in Messi's home.

Barry University in Miami Shores has a rich soccer history, having hosted the U.S. national team and most recently Boca Juniors and Chelsea during the 2025 Club World Cup. But, Barry's athletic facilities are undergoing extensive renovations as part of a joint project with Miami Country Day School, so the soccer fields will not be available until Fall.

Manchester City trained at Lynn University of Boca Raton. FIU is another local college campus with strong soccer history that could land a World Cup team for training this summer.

Portugal is in Group K and opens the World Cup against the winner of the Inter-confederation playoff (New Caledonia, Jamaica, Congo) on June 17 in Houston. Then, on June 23, they are back in Houston for a match against Uzbekistan.

On June 27, Ronaldo and Portugal will face Colombia in a highly anticipated and high-priced 7:30 p.m. match at Hard Rock Stadium (renamed Miami Stadium during the tournament).

That game is the most sought-after group stage ticket in the entire tournament with resale tickets going from $1,800 to $80,000 for a VIP suite. It is a hot ticket because global superstar Ronaldo, who turned 41 on Thursday, has 668 million Instagram followers, is captain of the Portuguese team and has said this World Cup will be his last.

Also, Colombia's national team, nicknamed “Los Cafeteros” (the coffee makers) has an extremely passionate following and South Florida is home to nearly 240,000 Colombians.

Sometime in the next few weeks, FIFA is expected to announce the 48 team base camps. Among the teams whose camps have already been made public: South Korea (Guadalajara, Mexico), Germany (Winston-Salem, North Carolina, training at Wake Forest University), Spain (Chattanooga, Tennessee, training at Baylor School), Uruguay (Playa del Carmen, Mexico), France (Boston, training at Babson College), Colombia (Guadalajara, Mexico), and Croatia (Alexandria, Virginia, training at Episcopal High School).

Lionel Scaloni has successfully built a highly competitive roster with Argentina. Lionel Messi not only shines, but he is also supported by standout teammates like Rodrigo De Paul, Emiliano Martínez, and others, who excel in their respective positions and enhance the team's overall competitiveness. One of the national team's top players reportedly plans to leave his club post-2026 World Cup, attracting interest from Atlético Madrid and Barcelona.

Unlike in previous seasons, Cristian Romero has been critical of Tottenham Hotspur's management. Following their 3-2 defeat to Brentford, the Argentine defender shared a blunt post on his Instagram account: “In moments like this, there should be others who come out to speak, but they don't. They only show up when things are going well.” With a negative streak in the current season, he could leave the team, with Atletico Madrid and Barcelona chasing his arrival.

Following four years of shining at Tottenham Hotspur, Cristian Romero has reportedly decided to leave the club. However, his exit could prove to be quite costly, as he is under contract until 2029 and remains a key piece of the team. In light of his potential departure from England, Atlético Madrid have reportedly identified him as a possible reinforcement, according to TyC Sports. Alongside Los Colchoneros, Barcelona have also listed him as an option, TEAMtalk reports.

While Hansi Flick has remained quiet on the Argentine star potential arrival, Diego Simeone has already spoken on Romero's potential arrival. “Do I want Cuti Romero? Of course! He's a great player,” he said, via DSports after a 4-0 defeat vs. PSG in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025. Holding an aggressive approach in his defensive skills, Cristian Romero would be an ideal fit for Atlético Madrid, who have shined in previous years for their solidity in the backline.

Tottenham captain Cristian Romero.

After shining at Atalanta, Tottenham Hotspur decided to back his signing, paying €52 million for his transfer. While his excessive defensive aggression caused him several problems in his first season, Cristian Romero has already managed to control this approach, establishing himself as one of the most difficult defenders to beat. In addition, the 27-year-old star has emerged as the team's undisputed leader, elevating it and becoming one of the Premier League's reference figures.

Far from defensive solidity being his only trait, the Argentine is also known for being one of the defenders with the best ball progression, something that would make him an ideal fit in Hansi Flick's Barcelona. Cristian Romero is even regularly compared to Virgil van Dijk, something that has reportedly caught the attention of several Premier League clubs that are also keeping a close eye on a potential move for the 2026–27 season.

Lamine Yamal's Barcelona has reportedly set its sights on a promising youngster from Ajax.


Marc-André ter Stegen got injured with Girona against Real Oviedo, putting his participation with Germany at the 2026 FIFA World Cup in doubt.


Although he is only 18 years old, Lamine Yamal has remained one of Barcelona's best players over the last two years, finishing second in the 2025 Ballon d'Or. In light of this, Blaugrana legend Andrés Iniesta did not hesitate to praise the young star, making clear the challenge that lies ahead.


As Milan navigates a delicate phase of the season and the 2026 World Cup looms ever closer, the American's form, fitness, and rhythm have become inseparable topics.

Gabi Zanotti was a standout for Corinthians at the women's Club World Cup, striking the semi-final winner against Gotham FC and cancelling out Arsenal's 1-0 lead in the final.

According to Meu Timao, her semi-final goal took her to two goals against United States clubs for Corinthians, more than her tallies versus Uruguayan, Bolivian and Colombian sides, one each.

It is a quirky split given Corinthians have faced United States opposition only twice, and she scored in both. Beyond Gotham, she found the net against Kansas City Current in the 2025 Teal Rising Cup final, which the Brabas lost 2-1.

Her strike against Arsenal marked her first for Corinthians against a team from outside the Americas. It also refreshed her list of international victims by country.

That list now reads: Argentina four, Paraguay three, Venezuela and Ecuador two apiece, United States two, and single goals against England, Uruguay, Bolivia and Colombia.

With Zanotti available, Corinthians have another final this weekend, facing Palmeiras at Arena Barueri on Saturday at 16:00 in the Supercopa do Brasil.

New valuation

Chelsea have set a price for Enzo Fernández amid interest from Real Madrid.

World Cup-winning midfielder Enzo Fernández is having a good season in England with Chelsea; the Argentine has scored 11 goals and provided 4 assists from his role as an orchestrating midfielder. This shows that the player is not only important in orchestrating plays but also has the ability to reach the opponent's penalty area



Chelsea have set a price for Enzo Fernández amid interest from Real Madrid.

World Cup-winning midfielder Enzo Fernández is having a good season in England with Chelsea; the Argentine has scored 11 goals and provided 4 assists from his role as an orchestrating midfielder. This shows that the player is not only important in orchestrating plays but also has the ability to reach the opponent's penalty area



Flexibility



During his time at Chelsea, Enzo Fernández shifted his position and began playing a bit further forward in midfield under the guidance of Enzo Maresca, the Italian coach with whom Chelsea won the first Club World Cup in history, making the midfielder the only player to have won the highest competitions in world football with his national team and at club level







Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain



Rumors have spread from England of strong interest from Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain in acquiring this player during the next transfer window. Therefore, in light of this situation, Chelsea has set a price on one of its key players, valuing him at between €100 million and €120 million, which would mean that offers for the midfielder will hover around those figures and, if there is competition, could even exceed them. As a player with both offensive and defensive facets, he's a wildcard for any team that wants to acquire him, and he also delivers in terms of goals and contributions during the match.

Outright T20 World Cup winners: India - 3pts win @ 13/10 (Bet365)

Group A winner: India – 6pts win @ 2/13 (QuinnBet)

Group B winner: Australia - 6pts win @ 4/11 (Ladbrokes)

Group D winners: South Africa – 2pts win @ 5/4 (Bet365)

The T20 World Cup starts on Saturday 7 February and runs right through until the final in Ahmedabad, on Sunday 8 March.

The co-hosts and holders India will again have a huge part to play in the outcome of the tournament and it's no surprise to see them as the pre-tournament favourites to underline their superiority on their home patch.

Skippered by Suryakumar Yadav, the hosts have an unbelievably strong squad, including Hardik Pandya, fast bowling superstar Jasprit Bumrah and left-armer Arshdeep Singh.

I expect them to dominate their opponents for the most part and it would not surprise me if they went through the tournament with a 100 per cent record, as they appear to have all bases covered. They should win Group A, with their only potential serious opposition, Pakistan, not even certain to play their arch rivals.

Any team is, of course, capable of an off day and if that fate befalls Yadav's team, then Australia would be my idea of the team most likely to mop up, though England remain red hot on their day, while South Africa can't be ruled out.

India should be capable of seeing off USA, Namibia, Netherlands and, if they consent to play, Pakistan to win Group A unscathed. They're long odds-on to do so but if Pakistan don't play them, this looks tantamount to that old bettors expression ‘buying money'.

T20 World Cup Prediction 1: India - 6pts win @ 2/13 (QuinnBet)

Co-hosts Sri Lanka are in Group B and there'll be a whole stack of commitment by captain Dasun Shanaka and his squad to try to secure a place in the Super Eights stage.

To do so, they'll have to beat Zimbabwe, Ireland and Oman and I think with home advantage, they could do so but they'll struggle to topple Australia, who are firm favourites on betting sites to progress as group winners and I think will do so.

T20 World Cup Prediction: Group B winner: Australia - 6pts win @ 4/11 (Ladbrokes)

With Scotland having replaced Bangladesh in Group C, there'll be some ‘home nations' interest, as the Scots will play group favourites England. Harry Brook has a strong squad to skipper, including Jos Buttler, recent Test centurion Jacob Bethell, the brilliant leg spinner Adil Rashid and, if he can stay fit, the zip of Jofra Archer.

England have the right ingredients to win their group but that's not taking anything away from West Indies, who have vasts amounts of T20 experience in the various world franchises and really ought to qualify for the last eight under the tutelage of Shai Hope. Italy and Nepal complete that group. I'm leaving that group alone for the simple reason that England are a best-priced 2/5 and while I wouldn't put you off getting involved if desired, they can be slow starters away from home.

Obviously, any self-respecting World Cup in any sport has a so-called ‘group of death' and for me, in this competition, it's Group D, which includes, South Africa, New Zealand, Afghanistan, Canada and United Arab Emirates.

Aiden Markram leads the Proteas into battle, with Quinton de Kock, Keshav Maharaj, Lungi Ngidi and Anrich Norte all part of a classy-looking squad.

For New Zealand, Mitchell Santner is an able leader and can draw upon the skills of Finn Allen, Lockie Ferguson, Jimmy Neesham and Devon Conway, while the Rashid Khan-led Afghanistan have famously bagged big scalps on the world stage before and include Naveen Ul Haq and Fazal Hal Farooqi. They can also get involved in what could be a real scrap for qualification.

I think there's a bet here on South Africa to win the group outright, for all it could be tough to do so. They're currently the only group favourites on cricket betting sites who are odds against and I think they can justify those odds.

World T20 2026 Prediction: Group D winners: South Africa – 2pts win @ 5/4 (Bet365)

This Thursday, February 5, 2026, marks the 41st birthday of one of the greatest legends in sports history: Cristiano Ronaldo.

More than just a date on the calendar, this milestone reinforces the exceptional longevity of the Portuguese star, who continues to defy time and accumulate records.

Born in Funchal, on the island of Madeira, Portugal, CR7 turned professional at Sporting, shone at Manchester United, and became an absolute legend at Real Madrid, where he became the top scorer in the club's history – 451 goals in 438 games.

After playing for Juventus and returning to United, Cristiano opened the doors to Saudi Arabia, playing for Al-Nassr, and now aims to end his career with the milestone of 1000 official goals.

The star boasts 961 goals for clubs and the national team, and in the current season, he has already scored 18 goals in 22 games for the Saudi club – an average of 0.81 per match.

If he maintains this pace in the coming months, he will need about 48 matches to reach the thousandth goal.

Considering the calendar and maintaining the current average, Cristiano Ronaldo could reach the thousandth goal still in 2026, either this season or the next.

For Al-Nassr: There are about 14 to 18 games left in the 2025/26 season, including the Saudi League, local cups, and the Asian Champions League.

For the Portugal National Team: There are preparation friendlies and at least the 3 group stage matches of the World Cup (Group K).

Cristiano reaches 41 years with statistics that seem straight out of a video game:

Official goals: 961 (only 39 away from the thousandth goal).

Ballon d'Or: 5 trophies.

National Team Record: He is the player with the most goals (143) and most matches (226) representing a nation.

Titles with the National Team: Euro 2016 Champion and Nations League (2019 and 2025)

Al-Nassr (1)

Arab Champions Cup (2023): it is important to note that this tournament is considered a regional friendly competition by FIFA (it does not count towards the official title count of the entity, although it is highly prestigious in the Middle East).

The relationship between Cristiano Ronaldo and Al-Nassr is experiencing its most tense moment since the star arrived in Riyadh in December 2022.

The Portuguese ace, in a drastic gesture of dissatisfaction, reportedly refused to take the field due to a direct disagreement with the directives imposed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which took majority control of the club in 2023.

The central point of discord is the recent cost-cutting policy of the state entity.

After two years of heavy investments – with 164 million euros spent in 2023/24 and 140.3 million euros in 2024/25 – the budget for reinforcements suffered a considerable drop in the current season (2025/26), closing at 105 million euros, already accounting for the winter window.

According to the international press, Cristiano Ronaldo believes that Al-Nassr is losing competitive edge and being overshadowed by rival Al-Hilal.

For the number 7, the current level of investment is insufficient to keep the club at the top, which motivated his current stance against the PIF management.

According to ESPN, Cristiano Ronaldo's dissatisfaction at Al-Nassr also involves the organizational structure.

The star reportedly demanded that sporting director Simão Coutinho and CEO José Semedo return to their respective positions at the club.

According to the Portuguese newspaper Record, the star is considering moving to Major League Soccer (MLS) or returning to Europe if he leaves Saudi Arabia.

No official offer, however, has been made so far.

If any club decides to take the Portuguese out of Saudi Arabia, they will need to pay the release clause set at 50 million euros.

A determining factor for the future of the number 7 is his planning for the 2026 World Cup.

Aiming to play in his sixth World Cup, Cristiano avoids drastic changes that could compromise his preparation.

The Portugal national team, buoyed by the recent Nations League title, is in Group K of the competition and is seen as one of the favorites to advance to the final stages.

If he goes to the World Cup, the tournament will be CR7's last major international stage, offering the chance to end a unique career at the top of the world.

Even with debates about his use in the Portugal national team gaining strength due to age, the consensus is clear: Cristiano Ronaldo no longer belongs only to the past or the present: he is immortalized in the history of world football.

This story was updated at 11:30 a.m. on Feb. 5 to include a statement from Gov. Maura Healey.

Foxborough officials said Wednesday they're willing to try to stand in the way of Gillette Stadium hosting 2026 World Cup soccer games this summer if security funding issues aren't resolved in the next few weeks. 

Select Board Chair Bill Yukna said town officials will not grant the entertainment license necessary for the matches to be played in Foxborough until the parties involved figure out who will pay the event's estimated $7.7 million in security costs up front. 

Seven World Cup matches are planned this summer for Gillette Stadium, which will be known as Boston Stadium, for the tournament. 

The approximately $7.7 million is needed for security across 39 days, town officials told MassLive on Wednesday, and would be used to cover associated costs for security, medical and communication to host the international sporting event.

While the town may eventually receive federal grant money allocated for this purpose, it would first have to foot the bill and get reimbursed later. 

“The town is going to stand behind the request of the $7.7 million for both manpower and some capital and expense items. And if they aren't met, then as this board has discussed in the past, the license won't be granted. We are going to be very clear with that,” Yukna said at a Foxborough Select Board meeting Tuesday night.

Foxborough Town Manager Paige Duncan said the town does not have enough money in its accounts to cover such a price tag, and Yukna emphasized the need to protect taxpayer dollars. 

“We've never believed that we were supposed to come up with the money,” he said. 

Foxborough town officials are currently looking to the Kraft Group or FIFA to foot the bill for security costs, but nothing has been decided. The entertainment license must be granted by March 17.

Asked to respond to reports of the Foxborough Select Board's concerns, Julie Duffy, the chief marketing and communications officer of FIFA World Cup Boston, issued a brief statement from the Super Bowl, where World Cup officials are promoting this summer's event.

“We are working closely with FIFA, the stadium, and the town of Foxboro to reach an agreement,” Duffy said. 

The Kraft Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday evening. 

Still, Duncan said she is confident the World Cup matches scheduled to take place in Foxborough this summer will go forward as planned. The town is “thrilled” to host the event, even as a funding source for the security costs remain unclear, she said.

“I actually don't think that the World Cup isn't going to happen. I think (FIFA's) gonna have to find a way to resolve all these issues because they need this event to happen,” she said. 

Up until November 2025, Foxborough officials were under the impression the Kraft Group would foot the bill for police details and other security costs during the World Cup as it does for New England Patriots games and other events at Gillette, Yukna said. 

After discovering this was not the plan — and that neither FIFA nor the Boston Host Committee were set to pay for security costs either — the town of Foxborough applied for the FEMA-funded FIFA World Cup Grant Program. The grant was part of President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill and is designated to be used on security costs for the tournament. 

Massachusetts is slated to get $47 million from the grant, but municipalities such as Boston and organizations such as the MBTA are competing with Foxborough for money, Yukna said. 

The Select Board chair was unsure which state agency will decide how the grant money is allocated, but Foxborough was supposed to find out whether it was approved for the $7.7 million on Jan. 30 and did not. 

Karissa Hand, a spokesperson for Gov. Maura Healey, said the state is working to ensure the success of the World Cup.

“This will have major economic benefits for our businesses and our state,” Hand said. “We are committed to ensuring that municipalities, especially Foxborough, have the support they need to make this a successful event through state, federal and private funds.”

Healey's office is evaluating the need for other funding sources, though they expect to see funds coming in from the federal government soon, Hand said.

Duncan said she was doubtful the town would be reimbursed for the full security costs even if they are awarded the grant, but she did not specify why.

Yukna expressed pessimism about whether the issues around the security funding could be resolved in the next month or so. The March 17 deadline would only give the town 90 days to complete all the planning involved for an event of this scale, he said.

Yukna described his confidence level surrounding resolving the security funding issue as “low” on Wednesday. 

“I do hope that they take us seriously. That's why we had to resort to deadline on getting an application submitted to us and now a deadline on getting it finalized,” he said.

FIFA has so far submitted a license application, but not all the details have been agreed upon or finalized, town officials said. 

There are 11 U.S. cities hosting World Cup matches. While there are no games taking place in Boston, it will be involved in related events. Five more matches will be hosted in Canada (3) and Mexico (2). 

The other U.S. host cities are Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Even leaders of larger communities are expressing concerns about the costs associated with hosting the World Cup. 

“There's a little bit coming in, but certainly there is not enough to cover our cost,” said Lisa Gillmor, mayor of the Bay Area city of Santa Clara, California, where six matches will be played, according to Politico. “It's a tall task to take on.”

Houston and Dallas are pulling tens of millions from Texas' Major Events Reimbursement Program Fund, Politico reported. Kansas' Wyandotte County, where Kansas City is located, is considering a new hotel tax. 

In November, Massachusetts lawmakers approved $10 million in a $2.31 billion year-end budget that Gov. Maura Healey signed into law — only half of what the governor had requested.

Tuchel wants warm-up games on 6 and 10 June

Most qualified teams not available on second date

The Football Association is experiencing difficulties in securing suitable opposition for England's World Cup warm-up games owing to their late start to the expanded 48-team tournament.

England open against Croatia on the last day of the first round of games on 17 June, six days after the first match between Mexico and South Africa, and Thomas Tuchel wants final preparation games as close to his team's tournament kick-off as possible.

Tuchel is understood to have requested friendlies near England's pre-tournament training camp in Florida on 6 and 10 June – the night before the World Cup starts – and finding high-calibre opponents for the latter date is proving particularly challenging.

The Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles with the launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!

The head coach would ideally like matches against World Cup sides but Fifa regulations prevent participants from playing friendlies in the final five days before their first game of the tournament. That means only teams playing on 16 and 17 June – who will include two qualifiers from March's intercontinental playoffs – could face England on 10 June.

The FA is in discussions with several national associations and confirmation of England's opponents is expected this month. With its options limited, New Zealand, who have qualified, and Costa Rica, who have not, are understood to be under consideration.

England have been starved of top-class opposition under Tuchel, making the identity of friendly opponents more significant. The highest-ranked opponents England have played under Tuchel have been Senegal, who were 19th when they won 3-1 in Nottingham last summer, and the best team they have beaten according to the Fifa rankings are Wales, who were 30th at the time.

Fifa has relaxed its previous World Cup regulations that banned teams from playing from 48 hours before the start of the tournament, as a result of the expanded draw and elongated opening round. World Cup participants remain prevented from organising friendlies against sides in the same group, although this was never a consideration for England, whose group is completed by Ghana and Panama.

England's late start to the World Cup has left also them facing a congested schedule, with eight games in 33 days if they reach the final, and a large amount of travelling. Their three group matches will take place in an 11-day period.

Tuchel wants to give his players a holiday at the end of the season, which has influenced his request for late friendlies, although anyone involved in the Champions League final on 30 May will be denied a break with the squad due to fly to Florida on 1 June.

England's warm-up games are expected to take place in Orlando and Tampa before they move to Kansas City in advance of the start their tournament.

The FA has announced England will face Uruguay and Japan at Wembley in March in their final matches before Tuchel names his World Cup squad.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Civil rights organizations, community activists and human rights leaders are coming together in Miami today to issue a travel alert for international tourists coming to the U.S., particularly Florida.

Groups like ACLU of Florida and Florida Immigrant Coalition are warning international travelers about potential dangers targeting their rights, liberty and physical security.

The statewide travel alert is primarily focused on FIFA World Cup fans who are considering coming to Florida for the matches.

The press conference to announce the travel alert is set to begin at 9:30 a.m. Thursday, Feb. 5, in front of the FIFA offices in Coral Gables.

You can watch the livestream here or simply scroll down.

The groups want to get the message out well ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which begins in June.

Throngs of soccer fans from around the world are expected to descend on the U.S. for the various matches, including seven scheduled to be played in South Florida.

The groups claim “enforcement tactics threaten to place international fans and delegations at risk—especially people of color, visitors from Latin America, Africa and Asia, and dual-nationals who could be targeted or questioned without cause.”

The advisory urges travelers to:

The Florida games will be held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.

They include key group stage match-ups featuring Portugal vs. Colombia, Saudia Arabia vs. Uruguay, and Uruguay vs. Cape Verde in June.

The state will also host group stage games like Brazil vs. Scotland, plus a Round of 32 match, a quarter-final and the Bronze final in July.

Groups participating the coalition issuing today's travel advisory include:

Mark Pieth, a Swiss attorney who chaired an oversight committee on FIFA reform, urged fans to skip the World Cup.

“There's only one piece of advice for fans,” he told the Swiss newspaper Der Bund. “Stay away from the USA! You'll see it better on TV anyway. And upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don't please officials, they'll be put straight on the next flight home. If they're lucky.”

Sepp Blatter, the ex-FIFA president, wrote on social media, “I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup.”","{'href': 'https://www.floridatoday.com', 'title': 'Florida Today'}","soccer"

The clip from Peacock and Telemundo shows the “Wedding Crashers” star becoming obsessed with soccer

Owen Wilson stars in a new teaser for a Super Bowl spot kicking off the road to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

In the trailer, a couch-bound Wilson stops studying a script as he becomes enamored by the sounds of soccer. The “Wedding Crashers” star, both intrigued by and invested in the game on screen, mutters a “This is good” before putting his script away and turning the volume up.

Throughout the teaser, Wilson (a real-life soccer fan) attempts to parse the Spanish spoken by the game's commentator, repeating what phrases he can make out to himself. The video ends with Wilson calling someone in his phone labeled “SOFIA :)” before leaving a “To be continued…” promise, pointing to a full commercial coming during Sunday's Super Bowl. 

“I wonder what he said,” Wilson says before picking up his phone. “Sofia, it's Owen. This is a call for help.”

The teaser comes ahead of the launch of the road to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with the international tournament (hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States) set to begin on June 11. Telemundo and Peacock, who will serve as the exclusive Spanish-language home for the World Cup, will release the full commercial starring Wilson during the third quarter of the Super Bowl after Bad Bunny's halftime performance.

Viewers can expect a lot more advertising as the World Cup approaches. In December, NBCUniversal shared that Telemundo had nearly sold out of 2026 FIFA World Cup ads, with 90% of its inventory for the Spanish-language presentation of the tournament sold.

“The growth of soccer in the United States coupled with the domestic nature of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and rising demand for both live sports and Spanish language content has proved to be the winning formula for our company, as NBCUniversal sits in its strongest position ever this far out from a FIFA World Cup tournament,” NBC Sports and Olympics EVP of advertising and partnerships Peter Lazarus said in a statement at the time. “The upcoming competition in Spanish-Language on Telemundo and Peacock, will captivate a highly engaged and passionate audience that our partners are eager to connect with, and we are excited to deliver both brands and fans a world-class experience this summer.”","{'href': 'https://www.thewrap.com', 'title': 'TheWrap'}","soccer"

When Manchester City signed Vivianne Miedema on a free transfer from Arsenal in the summer of 2024, it felt like one of the biggest coups in Women's Super League history. The Cityzens were not only signing the league's all-time top-scorer, they were also directly weakening a title rival in the process.

It was hard to see it as anything other than positive in Manchester, while the feeling in north London was largely negative. Miedema's first season in blue, though, suggested the Gunners might not have been wrong to choose to say goodbye to an icon.

After starting just three WSL games in a 2023-24 campaign that saw her make her return from a devastating ACL injury, the 29-year-old needed a third surgery on the same knee just a few weeks into her first year at City, with further time on the sidelines restricting her to only eight WSL starts last term. Amid those fitness woes, Miedema was still able to demonstrate her elite qualities and game-changing ability, but would she be able to stay fit for a full season again, to really allow City to feel the full impact of her talent?

This season, she has silenced anyone doubting her ability to do exactly that. Miedema has been available for every single City game so far this term, starting all 14 WSL outings, and in that time she has reminded everyone of the world-class player she is, playing a leading role in a team that is on the brink of becoming WSL champions for the first time in 10 years ahead of Sunday's trip to the Emirates Stadium.

It's hard to overstate how important that consistent availability of Miedema has been for her and for City. Despite a three-month absence in the middle of last season, and an injury that ended her 2024-25 campaign as prematurely as March, the former Arsenal star was still able to show often enough what has made her one of the most highly-rated players of her generation.

She managed seven WSL goals in just eight starts, while her two-goal display in the first leg of City's Champions League quarter-final clash with Chelsea was outstanding. She just didn't have the luck with injuries to be able to provide that magic all season long.

Given what she had been through since tearing her ACL in late 2022, it was no surprise to hear Miedema talk about how those early stages at City were tough. ""I thought, ‘I'm not sure if I can do this and still want to do this at my age',"" she told the club's official podcast.

But while one big silver lining from City's failure to qualify for the Champions League last season is the focus it has allowed them to put on a WSL title they are primed to lift, another is that the reduced schedule has allowed Miedema, who has regularly spoken about the negative impact of the growing fixture list amid the prevalence of ACL injuries in the women's game, to maintain such impeccable fitness.

""This season, I think everyone can see I feel like a completely different person and player,"" she told the City podcast, something the numbers back up. Only Khadija Shaw, City's outstanding No.9, has more direct goal involvements in the WSL this season than Miedema's 11, while only Kerstin Casparij, another stand-out performer for City at right-back, has more assists.

Miedema has also created more big chances than any other player in the WSL, with her ranking third for key passes, shots and shots on target. In short, she's absolutely thriving in this City team.

She is doing so in a No.10 role for the first time on a consistent basis, too. It's a role that Miedema has always had some essence of in her game, regularly describing herself as 'a 9.5', and she was given some of the freedom to play like that at Arsenal, dropping deep to create while also getting on the end of chances herself.

But while she primarily played as a No.9 with the Gunners, Miedema has almost always been deployed as a No.10 since moving to City, a position she clearly enjoys the most.

""In my head, I'm not an out-and-out No.9,"" she told City's podcast. ""I leave games happier when I'm involved a lot rather than scoring a couple of goals.""

Previously, some wondered whether Miedema could really thrive as No.10 week-in, week-out without it negatively impacting her team, because of the greater defensive impetus it places on the rest of the midfield. However, new head coach Andree Jeglertz has found the perfect formula.

Under previous boss Gareth Taylor, it felt like City didn't quite have the right midfield make-up to be solid off the ball and dangerous going forward, not with Miedema in there. Jeglertz, though, has established a formidable duo behind Miedema of Yui Hasegawa and Laura Blindkilde Brown.

Under Taylor, Hasegawa largely played as a lone holding midfielder, with two more attack-minded players in front of her. Blindkilde Brown, though, has actually sat deeper at times this term, allowing her Japanese team-mate to show more of her attacking talent while still contributing out of possession.

The two have formed wonderful chemistry in the middle of the park and have excelled in providing enough protection for the defence between them, so that Miedema really can roam freely and be as dangerous as possible in attack.

""My job is to put her in positions and situations where she can express herself,"" Jeglertz said of the Dutchwoman earlier this season. He's certainly done that.

The end result is not just that Miedema is playing extremely well; it's also allowed a wonderful relationship between City's No.10 and No.9 to blossom.

Shaw is running away with the WSL Golden Boot this season, scoring at least twice the number of goals as anyone else in the WSL, and while so much of that is down to the excellent work she does herself, the deadly partnership she has formed with her Dutch team-mate has played a notable role, too.

Shaw and Miedema's link-up play is excellent, with Miedema understanding the type of service the striker wants and, more often than not, able to provide exactly that.

""She's been in that position so she knows familiar runs,"" Shaw said of Miedema recently, speaking to Sky Sports. ""When she looks up, I just have to get going because I know she's going to play a really good ball to me. That's just something that we've been working towards.""

It's not just about Miedema picking out Shaw with passes, either.

""Where we've got to a different point is that, as a team, we make runs to create space for someone else as well,"" Miedema explained. ""[Bunny's run] might actually open up [space] for me driving in with the ball and taking a shot myself. [Or] if I need to run into the front post to take a centre-back away [from Bunny], then that's what I need to do.""

""It's just the chemistry,"" Shaw added. ""We've been working on it throughout pre-season, all the way up to now. It's not just something that happens overnight. Training day in day out, being on the same teams in training, constantly communicating, if it doesn't work, it's going to work the next time. I think the repetition, time and time again, definitely helped us.""

That partnership is at the heart of the deadliest attack in the WSL this season, one which has scored 41 goals in 14 games to put City 11 points clear of the rest of the pack with eight games to play. Chelsea have been England's dominant side for the past six years, winning every league crown from the 2019-20 season onwards. But after being the key instigator in the last club other than the Blues to win this trophy, scoring 22 goals in 20 games in Arsenal's triumph in 2019, Miedema looks set to be integral to Chelsea's dethroning, in a very different way.

""I love that I now have a new challenge and can give something else to the game. That's how I see it,"" she told Sky Sports of her season to date in this No.10 role. ""For me, it's just a luxury, really, to be on the ball and be able to play all of [our forwards] into space and put them in front of the goalkeeper. I've been really enjoying that.""

""We're always trying to find Viv,"" Shaw added. ""Because when she's got the ball, things just naturally happen."" It's one of many reasons why Man City have been the best team in England this season - and by quite some distance.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

USWNT legend Hope Solo returns to the pitch once again for TST, this time fielding teams in both the Women's 7v7 competition and Mixed 7s. 

It took almost everything to get Hope Solo to come down from the mountains of North Carolina and back onto a soccer field.

Last year, she returned to the game through The Soccer Tournament (TST), a 7v7, winner-take-all competition that offered Solo something she hadn't felt in years: a reason to come back.

Now 44, the former U.S. Women's National Team goalkeeper remains one of the most decorated players in the history of the sport. Solo was suspended by U.S. Soccer for her comments toward Sweden at the 2016 Rio Olympics, calling them “a bunch of cowards.” Soon after, her contract with the national team was terminated.  It was a spiral effect, as fallouts between teammates and dark times followed Solo for years to come. As a result, she stepped away from the game.

TST changed that.

After forming Solo FC and stepping back into goal last spring, Solo returns this year, fielding teams in both the women's competition and the newly introduced Mixed 7s. The tournament itself also returns expanded, with men's, women's, and mixed competitions set to take place May 27–June 1 at WakeMed Soccer Park in Cary, N.C..

Ahead of the tournament, GOAL caught up with Solo to discuss the evolution of TST, the introduction of the new format, and her ambitions for Solo FC in this year's competition.

Headlining the women's and mixed competition will be Solo FC. 

Last spring, Solo's team fell in the quarterfinals. Solo played in goal and fielded a diverse team of current professional, collegiate, and semi-retired talent. 

The U.S. Women's team, made up of USWNT greats like Heather O'Reilly, Carli Lloyd, and others are back-to-back champions, and Solo returns with unfinished business.

“You know, it was really hard to get me to come down from the mountains last year,” Solo told GOAL. “And back on the field, and the pressure and the stress of building a team that you hope and pray will be successful. So, it was quite the year.” 

Solo didn't want to roster a team with just anyone - she wanted to provide opportunities to players from other countries. 

“I mean, this isn't easy. You have to find the funding. You have to find the sponsorship. So the idea is great, but now it takes money to travel all these players from around the world, and that's so stressful,” she told GOAL last year. 

“I'm making this more of a global team, and showing fans these players that they've never heard of from around the world who are kind of diamonds in the rough.” 

Solo plans to do the same thing this year – but now has the added challenge of fielding a mixed team. 

“History still has to be made because the U.S. team can't continue to win it every year,” Solo said. 

The U.S. Women are a team made up of Solo's former national teammates. Solo reunited with Lloyd, O'Reilly, and others last year, and when asked how that was catching up, she said, “It was a blast from the past.”

In Cary, N.C., more than 30 teams made up of some of the world's biggest stars, like Sergio Aguero, Luís Nani, and Carli Lloyd, all gather around WakeMed Soccer Park to compete in TST. The fields are all set for 7v7 matches, and surrounding the fields, teams have gathering areas to camp out, rest, eat, and hang out between and after games. I

“It was a trip,” Solo said. “Just to see [how it] was the same thing. It just felt like deja vu going up the elevators [having the same conversations].” 

Solo didn't just make her return to the field last year, but also to conversations and interactions with teammates she hadn't seen in 10-plus years. Fans from all over the country flooded in to see her take the field once again – and it was like everything, but also nothing had changed. Solo was still the dominant force in goal - eyes locked on the game in front of her, body language to be feared, and the utmost leadership in her delivery. 

“When I went on the field, I think my instincts [kicked in] – the natural ability of my positioning and angles and leading my defense and knowing where players would be – that felt so good.  It was just kind of in my soul, you know, in my blood and very natural,” Solo said.

While last year was about Solo returning to the pitch after a long time away, this year she insists this tournament is about giving younger players an opportunity to showcase their skill. 

“Really looking into this year, it's not about me coming back in that respect. You know, it's really uplifting to all these younger goalkeepers who are fantastic and better than me.” Solo said she's going to do far less playing this year; a combination of protecting her body, but also to allow for other keepers to get valuable playing time. 

“I think I have to be mindful this year of knowing when to take myself out, but really making sure I'm giving those other players an opportunity because the players on our [team], you know, our second string goalkeeper, our third, they were [all] better than me.” 

Solo didn't name anyone that would be on either of her rosters yet, but gave a little insight into what creating these teams has been like. 

“You know, it's not an instant yes from people. It's many conversations. We're looking at a Palestinian who plays on the Palestinian national team, but she plays in Europe right now as well. We're just finding out that we're being backed into a corner, but we're trying to work with our local senators and things like that again, but there's no guarantee. We also are looking at a Somalian refugee. So, we'll see. It's very important to me to field a very diverse team.""

Solo's husband, Jerramy Stevens, a former NFL player, and children are all along for the ride. Last year, they were at all the games, and Solo said that her daughter cried when she told her she may not be on the field this upcoming year. Solo's husband has been dusting off his cleats to take shots at Solo in goal.

“I've tried to explain to her that mama's had a lot of tournaments and a lot of games and [it's] somebody else's turn,” Solo explained. “So now she's getting to know the players and the other goalkeepers. It really is just this beautiful kind of family journey, you know, that we help build the team that my players know my kids and my kids know the players.” 

The family-like culture at TST is also important to Solo, who maintains she wouldn't get involved in soccer again unless it was a vision she believed in. 

“I've said from Day 1, and I'm not sure anybody could have got me down from the mountains back into the soccer world if it weren't for Jon [Mugar] and everybody at TST. I think about this all the time, the reason why I'm back in the game here in America. I probably wouldn't be back in the game if it weren't for TST.”","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Former Manchester United defender Phil Jones has provided a hilarious insight into his Premier League picks, pointedly refusing to utter Erling Haaland's name. In a quick-fire Q&A with GOAL, the United coach turned heads by naming summer signing Senne Lammens as the division's premier goalkeeper. Jones also reserved special praise for a rising Carrington star, labelling the youngster a ""top, top player"" for the future.

Jones is currently carving out a new chapter in his footballing journey, transitioning from a decade-long playing career at Old Trafford to a vital role within the United academy. Having hung up his boots in 2024, the former England international has been working closely with the Under-18s and Under-21s while finalising his UEFA Pro Licence. This unique vantage point has given Jones a front-row seat to the development of the club's next generation of talent, as well as the tactical evolution taking place under senior management.

The 33-year-old's insights carry significant weight, particularly as he remains deeply embedded in the day-to-day operations. His transition from teammate to mentor has allowed him to witness the rapid integration of new signings and the steady rise of academy prospects. While Jones's playing days were often hampered by injury, his tactical acumen is now being utilised to nurture the stars of tomorrow. His recent public appearances show a man deeply engrossed in the ""patterns of play and systems"" of the modern game, making his selections for the league's best performers all the more intriguing to the United faithful.

Jones adopted a ""he-who-must-not-be-named"" approach when asked to identify the best forward currently playing in the Premier League. Despite the record-breaking exploits of Manchester City's Haaland, Jones's United loyalty prevented him from giving the Norwegian striker any public satisfaction. With a wry smile, Jones quipped that he had simply ""forgotten"" the name of the man leading the line across the city.

""Plays for Man City, but I can't say his name. I forgot... I forgot his name,"" Jones joked. While the forward remained anonymous in Jones's book, he was more than happy to dish out praise for players elsewhere on the pitch. He named Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers as the league's standout midfielder and Arsenal's Gabriel Magalhaes as the top defender, but his most eyebrow-raising selection came in the goalkeeping department.

Jones bypassed more established names to crown United's Lammens as the best goalkeeper ""at the minute"". Since his arrival from Royal Antwerp in September 2025, the Belgian has been a revelation, providing the stability and shot-stopping ability that has helped United stabilise their backline.

Perhaps the most significant takeaway from Jones's interview was his endorsement of teenage sensation Ayden Heaven. When asked to name the most underrated player in the Premier League, Jones didn't look toward a mid-table veteran or a hidden gem at another club; instead, he pointed directly to a player he has been mentoring at Carrington.

""Ayden Heaven for us, I think. Top, top player,"" Jones declared with total conviction. The 19-year-old left-sided centre-back has enjoyed a meteoric rise, making 11 Premier League appearances so far in the 2025-26 campaign. Having famously started in the 2-0 victory over Manchester City in January, Heaven is quickly becoming a household name among the Old Trafford crowd. Jones's ""top, top player"" tag is an elite-level validation for a defender who appears to be following in the footsteps of the greats before him.

Rounding off his picks, Jones stayed loyal to his former teammate and current club captain, Bruno Fernandes, naming the Portuguese international as his personal favourite player in the division. For Jones, the combination of Fernandes's leadership and the emergence of talents like Heaven and Lammens suggests a bright future for a club he still calls home.

GOAL sat down with the midfielder to discuss the upcoming World Cup and what kept him motivated in the years between USMNT appearances

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - As Cristian Roldan prepares for his 12th season in MLS, American soccer has generally formed its opinion of the Seattle Sounders star. There are very few things a 30-year-old veteran can do to change those opinions. At this point, Roldan's game is established, and while refinements remain, they are unlikely to alter how he's perceived.

Roldan isn't playing for the masses, though; he's playing for something more personal. It's not the opinions of many that are fueling his late surge towards the U.S. Men's National Team's World Cup; it's the opinion of one. That ""one"" isn't Mauricio Pochettino, it isn't Sounders' manager Brian Schmetzer, and it isn't any one of U.S. Soccer's powerbrokers. No, at this point, the one person Roldan is really playing for is a one-and-a-half-year-old girl who does not yet have a real concept of what he's doing or achieving.

""I think I've had this late surge because I've had my daughter around,"" Roldan told GOAL at MLS Media Day. ""It doesn't matter how I compete. I come home, and she just wants to see me. She doesn't care if I win or lose, but part of my motivation to extend my career and to continue to play at a high level is because I want her to watch me play. I really want her to be able to watch Daddy play. I want her to be able to see her dad actually on the field. I don't want her to see Daddy as just a bench player.""

That late surge that the Seattle Sounders star referred to has him pushing for a second consecutive World Cup. It was a concept that was almost unthinkable just a few short months ago. Even Roldan himself saw hope dwindling after spending two years away from the national team, but after a standout fall that came together somewhat by chance, Roldan is right back in the USMNT's mix. That fact isn't lost on him, and, with the World Cup just a few short months away, Roldan is determined to seize his opportunity to prove something to himself and that little girl that matters so much.

Roldan never truly accepted it, but as the days went by, he got closer and closer to acknowledging reality. That reality said that a 2023 Gold Cup loss to Panama on July 12 would surely be his last USMNT call-up. After a year had gone by, hope started to disappear. When Pochettino was brought in, it became much harder to find. The USMNT had seemingly moved past Roldan, despite the feeling he had deep inside that there was still something left to give.

""I had a glimmer of hope that I'd be there someday,"" Roldan says. ""I had some part of me that was telling myself that I still had a chance, but obviously it was dwindling down every time I didn't get called in. It was 700 days or so in between call-ups. In that time, you reflect on a lot of those things, and you get to appreciate it once it's taken away from you.

""For me, I just wanted to have that moment again. I knew that if I did get called in, I wouldn't take it for granted.""

The call came in the fall. After spending much of the 2025 season as one of MLS's standout players, Roldan was called in to the USMNT's September camp. A late replacement, he arrived at camp just two days before the USMNT's match against South Korea. He came on in the 62nd minute anyway. Just three days later, he started and played all 90 minutes against Japan, solidifying his place back among his longtime USMNT teammates.

""I always had a lot of motivation to get back onto the team,"" he says. ""I didn't lose hope, though, and because of that, it was a dream come true to be able to get called in again after such a long time away.""

Roldan, as it turns out, became a dream come true for Pochettino, who immediately understood the midfielder's impact, on and off the field.

In the moments following the USMNT's October win over Australia, Pochettino couldn't help himself. Roldan, a player he had never worked with until just a few weeks prior, had just put together a two-assist masterclass. Pochettino believed in Roldan before, but it was solidified that night. Ultimately, the message was clear: Pochettino really likes this guy.

“He is what we need,” Pochettino said postgame. “We need a player with confidence, with self-belief, with a little bit of arrogance, with a little bit of being naughty, being competitive. Maybe Cristian Roldan is an example of how you want to build your perfect player. He has a little bit of everything.

“I don't say that he's going to be in the next roster or is going to be in the World Cup, but I think, at the moment, or so far, after last camp and now, it's a player that we wanted to give the opportunity, we gave the opportunity, and look what is going on.”

It was a special moment for Roldan, no doubt. This was a coach who has worked with Lionel Messi, Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, all world-class stars, yet Roldan was the one being described as perfect. If hope was dwindling before, it was fully reignited on that night with Roldan's own performance and Pochettino's praise afterwards.

""For me, it was always nice to hear that from the national team coach,"" Roldan says. ""With his experience, the players he's coached, to hear that, obviously it means a whole lot. For me, it's just being an example, right? You can not have a call-up in a long time and still come in and make an impact. You can still potentially make the squad even if you aren't called in today. That's my mentality going into camp. I treat every situation and every game situation very competitively and I hope that he appreciates that. It seems like he does.""

His teammates do, too. Every player around USMNT camp is quick to praise Roldan for what he offers off the field, which is why so many were so glad to see him back this fall.

Ask around about Roldan, and you largely get the same answer. For the USMNT's players, he's the first teammate you choose to go talk to if you need help with something. For newcomers, he's the perfect person to show you how the USMNT is supposed to work. For coaches, he's the model professional, the one who sets a tone in a way that allows everyone else to buy in and follow.

""He has so many relationships within the national team,"" Brenden Aaronson said of Roldan. ""When you see him at camp, it's like seeing a big brother. It's a guy that you look up to, and he's done amazing things. It's just refreshing to see him at camp.""

That aspect of Roldan has never gone overlooked. Gregg Berhalter, Pochettino's predecessor as USMNT boss, spoke about it often, particularly when explaining Roldan's role at the 2022 World Cup. Teammates, like Aaronson, have reflected on it, too. Roldan might not be the USMNT's de facto leader, but he is the guy that the team's leaders go to when they themselves need a little bit of help.

Roldan loves that role. He relishes it. He does not, however, want to be defined by it. That's what made the fall so important to him. During that window, he showed he can make a difference as a player, too.

After impressing against Japan in September, Roldan dazzled against Australia in October, assisting both of Haji Wright's goals in the 2-1 win. Then, in November, he was strong against a good Paraguay team, too, further solidifying his place in the team. Roldan isn't just a cheerleader or a mentor; he's a midfielder, one who believes he can contribute between the lines, too.

""That was part of my goal going into those camps: making an impact on the field,"" he says. ""It was about making sure I gave myself the best chance to get called in again. I make a lot of impact off the field during training sessions in the moments people don't see, but it's really important to be able to do the stuff during the 90 minutes that you're called upon, too. For me, it was extra rewarding to be able to do that. Then, you're playing a part in wins and big games and, hopefully, we can make many more memories like that.""

There's no mystery about the big games to come. The biggest ones are on the horizon, and now, after so long away, Roldan believes he has a chance at being a part of them.

The 2022 World Cup remains one of the most treasured moments of Roldan's life. The moments at the team hotel, the anticipation of gameday, the look on his family's faces as the USMNT took the field - all were life-defining memories. They're all something Roldan is so eager to live again this summer.

Just four months are remaining from the start of the World Cup. It's a short time, but a long one, too. Roldan knows that better than most. Just a few short months ago, he was counting past day 700 without a USMNT appearance. Now, he's wondering if he might get a few this year in games that matter the most.

""It seemed like I was going to make the 2022 roster, but I also got surgery right before, so I was still unsure if I was going to make that squad,"" he says. ""Now, three months ago, I was looking like I definitely wasn't making this squad. Soccer can just change so fast, is basically what I'm saying. You have to be prepared for that on a human level, whether it goes your way or it doesn't.""

If it does go his way, if Roldan does complete his late resurgence from written-off to two-time World Cup veteran, it's safe to assume who he'll hug first. His daughter will turn two this summer and, while she may not yet understand the magnitude of what her dad is doing, he hopes she can someday. That hope, after everything, is what's keeping him going.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

At the 2002 World Cup, Ronaldo arrived looking for redemption. While sporting one of the most unique haircuts in football history, the Brazil striker found exactly what he was searching for. This is ICONS - a GOAL podcast and feature series that revisits the last 10 World Cups from unique perspectives, bringing the spirit of the tournament back to life...

Do you know what a ‘skin' is? Literally, it means ‘skin', but in the modern slang of gaming and social media, it refers to the outfit, costume, or accessories that define one of the visual identities of an important character. Great heroes have multiple skins - each one representing a different chapter of their story. For Ronaldo, ‘Il Fenomeno', his most legendary skin is the one that gave him a hideous, almost comical tuft of hair - but nevertheless brought happiness to millions of Brazilians all over the planet.

Ronaldo, the first of his name among football's immortals, lived through some of the sport's most iconic moments and was top scorer everywhere he went. At Cruzeiro and PSV, early in his career, he still wore an ordinary haircut to go with his boyish, innocent smile. At Barcelona, he popularised the shaved-head look like no one else, all while shocking the world with explosive runs, dazzling dribbles and clinical finishes that made him a player far ahead of his time.

His ‘Inter skin' represented the peak of his physical powers until it was shattered by a devastating knee injury that many believed would end his career. The Ronaldo with the ‘Cascao haircut', on the other hand, became the image of his redemption - a hero's apotheosis in yellow and green; a symbol of one of football's greatest hero's journeys; a look that not only defined his image forever but also an entire World Cup. And to think it all started as a joke during a moment of tension...

Brazilians have a peculiar way of finding humour even amid hardship. Despite endless social challenges, they're still known as people who laugh. Yet the smiles after Brazil's 2–1 comeback win over England in the 2002 World Cup quarter-finals didn't last long.

Ronaldinho, the genius behind the improbable winning goal, would miss the semi-final due to a red card. But the real bad news concerned the other Ronaldo - the one and only Ronaldo of that era.

Brazil's No.9 began feeling pain in his thigh during the first half against England and was substituted with 20 minutes to go. Even amid the post-game celebrations, he already knew the situation was serious.

""I want to see you get me ready for the next match. I want to see if you're good,"" he told the team doctor, Jose Luiz Runco, in footage later shown in Ronaldo's documentary on Globoplay. It wasn't a light-hearted challenge, more a plea from a man who'd been through hell before.

From the infamous seizure hours before the 1998 World Cup final to that demand in 2002, life had tested Ronaldo like few others. The toughest trial came in April 2000, during Inter's Coppa Italia clash with Lazio, when he suffered a devastating injury to his right knee, tearing his tendon in his very first match back after five months of recovery. The image of Ronaldo crying on the turf became one of football's most heart-breaking scenes.

The timeline of his injuries was alarming. In late 1998, inflammation in both knees sidelined Ronaldo for months. He returned in January 1999, but pain persisted, and in April he was ruled out for another eight weeks. A minor thigh strain followed in May, and then, in November of that year, came the partial rupture of his right knee tendon. When he finally returned in April 2000, it was only to suffer the complete rupture moments later.

By the time Luiz Felipe Scolari announced Brazil's final squad for the 2002 World Cup, Ronaldo had played only 19 matches since that night in Rome, completing the full 90 minutes in just three of them. After nearly two years without football, he was to be thrown straight into the most intense competition on Earth. Only during that World Cup, against Costa Rica and Belgium, did he finally manage to play back-to-back full games again.

Though he tried to appear calm following the England game, Ronaldo wasn't much of an actor. Reports from the time noted his unusual silence and serious expression,while both Scolari and Runco shared that same unease. There was good news when early scans revealed no muscle tear, and the absence of knee-related headlines brought a dose of optimism. Still, the tournament's top scorer - tied with Rivaldo and Miroslav Klose on five goals - was in pain.

""Medicine isn't an exact science. Each case is unique,"" Runco told O Globo amid that wave of anxiety. ""I believe he'll play, but I can't guarantee it.""

While his team-mates trained on the pitch, Ronaldo spent his days in physiotherapy, electrotherapy and cryotherapy as he did everything he could do to play.

His injury record was terrifying. Even his call-up had been a gamble, especially as Romario had been left out to national outcry. In the months leading up to the World Cup, Ronaldo had suffered five muscle injuries - all in his right thigh, and none had healed as quickly as the five days separating the win over England and the semi-final against Turkey.

""His injury worries us,"" Scolari admitted, ""but I trust our medical team - and, more importantly, the player's willpower. I don't believe he'll miss the semi-final. We need everyone now. If you've got half a leg, you play! Ronaldo knows Brazil needs him. He's been a technical and emotional leader for this team.""

Seeing Ronaldo smile again was the first good sign. During an interview with Japan's Nippon TV on the eve of the semi-final, he declared he'd be ready to face Turkey: ""I was more tired than the others, but in two or three days I'll be fine. After all, I've played so many games in a short period. After two years without football, it's been intense.""

Runco's tone was also lighter, but no one was truly relaxed. Imagine Ronaldo's situation: years of meticulous preparation, only to be derailed by injury every time. Maybe, in a butterfly-effect kind of way, that's why he decided to change his ritual.

""I always shaved my head before matches,"" Ronaldo recalled in his documentary. ""This time, I left a patch. I walked down the hotel corridor… Everyone laughed, made jokes, teased me, saying I didn't have the guts to show up for training like that.""

Scolari, on the other hand, was furious. ""'What's that haircut?!' I was nervous, upset. 'Why do this now? What if it backfires? Did you ask my permission?' I was p*ssed off!” he explained, years later, in the same film.

But the manager had other things to worry about. Ronaldo barely moved during the final training session and everyone who saw it, reported it. Could he really play? Doubt on one side, conviction on the other: Ronaldo was keeping the haircut.

""I can't disappoint all the little kids who copied it,"" he said with a grin at a press conference.

The haircut was an instant hit. It dominated news cycles worldwide as fans and kids imitated it everywhere, while even Turkish midfielder Umit Davala's mohawk drew 'hair duel' headlines.

Ronaldo has often talked about that haircut since, always downplaying any special or magical plan of his own. But he admitted it served a purpose, as it shifted attention away from his injury. 

""I was only at 60 percent, so I shaved my head. Everybody was only talking about my injury. When I arrived in training with this haircut everybody stopped talking about the injury"" he told The Sun in 2017. Planned or not, that ridiculous tuft of hair brought the levity everyone needed.

If Ronaldo decided not to shave his head completely, the Turkish players had the opposite plan: They'd all go bald if they beat Brazil. The first half of that semi-final, though, was dreadful. Brazil were poor, and Ronaldo was the worst of them all. On Globo's broadcast, commentator Walter Casagrande demanded his substitution, saying, ""He's a man down today.""

Legendary Brazil coach Mario Zagallo later admitted: “At half-time, I also thought Ronaldo should come off. Everyone saw he wasn't right.""

And he wasn't. But that's the thing about geniuses, they find magic in misery. Ronaldo came out for the second half and, with the first chance he truly believed in, conjured a moment of brilliance.

""I couldn't strike with the inside of my foot, it would've worsened the injury. So I saw the chance and hit it with my toe. Perfect,” he recalled in the documentary.

Brazil led. Out of pain came art, with one of Ronaldo's most iconic goals. He was substituted in the 68th minute, and Brazil held on.

""I knew he'd play when I saw that haircut two days before,"" Scolari laughed after the match.

The Cascao haircut, named after one of Brazil's most famous cartoon characters, earned its eternal place in football lore that night. But one last step remained: the final.

World Cup finals are always tense, but for Ronaldo, the weight was immeasurable after 1998. This time, with a tuft instead of trauma, he delivered both goals in the 2-0 win over Germany, and Brazil's fifth global title was secured.

Ronaldo finished as the tournament's top scorer with eight goals and finally achieved redemption. That haircut, along with the canary-yellow jersey streaked with green, became a symbol of that triumph. He kept that hair for months after the final, reluctant to let go of its magic.

Even today, when Brazilians think of Ronaldo and the Penta, they think of that infamous haircut - absurd, unforgettable, and forever legendary.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Why does Cristiano Ronaldo always have so much bad luck?!... First, Erik ten Hag didn't recognise his unrivalled ability at Manchester United, then Fernando Santos ruined his 2022 World Cup bid with Portugal. And now, the powers that be in Saudi Arabia are conspiring to make sure his trophy drought in the Middle East extends to three-and-a-half seasons. Give the guy a break!...

Ronaldo has gone on strike at Al-Nassr in protest over a perceived lack of investment from the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) in comparison to the other clubs under its ownership umbrella: Al-Hilal, Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahli. The 41-year-old striker allegedly even tried to block Karim Benzema's deadline-day transfer to Al-Hilal from Al-Ittihad, deeming it an unfair move designed to give the former a clear advantage in the 2025-26 Saudi Pro League title race.

Benzema's switch went ahead despite Ronaldo refusing to play in Al-Nassr's derby clash with Al-Riyadh, and he could yet also boycott their outing against Benzema's former club, Al-Ittihad, on Friday. If there are no changes to the PIF operation in the coming weeks, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner will reportedly ask to leave Al-Awwal Park Stadium at the end of the campaign - and who could blame him?!...

Al-Nassr only brought in eight new players in the summer after all, including former Chelsea and Atletico Madrid star Joao Felix and Bayern Munich legend Kingsley Coman for a combined €90 million, as well as Inigo Martinez, who made the La Liga Team of the Season after playing an important role in Barcelona's run to the title last term.

Forget the fact that the PIF funded his record-breaking contract extension back in June - Ronaldo has been betrayed, and has every right to start exploring other options. With that in mind, GOAL runs through the seven most obvious next steps for CR7 if he does indeed cut short his time at Al-Nassr, starting with a potential second glorious homecoming...

Ronaldo scored 27 goals in 54 appearances during his second stint with Manchester United after arriving back at Old Trafford in 2021, only to then manufacture a way out after being stuck on the bench by the ""disrespectful"" Dutchman Ten Hag.

Some four years on, the Red Devils could bring Ronaldo back for a third run, and the man himself claims to know exactly what needs to be done to make the club great again.

""I'm sad because that's one of the most important clubs in the world, and a club that I still have in my heart,” he said during an interview with Piers Morgan Uncensored in November. ""You have to follow with the intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United have [done] so many years ago. Nicky Butt, Gary [Neville], Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.

""So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure.  I hope that changes in the future, present-future, because the potential of the club, it's amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.”

Michael Carrick's recent appointment as interim manager shows that United perhaps took notice of Ronaldo's words, and re-signing the evergreen Portugal international could help bring the glory times back to the Theatre of Dreams. Quite how invaluable of a learning curve Ronaldo's return would provide £74m ($111m) signing Benjamin Sesko if the Slovenian were to spend the next year or two playing second fiddle to the five-time Ballon d'Or winner is worth bearing in mind, however.

""I'm happy at Real Madrid and I want to stay and finish my career there if possible,"" Ronaldo said after winning his fifth Ballon d'Or in December 2017. The Sporting CP academy graduate ended up leaving for Juventus the following summer, but, to this day, he retains a unique emotional link to Los Blancos.

""My period at Real Madrid is the happiest for me in terms of football,"" he said in January 2025, and Ronaldo could still end his glittering career at the Bernabeu, where he would undoubtedly be welcomed back with open arms amid a turbulent period that is seeing Alvaro Arbeloa trying to pick up the pieces after Xabi Alonso's ill-fated seven-month reign.

Madrid's current leading light, Kylian Mbappe, has repeatedly called Ronaldo his 'idol' and has regularly picked the Portuguese's brain since arriving in the Spanish capital. Having the opportunity to work with him in close quarters and share the spotlight might, then, be a dream scenario for the Frenchman - or perhaps not.

It has also been suggested that Madrid's biggest weakness these days is a lack of tracking back from their forward players, especially Mbappe. Quite how signing Ronaldo would solve that issue is a question that is probably best left unanswered.

The PIF also happens to be Newcastle's majority owner, which means the Magpies are ideally positioned to bring Ronaldo back to Europe. According to Marca, they could have done exactly that in 2023, as Ronaldo's first contract at Al-Nassr included a clause that gave him the option to join Newcastle if they qualified for the Champions League.

A move never transpired then, but do Newcastle have far greater need for a player of Ronaldo's stature now, as they languish in the Premier League's bottom half? Sure, they would have to sideline £124m ($168m) duo Nick Woltemade and Yoanne Wissa, but both pale in comparison to the age-defying Ronaldo...

Ronaldo would be unquestionably the most high-profile signing in Newcastle's history. His presence guarantees more eyes and raised expectations, and failure to meet them would set the Saudi project on Tyneside back even further. A risk worth taking, then?...

When former Arsenal midfielder Anders Limpar was asked about the prospect of Ronaldo moving to MLS last year, he gave a response that made a lot of sense.

""Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been there, Lionel Messi is there now and can you imagine if Cristiano Ronaldo joined him? Why not? It would be the icing on the cake - and imagine they played together, it would be simply unbelievable,"" said Limpar. ""I think there is only one person who can make that happen and that is David Beckham. If you ask me, Ronaldo should leave Saudi Arabia and make MLS bigger than ever.""

Indeed, Beckham already pulled off one of the greatest coups ever when luring Messi to Miami in 2023, and it wouldn't be a surprise if he's been on the phone with Ronaldo's entourage after hearing of his disillusionment in Saudi.

Ronaldo would also be eager to stamp his mark on another league, after - as he might claim - revolutionising the game in Saudi. He has suggested that MLS is ""obviously"" a worse competition than the Pro League, but as Limpar observed, he'd instantly make it ""bigger"", and potentially better. 

Messi has won two successive MVP awards and lifted Inter Miami to their first MLS Cup crown in 2025, so what could possibly go wrong if Ronaldo's single-minded mentality was added to the mix?...

""It would be incredible to see him finish his career at Sporting CP. It would be the best, a beautiful story for everyone,"" Ronaldo's former team-mate Ricardo Sa Pinto said in a recent interview with Radio Marca. ""When you love football like Cristiano, you know there are stories that only happen once. It would be a beautiful story, a very beautiful one. The Sporting fans deserve it. And so does he.""

Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, has also long been pushing for the forward to retrace his steps. ""Ronaldo has to come back here,"" she said in 2021. ""If it were my choice, he would already be here. He likes to watch Sporting games. I've already told him: 'Son, before I die, I want to see you return to Sporting'. He says: 'Let's see.'""

Sporting are perhaps the least attractive European option for Ronaldo based on prestige, but they're top for pure romance. He spent six years on the Portuguese club's books before joining United in 2003, and though he represents the greatest triumph of their academy system, he only played 31 senior matches, scoring five goals, and didn't win a trophy at the Jose Alvalade Stadium.

There is, then, unfinished business for Ronaldo in Lisbon. Would he be an upgrade on Sporting's current No.9, Luis Suarez, who currently sits second in the Liga Portugal scoring charts on 18 goals from 19 appearances in 2025-26? Well, Suarez is a strong finisher, link-man and presser with bags of pace, but Ronaldo is Ronaldo, and his aura alone could strike fear into Sporting's opponents.

Pinto, then, is right: It would be a ""beautiful story"", even if it resulted in no tangible success of any kind.

Ronaldo, however, is very unlikely to be handed the same eye-watering £488,000-per-day(!) salary he earns at Al-Nassr if he departs the Middle East. If financial power is one of his main motivators at this late stage in his career, he'd be best off staying in Saudi - though that doesn't mean he has to remain tied to Al-Nassr.

The Riyadh-based side have spent a total of €414m on transfers since Ronaldo's arrival, eclipsing Al Ittihad (€380m) and Al Ahli (€386m), but they are still well behind Al-Hilal's outlay of €650m. Benzema is just the latest in a long-line of marquee additions at Al-Hilal, who won the 2023-24 Pro League title without losing a single game, with big money also spent on the likes of Neymar, Ruben Neves, Malcom, Joao Cancelo, Kalidou Koulibaly and Darwin Nunez.

If you can't beat them, why not join them? According to CBS Sports, PIF pushed for Al-Hilal to sign Ronaldo before the expanded Club World Cup in 2025, so it's not unrealistic to think they could target him again, even after the capture of Benzema.

The masterplan could be to reunite Ronaldo and Benzema, who enjoyed unprecedented success together at Real Madrid. At Madrid, Benzema put in the hard yards in the build-up play while Ronaldo waited to pounce and claim all the praise, so why not reintroduce that dynamic to a star-laden squad?!

The Portugal international can kill two birds with one stone at Al-Hilal by ending his six-year trophy drought (having won no major honours since the 2021 Coppa Italia), and re-establishing himself as the unrivalled face of Saudi football. Al-Nassr supporters would feel blindsided, but that's not Ronaldo's problem.

Retirement is on the table, too, though Ronaldo rejected the possibility when speaking to Canal 11 in October.

""People, especially my family, say, 'It's time for you to stop. You've done everything. Why do you want to score a thousand goals?' But I don't think so,"" he said. ""I think I'm still producing good things, I'm helping my club and the national team, and why not keep going? I'm sure that when I finish, I'll be fulfilled, because I gave it my all. I know I don't have many more years, but the few I have, I'll try to enjoy to the fullest.""

Ronaldo is only 39 goals short of that magic, four-figure career total, and it would feel like a tragedy if he doesn't make it - at least for the man himself.

An elusive World Cup is still on his agenda, too, as Portugal head into the 2026 event in North America as one of the favourites. Some believe that Ronaldo is standing in the way of his country's progress, given he's only scored once in his last 10 major tournament appearances and often rebukes his team-mates for neglecting to look for him straight away, but Roberto Martinez has emphatically dismissed such a notion.

""He's a player who, for us, is a finisher. He's the all-time leading scorer. So, having a player who now has 25 goals in the last 30 games (across qualifiers, friendlies and the Nations League) for the national team is a gift,"" the Portugal boss said last month. ""It's about the present; we're not talking about what he did 10 years ago. So, for me, his commitment is very important. He's the only player in the world with more than 220 international caps. So, with Cristiano Ronaldo's experience, having the commitment he has... He's an example. And he's a player who inspires the locker room.""

Can you imagine the Portugal national team without Ronaldo? They'd probably pass teams to death, with Vitinha, Bruno Fernandes and Joao Neves getting all the headlines. But who needs fluid football when you can go direct to a man who will always back himself go for glory, even when there appear to be better options?...

Martinez is spot on; Ronaldo remains a gift for the sport, if only for the publicity he continues to provide. Whether him continuing to play is beneficial to anyone aside from Ronaldo is, however, at least up for debate.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","No longer a 'little boy'","https://www.goal.com/en-om/lists/no-longer-little-boy-florian-wirtz-premier-league-next-star-playmaker-improved-liverpool-displays/bltdcf09611a7e7cf26","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 08:00:00 GMT","

At the tail end of October, Dimitar Berbatov appeared on Rio Ferdinand's podcast and pleaded for patience with Liverpool's struggling superstar summer signing Florian Wirtz. ""He will be unbelievable, trust me,"" the Bulgarian told his former Manchester United team-mate. ""I'm sure that everybody [at Liverpool] sees his quality, and they'll give him that time that he needs to fit into the team. And I guarantee you, he's going to be a success. 

""The way he sees football, how he looks for the space, how he knows how to position himself, the touches on the ball, the improvisation, the eye for the pass and for the goals. Of course, someone can argue that his physique is not that great for the Premier League. But then you can easily see the great players of his position, like [Luka] Modric, also the same build. Modric. F*cking monster! So just give Wirtz time.""

Less than a fortnight later, though, Gary Neville felt that Wirtz looked more like a ""little boy"" than a monster while being ""mauled"" by Matheus Nunes in Liverpool's demoralising defeat at Manchester City. 

Wirtz wasn't the only Liverpool player to disappoint in the 3-0 loss at the Etihad that realistically ended the Reds' title defence after just 11 games. Arne Slot's side may have been unlucky to see Virgil van Dijk's equaliser disallowed for offside, but there was no disguising how poorly they had all played.

Neville, though, was particularly concerned by how little Wirtz had contributed to the game - and, in fairness to the retired right-back, one could understand why.

There had been just two shots from Wirtz (neither of which were on target) and zero chances created. Even more damningly, the £100 million player around which Liverpool clearly intended to construct their revamped attack, had touched the ball fewer times than stand-in goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili during a painfully ineffective outing on the left wing.

""Wirtz is a problem,"" Neville declared on his Sky Sports podcast. ""Let's just call it as it is: it's an issue. We've been tiptoeing around him for a few months, around the fact that he's young, he's coming to a new country, but he's £100m-plus, you're going to have to stand up soon.

""He's obviously got something, he's a really good player, he's technically fantastic, but he's been chucked around the pitch, and he didn't deliver on the quality side of things as well, so his performance was a real worry.""

Neville was particularly concerned with Wirtz's physique. He didn't think that the Germany international looked fit or strong enough for the rigours of English football - and it was significant that Wirtz's best performances in a Liverpool shirt up until that point had all come in Europe, against Atletico Madrid, Eintracht Frankfurt and Real Madrid.

As Berbatov alluded to, there was a growing fear that the diminutive 22-year-old simply wasn't cut for a Premier League that had become even more intense and aggressive this season. His former Manchester United team-mate Wayne Rooney, meanwhile, also argued that Wirtz wasn't the right fit for Liverpool; that the club had bought a player ill-suited to Slot's system

""I think Wirtz actually damages the balance of Liverpool and how they play,"" the ex-England forward said on his BBC podcast. ""He's a top player and I'm sure he will get better - but he's had a slow start and I think there's no denying that. I've seen players come into this league and it takes time.

""But it's not the price tag. It's not the player or his ability. I just don't see where he fits into what Liverpool do in that [4-3-3] formation. Is he a third midfield player? For me, no, he's more of an attacking player. So, if I have to choose between him and [Dominik] Szoboszlai, then I choose Szoboszlai.""

However, the devastating three-goal defeats at home to Nottingham Forest and PSV at the end of November proved that Wirtz was never really the problem. Liverpool were just as defensively frail without their injured No.7 - if not more so - and a lot less threatening in attack.

Of course, Slot's response to the Reds' rotten run of results was to adapt a more conservative game plan, which resulted in Wirtz being put back onto the left wing rather than played in his preferred No.10 role. However, in the run-up to Christmas, he began to feel the benefits of the special fitness programme designed to not only help Wirtz bulk up but also boost his stamina.

On December 3, he completed 90 minutes in the Premier League for the first time, and it was his late deflected effort that spared Liverpool from an embarrassing loss at home to Sunderland.

By the turn of the year, it no longer mattered whether Wirtz was deployed on the left or through the middle, he was making an impact wherever he played and earning comparisons to Kop icon Peter Beardsley for the way in which he was nimbly moving in between the lines - and defenders - to both create and convert chances.

Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting

Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy had insisted all along that Wirtz's record of zero goals or assists in his first 16 Premier League appearances was misleading.

""Although you have to accept that he hasn't started as well as we anticipated,"" Murphy told GOAL in October, ""I think he has been a bit unlucky because he has made a lot of chances that haven't been converted. All of a sudden the narrative changes a little bit if a few of those go in.""

And that's exactly how it's panned out, because Wirtz hasn't really looked back since Alexander Isak stuck away one of his through-balls in the 2-1 win at Tottenham on December 20. The following weekend, in fact, he opened his Liverpool account against Wolves in what represented a huge boost for his confidence.

""I am quite sure it was a relief for him,"" Slot said afterwards. ""I could see with his reaction when he scored the goal and it was the same with his team-mates, they were really happy for him.

""In football, rightly so maybe, we mainly get judged on results and individuals mainly get judged on goals and assists and we sometimes forget what else is there to do during a game. And I think he has multiple good games for us, but I also think he is getting better every game he plays for us. 

""He is getting fitter and fitter and was getting closer and closer to his first goal, and it is not a surprise he scores today. He will be the first to understand that one goal is not enough. But he will go on and score many more goals.""

Unsurprisingly, Slot was spot on.

Thanks to his precise first-time finish from Mohamed Salah's pass in last weekend's 4-1 win over Newcastle, Wirtz now has six goals in his last 10 appearances in all competitions. He's also formed a fantastic understanding with striker Hugo Ekitike - as so encouragingly underlined by the fact that the pair have combined for more goals than any other Premier League duo this season (six).

Consequently, Wirtz is turning doubters into believers - chief among them, Jamie Carragher, who previously questioned the German's world-class credentials by pointing out that Liverpool legends such as Luis Suarez and Sadio Mane had hit the ground running after arriving at Anfield.

""I can't think of many who had an average, poor start,"" the former Reds defender said on Sky Sports back in October. ""I'm not talking seven games by the way, but if you're getting to Christmas and January and being like, 'Oh...' History doesn't tell me that top foreign signings come into England take a year.""

Wirtz didn't either, though. 

Wirtz may have looked a little lost at times during the first half of the season, but he's found his feet now. Indeed, after watching Wirtz both score and assist in his preferred position during a Player-of-the-match-winning performance against Newcastle in what was Liverpool's best Premier League display of the season so far, Carragher even went so far as to compare him to two of the finest playmakers the Premier League has ever seen.

""I have watched him a lot and thought about whether he can get to Kevin De Bruyne's level,"" the former centre-back said on Sky Sports' 'Monday Night Football'. ""But I also think he could be lovely on the eye like David Silva. He has almost a bit of both.

""We are talking about special players coming into our league and, eventually, the mantle has to be passed on, and there is no doubt the lad has real quality. The Premier League has lost De Bruyne, [but] we have gained Wirtz.""

City supporters may well be enraged by such hyperbole, given Wirtz clearly has a hell of a long way to go be mentioned in the same bracket as De Bruyne and Silva. However, it's now a lot easier for everyone to understand why Pep Guardiola wanted Wirtz to replace De Bruyne at the Etihad last summer. That certainly wasn't obvious the last time City and Liverpool met in the Premier League, but it should be at Anfield on Sunday. 

Liverpool's 'little boy' is transforming into a Modric-like 'monster'.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Ekaterina Alexandrova ended Alexandra Eala's run at the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Open in straight sets in the quarterfinals, while Sara Bejlek delivered a flawless performance to reach her first tour-level semifinal.

No. 2 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova was well-prepared for the challenge that Alexandra Eala -- and the fervent Filipino diaspora crowd -- would pose in the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Open quarterfinals. It showed, as she notched a 6-3, 6-3 win in 1 hour and 30 minutes to reach her first semifinal of 2026.

Abu Dhabi: Scores | Draws | Order of play

""I saw the last match,"" Alexandrova said in her on-court interview, referring to Eala's remarkable comeback from 4-0 down in the third set -- saving a match point -- the previous day against Aliaksandra Sasnovich.

""She was fighting 'til the end. I knew it was going to be difficult but I think the atmosphere was amazing today -- the crowd, I know they were cheering for her but I think the atmosphere was great. So I enjoyed my time on the court, and I'm happy I could finish in two sets because it was really difficult in the end.""

Despite the scoreline, the contest remained tense throughout, largely owing to Alexandrova playing her best tennis to gain a lead, but Eala playing her best tennis with her back to the wall. Alexandrova's superior firepower -- she struck 33 winners to Eala's 15 -- enabled her to break first in both sets. But both times, Eala upped her intensity whenever she was behind, searching for a potential turning point.

Alexandrova did well to avoid that happening and to keep her nose in front. The gulf in quality between the two players' serves was crucial -- despite landing 70% of her first serves, Eala won just 45% of those points (fewer than the 53% she won behind her second delivery). Alexandrova, by contrast, won 70% of her first-serve points. Consequently, for all Eala's fighting spirit off the ground, the ability to find a winning serve or return was always in the 31-year-old's pocket.

That proved to be the case in the final game of the first set, in which Alexandrova saved four break points before converting her first set point with a simple one-two punch. At 3-3 in the second set, having had her lead pegged back, Alexandrova again found a returning level that was too hot for Eala to handle.

""I was trying to remind myself, 'You need to play until the last point,'"" Alexandrova said. ""I was trying to keep my focus on that -- I think that really helped me. Not thinking about the outcome but more about the process.""

Earlier, an all-qualifier quarterfinal saw 20-year-old Sara Bejlek deliver a flawless performance to defeat Sonay Kartal 6-0, 6-2 in just 63 minutes and advance to her first semifinal on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz.

The Czech won the first 10 games of the match by mixing up superb down-the-line redirects with deft drop shots, and held her nerve after Kartal got a brief foothold in the second set by extending the rallies. Bejlek will play Clara Tauson in the semifinals after the No. 3 seed came through 6-3, 6-4 over McCartney Kessler.

As Steve Tignor put it in his review of the men's semis Down Under, “You can't say Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic didn't earn their way through their semifinals. Both of them pulled off minor miracles to make it to Sunday.”Miraculous play is generally required to defeat Jannik Sinner these days—the Italian went a combined 131-12 in 2024 and 2025. But the 38-year-old Serbian turned back the clock with a performance that left nearly everyone (maybe except Djokovic himself) astonished.How far back?I thought he was playing Pete Sampras-like. Brad Gilbert on Novak DjokovicBG also dropped some surprising Sinner stats—beyond him going 2 for 18 on break points against Djokovic:He's 6-11 in matches that go five setsHe's 0-9 in matches that go longer than three hours and 50 minutesThe other semifinal, featuring eventual champion Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev, also went the distance.

What would your reaction to it be, Collins asked Vandeweghe, if you were playing?“I have a two-part answer to that,” she said. “One, I would have absolutely taken every ability to get into a Grand Slam final.

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

Following Cadillac's running at the Barcelona Shakedown, Team Principal Graeme Lowdon has given his take on the mood in the camp.

Cadillac Team Principal Graeme Lowdon has praised the “strong team spirit” of the new squad following their early mileage at the Barcelona Shakedown, with the mood in the camp ahead of pre-season testing in Bahrain slated as “really positive”.

While the event at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya marked the first opportunity for all teams to run their new cars at length, it was a particular milestone for Cadillac ahead of the American outfit's maiden campaign in F1 – one that they marked by including the names of the founding members of the team from both the United States and the UK into a special livery design.

Following the 2026 challenger's initial running, Lowdon spoke positively of how the whole squad has come together.

“We've got a really strong team spirit,” the Briton explained. “Everyone's energised, everyone's up for this. Super proud for me and everyone in the team to carry the names of everybody in the team on the livery for this shakedown.

“That was something that we really wanted to do and we've just got a really good bunch of people who want to join the team, which is great, and it's just a great team atmosphere at the moment.”

Reflecting further on the emotions during Cadillac's first day at the shakedown, Lowdon said: “It is a big step, and it's okay to allow ourselves a tiny bit of time to feel the emotion. But I think the overriding feeling is it feels like business as usual as a proper Formula 1 team, and we're getting stuck into the same work that everybody else is.

“Huge, huge, huge respect to everybody in the team – I'm so lucky to be in this situation where I can work with so many really talented people, both here at the track, back at Silverstone, back in Indianapolis and in Charlotte as well, and it's a great feeling to be kind of feeling as if we're really on our way now.”

Lowdon went on to share his summary of the team's mood when the shakedown came to an end, ahead of their next opportunity to run when pre-season testing begins in Bahrain on February 11-13, which will be followed by a second test across February 18-20.

“I think [the feeling is] one of excitement and encouragement as well – really happy with the ways things have gone,” he conceded. “We've steadily worked through all the usual niggles and the like that you find with a brand-new car, but also you have to remember it's only the fourth day of this team running their Formula 1 car.

“But every day we're getting more streamlined, the procedures are working well. People are working extremely well together, which I'm really, really happy about, so [I'm] encouraged. Still a lot of work to do, but that's the same for all of the teams up the pit lane. I think we'll be heading to Bahrain with a really positive feeling.”

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

2025 World Champion sits down with Lawrence Barretto to reflect on his title achievement as well as looking ahead to a new season in Formula 1.

It's Tuesday afternoon and Lando Norris has just bounded into our studio, nestled deep inside the McLaren Technology Centre, for our first interview of the year. He's been going for six hours or so already, completing various tasks as part of a marketing day, but he's still exuding energy.

After shaking everyone's hand, he drops onto the sofa and we chat winter holidays while the crew finesse the set-up. It's clear he's still riding the crest of a wave after achieving his life-long dream of winning the title.

When we get down to business, I kick off with a run-through of the predictions he made for 2025, as part of a feature for Formula 1's digital content channels. 1) Stand up for yourself. Well that's a big tick. 2) To enjoy my life. Another tick. 3) Do more for others. That's a third big tick. 4) Win the Drivers' Championship. Ker-ching! Big tick. 5) Win the Constructors' Championship. Huge tick, with six races to go no less.

As I read through each, Norris is looking down, a smile etched across his face, as he relives it all.

Having achieved so much last year – on and off the track – how on Earth is he going to improve on that? ""That's tough!"" he says with a laugh. ""Of course, the goal is exactly the same, but it never gets easier, especially with the rules changing. It's almost an even bigger challenge for us.

""You've got a lot of teams that are fighting more than ever – and it's also closer. [The plan is] to do the same, simple. Try and déjà vu the whole year and just let it all happen again! That's my goal. That's the team's goal. But it takes a lot of work, a lot of time, and a lot of effort. So we have to keep working hard.""

In achieving his dream – and defeating four-time World Champion Max Verstappen plus McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri – Norris became one of just 35 people to have been crowned Formula 1 World Champion since the series began back in 1950. He's only had the honour of the title for a couple of months, so is it still weird when people call him world champion?

""Yeah, because it's just such a big thing,"" he says. ""It's been my whole life. It's been 20 years or so of trying to achieve it and now it's done and I'm trying to do it again. I still find it odd, but it's easily one of the coolest things ever when people say that and you see the number [1 on the car] because it's a genuine thing now.

""The more people say it to me, that allows it to settle in the most, rather than just kind of seeing it, because sometimes you're like, 'nah, I don't believe it'. But when someone says it, I'm just like, oh, that's, it's a real thing'.""

The winter break was spent with his friends and family – ""it was nice to forget about life and just be normal"". So he has come back feeling ""recharged"" and ""relaxed"". It's meant he's been able to spend a little bit more time at home in Monaco – giving him the chance to do a bit of a spring clean.

As he cleared up, he found a box – or rather the box – which housed his World Championship trophy. It now sits proudly in his hallway, alongside his other most prized piece of silverware – the winner's trophy for Miami, which was his first in F1. It means he can see them, and be reminded of what he has achieved, every time he steps through his own front door.

""They're like two of the biggest moments,"" he says, as it feels like he immediately transports himself back to those times. ""The first win in Miami, I can still picture everything pretty clearly. Then having [the World Championship trophy], to be able to hold it and have that sense of, this is it. I've seen videos and photos of it for many years.

""I've seen all the ones that Max [Verstappen] had, the four of them all stacked up behind him when he's on the sim and stuff, so the fact I now have one of them and my name is alongside the people I looked up to in Lewis [Hamilton], Fernando [Alonso], Max, Seb [Vettel], and then all the other incredible people and the greats, especially the guys who have been in McLaren and [Alain] Prost and [Ayrton] Senna, all these guys, so to see my name alongside some of them is, is pretty, it's a beautiful thing.""

While Norris is still basking in the glory of that success – and rightly so given the scale of the achievement – it's clear that the Briton has gained oodles of confidence and become mentally tougher courtesy because he proved to himself that he could do it.

It's well-documented that he has always been very tough on himself. He has been his harshest critic and preferred to not believe it was possible until he had actually done it. Whatever you make of that strategy, it worked for him last year and, now he has reached the highest step in motorsport, it feels like he believes the world is really his oyster now.

""I feel more relaxed, even more relaxed, which is a great thing,"" he says. ""Last year I proved to myself that I have what it takes. I've always had to do it to make myself believe it.

""It's the wrong way around in a way, but that's just me. Even last year, it was hard to believe what was happening and whether it was going to be possible until I crossed the line in Abu Dhabi.

""I just feel more like I can come into this season and just know I can always have an answer to myself now. Every time I might have a bad day or bad weekend at the track, I can [say to myself] 'I did it last year and I proved to myself that I can do it'.

""So I don't need to question myself anymore and that's a great thing. It gives confidence and that's a very important thing in our sport.

""I came back into MTC and see the same faces and it's the same determination, the same desire to want to just repeat it all over again. It's déjà vu in a way. It feels different at certain moments, but underground, like the underlying feeling is you kind of forget about it and you're like, I have to go and do it again.""

Whether or not Norris will be able to do it again and successfully defend his title (only 11 drivers have managed to do that in the sport's history) will depend on the kind of car he will have at his disposal. And while he has full faith in his McLaren team, the squad he has been with since his F1 debut in 2019 and the operation which has won the last two Teams' titles, the pecking order is unknown for this season given the sweeping changes to the chassis and power unit regulations.

Norris got his first taste of the MCL40 last week in Barcelona – but given all teams were simply focusing on shaking down the cars rather than chasing performance, it's still a case of way too early to tell where his team will stack up this season.

""It's a different game this year in terms of car, in terms of how you have to drive it,"" he says. ""It's still early days and Barcelona is pretty cold so how the tyres work, how the car works is also quite different to how it's going to be in Bahrain [for official pre-season testing]. But I think we're in a good place.

""There's plenty of things we could have done better and I needed to probably be a little bit more on top of. But that was the reason for the test, is to kind of get all the niggles out and get all the issues out. We've got time to try and iron them out and improve on things.

""But I'm with a team that's won the last two World Championships so I'm definitely not lacking any confidence that we're going to be strong and we're going to be fighting for things. Whether it's going to be first, second, third, fourth, I have no idea.

""And I think that's also something I've learned, is to just have no expectation anymore. No point, it causes too much stress, anxiety, all those things for no reason. So yeah, we're in a good place. We need to improve on many things, but at the same time, we're a long way up before the first race still so we have to be patient.""

Like last year, one of his chief rivals is going to be his team mate Piastri. The Australian led the way in the championship for much of last season before he faded in the final part of the campaign. Norris and Piastri have always got on very well, even when it became tense in a title fight, and the Briton doesn't expect that to change given the immense amount of respect they have for each other.

""We did our first shoot together last week and we were both the same, we didn't want to be there!"" he says. ""But we're both looking forward to it again. Of course he's going to try harder than ever to turn things around and to do even better than he did last year, which was already incredible, and I have to try and raise my game to deal with that because we both made our lives very tough for each other last year.

""We're going to continue to try and do that for our whole career. It's just an awkward dynamic always within Formula 1. You don't get it in any other sport where you're team mates but you're also fighting to try and be better than one another.

""But at the end of the day, I think we know that we have respect for one another and that's the most important thing. We're going to have moments where things don't go either our way together or one person's way but we have a lot of faith in the team.

""Andrea [Stella, Team Principal] runs things very well and so does Zak [Brown, McLaren CEO]. And I think we're excited for all these battles that we're going to have together. I'm excited for more of them this year.""

Williams have put their FW48 on track for the first time at Silverstone.

1 / 4

Williams' 2026 car has hit the track for the first time, with the squad confirming that the FW48 ran during a shakedown at Silverstone.

Sporting a special ‘Flow State' testing livery, the new challenger was taken for its maiden laps as part of a promotional filming day on Wednesday.

Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz both spent time at the wheel, with Albon suggesting that the car's debut run was a “fairly smooth” day.

“That's shakedown done!” said Albon. “Obviously a few bits of data to look at and areas to improve, but generally a fairly smooth day. We had decent weather for Silverstone at this time of year and glad to finally be in the car and driving the FW48.

“Our full focus is on Bahrain now, looking at the data and getting ready for the start of the season.”

Sainz commented: “We just had our first laps in the FW48! It's always an exciting, special day for the drivers, the mechanics and the entire team and it's been a great effort from everyone to get the car on track today.

“It was a typical winter day at Silverstone, so we focused on getting in our first few laps and completing our shakedown plan. We are ready to fly to Bahrain in a few days where we'll dive into more complete run plans, so I'm looking forward to it!”

Williams were the only team to miss the Barcelona Shakedown in late January, but went on to confirm that they will participate in official pre-season testing in Bahrain, which begins with the first test from February 11-13 followed by a second test across February 18-20.

Reflecting on the shakedown, Team Principal James Vowles added: “This was a milestone day for us and it is always a very proud moment to see a new car on track for the first time.

“The team has absolutely pulled together under the pressure of the situation and delivered a car today for a planned promotional filming day here at Silverstone.

“We were able to understand more about our package in preparation for Bahrain next week, and Carlos and Alex were able to provide some positive feedback to direct us, while also identifying some minor issues for us to clean up between now and then.

“The push isn't over yet – this is just the beginning and there is more in front of us.”

It comes after the Grove-based outfit unveiled their livery for the 2026 season on Tuesday, featuring a mostly blue and black colour scheme.

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

As part of Santander's Driving Tomorrow series, Ariana Bravo discusses the growth of Formula 1, the evolution of the fanbase, and her hopes for the next phase of the championship's development when it comes to viewer and spectator engagement.

Ariana Bravo is one of the faces of Formula 1 broadcasting through her roles with F1 TV, Track TV, and at the Fan Forum at Grands Prix throughout the course of each season. As part of Santander's Driving Tomorrow series, Bravo discusses the growth of Formula 1, the evolution of the fanbase, and her hopes for the next phase of the championship's development when it comes to viewer and spectator engagement.

If you're among the increasing number of fans who have attended a Grand Prix in recent years the chances are you've seen and heard Ariana in her element.

That may be interviewing drivers, speaking to paddock personalities, or engaging with those who have flocked to the Fan Forum at each event. It is that directness and closeness with Formula 1's expanding fanbase that has enabled her to be a first-hand witness to the championship's evolution.

“The sport has changed in so many different ways,” Bravo says. “We are no longer just all about racing: we're now an entertainment spectacle that travels all around the globe.

“It's so exciting to see from my perspective, because we see it reflected in the fans that come to the race tracks. The demographics have completely changed, we see Formula 1 overflowing into everyday life, and the fans love it – and they've all got a place to belong within Formula 1.”

That sense of belonging has been cultivated and grown across recent years, after particular efforts were made in promoting Formula 1 beyond just the spectacle of the racing action.

The championship now reaches more fans than ever before, with 827 million worldwide, which is a year-on-year increase of 12 per cent and a gain of 63 per cent since 2018 – and part of that growth has been driven by delving deeper into the inner workings of the sport.

“The great thing about Formula 1 is that we are able to offer something for everyone – we have world class racing from 20 of the best drivers in the world,” Bravo says.

“But along with those 20 drivers you get 20 different personalities, and these drivers all bring their own flair to the sport, which allows all of our fans to identify with a different person.”

A prime example of that came at the Fan Forum at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, where Franco Colapinto disguised himself as a security guard, before revealing his true self to the surprised fans.

“In my role as a presenter, I have the honour of bridging the gap between the sport and the fans,” Bravo says.

“We do that in so many different ways: we have our traditional broadcast offering, F1TV, and then we have our Fan Forum interviews, where we bring the drivers out in front of thousands of people and really showcase the more fun and light-hearted side, letting them see behind the visor. Then we have these glamorous events like F175 as well.”

Formula 1's ever-growing popularity has led the sport to welcome a younger and more diverse audience, with 43%now under the age of 35, and female fans now accounting for 42% of the fanbase.

“It has been so special to see,” Bravo says. “Of course we value our hardcore long-term fans but this huge influx of young fans has brought this fresh energy to our sport.

“From my perspective, when I'm on the stage and when I look out at the crowd, it's amazing. There are fans of all ages there. We've got families, we've got little kids on parents' shoulders in their little merchandise supporting their drivers, and there's also so many women in the crowd now as well.

“Obviously to me that is something really important because I want our sport to feel as accessible as possible, and that is where it feels like we're at right now. When I look out from the stage, I can see people from so many different backgrounds – not every sport has that.”

As Bravo alluded to, there has been a growth of female fans in Formula 1, as well as more women working across different departments within the paddock.

“We have so many different initiatives to support young women who are interested in getting into the driving seat or into these engineering roles,” Bravo says.

“We have F1 ACADEMY, which of course does a fantastic job on the ladder up to Formula 1, and I have no doubt [a female Formula 1 racer] will happen. It won't happen overnight, but it will happen in time and I think it's beyond just what we see on track as well.

It's the roles behind the scenes that we already see a lot of women in today, but I think that will continue to grow, and I think it inspires a lot of the younger women that follow our sport on TV at the moment, that there is definitely a place for them, and I'm very proud to be part of a sport where that exists.”

Through her role immersed in the world of broadcasting Bravo has been able to track not just the changes to Formula 1's fanbase, but also the evolution in how the product is conveyed to fans around the world.

“There has always been this element of technology, but over recent years we've really seen that develop and we've been able to now use it in a way that brings fans closer to the action,” Bravo explains.

“On our broadcast on F1 TV we're able to introduce all these different insights that help the fans at home really understand what is happening on track and understand the story of the racing. That's really important – especially if you're a new fan and you're maybe not as familiar with all of the complexities of Formula 1.

“Technology helps you bring it closer, and it is fantastic to see how we're able to use it on the broadcast, whether it's graphics that we're putting up and different things such as ghost cars, all of these different elements bring Formula 1 to life.”

But as fan habits evolve Formula 1 is striving to stay ahead of the curve, tapping into new markets and outlets, in order to strengthen that connection.

“I think engagement is going to continue to grow,” Bravo reckons. “I think we're on an upward trajectory that hopefully is only going to continue.

“I really look forward to seeing and welcoming the younger fans who are just now tapping into Formula 1, and keeping them with us as they grow older and their interests change, their driver alliances change and things like that.

“I think it's going to be really fantastic to see how we're able to keep them engaged, and also how we can keep reinventing ourselves to make sure that we are staying in touch with what the audience wants, and how that changes, especially when it comes to aspects such as social media.

“I think we're going to keep on growing and I can't wait to be part of it.”

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

Another driver has secured their place on the 2026 F1 ACADEMY grid.

American Express have announced that Ava Dobson will be representing the F1 ACADEMY Official Partner on the 2026 grid.

The 17-year-old American is the fourth Wild Card entry from last season to make the step up to a full-time seat in the all-female series. Having made her debut at her home event in Miami, she will be continuing to race in a Hitech-operated car this season.

Starting out in 2023, Dobson first competed in the Formula 4 United States Championship alongside appearances in the USF Juniors and USF2000 Championship. Continuing in single-seaters, she raced in Europe for the first time the next year with a two-round stint in the GB4 Championship.

Returning for the 2025 season, Dobson secured her maiden podium at Donington Park on her way to becoming the highest scoring female driver that year.

“I am really excited to be going with F1 ACADEMY this year with American Express,” said Dobson. ”I'm truly super honoured to be chosen to race in the series and having an amazing partnership with American Express.

“I can't wait to continue to build off of that throughout the whole year and work really hard with the team, and with American Express to be the best we can be.”

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

Lewis Hamilton was in high spirits at the end of a positive Barcelona Shakedown week for Ferrari.

Lewis Hamilton has spoken about an “incredibly enthusiastic” mood at Ferrari in the build-up to the 2026 season, with the seven-time World Champion feeling a “winning mentality in every single person more than ever”.

Hamilton and Ferrari enjoyed a solid start to F1's new era of regulations at last week's Barcelona Shakedown – the famous Italian marque working through their programme without major issues and learning plenty about the SF-26 package.

Sharing his reflections afterwards, Hamilton said: “It's been a really enjoyable week, honestly. I think a huge amount of work over the winter, on my personal side, but what the team have done over the winter to make changes going into the test.

“To see the mileage that we've been able to get the last couple of days due to just so much great work from all the people back at the factory, which I'm really grateful for because having consistency, not having problems…

“Of course, there's always small things, but we didn't really have any downtime moments. I'm sure they could potentially come over the next weeks, but otherwise just a really, really solid couple of days.

“We definitely have work to do to improve, of course, like everybody does, but I think we've had great debriefs, everyone's really on it – I really feel the winning mentality in every single person in the team more than ever, so it's a positive.”

Hamilton, who endured a difficult first season at Ferrari, went on to ponder what might lie ahead for himself and the team in 2026 – the Briton pointing out that the latest generation of F1 car “is actually a little bit more fun to drive”.

“Everyone's positive and incredibly enthusiastic,” he made clear. “I mean, we're under no illusions. We know we've got work to do. Mercedes have done great running as well. I think Red Bull and Haas did some great running as well, so we don't really know where we are, but I think it's a solid first week and we can really build from here.

“There may be some big leaps that we're going to need to take, and development's going to be key. Just really making sure we leave no stone unturned, and we're just really clear and concise with our communication and the decisions we take.

“It's going to take all of us to be at our best. I'm just seeing that everyone's really coming with new energy this year, which is great.”

Hamilton and the rest of the F1 field will be back in action in Bahrain next week, as the first of two official pre-season tests gets under way.

The prolific creator said that despite vowing to never work with his wife of more than 30 years, the adaptation of ‘Margo's Got Money Troubles' for Apple TV proved too good to pass up.


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Michelle Pfeiffer and David E. Kelley have long and enviable Hollywood resumés but those credits have only crossed one time — until now.


	They teamed for the upcoming Apple TV series Margo's Got Money Troubles, which was revealed for the first time on Tuesday with a teaser, first look photos and a panel discussion during the streamer's inaugural press day at Santa Monica's Barker Hangar. The event found Kelley sitting alongside his stars including Pfeiffer, Elle Fanning, Nick Offerman and Thaddea Graham along with Rufi Thorpe, the latter of whom wrote the best-selling novel on which the series is based and is an executive producer of the series.

	The eight-episode Apple Original series, made in partnership with A24, casts Fanning as the title character, a college dropout and aspiring writer who is the daughter of an ex-Hooters waitress (Pfeiffer) and ex-pro wrestler (Offerman). A surprise pregnancy, a mounting pile of bills and no cash to make ends meet leads Margo to make some entrepreneurial choices. Marcia Gay Harden, Greg Kinnear, Michael Angarano, Rico Nasty and Lindsey Normington round out the cast.


	Thorpe had the task of moderating the discussion, and she opened it by describing the series as a “bold and acerbic” take on “the sacrifices we make as mothers and using your goods to get by.” She added that when she wrote the book, she “could not have imagined such a dream cast” embodying the characters who “lived in my head so long.” 

	











	She asked Kelley what drew him to the adaptation, and he said that he fell in the love with the book when he picked it up. “These characters spoke to me when I read the book, and the opportunity to make space for them in my head while adapting was just too exciting to pass up. It's such original storytelling,” said Kelley, who had a relationship with Apple TV after making Presumed Innocent. He described the casting process as an easy one “because everyone fell in love with it.” 


	“I think when you and I first talked, Nick, you had read the book, and that was it. You were in without knowing what we were gonna do to it. Elle owned Margo, I think, before I even picked up a pen. And the actress there in the middle, who I vowed never to work with,” Kelley continued, turning his attention to his Pfeiffer. She quipped, “I'm very difficult.”


	He continued: “When I read the book, I could only see one person playing it, and we're lucky enough that she said yes, the second luckiest yes I've gotten from her.” The first, obviously, being the time he asked her to marry him. The couple wed on Nov. 13, 1993, and before Margo had only shared one other credit on To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday, which Kelley co-wrote (with Michael Brady) and Pfeiffer starred in opposite Peter Gallagher and Claire Danes.


	Beyond the material, it's unclear why they made Margo their first time, but Kelley previously told Entertainment Tonight that they “took a chance” on this project by making it their inaugural collaboration and that it had gone “quite well.” 

	











	During the panel, Pfeiffer offered a lot of praise for her husband's creative talents. “It's built on such strong writing,” she said of the show. “So, all you have to do is really open your mouth and you just have to be smart enough to recognize that it's really good writing. And you don't have to do more than that. And I just think that it's really important to always respect the character that you're playing.” 


	She said that her character, Cheyenne, only appears in about 10 pages of the novel, and “then she disappears,” but it was enough to know that the part was for her. “I said, ‘This is a gem.' I was, literally, ‘sign me up,'” she added.


Margo's Got Money Troubles will premiere globally on Wednesday, April 15, with three episodes, followed by new episodes every Wednesday through May 20.


Wednesday, Feb. 4, 8:30 p.m.: Updated to include their shared credit on To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday.

Expenses for VFX, editing and sound mixing are not currently eligible on their own for state tax credits — but industry insiders want to change that as their ecosystem is “bleeding out.” 


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


	State Assemblymember Nick Schultz has committed to carrying a bill aimed at creating a standalone postproduction tax incentive in California, a field representative for his office announced at a town hall for Hollywood professionals on Wednesday night.


	Amanda Faissal said that the state representative will soon introduce legislation in a bid to return more editing, sound mixing, VFX and other post work to the state. Though postproduction expenses can qualify for tax credits in California if physical production is also done in the state, it is not currently eligible for incentives on its own — even as other states and countries offer this perk to cost-conscious companies.

					Ahead of High-Profile Negotiations, Writers Guild West's Own Staff Union Authorizes Strike		
			









	The initiative follows a successful lobbying effort from Hollywood unions and grassroots groups in 2025 to more than double California's film and television tax credit, expanding the program from $330 million to $750 million. Like that effort, it aims to make the state competitive with rivals like New York and Georgia and countries like the U.K. and Australia, which all offer highly competitive postproduction incentives.


	“We're very excited about this announcement, I had butterflies all day thinking about it,” Faissal told the audience of postproduction creatives and executives, without going into detail on the language of the bill.


	Faissal's news drew loud applause during a town hall for the California Post Alliance (CAPA), an organization dedicated to attracting more postproduction work to the state. Like physical production, local postproduction has withered amid increasingly competitive incentives offered by other jurisdictions and studio and streamer cost-cutting.  

	











	Wednesday's event at Evergreen Studios in Burbank was the latest example of the postproduction industry responding to a sharp drop in work over the last few years. Conversation around the issue ballooned after an open letter from Encompass Music Partners and Encompass Creative founder Peter Rotter circulated among insiders in early 2025. The letter, which warned that “the infrastructure of the L.A. recording industry [was] about to fail,” led to a town hall in April 2025. At the event, production insiders raised deep concerns that Los Angeles was becoming another Detroit in that it was losing ground on its signature industry.


	The mood during Wednesday's event was only slightly more hopeful — even as CAPA leaders discussed potential solutions, they detailed the impact that the downturn in work has had on local labor and companies. In a speech opening the event, Rotter said that the slowdown was “killing our community, the heart and soul of it.”


	He added, “Families can't pay their rent on what little work is left. Editors are driving Uber instead of cutting reels. Sound designers are selling gear just to eat. The whole ecosystem is bleeding out and no one's coming back.”


	Two-time Oscar-winning sound designer Karen Baker Landers (MaXXXine, Scream VI) said that she had lost four to five jobs due to California not offering the standalone postproduction credit that other jurisdictions do. Trevanna Post and Trevanna Tracks founder Jennifer Freed, whose company has offices in London and New York as well as in L.A., said that she had witnessed the production exodus on her own balance sheet. “As the studios seek tax incentives and lower overhead, the production map is just being redrawn,” she said.

	











	California's share of U.S. postproduction work declined more than 11 percent between 2010 and 2024, according to data shared by CAPA on Wednesday. During that same period, California sustained a nearly 17 percent decline in payroll employment while the U.S. overall saw a 2.5 percent uptick.


	An early economic model from CVL Economics founding partner Adam Fowler estimated that 4,451 jobs have been lost in the last 15 years in addition to $1.63 billion in annual economic input in California.


	He mentioned the entertainment industry's particularly high retention rate, or how much money spent in motion picture industry stays in the economy — 93 cents in the case of Hollywood. ”As companies leave and the supply chain starts to thin, that retention rate erodes and the multiplier effects weaken for everyone that remains, and that becomes a self-perpetuating cycle,” he warned.


	One of his slides read, ominously: “California built this industry over 100 years. Losing it would take less than a generation.”


	CAPA's solution to this dire situation lies, at least initially, in advocating for the Schultz-sponsored bill. To accomplish that, the group has hired a lobbyist and a publicity firm, one of whose publicists encouraged attendees on Wednesday to post about the event on social media. CAPA also encouraged attendees to join as members and financially support the effort.


	One of the hurdles the group will grapple with in lobbying for Schultz's bill is bringing the often low-key work of editors, composers, sound mixers and others in their cohort to the attention of policymakers. Said CAPA president Marielle Abaunza, “We need to come out of our dark rooms… We need to now take a moment to turn the camera and the light and shine it on us. We now need to tell our stories.”

The actor played the villainous playboy turned Blair Waldorf's devoted partner for six scenes in the original show.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	Could Gossip Girl fans hear the iconic line, “I'm Chuck Bass,” once again? Maybe, because Ed Westwick has revealed that he's down to step into his character's shoes for a spinoff.


	The actor, best known for playing the villainous playboy turned Blair Waldorf's (Leighton Meester) devoted partner, was recently asked by Hits Radio UK if he would reprise Chuck Bass if a spinoff came to fruition.




	“It would be super interesting to see where Chuck Bass is. I just think it would be really hard to get everyone together,” he said. “You know what? I think anything is possible in this world, so yeah, it would be great to know what Chuck is up to these days — for sure!”

Gossip Girl, which ran for six seasons from 2007 to 2012, followed a group of wealthy teens through their scandalous lives as Manhattan's elite and how they betray each other for each other's gain, all while the chaos is narrated by a mysterious, ruthless blogger. In addition to Westwick and Meester, the cast also included Blake Lively, Penn Badgley, Chace Crawford, Kelly Rutherford, Matthew Settle, Taylor Momsen and Jessica Szohr.


	Elsewhere during his interview with Hits Radio UK, Westwick also revealed his favorite scene that he filmed from the show.


	“My favorite scene was when I was at the top of the Empire State Building, but not so much because of filming it,” the Sandokan actor said, referencing when Chuck was waiting for Blair at the top of the famous building during the season three finale. “They let me climb up in the needle of the Empire State Building, which nobody gets to go inside, except like the handyman or something. And it was just really really cool that I got to go up there. I was wearing like a full tux and climbed into this needle.”

	











	He added, “There was that. I mean, there were a million things we had a lot of fun doing. Some of those scenes in the back of the limos were great as well. Super super blessed to have been a part of that show.”


	While no spinoff with the original Gossip Girl cast has been announced, a reboot of the show with a new cast ran for two seasons, from 2021 to 2023.


	Also on Wednesday, Deadline reported that Cecily von Ziegesar, the author behind the book series that inspired the show, was working on a new standalone novel centered on Blair, but set 20 years after the original novels.

Lower revenues from motion pictures proved to be a drag on SPE's overall performance in the period October to December 2025. 


							By 

	Abid Rahman


International Editor, Digital


Sony Pictures Entertainment's operating income for its fiscal third quarter (ending December 31, 2025) was down 11 percent to $197 million from $223 million in dollar terms for the comparable period a year before, with Q3 sales down 12 percent to $2.295 billion from $2.619 billion.

	Third quarter revenue from media networks (that includes TV channels and digital channels) was up 10 percent to $775 million from $707 million. The company revealed that it ended 2025 with 38 television channels and 535.2 million total subscribers.

	











	Third quarter operating income in the Game & Network Services unit (which includes PlayStation hardware and software sales and services income) grew 19 percent to 140.8 billion yen, primarily driven by a weaker yen and higher software sales. Although revenue for the segment dipped 4 percent in the same period and one cause for concern will be that PlayStation 5 sales were 8 million units down from 9.5 million units a year previously in what is usually the busiest quarter for hardware sales as it includes the run up to Christmas. 


	PlayStation Network monthly active users hit 132 million in Q3, up from 129 million MAUs from the same period the year before. 


	Sony's music division had a stellar third quarter with 13 percent increase in sales (542.3 billion yen from 481.7 billion yen) and a 9 percent increase in operating income (106.4 billion yen from 97.4 billion yen).

His bass vocals helped power seminal hits such as ""Stoned Soul Picnic,"" ""Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In"" & ""Wedding Bell Blues.""

	Gail Mitchell



	LaMonte McLemore, a co-founder of the Grammy-winning soul/pop group The 5th Dimension, has died at age 90. After suffering a stroke several years ago, McLemore died of natural causes on Tuesday at his home in Las Vegas.


	A popular crossover fixture in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s music scene, The 5th Dimension formed in Los Angeles and was originally comprised of McLemore, Billy Davis Jr., Florence LaRue, Marilyn McCoo and Ron Townson (who died in 2001). Known for its signature silky harmonies and sophisticated fusion of R&B, soul and pop, the group cemented its success through hits such as “Up, Up and Away,” “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures),” “Wedding Bell Blues,” “Stoned Soul Picnic” and “One Less Bell to Answer.”

	











	In remembering McLemore, the group's bass singer LaRue commented in a press release, “Proverbs 17:22 states that ‘one joyful heart is good medicine…' Well, Lamonte really knew my prescription. His cheerfulness and laughter often brought strength and refreshment to me in difficult times. We were more like brother and sister than singing partners. I didn't realize the depth of my love for Lamonte until he was no longer here. His absence has shown me the magnitude of what he meant to me and that love will stay in my heart forever.”

	











	In a joint statement, McCoo and Davis Jr. said of McLemore, “All of us who knew and loved him will definitely miss his energy and wonderful sense of humor.”


	McLemore was born Sept. 17, 1935, in St. Louis. After enlisting in the Navy, he trained and worked as an aerial photographer. Before setting his sights on dual careers as a music artist and as a professional entertainment and sports photographer for Jet magazine and other publications, the multi-faceted McLemore sought a baseball career in the Los Angeles Dodgers' farm system. An author as well, McLemore co-authored the 2014 autobiography From Hobo Flats to The 5th Dimension: A Life Fulfilled in Baseball, Photography, and Music with Robert-Allan Arno.


	During McLemore's tenure with The 5th Dimension, the group twice won record of the year Grammy Awards for “Up, Up and Away” and “Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures),” the latter of which spent six weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. Both songs were also inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. All told, the group received seven gold albums and six RIAA-certified platinum singles. Additional achievements include embarking on a State Department cultural tour in 1973 that brought American music behind the Iron Curtain and receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1991.


	The 5th Dimension found themselves back in the spotlight in 2021 with the release of Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson's Academy Award-winning documentary Summer of Soul (…Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised). The group, along with Sly & the Family Stone, Nina Simone and Stevie Wonder, was among the acts who performed at the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, which is chronicled in the documentary.

	











	Surrounded by family when he died, McLemore is survived by Mieko McLemore, his wife of 30 years, daughter Ciara, (adopted) son Darin, sister Joan and three grandchildren. A memorial service and celebration of life will be announced at a later date.

The Life of a Showgirl continues with a second music video, following lead single ""The Fate of Ophelia.""


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	Four months after the release of The Life of a Showgirl, Taylor Swift has announced a second music video from the project: The “Opalite” music video will arrive on Spotify and Apple Music on Friday morning (Feb. 6).


	The pop star made the announcement on her website, unveiling a countdown clock to 8 a.m. ET on Friday morning. Following the Apple and Spotify premiere, the music video will be available Sunday (Feb. 8) on YouTube.


	“Opalite” will be the second visual unveiled from the project, following a video for lead single “The Fate of Ophelia,” which first arrived as part of Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl in movie theaters before hitting YouTube two days later. Fans will have to wait and see whether the “Opalite” video is the same as the version that was shown during the album's theatrical release party or different.

	











The Life of a Showgirl debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 following its Oct. 3 release and spent a total 12 weeks atop the chart. It moved a single-week record 4.002 million equivalent album units in the United States in its first week, according to Luminate, with “The Fate of Ophelia” debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 that week, followed by “Opalite” at No. 2 — which is so far its peak on the chart.




	Swift's decision to premiere the video first on Spotify and Apple Music follows YouTube's December announcement that it was withdrawing its streaming data from all of Billboard‘s charts. YouTube's withdrawal followed Billboard‘s Dec. 16 announcement of a change to chart methodology that will continue to weigh subscription streams more favorably than ad-supported streams, in a bid to better reflect changing consumer behaviors and the increased revenue derived from streaming in the industry. The change means that paid/subscription streams will be weighted against ad-supported streams at a 1:2.5 ratio, narrowed from the previous 1:3 ratio.


	In addition to the music video, Swift also announced an “Opalite” 7-inch vinyl single available to purchase for only 48 hours on her web store, set to ship on or around Feb. 9.

Barry Manilow is fit and fine after surgery, but he's pushing back his upcoming concert dates in Las Vegas to focus on the road ahead.


	The pop veteran was initially booked for residency dates at Westgate Las Vegas, from Feb. 12-21, but has scrapped those plans on his “doctor's guidance and recommendation,” he writes in a social post.


	The Grammy winner recently went under the knife after a scan revealed stage one lung cancer. The operation was deemed a success, but he needs more time out.

	“I'm doing great and recovering very well after my surgery,” he writes. “I've been getting exercise and spending some time in the studio, which has been fantastic.”


	With some additional downtime, he continues, “I can stay focused on healing and getting ready for the tour that's kicking off at the end of February. Having a few extra weeks to rest and prepare is what the doctor ordered!”


	No replacement dates have been announced for the postponed Vegas shows, and tickets will be refunded at the point of purchase, reps say. Manilow will return to the Westgate on March 26, 27 and 28, part of a national swing that starts Feb. 27 at Benchmark International Arena in Tampa, FL.


	Despite his health setback, Manilow is in record-breaking form. He extends a chart milestone with his latest release, “Once Before I Go,” which enters Billboard's Adult Contemporary tally (dated Feb. 7) more than half a century — 51 years and three months, to be precise — since he first appeared on the list dated Nov. 7, 1974, with his breakout ballad “Mandy.”

	Next stop, HADES.


	After sharing the new single “POSSESSION,” her first new music in three years, Melanie Martinez is taking us on a trip to HADES, her fourth studio album that's set to drop March 27.


	“Each song on this record explores a different trap set by the kind of evil, patriarchal energy that is HADES. It isn't about predicting a dystopian future,” she explains in a statement announcing the new collection. “It's about recognizing destructive patterns that already exist. The same dynamics repeating in different places. Control disguised as protection. Cruelty framed as logic. Exploitation sold as opportunity. Once you start noticing those threads, it becomes hard to ignore them.”

HADES is an appropriately hot theme for this alt-pop phenom. Following its release last month, “POSSESSION” was by some distance the favorite new cut of the week, as chosen by readers of Billboard.com. Also, the track debuted with more than 2.7 million Spotify streams in its first 24 hours and has surpassed 10 million to date, according to reps at Warner Music. It's now Martinez's fastest-streaming release and the biggest female debut of 2026.

HADES is the followup to 2023's Portals, which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, her third consecutive top 10 appearance on the chart. Portals went all the way to No. 1 on Australia's ARIA Chart. Her debut album from 2015, Cry Baby, peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 200, and her sophomore album from 2019, K–12, hit No. 3 on the all-genres tally.


	Martinez burst into the public consciousness in 2012 as a contestant on season 3 of The Voice. Although she didn't claim the crown, she's been winning ever since. Career streams top 30 billion, including upwards of 5.5 billion official YouTube views with more than 62 million followers across platforms.

	











	Meanwhile, Cry Baby spawned the perfume of the same name, which was self-released the year after the album's release. It was a sell-out. Later, she partnered with Flower Shop Perfume on a perfume line, the first of which arrived in 2023 — with similar success to its predecessor.

Senior International Film Correspondent


EXCLUSIVE: Karim Aïnouz's starry drama Rosebush Pruning world premieres in competition at the Berlin Film Festival this month and Deadline can reveal a first clip giving a taste of the satire about the absurdity of the traditional patriarchal family.


	Set in an opulent villa underneath the Catalonian sun, Jamie Bell, Calum Turner, Riley Keough and Lukas Gage play American siblings Jack, Ed, Anna and Robert. Together, they wallow in isolation and their inherited fortune, eschewing the demands of their blind father (Tracy Letts), and seeking love and validation through each other and their latest designer clothes.

	When Jack (Bell), the eldest brother and family lynchpin, announces he is moving in with his girlfriend, played by Elle Fanning, blood ties are severed and Ed starts to uncover the truth surrounding their mother's death. Generational lies begin to unravel, and the fabric of this family slowly begins to disintegrate. Elena Anaya and Pamela Anderson also feature in the cast.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The clip, released by Mubi on Thursday, reveals the dynamics between the family as the father asks Anna to describe Jack's girlfriend in her presence over dinner, even pressing for details of her “bosom”.  


	The film is a joint production between Mubi, The Match Factory, Kavac Film, Fremantle's The Apartment, Sur Film, Crybaby and Gold Rush Pictures.


Firebrand director Aïnouz is directing from a script written by long-time Yorgos Lanthimos collaborator Efthimis Filippou (Kinds of Kindness, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Lobster), which is inspired by Marco Bellocchio's 1965 drama Fists in the Pocket.


	The adaptation rights were acquired from Bellocchio's company Kavac Film, with the company's CEO Simone Gattoni also producing alongside Viola Fügen and Michael Weber for The Match Factory, Annamaria Morelli for The Apartment, Andreas Wentz for Sur Film and Vladimir Zemtsov for Gold Rush Pictures  


	The Match Factory is also handling worldwide sales.

International TV Co-Editor


Prime Video's The Grand Tour has confirmed it has turned to social media for the hit motor show's next trio of presenters.


	Viral trainspotting aficionado Francis Bourgeois will host the next series later this year along with James Engelsman and Thomas Holland, the creators of the popular Throttle House YouTube channel. Talks were first reported by The Sun last year.


	The three are significantly younger than the trio of previous hosts, Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, who started The Grand Tour once they left Top Gear and the BBC. They quit two years back, driving off into the Botswana sunset, and The Traitors producer Studio Lambert has since taken over production from Expectation.

Amazon said Season 7 “honours the show's legacy while driving it into a new era.” The presenters will head to Angola, Malaysia and California, test driving cars and taking part in challenges.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Bourgeois is well known for his viral trainspotting videos, which have given him millions of followers across social. He previously hosted Trainspotting with Francis Bourgeois for Channel 4. Engelsman and Holland run Throttle House, a YouTube channel that clocks up millions of viewers per vid, test driving cars, tracking test runs and taking adventures.


	Amazon is taking something of a gamble by dipping into the content creator well rather than looking to established names with older audiences like Clarkson. Content creators are all the rave in the British TV industry at present and, for our recent deep dive, multiple producers told us top broadcasting executives are now obsessed with YouTube stars and how they can better leverage their talent and audience base.


	Bourgeois said: “The saying ‘big shoes to fill' spring to mind. Well, in this case it'll be like [British runner] Mo Farah running in Size 14 wellies — it'll be a little awkward at first, perhaps blister inducing but will overall be an interesting watch.”


	Tara Erer, Head of UK & Northern Europe Originals at Prime Video, added: “The Grand Tour is Prime Video's most watched unscripted UK Original series globally, so finding the right successors was no small feat – but we've absolutely struck gold. We're beyond excited to pass the keys to Thomas, James, and Francis, three standout talents who emerged from an extensive search. Each bringing distinctive talents and energy that will propel the series into exciting new territory while capturing the spirit of adventure and camaraderie of this beloved franchise.” 

	











	Studio Lambert, storied All3Media-backed British producer behind The Traitors and Gogglebox, landed the contract to develop a fresh version of The Grand Tour in 2024, which was previously made by Clarkson's Farm producer Expectation. 


	Clarkson, who is his mid-60s, previously said the “immensely physical” Grand Tour missions had taken their toll. He has been focusing on his other hit Prime Video show, Clarkson's Farm, while May and Hammond work across a wealth of different TV and radio shows.


The Grand Tour EPs are Phil Churchward, Tim Harcourt, Stephen Lambert, Alex Renton and Nia Yemoh, with production executives Hilary Berkshire and Diana Focke.

International Investigations Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Apple TV executive Jay Hunt has been sounded out about becoming the next director general of the BBC.


	Deadline understands that Hunt, the European creative director at Apple TV, has been approached about succeeding Tim Davie, who dramatically resigned in November amid a scandal over a Panorama documentary about Donald Trump.


Sources have consistently told Deadline that Hunt is among the frontrunners for the most powerful job in British media, and we now hear that conversations have taken place. It is not clear if Hunt will participate in formal interviews in the coming weeks.

	The BBC declined to comment on speculation regarding the recruitment process, which is being overseen by chair Samir Shah alongside headhunters at Egon Zehnder. Hunt did not respond to a request for comment.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Davie will step down on April 2, with nations chief Rhodri Talfan Davies becoming interim DG until a permanent successor is appointed. Davie is embarking on a farewell tour, telling employees he will be “out and about meeting teams across the UK.” Davie will preside over a town hall next week, during which he intends to brief staff on “the next stage of our strategy.”


	Many consider Hunt to be the most well-rounded candidate, given her credentials as a former journalist, her familiarity with the BBC, track record of backing hits like Slow Horses and Sherlock, and her experience at one of the world's most influential tech companies.


	Hunt has worked at Apple for the past eight years, her longest spell in an executive post throughout her career. In the past two years, she has balanced this with chairing the British Film Institute. 

	











	Hunt was previously Channel 4's chief creative officer for six years, while her other roles have included running BBC1 and heading up content at Channel 5, the Paramount-owned network. Her spell as a journalist included editing BBC News at Six and senior roles on Newsnight and Panorama.


	Hunt is one of three female frontrunners, with former BBC content boss Charlotte Moore, and ex-Channel 4 CEO Alex Mahon, also considered to be serious contenders. The BBC has never had a female director general, so appointing a woman would be a historic moment for the national broadcaster.


	Moore only left the BBC last year to become CEO of The Crown producer Left Bank Pictures, but many at the UK national broadcaster would welcome her back with open arms. Several people close to Moore said she had ruled herself out, but there is a feeling that she has not completely shut the door on a return to the BBC.


	As for Mahon, sources have said she is “serious” about the director general vacancy, despite only recently leaving Channel 4 to become the boss at Superstruct Entertainment, the festival company backed by private equity giant KKR. There is a view among some at the BBC that she could be the candidate to beat.


	Others are not ruling out a dark horse contender. Other names linked to the BBC job include Jane Turton, boss of The Traitors producer All3Media; Patrick Holland, the Banijay UK chief and former BBC2 boss; Anna Mallett, the former ITN CEO who is now Netflix's vice president of production in Europe; and James Harding, the former BBC News boss now running Tortoise Media, which publishes The Observer.


The Guardian reported last week that CNN boss Mark Thompson had been sounded out about a shock return to the BBC, but had made clear he was committed to the U.S. news network. Another potential candidate, Kevin Bakhurst, director general of Ireland's RTÉ and a former BBC News journalist, told Irish lawmakers in December that he had not applied for the BBC vacancy.


	Davie's successor will inherit an organization wrestling with its place in a media ecosystem dominated by overseas tech giants, as well as battling enemies closer to home, with conservative politicians and media proprietors wishing to see the BBC diminished during charter renewal. There is also the small matter of a looming legal fight with the U.S. president over the botched Panorama edit that triggered Davie's resignation.

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


David Ellison has written an open letter to the UK creative community, committing to content investment, theatrical windows, and preserving HBO, as Paramount continues its pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD).


	With Ellison's hopes of landing his prize looking increasingly bleak, the CEO also took the opportunity to swipe at Netflix, suggesting that the streamer's vision for WBD's studios assets would create a “monopolistic or dominant entity.”


	Netflix has said it is “highly confident” of getting its $83B deal past regulatory authorities in the UK and beyond. “This deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator and pro-growth,” a UK spokesperson said in a statement last week.

	Ellison, who has been meeting with UK lawmakers as part of a charm offensive in the country, said: “We believe the creative community and audiences are best served by greater choice — not less — and by a marketplace that encourages the full spectrum of filmmaking, content creation, and theatrical exhibition, not one that eliminates meaningful competition by creating a monopolistic or dominant entity.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	He specifically named Netflix, adding: “In stark contrast to Netflix's path, this proposed combination is intended to strengthen competition by creating a more capable and effective rival to the dominant platforms.”


	Ellison set out Paramount's commitments as part of its hostile WBD takeover plan, though there did not appear to be any specific gestures to the UK creative community. He repeated Paramount's plan to release more than 30 cinema films a year and said the company would commit to a minimum theatrical window of 45 days (Netflix has made the same pledge).

	











	“HBO will continue to operate independently under our ownership, enabling it to create more of the world-class content it is renowned for,” he added. HBO Max will launch in March in the UK, where Paramount owns assets including 5, the public service broadcasting network.


	Ellison concluded: “At Paramount, we will do everything in our power to ensure the next generation of extraordinary films can be told and seen by the broadest possible audience on the biggest screens. And we will do so under conditions of fair access and vibrant marketplace choice—because we are pro-competition, pro-creative community, and pro-consumer.”


Below is the full letter:


	To the British creative community, fellow film lovers and television fans, the industry at large, and all who care deeply about the future of cinema and the arts.


	As a producer and lifelong fan of movies and television, I am writing this open letter to speak clearly and unequivocally about the vital role visual storytelling plays in our society. Films and television transcend age, ethnicity, politics, and socio-economic status, connecting us through shared experience. They entertain and inspire us, transport us to new worlds, preserve our history, and expand our sense of what is possible. This art form is essential—and it must be protected and preserved for generations to come.


	At Paramount, these beliefs are what drive us and our pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery. We see an extraordinary opportunity to bring together our two celebrated companies, enabling us to tell more stories, reach broader audiences, and amplify impact. Just as important, we believe the creative community and audiences are best served by greater choice—not less—and by a marketplace that encourages the full spectrum of filmmaking, content creation, and theatrical exhibition, not one that eliminates meaningful competition by creating a monopolistic or dominant entity.


	I want to be absolutely clear—if we succeed in acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery, here are the commitments I make to the creative community and to audiences:


	Again, I make these commitments because I have a deep love and appreciation for storytelling—especially on screen—and because I firmly believe that uniting Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery presents a unique opportunity to build a true champion for the creative community, one that can and will bring more stories to life, support filmmakers and talent with real scale, and compete effectively on the global stage as an independent media leader. At the same time—and in stark contrast to Netflix's path—this proposed combination is intended to strengthen competition by creating a more capable and effective rival to the dominant platforms.


	At Paramount, we will do everything in our power to ensure the next generation of extraordinary films can be told and seen by the broadest possible audience on the biggest screens. And we will do so under conditions of fair access and vibrant marketplace choice—because we are pro-competition, pro-creative community, and pro-consumer. This commitment drives our pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery, and we hope we can count on your strong support as we work tirelessly to safeguard the future of visual storytelling.

Kendall Roy throwing another tantrum.

Maybe don't give scumbag Brett Ratner a tent-pole movie because Trump asked….
…and the Hollywood creative community would start listening to you….

Um, Paramount is releasing 10 films this year, so he's flat out lying.

Ellison is delusional. Dude needs to hang it up. Paramount and WB is more of a monopoly than Netflix. Loser behavior.

“They shouldn't get to be monopolistic. Only we should be monopolistic. Me and my father, one of the richest men in the world..”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Bella Hadid pulled over by police moments before Adan Banuelos' arrest: report","https://pagesix.com/2026/02/04/celebrity-news/bella-hadid-pulled-over-by-police-before-adan-baneoulos-arrest/","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 01:17:00 GMT","

Bella Hadid was reportedly pulled over by police just moments before on-again off-again boyfriend Adan Banuelos was arrested for public intoxication. 

According to a police report obtained by TMZ, deputies pulled over the model in the parking lot of Gator's Cantina in Weatherford, Texas in the early morning hours of Saturday, when Banuelos came toward them.

“I immediately noted that Adan's speech was slurred and his eyes were bloodshot and glassy,” the arresting officer alleged in the report.

The report also noted an “odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath” as Banuelos explained that he was worried about Hadid.

Advertisement

Per the report, Banuelos claimed Hadid went back into the bar because she left her phone there, and he “followed her,” adding that he “cared for her.”

Authorities wrote in their report that as they spoke with Banuelos, his white truck continued to run while a dog, which he claimed was Hadid's, was still inside.

Banuelos reportedly consented to a field sobriety test after confessing to consuming “four” beers that day — which led to his arrest.

The report stated that Banuelos was taken into custody as a precaution against him “possibly driving a vehicle or posing a danger to himself or others.”

“I released Adan's property and his vehicle to his girlfriend, who was identified as Isabella Hadid, at his request,” the report read, per the outlet. 

The professional cowboy was subsequently transported to Parker County jail, where he was questioned — and according to the report, he strenuously denied having driven to the bar and refused to give a name for who did.

The horseman, 36, reportedly told authorities that “he was at home with a friend when Isabella came home and then left again to go back to the bar.”

“Adan said that he and his friend got into the truck and drove after Isabella, and when they arrived at the bar, his friend went inside, and Adan walked over to the traffic stop.”

A rep for Hadid, 29, did not immediately return Page Six's request for comment on Wednesday. 

Page Six confirmed on Saturday that Banuelos had been arrested for public intoxication, following TMZ's initial report. He was released the same day after paying a minor bond of $386.

Page Six confirmed earlier last week that he and Hadid had split after two years of dating, with a source calling their relationship “tumultuous.”

Breakup rumors first emerged in June 2025, but died down after the athlete shared an Instagram birthday wish for Hadid in October, writing in part, “Love you, baby. I'll keep reminding you every day just how much.”

A source told Page Six earlier this week that the pair's difficulties may come down to differing lifestyles. 

“She's the daughter of Mohamed and Yolanda Hadid,” a source told us of the reality star and real estate titan. “It's such a different way of growing up.”

Britney Spears candidly admitted that she's “lucky to be alive” after surviving the way her family treated her. 

“As people, all we really want is to feel connected to each other and never feel alone,” the pop star wrote via Instagram Wednesday.

“For those of you in your family that have (sic) said to help you is to isolate you and make you feel unbelievably left out … they were wrong. We can forgive as people but u don't ever forget.”

“Yearning and longing for contact is always crucial !!!” Spears, 44, continued. “I'm incredibly lucky to even be alive with how my family treated me once in my life and now I'm scared of them.”

The “Toxic” songstress explained that “it's weird how God works in mysterious ways,' adding, “My friends, what do you think he is saying today ???”

“Because to be totally honest with you, no matter what he says, they will never take responsibility for what they did.”

The hitmaker concluded that she hadn't “danced in a month,” saying, “I broke my toe twice!”

A rep for Britney wasn't immediately available to Page Six for comment.

Britney was entangled in a 13-year conservatorship under her father, Jamie Spears, from 2008 to 2021, giving him control over her finances, medical decisions and personal and professional proceedings.

Before her conservatorship ended, she testified against her father, claiming that he forced her to embark on her 2018 “Piece of Me” tour and Las Vegas residency.

The Grammy winner claimed Jamie drugged her with a “very strong” drug known as lithium when she wasn't cooperating during rehearsals for her residency.

Britney also stated Jamie forced her into rehab and threatened her not to see her kids — Sean Preston Federline and Jayden James Federline — if she didn't cooperate.

Additionally, the “Circus” singer shared she was required to be on birth control and prohibited from getting married or having another baby.

Britney vulnerably opened up about her conservatorship in her 2023 memoir, “The Woman in Me,” claiming that her sole purpose was “for no other reason than to help [her family's] cash flow.”

Court filings showed Jamie awarded himself around $6 million throughout the years of Britney's conservatorship.

Britney remains estranged from Jamie, with an insider telling Us Weekly in September that there was no chance of reconciling despite the latter's health issues. 

Advertisement

However, she's worked on “rebuilding” her bond with her mom, Lynn Spears, over the years, though the source told the outlet their relationship is “very fragile” with communication “every few weeks.”

As for Britney and her sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, their relationship has reportedly been on the mend following their famous feud in 2022.

The “Criminal” singer is closest to her brother, Bryan Spears, who moved in with her shortly after her split from ex-husband Sam Asghari in August 2023.

Savannah Guthrie and her siblings, Annie and Camron, are begging for their mother Nancy's safe return after her mysterious disappearance.

“Bring her home,” the journalist captioned an Instagram video shared on Wednesday night.

“We want to thank all of you for the prayers for our beloved mom, Nancy. We feel them and we continue to believe that she feels them too,” an emotional Savannah said in the clip, reading from a prepared statement.

“Our mom is a kind, faithful, loyal, fiercely loving woman of goodness and light. She's funny, spunky, and clever. She has grandchildren that adore her and crowd around her, and cuddle her with kisses,” the siblings' message continued.

“She loves fun and adventure. She is a devoted friend. She is full of kindness and knowledge. Talk to her, and you'll see.” 

Annie echoed her sister's sentiments, adding that the “light is missing” from their family's lives without their mother. 

“Nancy is our mother. We are her children, she is our beacon. She holds fast to joy in all of life's circumstances. She chooses joy day after day. Despite having already passed through great trials of pain and grief,” she said, as Savannah tearfully held her head down.

“We are always going to be merely human. Just normal human people who need our mom. Mama, mama if you're listening, We need you to come home. We miss you.”

Savannah continued to read from her note as she pleaded with her mother's alleged captor for proof that she is alive.

“Our mom is our heart, and our home. She is 84 years old. Her health, her heart is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive, she needs it not to suffer. We, too, have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media. As a family we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk,” Savannah said.

Addressing the purported kidnapper, she added: “However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know — without a doubt — that she is alive, and that you have her. We want to hear from you and we are ready to listen.”

The former “Today” show host then sent a message directly to Nancy, asking her to “please reach out” to their family. 

“Mommy, if you are hearing this, you are a strong woman. You are God's precious daughter, Nancy. We believe and know that even in this valley, he is with you,” she said.

“Everyone is looking for you, Mommy — everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again. We speak to you every moment and we pray without ceasing. And we will rejoice in advance that the day we will hold you in our arms again. We love you, mom,” Savannah closed before her siblings echoed her last sentence in their closing statements.

Nancy was last seen on Saturday at around 9:30 p.m. She was reportedly dropped off at her Catalina Foothills home after having dinner with family members.

On Monday, the Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed that Nancy's home was being treated as a crime scene.

Authorities initially believed Annie was the last person to see their matriarch before she went missing. After which, FBI agents paid Annie's home in Arizona a visit on Tuesday amid the continued investigation.

However, authorities told The Post that Annie's husband, Tommaso Cioni, was the last person who saw Nancy alive when he drove her back to her home at around 9:45 p.m. after she had dinner with him and his wife.

The Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed they have yet to identify a suspect or person of interest in an X statement on Wednesday.

Kylie Jenner just released a new product — and she's dressing the part.

To promote her Kylie Cosmetics Pomegranate Lip Butter ($21), she posed for a photo shoot wearing little besides the product's namesake fruit.

In a totally sheer, nude-toned minidress with a bra top made of tons of pomegranate seeds, Jenner stares just off camera with her hair slicked back into a tight bun.

She is, of course, wearing the new lip butter in the snaps, the rest of her glam taking the natural route.

It's unclear if the outfit incorporates the real deal or faux seeds, but the makeup mogul truly loves the fruit; so much so that she even chowed down on some during the shoot.

Holding a white bowl of pomegranate seeds, the beauty mogul said in a behind-the-scenes video posted on Instagram, “Eating my pomegranates, on our pomegranate lip butter shoot, dressed in pomegranates.”

The 28-year-old is no stranger to dressing like her products.

In the past three months alone, Jenner has covered herself in glitter body paint for her “King Kylie Collection,” worn a bandeau top and mini skirt made entirely of lip gloss and slipped into a red latex catsuit to launch her latest fragrance.

What's more, not only has Jenner launched a new variation of one of her best-selling products, but she's also collaborated with sister Kourtney Kardashian and her brand Lemme on a limited-edition pomegranate gummy called Skin Glaze.

Chris Hemsworth was hesitant to reveal his genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease for the sake of his acting career.

“I wondered if I was letting people too far in,” Hemsworth — known for his role as Marvel superhero Thor —  told Variety in an interview published Wednesday. 

“Are they no longer going to believe in the action star or the Marvel character?” He questioned. “And do I want people to know my fears and insecurities to this level?” 

Advertisement

Hemsworth, 42, revealed the predisposition in 2022 and has since shared that his grandfather and father were hit with the disease, which has no known cure. 

Advertisement

At the time, the actor shared that he has a copy of the gene APOE4 from both parents, making him “eight to 10 times more likely” to battle the progressive disease. 

However, he made clear that he hasn't “handed in [his] resignation.”

“It's not a pre-deterministic gene, but it is a strong indication. Ten years ago, I think it was more thought of as determinant,” he said.

Hemsworth was disappointed with the way the press spun his admission to make it seem like he was destined to be diagnosed with the disease. 

Advertisement

“It really kind of pissed me off because it felt like I had been vulnerable with something personal and shared this,” he told Vanity Fair in 2024. 

He continued, “No matter how much I said ‘This is not a death sentence,' the story became that I have dementia and I'm reconsidering life and retiring and so on.”

Hemsworth has been more selective with his acting gigs since his father's heartbreaking diagnosis.

“I'd think, ‘I came from nothing. Who am I to turn down that kind of money?'” he said, referring to the blockbuster films he took on earlier in his career. “Justifying things that weren't the purest creative decision – but I'll be able to pay for my parents' house, or I'll be able to help out my cousins.”

Hemsworth said that his 2025 documentary, “A Road Trip To Remember” — which explores his dad's battle with Alzheimer's — was “so deeply personal.” 

“It was a love letter to my father,” he said. “It empowered him for a period, and stimulated memories that were being taken away from him.”

The Aussie actor revealed that he was making lifestyle changes after learning he is at risk.

Advertisement

“I'm lifting less frequently than I was and I'm incorporating more cardio and endurance workouts which I much prefer than heavy body-building style sessions,” he told Men's Health in 2023.

He also started prioritizing sleep and taking regular ice baths. 

That same year, Hemsworth took a step back from his acting career — but emphasized that he is not retiring.

An independent theater in Lake Oswego, Oregon, just a few miles south of Portland, is reporting that the Amazon corporation does not, in fact, have a sense of humor when it comes to its new, very expensive Brett Ratner documentary Melania. Per the Lake Oswego Review, Jordan Perry, general manager for the small city's Lake Theater & Cafe, is claiming that Amazon has yanked the movie out of theaters after he advertised the booking with taglines like “To defeat your enemy. You must know them. Melania,” and the slightly less confrontational, “Does Melania wear Prada? Find out on Friday!”

Perry wrote about the decision on the theater's Instagram—which, we can't help but note in passing, is also filled with hand-drawn movie posters that are pretty kick-ass—noting that the theater “Got a call that the higher ups (i.e., at Amazon) were upset with how our marquee marketed their movie (i.e., Melania), that, per them, Sunday would be its last day here.” Joking “please don't cancel my Prime” and suggesting that devoted Amazon fans will have to “show your support at Whole Foods instead,” Perry noted both in the Instagram post and in a separate blog post that he also got quite a bit of pushback from the theater's fans for screening the documentary at all. Titling the post “Why I, Jordan, Got Melania Here,” Perry wrote that, “Mostly, I thought doing so would be funny.” But also, “Financially, the film marketplace this week and next were a desert… So, to fill a screen, why not get this inexplicable vanity piece from the current president's wife? I mean, it just seems so weird that it even exists (who wants a movie about Melania lol?), and wouldn't it then be exponentially weirder, to the point of being funny, to show it here, at your obviously anti-establishment, occasionally troublemaking, neighborhood cinema?”

Perry suggests that the theater may be on Amazon's “black list” for a while, possibly impacting the release of upcoming films like Project Hail Mary. (He also notes that the film made the company about $196 during its truncated run, writing, “Jeff Bezos won't notice the $196. He wouldn't notice $1,960, though someone on his team noticed our marquee.”)

Anyway: “Wuthering Heights” starts 2/12.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Okay, let's watch clips of every single comedian just cast in the British SNL","https://www.avclub.com/british-snl-casts-comedians-watch-clips","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 03:39:42 GMT","

We've known for about a year at this point about the U.K.'s plan to import Saturday Night Live across the Atlantic, with an official British version going into production under Lorne Michaels' oversight. (It's actually part of a long tradition of countries trying to import SNL, usually to extremely limited success; of the 14 countries that have tried, only a handful—Egypt, Germany, Italy—went any kind of multi-season distance, and only South Korea's version is currently on the air.) Right out the gate, we'd note that the sheer amount of British sketch comedy out there at the moment threatens to make Saturday Night Live less of a unique beast than it is in the States, where its sheer institutional presence and rarity in network TV is probably its most potent marketing tool. Even so, there's a fascinating question lurking at the heart of the plan, one that Sky TV has now officially answered: Which British comedians do you cast to start a brand new Saturday Night Live?

Rather than rattle off a list of credits for the show's just-announced cast—Hammed Animashaun, Ayoade Bamgboye, Larry Dean, Celeste Dring, George Fouracres, Ania Magliano, Annabel Marlow, Al Nash, Jack Shep, Emma Sidi, and Paddy Young—we figured it'd be better to see them in motion, so we've collected clips of as many of the 11 newcomers as we can. We have also, because we are incapable of not doing this, noted which of them have done a season of Taskmaster. (It's Ania Magliano and Emma Sidi, natch.)

First up: Hammed Animashaun, who American audiences might actually know from his role on Prime Video's Wheel Of Time adaptation. (He played the tree guy, Loial.) Here he is (briefly) in his recent U.K. comedy series Black Ops:



Next: Ayoade Bamgboye, who won Best Newcomer at Edingburgh in 2025, here in a sketch for Channel 4's Comedy Playground:



Then we've got Scottish stand-up Larry Dean:



And Celeste Dring, one half of comedy duo Lazy Susan:



George Fouracres, a stand-up best known as one-third of the comedy group Daphne:



There's Ania Magliano, a stand-up, writer, and person we know from Taskmaster:



Annabel Marlow, well-known as a musical comedian:



Al Nash, best known as an online comedy sketch guy:



Jack Shep, who's done a few TV roles but seems to be mostly prominent on TikTok. (Apologies for the lack of embed.)

Emma Sidi, a comedian and stand-up with a focus on character work who is also, yes, a former Taskmaster contestant:

Celebrities who know and love “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie were gobsmacked by the stunningly raw and vulnerable video she and her siblings — sister Annie and brother Camron — posted on the evening of February 4, 2026. 

Looking understandably haggard and heartbroken, Savannah began their video, reading a written statement that addressed a possible captor and noting they were aware of ransom notes regarding their mom, 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie. Millions have been praying for Nancy's safe return since she disappeared from her home in Tucson, Arizona, overnight on February 1, 2026.

Less than an hour after the post went live, over 18,000 people had commented on the Guthrie family's Instagram post, including her “Today” show colleague Carson Daly, who'd asked viewers earlier in the day to stay positive. 

Many other journalists reached out, too. Savannah's dear friend and former co-anchor Hoda Kotb posted two comments, first writing, “❤️❤️ please❤️❤️🙏🙏” and then “Bring her home.” 

NBC's “Sunday Today” host Willie Geist wrote, “Bring Nancy home. We love you Savannah, Annie, and Cam.”

CNN anchor Sara Sidner chimed in, “Bless you. I'm so so ver sorry for the pain you are going through.”

ABC “World News Tonight” anchor David Muir wrote, “We're with you, Savannah — and your siblings – Please bring Nancy home ❤️”

CBS News reporter Jamie Yuccas commented, “Sending you love and prayers for a safe return. ❤️”

“Good Morning America” reporter Will Ganss wrote, “Praying that the light will soon be restored to your lives, that your mother will return home soundly. Thank you for sharing these words. We are all with you.”

Many other famous friends reached out on Savannah's post within the first hour. Bruce Willis' wife, Emma Heming Willis, was among the first to comment, writing, “Bring her home. We continue to pray for her and your family ❤️” 

“The Morning Show” actress Karen Pittman wrote, “Please please bring Nancy home. Praying for you all. ❤️❤️

Legendary actress Frances Fisher posted, “Pray Mama comes home safe 🙏🏽”

Ross Mathews of “The Drew Barrymore Show” simply commented, “I love you” and actress Alyssa Milano wrote, “Bring her home.”

Best-selling author Kate Bowler shared, “Praying with you and for God's precious child Nancy.”

Reality TV star Savannah Chrisley exclaimed, “BRING HER HOME!!! God will NOT fail your family. I have to believe that. GOD WILL PREVAIL!!! Will never stop praying ❤️”

Tennis legend Billie Jean King commented, “Sending our love and support to your entire family.”

Actress Jennie Garth weighed in, “Please bring her home to her family. Sending all my prayers🙏🏻❤️🪽”

Savannah began the family's video by stating, “On behalf of our family, we want to thank all of you for the prayers for our beloved mom, Nancy. We feel them, and we continue to believe that she feels them too.”

Choking back tears, Savannah said, “The light is missing from our lives,” she said. “Nancy is our mother. We are her children.” 

Savannah called their mom “our heart and our home” through tears, noting, “She is 84 years old. Her health, her heart is fragile.” She also said that Nancy lives in “constant pain” and needs medication to survive. Addressing her mom directly, Savannah added, “Mama, mama, if you're listening, we need you to come home. We miss you.”

She also addressed a possible captor, clearly still unaware of who might have their mom. “We too have heard the reports about a ransom letter in the media,” she said. “As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk.” 

Acknowledging the advent of AI technology, she added, “We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen. Please reach out to us.”

Nicole Curtis had quite an ordeal aboard a tiny plane during her recent travels. The HGTV star shared details of the flight that left her crying and praying, with video showing just how scary it was.

On Feb 1, Curtis took to Instagram to share the details of her dicey flight.

“Not sure what we are going to call this phase I'm in, but I ended up in Central America on a tiny little plane tonight,” she wrote in the caption. “I cried, I prayed, I took the Lord's name in vain.”

Thankfully, she landed safely at her destination.

Curtis noted, “And for the nice people — tell me, what's the craziest thing on your life list? This is tied with the night train across India for me.”

“Was supposed to be on another plane, but I'm horizontal til morning — motion sickness got me,” she added.

Curtis also shared a quick update on the status of “Rehab Addict.” The show started a new season in summer 2025, but fans have been waiting on the final two episodes to air.

“Shows are done — waiting for airdate announcement. (For the people that are gonna throw hate),” she wrote.

In a February 4 Instagram post, the HGTV star checked in with fans with some questions about her show.

“I need immediate information from all of you and your friends (so tag your best buddies in your comment) or send this post out and comment. I'm making life decisions based on your feedback,” she wrote. “I'm listening and more importantly, I'm out here collecting much needed data.”

“1. Did you watch the Wyoming episodes on regular TV, stream them or are you still waiting for me to re-air them? 2. Do you watch HGTV by day or night? Or do you DVR?” she asked.

Curtis continued, “3. What are your thoughts about me showing you my projects that are in other countries ? 😬 and what country would you love to see?”

She concluded the post by asking, “Are you ready for me to be back in your TV ? Let me know; otherwise, I'm chasing another passport stamp ❤️❤️.”

Fans flooded the comments section, with one writing, “Your HGTV show is my most watched. I love the originality you bring back to the homes.”

Another fan noted, “We watch you on HGTV and are waiting for your new season.”

“Can't wait for the rest of Wyoming shows. I am from North Dakota and love the small town build. I only watch on streaming platforms,” one fan commented. “And I would totally watch whatever builds you do … just please don't make us wait so long.”

Another fan shared, “I completely understand the traveling, but I want you back on my TV!!!! With ANYTHING you want to do. 😃”

Savannah Guthrie's brother-in-law, Tommaso Cioni, was identified as a possible suspect in the disappearance of Guthrie's mother, Nancy Guthrie, according to Ashleigh Banfield.

Ashleigh Banfield, the former host of News Nation's “Banfield,” claimed a “highly regarded” law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation informed her that Cioni “may be the prime suspect” in this case.

Investigators have since debunked the rumors, but Cioni's name continues to circulate.

Cioni is married to Nancy Guthrie's eldest daughter, Annie Guthrie. He was reportedly one of the the last people to see Nancy on Saturday evening during a family dinner. 

While not much is known about Cioni, the couple reportedly reside nearly Nancy in Tucson, Arizona.  

“My husband Tommaso Cioni is my greatest teacher. He is a great manifester; he writes poetry with his lifestyle,” Annie shared in a May 2013 interview. “I was trained as a reader. My family was book-centered. In junior high I always hid in the library at lunch time to avoid the other kids. I think writing is just what young readers begin to do. There was never a decision. My Mom always made us keep diaries.”

According to a LinkedIn profile attributed to Cioni, he works as a teacher at a charter school in Tucson. A biography seemingly written for Cioni from the Tapirulan Cultural Association, reads: “I was born in San Giovanni Valdarno on June 18, 1975.”

“Since 2006, I have been living in Tucson, Arizona. I write when it happens. I study lizards. I play the electric bass. I make homemade pasta.”

Cioni also plays bass for a local band called Early Black. 

“Early Black was born on April 2007, when Dominic Evans (drums) and Tommaso Cioni (bass, vocals) met Walter I. Gonçalves, Jr. (guitar, vocals) over a series of online and newspaper ads (Evans met Gonçalves through a Craigslist posting, Cioni responded to a Tucson Weekly posting),” the band's Reverb Nation profile reads. 

After reports began circulating, pointing to Cioni as a possible suspect in the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos released a statement.

“At this point, investigators have not identified a suspect or person of interest in this case. Detectives continue to speak with anyone who may have had contact with Mrs. Guthrie,” the statement, which was shared via social media on Wednesday, February 4, began. “Detectives are working closely with the Guthrie family.” 

He added, “While we appreciate the public's concern, the sharing of unverified accusations or false information is irresponsible and does not assist the investigation.”

Mmmmmm im puzzle about this story too my first guess was the police should investigate the last person who was seen with her that my first guess.🤔 i 🙏🏾 that they find her safe and unharmed 🤞🏾🙏🏾✝️..I will keep her family in my ❤️🙏🏾🤞🏾 for safety return..

Just very sad. People jump to conclusions too fast. Someone out there knows and is guilty. I pray they find her quickly. If this was my mother, I'd be hysterical.  What is the mood and facial expressions of this son in law?

Call it the product of some awards season burnout and the residual impact of an exhausting Sundance, but we're starting to get pretty excited about the possibilities of a good, old-fashioned horror movie. With fun! And sisters! And David Cronenberg in an acting role!

Following their 2019 hit, directing duo Radio Silence (aka Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett) and their Final Girl for the ages, Samara Weaving, are back for “Ready or Not 2: Here I Come.” Familiarity with the original film is a must for this one, as it picks up immediately after the events of “Ready or Not,” in which blushing bride Grace (Weaving) was shocked to discover she had married into a murderous family that loved nothing more than playing deadly games around their sprawling mansion. Poor Grace, she had no idea what the hell she got into when she picked “Hide and Seek” on her wedding night.

But, crucially, Grace did get out of all that (too bad it involved the death of her husband and all her in-laws), and so you can imagine she felt pretty good when it was all over. Alas, with the advent of a sequel, it's clear none of this is actually over. 

Here's the official synopsis courtesy of Searchlight Pictures: “Moments after surviving an all-out attack from the Le Domas family, Grace (Samara Weaving) discovers she's reached the next level of the nightmarish game — and this time with her estranged sister Faith (Kathryn Newton) at her side. Grace has one chance to survive, keep her sister alive, and claim the High Seat of the Council that controls the world. Four rival families are hunting her for the throne, and whoever wins rules it all.”

 










In the film's latest trailer, we get a better sense of the rules of the game and what the prize is: nothing less than world domination. Neat! Along the way, Grace and Faith will go up against a group of “High Council” families that make the Le Domas clan look like amateurs, including turns from Elijah Wood, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Shawn Hatosy, Nestor Carbonell, and Cronenberg himself.

Come for Gellar and Hatosy giddily driving their golf cart to clearly nefarious activities, stay for Carbonell really fucking up that whole “loading a gun” thing.

Check out the new trailer for the film below, which Searchlight Pictures will release in theaters on Friday, March 20.

A stacked cast descends upon Berlin this month for the world premiere of Karim Aïnouz‘s lustily awaited, prickly family drama “Rosebush Pruning.”

The ensemble includes Callum Turner, Elle Fanning, Jamie Bell, Riley Keough, Lukas Gage, Tracy Letts, Pamela Anderson, and Elena Anaya — and a new clip shared by Mubi, which is repping sales on the film at the festival, offers a devious taste of the drama. It's scripted by Efthimis Filippou, the co-writer on the more hopeless Yorgos Lanthimos movies like “Kinds of Kindness” and “The Killing of a Sacred Deer.”

 










Here's the official synopsis before we dive into what's going on in the clip: “In an opulent villa underneath the Catalonian sun, American siblings Jack, Ed, Anna, and Robert wallow in isolation and their inherited fortune, eschewing the demands of their blind father, and seeking love and validation through each other and their latest designer clothes. When Jack, the eldest brother and linchpin of this family, announces he is moving in with his girlfriend, Martha, blood ties are severed, and Ed starts to uncover the truth surrounding their mother's death. Generational lies begin to unravel, and the fabric of this family slowly begins to disintegrate.”

Those siblings are played by Turner, Bell, Keough, and Gage, and in the clip below, Letts' character asks his children to describe Martha's (Fanning) physical appearance and “bosom,” and they all proceed to debate about it in ways that quietly humiliate Martha — and treat her like she's not even in the room.

“Rosebush Pruning” is inspired by Marco Bellocchio's 1965 drama “Fists in the Pocket,” the Italian director's debut about siblings mounting an almost family annihilation. Originally, Kristen Stewart and Josh O'Connor were set to star in “Rosebush Pruning” before they were swapped by Keough and Turner due to scheduling conflicts. Filming has been completed for over a year, and “Rosebush” had been expected at multiple festivals ahead of Berlin.

Brazilian director Aïnouz's last film was 2004's sexually charged Cannes premiere; he also directed “Firebrand,” Brazil's 2020 Oscar entry “The Invisible Life of Eurídice Gusmão,” and “Futuro Beach.” 

Other starry films landing at this year's Berlin Film Festival include “Everybody Digs Bill Evans” with Anders Danielsen Lie, “Queen at Sea” with Juliette Binoche, honorary Golden Bear recipient Michelle Yeoh in Sean Baker's short “Sandiwara,” “Rose” with Sandra Hüller, and much more.

While working on their second album, two members of Mandy, Indiana—the Mancunian quartet fronted by a French valkyrie named Valentine Caulfield—were faced with their own corporeality. Drummer Alex Macdougall underwent surgery for a hernia and, after doctors found a lump, had half of his thyroid removed. Caulfield lost most of her vision in one eye. The 10-hour days that comprised the recording sessions could have broken them. Instead, the band's distinctive sound—an alloy of industrial, post-punk, and '80s neo-noir soundtracks—emerged titanium-plated and electrified. URGH is both headier and more visceral than anything Mandy, Indiana have made before. This isn't body music or brain music; it's spine music, homed in on the bony junction where mind meets matter.

Listening to Mandy, Indiana's 2023 debut, i've seen a way, felt like wandering the darkrooms at Berghain—if Berghain blasted vintage French pirate radio broadcasts. You were in the cool kids' club but couldn't shake the sense of being held at a remove, as if there were another velvet rope you weren't allowed to cross. URGH puts you right in the sex sling, and there's Caulfield towering overhead, cracking a riding crop. As she recites Revelation 6 (the one about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse) on opener “Sevastopol,” her voice glitches and frays like Jigsaw coming through the TV screen. The abiding mood is powerlessness: At any second, a trapdoor might open beneath your feet, sending you down a tube slide into a hornet's nest of violins or a ball pit full of scrap metal.

Caulfield's lyrics—most of which she delivers in her native language—have always been concerned with power, specifically how interpersonal violation mimics the patterns of structural violence. In press materials, she described URGH's lead single “Magazine” as “the only way I will ever get to say to my rapist: You hurt me, so I'm going to hurt you.” After a blistering salvo that can best be likened to Trinidadian soca produced by Edward Scissorhands, “Magazine” plunges into a techno netherworld akin to the one Coil charted on “The Snow.” “This time, despite what you believe, you won't escape me,” Caulfield purrs, as a one-syllable sample of her voice gets chopped and splattered across the stereo field. To borrow a framing from the radical feminist scholar Andrea Dworkin, when the autonomous zone of one's body has been forcibly colonized, fantasies of retribution—to never let him do that to anyone else, ever again—are often the sole recourse. Caulfield sharpens them into knives.

In Mandy, Indiana's hands, repeated sounds and phrases become improvised weapons. “Souris souris souris souris/C'est plus joli une fille qui sourit” (“Smile, smile, smile, smile/A girl who smiles is prettier”) went the skin-crawling nursery rhyme hook of i've seen a way's “Drag [Crashed].” On URGH, Caulfield flips the French playground chant “Am stram gram” into a call to the dancefloor (“Cursive”), and recreates a sample of the “Light as a feather/Stiff as a board” scene from the 1996 teen-witch cult classic The Craft (“Life Hex”). As her voice gets gobbled up by the gnashing teeth of Macdougall's kit, the listener is, in turn, subjected to the ravages of growing up as a girl under patriarchy. But these kinds of schoolyard games are also early building blocks of female solidarity, the groundwork upon which networks of collective care—from “Are we dating the same guy?” Facebook groups to French women's activism behind Gisèle Pelicot—are built.

“Do you want to be remembered as someone who clapped as the bombs rained down?” Caulfield demands on “Dodecahedron.” “Stand up and march.” She namechecks Gaza directly on “ist halt so,” which sounds like “Bulls on Parade” being fed through a paper shredder. Mandy, Indiana's livewire, high-wire act—they're somehow even more galvanizing onstage—gets juiced here by production from guitarist Scott Fair and Gilla Band's Daniel Fox, who throw on the floodlights, catching the contours and reflections of every instrument. The rotor-blade synth that descends halfway through “try saying” seems to chop the song into ribbons. On“Sicko,” which isn't that far afield from the most virulent El-P beats, Caulfield hands the mic to another postmodern prophet, billy woods, who rails against Big Pharma.

For the closer, “I'll Ask Her,” Caulfield dons a British accent and sneaks behind enemy lines: “And anyway, you stand by your boys, 'cause they're your boys and that's just how it is, and they're all fucking crazy, man.” A synthesizer blares like an air raid siren, one of those Pavlovian triggers that means get out, get out, get out. Insidiously catchy, incomprehensibly groovy, URGH is a razor blade hiding in a rainbow jawbreaker. Then, in its final moments, Caulfield just says the thing: Your friend's a fucking rapist!!!

Where do you go from there? Out into the streets seems like a start. An “urgh” can be a vulgar grunt, a furious growl, a cry of physical exertion. It also sounds a lot like “urge.” On a record that transforms this band's music into an abstracted, serrated version of its previous self, it seems pointed to close with its most startling lyric, delivered in the second person as an accusation. Here the hard work begins.

Death stalked Mayhem from the womb. Founded near Oslo in 1984, the black metal band cycled through a handful of temporary vocalists before meeting the Swedish teenager Per Yngve Ohlin in 1988. Ohlin went by the pseudonym Dead, and his self-destructive intensity onstage was the missing piece for this band bent on sonic and metaphysical annihilation. Dead died by suicide in 1991 without ever appearing on a proper Mayhem release. His voice only surfaced posthumously on a couple of live recordings, including one adorned with a gruesome photo of his corpse next to the shotgun he used to kill himself. Two years later, Mayhem's charismatic guitarist Euronymous (born Øystein Aarseth) was murdered by Varg Vikernes, the musician behind competing black metal project Burzum. In 1994, Mayhem would finally release their debut full-length, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, featuring Euronymous on guitar and Vikernes on session bass in what might be the only musical collaboration between a murderer and his victim.

Thanks to a raft of books, films, and VH1 afternoon programming, that's all become Rock History 101. What gets left out of most of those accounts is how Mayhem quickly regrouped, soldiering on with a series of lineups built around bassist Necrobutcher and drummer Hellhammer. De Mysteriis is one of black metal's towering masterpieces, but the band has made plenty of interesting music in the decades since—the dark industrial oddity Grand Declaration of War, the violently atavistic Chimera, and a string of albums with De Mysteriis vocalist Attila Csihar. As they've aged, they've become more technically proficient, and their songs no longer sound like instinctive, nihilistic outbursts. They're simply a black metal band, albeit one that was forged in a crucible of murder, suicide, and arson. The blessing and the curse of Liturgy of Death, the band's seventh full-length and fourth since Csihar returned to the fold, is that having a new Mayhem album somehow feels commonplace now.

As with 2014's Esoteric Warfare and 2019's Daemon, the Mayhem that appears on Liturgy of Death comprises Csihar, Necrobutcher, Hellhammer, and guitarists and co-songwriters Ghul and Teloch. That's by far the longest run of lineup continuity the band has ever had, and it's given latter-day Mayhem a signature style that earlier iterations never did. Liturgy of Death completes a trilogy of ritualistic, atmosphere-driven albums that nod heartily to De Mysteriis and other Norwegian Second Wave classics. That makes this version of Mayhem a less daring one than the experimentally minded group that came up with Grand Declaration of War, but Ghul and Teloch's reverence for the fundamentals of black metal songcraft ensures that barnstormers like “Despair” and “Weep for Nothing” hit with appropriate force. On those songs—and pretty much every other song here—blastbeats churn and tremolo-picked guitars gnash their teeth. These guys know what they're doing.

Liturgy of Death has its share of weirder moments, too. Csihar remains one of extreme metal's most singular, colorful vocalists; no song can sound generic once he adds his demonic cackles, goblin shrieks, and incantatory low growls. The band shines when they match his expressiveness. Around the midpoint of “Realm of Endless Misery,” everything drops out of the mix except Csihar's indecipherable gargling and a frantic, amorphous riff from Necrobutcher's bass. The effect is deeply unsettling. In the back half of “The Sentence of Absolution,” a furious barrage of blastbeats is slowly supplanted by hypnotic, tribal drumming. It's as though Sepultura's Iggor Cavalera showed up during the session and jumped in for Hellhammer midstream. The album could have used a few more of these breaks with black metal orthodoxy.

Thematically, Liturgy of Death tackles a subject befitting a band whose legacy is so defined by loss: death itself. Specifically, the album explores “the philosophy of mortality,” and “death as a gateway to a higher form of being,” which are the kinds of things you can write about once you've survived your 20s. It's a small miracle that Mayhem are still here to examine death from this remove, that the graves of Dead and Euronymous sprouted flowers they continue to water. On “Weep for Nothing,” Csihar sings of “a common end for every mortal soul/Death's gates open alike to all.” It sounds like an invitation to get the old band back together.

“Running out of Sounds” may be an ill-advised song title for a band celebrating the 20th anniversary of its first album; this is especially true for musicians who have treated their debut as a sacred blueprint for all the records that have followed. So give Silversun Pickups some credit: They spend their seventh album, Tenterhooks—which contains a song with the aforementioned title—circling through the same sounds they've mined for two decades, blissfully oblivious to the irony.

Not that Silversun Pickups act as if they're middle-aged on Tenterhooks. Unlike so many rock bands with members facing their 50s, they don't embrace new fashions in a frantic attempt to remain relevant. Nor do they spend the record gazing at the past and mulling their own mortality. No, the L.A. quartet sticks to their tried and true, blending dreamy harmonies and blissed-out guitars as if no time had passed since the 1990s.

There's one small problem: Silversun Pickups themselves weren't part of the dream of the '90s, a fact that adds to the creeping feeling of stasis on Tenterhooks. When Silversun Pickups surfaced during the great alt-rock revival of the late 2000s, their insistent rhythms and underlying sense of vigor made Carnavas, their 2006 debut, feel fresh. Over the ensuing years, their growing professionalism created a gulf between their underground inspirations and their own output. The chasm only grew when they struck up a collaboration with Butch Vig, the producer behind alt-rock landmarks by Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins and his own band, Garbage, his studio skills smoothing out any remaining rough edges in the group.

Tenterhooks is the third Silversun Pickups album in a row to be produced by Vig, and there's a palpable sense of ease to the partnership. He swaddles their overdriven swirl in comforting clothes, weaving fuzzy riffs and candied electronics into Brian Aubert and Nikki Monninger's sighing vocals. There are shifts in tempo and tone: “Au Revoir Reservoir” plays like heightened nocturnal new wave, giving way to the gallop of “Wakey Wakey,” which in turn leads into the glassy shimmer of “Witness Mark.” But Vig's production is seamless enough that Tenterhooks starts to feel like one continuous song.

There are pleasures to be had within these spacey spirals. For listeners of a certain disposition, the marriage of dream-pop harmonies and distorted guitars can feel as welcoming as a warm bath. But the familiarity can also reveal how the years are starting to pile up for Silversun Pickups. It isn't that they lack urgency—they never specialized in catharsis, anyway—but that they're circling the same ideas they've had since the start. Vig's masterly production gives the album a seasoned gleam and punch, but his period-specific details only exacerbate the weary undercurrent on Tenterhooks; it makes the album feel stagnant, as if the Silversun Pickups are caught in an endless loop. Maybe that's an inevitable problem of trading in the music of the past: At a certain point, you're bound to run out of sounds.

Britney Spears called out her family in a post on Instagram on Wednesday night, saying she is “incredibly lucky to even be alive” after their mistreatment. 


	“As people, all we really want is to feel connected to each other and never feel alone … for those of you in your family that have said to help you is to isolate you and make you feel unbelievably left out … they were wrong,” she wrote alongside a photograph of a child holding a parent's hand. “We can forgive as people but u don't ever forget. Yearning and longing for contact is always crucial !!!”


	She added, “I'm incredibly lucky to even be alive with how my family treated me once in my life and now I'm scared of them.”


	The singer reflected on how her family hasn't owned up to their part in her conservatorship. “It's weird how God works in mysterious ways,” she wrote. “My friends, what do you think he is saying today ??? Because to be totally honest with you, no matter what he says, they will never take responsibility for what they did.”

	











	This isn't the first time Spears has posted about her family in recent months. In December, she shared an image of a Christmas tree with a sarcastic comment: “Merry late Christmas to my beautiful family who have never disrespected me, harmed me, ever done anything completely unacceptable or caused unbelievable trauma, the kind you can't fix.” 


	In November, Spears temporarily deactivated her Instagram account after she posted a series of responses to her ex-husband Kevin Federline‘s recent memoir, You Thought You Knew. The tell-all book, released in October, recounts the couple's tumultuous relationship, including their marriage in 2004 and their divorce in 2007. Along with an alarming claim that Spears would watch their children sleep with a knife in her hand , Federline wrote: “Something bad is going to happen if things don't change.” He also claimed she drank while pregnant and did cocaine while breastfeeding.

	Spears discussed her family drama in her own memoir, The Woman in Me, which was released in 2024. The best-selling book contained several bombshell revelations, many of which were related to Spears' controversial conservatorship, which finally ended in 2021. In the book, she said the court-ordered arrangement turned her into “a sort of child-robot,” adding, “I had been so infantilized that I was losing pieces of what made me feel like myself.” 

	











	The singer also wrote about agreeing to the conservatorship so she'd be able to be with her kids (whom she'd lost custody of after her divorce with Kevin Federline); feeling betrayed by her sister Jamie Lynn, who told Spears to “stop fighting” the conservatorship; and learning about the #FreeBritney movement while she was “locked up against my will” in a rehab facility.

Savannah Guthrie and her siblings, Annie and Cameron Guthrie, have shared a public plea for the return of their missing mother, Nancy Guthrie, who was last seen on Jan. 31. The 84-year-old woman is believed to have been taken from her home against her will and local authorities reportedly notified the FBI of an alleged ransom note received.


	In a tearful video captioned, “Bring her home,” and posted on Instagram on Wednesday, Feb. 4, Savannah began by thanking supporters “for the prayers for our beloved mom,” adding, “We feel them and we continue to believe that she feels them too.” The Today show host described their mother as “full of kindness and knowledge” with grandchildren that “adore her.”


	“The light is missing from our lives,” Annie continued. “She is our beacon. She holds fast to joy in all of life's circumstances. She chooses joy day after day, despite having already passed through great trials of pain and grief.” Speaking directly to Nancy, she said, “Mama, if you're listening, We need you to come home. We miss you.”

	











	Savannah said that their mother's heart is “fragile” and she lives in “constant pain,” and that she needs her medicine to survive. Savannah also acknowledged that she and her siblings heard reports of an alleged ransom letter and said, “We are ready to talk.” She then addressed the alleged kidnappers: “We live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her, we want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen.”


	Speaking to their mother, she said, “Mommy. If you are hearing this, you are a strong woman. You are God's precious daughter. We believe and know that even in this valley, he is with you. Everyone is looking for you, mommy, everywhere, we will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again.”


	The full content and source of the ransom note, which TMZ reportedly received, has not been shared. The outlet claimed that it included demands for “millions” in cryptocurrency to be paid to a Bitcoin address. The legitimacy of the note has not been verified.

	The missing person report for Nancy describes her as being 5 feet 5 inches, weighing 150 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. 88-CRIME is offering a $2,500 reward for information leading to an arrest or arrests in Nancy's disappearance. The Pima County Sheriff's Department is asking those with potential evidence to submit information via an online tip portal.


	“We speak to you every moment, and we pray without ceasing, and we rejoice in advance for the day that we hold you in our arms again,” Savannah said before ending the video. “We love you mom.”

	R&B singer Chris Brown is facing allegations he cut a songwriter out of credit and compensation on his two songs “Monalisa” and “Sensational.”


	In a new lawsuit filed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, Steve Chokpelle claims he was at Brown's Los Angeles home with Sean Kingston in 2020 when Brown asked him to compose lyrics for “Monalisa,” a track purportedly released on June 4, 2021. Though the lawsuit doesn't mention it, a 2022 “Monalisa” remix from Nigerian musicians Lojay and Sarz that also featured Brown eventually peaked at Number Eight on Billboard's U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart.


	In his complaint, Chokpelle also alleges he penned the lyrics for the follow-up track “Sensational” in 2021, and that after Brown heard a demo, he decided to cut it himself. According to Chokpelle, Brown recorded, mixed, and mastered his own version featuring Lojay, which landed on Brown's 2023 album 11:11. The track, which listed Kingston and Lojay as co-authors, climbed to Number One on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart and peaked at Number 71 on the Hot 100. The lawsuit alleges “Sensational” generated more than $1 million in revenue, but Chokpelle says he didn't see a dime.

	











	Chokpelle claims Brown deprived him of proper credit for the songs and “his properly entitled compensation flowing from his role as author/owner of the lyrics.” He's now asking for a court order declaring him an author and copyright owner of the two songs, and seeking damages from Brown, Kingston, Sony Music Entertainment, and Universal Music Publishing Group.

	Attempts to reach reps for the defendants were not immediately successful.


	“Defendants sustained a tremendous benefit, and shall continue to receive tremendous benefit, by earnings millions in revenues, acclaim, accolades, and goodwill, from the commercial exploitation of ‘Monalisa' and ‘Sensational,'” the 13-page lawsuit filed by Chokpelle and his lawyer Simon J. Rosen, reads. “Chokpelle is entitled to a full, discrete accounting of all revenues earned by [Brown] from the commercial exploitation of the subject songs, from inception through current, and ongoing into the future.”

Barry Manilow is doing well after surgery, but says he needs more time to recover before appearing on stage. 


	The singer, who was scheduled to begin his Feb. 12-21 residency dates at Westgate Las Vegas, said that he will need to postpone the performances for now. The update arrives after Manilow announced back in December that would undergo surgery to remove a “cancerous spot” on his lung.


	“I'm doing great and recovering very well after my surgery,” Manilow wrote in a statement shared to social media on Wednesday. “I've been getting exercise and spending some time in the studio, which has been fantastic.”


	“With my doctor's guidance and recommendation, however, we have decided to postpone my residency dates at Westgate Las Vegas from February 12-21 so I can stay focused on healing and getting ready for the tour that's kicking off at the end of February,” he continued. “Having a few weeks to rest and prepare is what the doctor ordered!”


	Tickets for the Vegas dates will be refunded. Manilow will return to the Westgate on March 26, 27, and 28, according to a rep for the singer.

Nick Jonas appeared on The Tonight Show to perform his recent song, “Gut Punch.” The musician began the emotional performance on the piano before standing up as the chorus kicked in. He was accompanied by a ballerina and two percussionists/dancers, who added a sense of dramatic flair. 


	Jonas released “Gut Punch” on New Year's Day. It is the first single from his forthcoming LP, Sunday Best, out Feb. 6 via Republic Records. The album marks the musician's first solo effort in five years. He described it as a collection of “new stories, candid thoughts, quiet walks home in the city, and snapshots of my life over these past few years.”


	“Gut Punch” reflects on Jonas' self doubt. “I tend to be hyper critical of myself, not typically about my appearance or getting older, but I was wondering, ‘Am I doing everything to be the best version of myself? Am I a present and thoughtful husband? Am I a good father?'” he shared in a statement when he released the song. “As time goes by, the stress and complications of life will weigh on you. It's important to remember there was once a version of you who was carefree and loved the world.”

	











	Jonas first debuted “Gut Punch” live in November while on tour with the Jonas Brothers in Las Vegas. He also performed it at the group's Samsung TV Plus New Year's Eve show in Miami.

   23:06 EST 04 Feb 2026, updated  08:42 EST 05 Feb 2026    By CHRIS MELORE, US ASSISTANT SCIENCE EDITOR  

New video from a US military drone has captured what UFO investigators are calling a formation of mysterious orbs flying over one of the most contentious regions in the world. 

Jeremy Corbell, investigative journalist, documentary filmmaker, and co-host of the WEAPONIZED Podcast, revealed footage this week allegedly obtained from intelligence sources that captured three objects flying over the Persian Gulf on August 23, 2012.

The minute-long recording was taken by an MQ-9 Reaper drone being operated by the US Air Force while it was using its infrared sensors just after 6pm local time. 

According to Corbell and podcast co-host George Knapp, the Pentagon described these three lights as 'orbs' flying in formation instead of coming from one triangular-shaped object.

In the video, one of the lights could be seen suddenly dropping back behind the other two, before seemingly being slingshot forward to lead the group.

Corbell added that the orbs appeared to be flying in an almost 'playful' manner and were intelligently coordinated, maintaining equal distances without any visible wings, tails, fins, or engine exhaust of any kind.

He pointed out that the leaked recording clearly showed unidentified flying objects displaying one of the 'five observable' behaviors often linked to UFOs - unusual flight movements that defy basic physics.

In this case, the one orb moving between the other two exhibited clear signs of instant acceleration without any visible thrust, something human aircraft haven't publicly shown an ability to do.

In a breakdown of the sighting, Corbell noted that the US Department of War officially designated the orbs as 'UAP,' which stands for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and is the new term for UFOs.

The video was reportedly placed in a separate archive specifically for evidence of non-human craft or objects that clearly weren't birds, balloons, or other explainable items.

The WEAPONIZED Podcast hosts added that the credibility of the sighting was indisputable, since the footage was taken by the military, using technology that accumulates more data than a standard camera or an everyday person's smartphone.

'This is a military recorded sensor-generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO, like one big triangular craft with dots on each of the three ends. And clearly, you watch this, and that's not what it is,' Knapp said in the January 30 episode.

'Your government has labeled this UAP, and you were never supposed to see this footage,' Corbell added.

The two men noted that the area where this recording was made, between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has become a hotspot for UAP activity in recent years, with personnel on US Navy vessels in the region reporting multiple encounters with bright objects in the sky.

In one incident allegedly recounted to Corbell, an unknown object flooded the bridge of a Navy ship with extremely intense light, so bright that a commanding officer claimed she raised her hand to shield her eyes, but she couldn't see her own hand in front of her face.

In another incident recently revealed during a bombshell hearing in Washington, military drone footage captured the moment a Hellfire missile struck and merely bounced off the hull of a UFO flying over the nearby country of Yemen.

Congressman Eric Burlison of Missouri produced the shocking, never-before-seen footage from October 30, 2024 during the congressional UAP hearing with a group of military whistleblowers last year.

The black-and-white video captured the 100-pound class air-to-ground precision weapon bouncing off the mysterious orb, which continued traveling at extreme speed off the coast of Yemen, roughly 1,000 miles away from the Persian Gulf.

Witness Jeffrey Nuccetelli, a former Air Force military police officer for 16 years, called the Hellfire video 'exceptional evidence' of the existence of UFOs.

'I imagine there are members of Congress that would like to see it, who I don't even know if they've asked to see the repository of UAP videos that we've mentioned to them in the past,' Knapp said.

'But it must be frustrating for them to know that this kind of stuff exists and they're not allowed to poke into it or get a glimpse of it at all.'

Officially, the US government and the Pentagon have declared that there has never been any physical evidence recovered that proves UFOs or extraterrestrial beings exist.

The podcast hosts noted that ARRO, the Pentagon department in charge of reviewing all UAP incidents, has released very few videos showing clear UFO sightings, despite whistleblower footage continuing to be leaked to the public.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

Oops, something went wrong

Tuttle Capital has launched the UFO Disclosure ETF (UFOD), an actively managed fund investing in companies linked to possible non-human intelligence technologies.

The fund launches after former Bank of England analyst Helen McCaw warned on January 18 that UFO-related news could shock markets, and cause big price swings and sudden moves into ""safe"" assets.

UFOD invests mainly in aerospace and defense, advanced materials, and energy companies, which could benefit should new UFO/UAP (Unidentified Flying Object/Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) information lead governments and markets to change how they spend and invest.

Riverside, Connecticut--(Newsfile Corp. - February 5, 2026) - Tuttle Capital Management, a pioneer in thematic exchange-traded funds (ETFs), today announced the launch of the Tuttle Capital UFO Disclosure ETF (CBOE: UFOD). The fund seeks capital growth by investing in companies positioned to benefit from the disclosure, confirmation, or commercialization of advanced non-human technologies.

""Markets react to new information about wars, pandemics, regulation, and technology shocks,"" said Matthew Tuttle, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Tuttle Capital Management. ""UAP disclosure could reshape budgets, priorities, and potentially entire industries. We could be in the very early days of an evolution that could have a significant impact on the global economy and on markets, similar to the likes of the Internet boom and the AI revolution. This new fund provides a disciplined, rules-aware way for investors to navigate that uncertainty, and the potential of UAP.""

The launch follows fresh warnings from former Bank of England senior analyst Helen McCaw, who has urged central banks to prepare for potential financial instability in the wake of disclosure. McCaw argues that an announcement could trigger an ""ontological shock"" for markets, driving extreme price swings, abrupt flights to perceived safe-haven assets, and a sudden loss of confidence in existing valuations.

A Focused ""UFO Tech"" Mandate with Profound Implications

UFOD seeks to provide investors with a targeted way to express a theme at the intersection of defense, space, and unconventional technology. This thematic approach emphasizes industries that may experience substantial disruption or growth, including:

Aerospace & Defense: Companies involved in the analysis of recovered materials or UAP reporting.

Advanced Materials: Firms developing new alloys or compounds that might be derived from reverse-engineering efforts.

Energy: Innovators in alternative fuels and energy storage.

The strategy is actively managed, allowing the portfolio team discretion to tilt toward companies better aligned with evolving disclosures, policy priorities, and commercialization opportunities.

""We believe that the eventual disclosure or confirmation of non-human intelligence (NHI) technologies could have profound and far-reaching implications across multiple industries,"" said Tuttle. ""With increased reporting requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and ongoing Congressional hearings, we are witnessing a shift in government transparency. UFOD is designed to capture the potential economic disruption that may result from these historic advancements."" - Matthew TuttleTo learn more about UFOD and the rest of Tuttle Capital's suite of funds, schedule a quick call with a Tuttle Capital team member here.

Principal Risks

As with all funds, a shareholder is subject to the risk that his or her investment could lose money. The Fund is not a complete investment program and is designed for inclusion in a diversified investment portfolio. The principal risks affecting shareholders' investments in the Fund are set forth below. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any government agency. The principal risks described herein pertain to direct risks of making an investment in the Fund and/or risks of the issuers in which the Fund invests.

Speculative Nature Risk. Government confirmation or denial of advanced alien technology is uncertain, and rumored breakthroughs might never materialize. This entire theme is highly speculative and subject to rumor cycles.

Equity Securities Risk. Since it purchases equity securities, the Fund is subject to the risk that stock prices will fall over short or extended periods of time. Historically, the equity markets have moved in cycles, and the value of the Fund's equity securities may fluctuate from day to day. Individual companies may report poor results or be negatively affected by industry and/or economic trends and developments. The prices of securities issued by such companies may suffer a decline in response. These factors contribute to price volatility, which is a principal risk of investing in the Fund.

Other Investment Companies Risk. To the extent that the Fund invests in other ETFs or investment companies, the value of an investment in the Fund is based on the performance of the underlying funds in which the Fund invests and the allocation of its assets among those ETFs or investment companies. The underlying ETFs and investment companies may change their investment goals, policies or practices and there can be no assurance that the underlying ETFs or investment companies will achieve their respective investment goals. Because the Fund invests in ETFs and other investment companies, shareholders indirectly bear a proportionate share of the expenses charged by the underlying funds in which it invests which impacts the Fund's performance. The principal risks of an investment in the Fund include the principal risks of investing in the underlying ETFs and investment companies.The Fund is exposed to the risks of the underlying ETFs and investment companies in which it invests in direct proportion to the amount of assets the Fund allocates to each underlying fund. One underlying fund may buy the same security that another underlying fund is selling. You would indirectly bear the costs of both trades. In addition, you may receive taxable gains from portfolio transactions by the underlying funds, as well as taxable gains from the Fund's transactions in shares of the underlying funds. The Fund's ability to achieve its investment goal depends, in part, upon the- Adviser's skill in selecting an optimal mix of underlying funds.Sector Risk. To the extent the Fund invests more heavily in particular sectors of the economy, its performance will be especially sensitive to developments that significantly affect those sectors.

Technology Sector Risk. The market prices of technology-related securities tend to exhibit a greater degree of market risk and sharp price fluctuations than other types of securities. These securities may fall in and out of favor with investors rapidly, which may cause sudden selling and dramatically lower market prices. Technology securities may be affected by intense competition, obsolescence of existing technology, general economic conditions and government regulation and may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Technology companies may experience dramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for qualified personnel. These companies are also heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights, the loss or impairment of which may adversely impact a company's profitability. A small number of companies represent a large portion of the technology industry. In addition, a rising interest rate environment tends to negatively affect technology companies, those technology companies seeking to finance expansion would have increased borrowing costs, which may negatively impact earnings. Technology companies having high market valuations may appear less attractive to investors, which may cause sharp decreases in their market prices.

Bizarre footage appears to show three strange lights in the sky maintaining a consistent 'formation'.

The video was released by the US Department of War, formerly the Department of Defence, and sees the lights moving over the Persian Gulf.

Although it has only just been released, the footage was originally taken back on August 23, 2012, and was shot by an MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the US Air Force.

The drone captured the minute-long video just after 6pm local time, while using infrared sensors.

UFO sightings continue to be a source of mystery, with many people believing them to be evidence of 'alien life' visiting Earth.

In this case, what's interesting about the lights was the way they appeared to hold their 'formation', maintaining a clear triangle shape between the three points of light.

This continued except for one moment when one of the lights seemed to drop back slightly.

The footage was analyzed in detail on the WEAPONIZED podcast, which is hosted by Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp.

In an episode from January 30, they looked at the strange footage.

Corbell suggested that one light was flying in a 'playful' way, saying: ""These objects appear to be aware and intelligent of one another, and they're keeping equidistant as they fly.

""But all of a sudden you see one make this playful little move as if it drops back in the formation, and then comes forward again.""

Debating the credibility of the footage, Knapp suggested that its military source makes it more reliable.

""This is a military recorded sensor-generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO, like one big triangular craft with dots on each of the three ends. And clearly, you watch this, and that's not what it is,"" said Knapp.

Corbell explained that the footage was desingated 'UAP', which is the official Air Force designation that stands for 'Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena', and not actually the classic 'UFO'.

""Your government has labeled this UAP, and you were never supposed to see this footage,"" Corbell claimed.

Analyzing the movement, he said: ""You see a break in that formation, and a pretty distinct and interesting movement.

""Our department of defence, or department of war now, said that this is a formation.""

Knapp added: ""That's clearly not one craft with three points of light on the corners.""

The video was reportedly part of an archive of material which had been designated as 'non human' but not something like an animal or other regular encounter.

Military drone footage has captured what UFO researchers describe as a formation of mysterious orbs flying over one of the world's most volatile regions.

Investigative journalist and WEAPONIZED Podcast co-host Jeremy Corbell unveiled the recording allegedly sourced from intelligence contacts, showing three objects traversing the Persian Gulf.

The one-minute clip was recorded by an MQ-9 Reaper drone operated by the US Air Force using infrared sensors shortly after 6pm local time. Corbell and podcast co-host George Knapp explained the Pentagon categorized the three lights as ""orbs"" flying in formation rather than originating from a single triangular craft. The footage shows one light abruptly falling behind the other two before appearing to slingshot forward and assume the lead position.

Corbell and Knapp observed the orbs appeared to fly in an almost ""playful"" manner with intelligent coordination, maintaining equal spacing without any visible wings, tails, fins or engine exhaust. The podcast hosts emphasized the leaked recording demonstrated UFOs exhibiting one of the ""five observable"" behaviors commonly associated with unidentified aerial phenomena - unusual flight patterns that defy conventional physics. The orb moving between the others showed clear signs of instant acceleration without visible thrust, a capability human aircraft have not publicly demonstrated.

Corbell's analysis revealed the US Department of War formally designated the orbs as ""UAP"" - Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, the current official terminology for UFOs. The video was reportedly filed in a dedicated archive containing evidence of non-human craft or objects definitively ruled out as birds, balloons or other explainable phenomena.

The WEAPONIZED Podcast hosts stressed the August 23, 2012 sighting's credibility remains indisputable given the military origin of the footage and the advanced technology capable of collecting far more data than standard cameras or smartphone devices. Knapp stated in the January 30 episode: ""This is a military recorded sensor generated image of what looks like a triangular UFO, like one big triangular craft with dots on each of the three ends. And clearly, you watch this, and that's not what it is."" Corbell added: ""Your government has labeled this UAP and you were never supposed to see this footage.""

The recording location between Saudi Arabia and Iran has become a hotspot for UAP activity in recent years, with US Navy vessel personnel reporting numerous encounters with luminous objects. One incident allegedly described to Corbell involved an unknown object flooding a Navy ship's bridge with extraordinarily intense light, so powerful that a commanding officer raised her hand to shield her eyes but could not see her own hand before her face.



Another recently disclosed incident during a Washington hearing featured military drone footage capturing a Hellfire missile striking and merely ricocheting off a UFO flying over Yemen. Missouri Congressman Eric Burlison presented the shocking previously unseen footage from October 30, 2024 during last year's congressional UAP hearing with military whistleblowers.

The black-and-white recording showed the 100-pound class air-to-ground precision weapon bouncing off the mysterious orb, which continued traveling at extreme velocity off Yemen's coast roughly 1,000 miles from the Persian Gulf. Jeffrey Nuccetelli, a former Air Force military police officer with 16 years service, described the Hellfire video as ""exceptional evidence"" of UFO existence.

Knapp said: ""I imagine there's members of Congress that would like to see it, who I don't even know if they've asked to see the repository of UAP videos that we've mentioned to them in the past. But it must be frustrating for them to know that this kind of stuff exists and they're not allowed to poke into it or get get a glimpse of it at all."" The US government and Pentagon have officially declared no physical evidence has ever been recovered proving UFOs or extraterrestrial beings exist. The podcast hosts noted ARRO, the Pentagon department responsible for reviewing all UAP incidents, has released minimal videos showing clear UFO sightings despite continued whistleblower footage leaking to the public.

There's something inherently invasive about horror that travels through headphones—sound that bypasses the room and goes straight into your skull. That's the pressure point A24 leans into with the official trailer for “undertone,” Ian Tuason's feature debut (and an established sci-fi author) that weaponizes the intimacy of listening: a popular paranormal podcast host starts receiving terrifying recordings from an anonymous source, and they don't stay contained to the show.

The setup is elegantly nasty. Per the film's logline, the host of a hit spooky podcast becomes haunted by the mysterious audio files sent her way—recordings that escalate into something genuinely threatening. And in Fantasia's more detailed description of the premise, the story centers on Evy, a skeptic co-hosting a paranormal podcast while caring for her dying mother, when an email delivers a batch of unsettling files that begin to bleed into her already-fragile reality.

Nina Kiri (The Handmaid's Tale, per Fantasia) leads the film, alongside Adam DiMarco, Michèle Duquet, Keana Lyn Bastidas, and Jeff Yung. The feature is written and directed by Tuason, with Dan Slater and Cody Calahan producing.

“undertone” premiered at the Fantasia International Film Festival in July 2025, where it also took the Gold Audience Award for Best Canadian Feature—exactly the kind of genre-crowd co-sign that tends to travel when a movie's doing something sharp with atmosphere and craft.

The film opens in theaters on March 13, 2026. Watch the new trailer below

One of the things I love most about science fiction is the space it provides for writers to stretch their imaginations. Aliens are a prime example of this. Sure, there are many sci-fi stories that are full of beings that are essentially humans but with blue skin or pointy ears, but every so often a writer will conjure up an otherworldly creature that feels truly alien.

I find it particularly interesting to read from the perspective of such an extraterrestrial for two reasons. Firstly, it's fascinating being placed into the consciousness of a being that sees and experiences the world in a totally different way to humans. Secondly, it can sometimes provide an outside perspective from which to view humanity, highlighting just how strange we ourselves are as organisms.

Below are five such short stories that adopt an alien point of view.

Enash and his fellow crew members land on Earth as part of a reconnaissance mission. Their species, the Ganae, have a rapidly growing population so they're constantly searching the universe for planets to colonize. When they touch down on Earth (well, a far-future version of it), they find that all of the animals—including humans—are long dead.

But before claiming the Earth as their own, the invading aliens need to know whether the planet itself had something to do with humankind's demise (and that therefore might be a threat to them too). They've cracked the technology for resurrection, so they head to a museum where they can speak to humans throughout history in an effort to understand what happened. This backfires on them in spectacular fashion.

Although the Ganae aren't the most alien of all the aliens on this list, this role-reversed first contact story is still intriguing—in large part thanks to seeing how humanity has developed. Some of the ideas are admittedly a bit silly, but I think that just adds to the fun.

“Odd Attachment” is told from the perspective of a large plant-like alien called Fropome. He begins the story lamenting the fact that the female plant he's in love with doesn't pay him any attention. He's grasping at straws in his lovesick state, so when he sees what he describes as a “big seed pod” (i.e. a human spaceship) descend from the sky, he takes it as a sign from the universe that she actually does love him.

Fropome is perplexed by the alien that comes out of the pod, but his thoughts are still dominated by his unrequited love, leading to a rather careless first encounter with humankind. Not only is it entertaining to view a human being through a sentient plant's eyes, but this story also has a darkly funny ending.

For a story that is far more about humans than it is aliens, check out “They're Made Out of Meat,” which can be read in just a few minutes. The entire story is comprised of a conversation between two aliens who have come across Earth. They're utterly shocked to discover that, as the title suggests, humans are made out of meat. The physical form of the two extraterrestrials isn't described, but given how horrified they are by humans, they certainly aren't meat-based.

This hilarious short story is likely to make you very aware of your own body and how strange it is. Plus, the ending provides one possible answer to the Fermi paradox—the discrepancy between the likelihood of extraterrestrial life being out there and at the same time, our complete lack of evidence for such life.

“The Things” is a retelling of John Carpenter's The Thing (1982) from the POV of the Thing itself (okay… I'll now try to limit my use of the word “thing”). We soon learn that the Thing extraterrestrial biomass is just as disgusted by humans as we are by it. From our perspective, it's a body horror nightmare that, by assimilating us, erases our individual identities. From its perspective, we're isolated beings and assimilation—or in its own words, “communion”—is a pleasurable feeling of completeness.

Finding ourselves in the head of an otherworldly creature that thinks that the violent joining of cells is good, actually, is exactly as disconcerting as it is fascinating. While Carpenter's film offers a buffet of horror delights, Watts's short story is far more sharply focused on existential terror.

It is possible to read this story without having seen The Thing, but I do think it's more rewarding to be familiar with the human perspective first (plus it's an incredible movie!).

This short story is set at an intergalactic school where the student population is comprised of an eclectic mix of beings from many different planets. But even at a school that is as accepting of differences as this one, Filo/Gee doesn't really fit in. Most of the students are bipeds, while Filo/Gee is an amoeba-like being (although a fair bit bigger than Earth's tiny amoebas) who experiences the world via sound and taste. The latter sense works best when they fully absorb objects into their gelatinous body, but that doesn't go down so well with some of the other students.

The story is a bit heartbreaking at times—with Filo/Gee being misunderstood and mistreated by pretty much everyone at the school, students and staff alike—but it's ultimately an uplifting tale about overcoming differences.

Please feel free to share your own recommendations of stories told from an alien perspective—whether they're short stories (like the ones above) or full-length novels (like the ones on this list!).

A world first has taken place, and it's incredible – an ‘alien message' has been received from Mars, and successfully decoded. But don't worry, the Martians aren't coming. 

The Sign in Space project dates back to 2023, with the simulation message sent down to Earth, and global participation was needed to successfully interpret it.

After the event was livestreamed, one clever duo successfully cracked the code 

The project grabbed worldwide attention as people tried to figure out the true meaning.

ET phone home. No, quite literally. 

Clever scientists and artists have made it possible for Earth to receive an alien message from Mars as part of a simulation in a huge project. 

Spearheaded by Daniela de Paulis, the Sign in Space project is in collaboration between the SETI Institute, the European Space Agency, the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, and the Green Bank Observatory to make the magic happen.

The supposed first-ever alien message from Mars was transmitted as a simulation of a message and was made possible by an ESA spacecraft. 

The extraterrestrial message, which was a simulation of a radio wave, was transmitted towards our planet by the Trace Gas Orbiter.

“Receiving a message from an extraterrestrial civilization would be a profoundly transformational experience for all humankind,” said visionary artist Daniela de Paulis.

“A Sign in Space offers the unprecedented opportunity to tangibly rehearse and prepare for this scenario through global collaboration, fostering an open-ended search for meaning across all cultures and disciplines.”

Well, the message was transmitted on 4 May 2023 as a radio signal, and thousands of participants attempted to decode the message.

One day, a father and daughter team cracked the true meaning. 

The duo, known only as ‘John and Sarah,' as they wished to remain anonymous, figured out the hidden meaning successfully. 

The pair worked out that it was an image of five amino acids, presented in a universal organic diagram displaying molecular notation. 

This was also joined by single pixel points located among the transmitted clusters and diagrams.

“My decoded message is a simple image with five amino acids displayed in a universal (hopefully) organ.

“The decoded image is only visible for one frame lasting about 1/10th of a second, but I can pause and manually step as well as reverse my CA engine,” said John.

So, the message was successfully cracked, but the project is an onoing exploration topic.

For centuries, communities across Russia, Finland, and parts of Eastern Europe dropped small live frogs into fresh milk to stop it from spoiling. It sounds bizarre, almost like a superstition passed down through generations, but the surprising part is this: science now suggests the practice may actually have had real antimicrobial benefits.

Before refrigeration, milk spoiled fast, especially in humid or warm regions. Families relied on whatever tricks they had: plunging containers into cold wells, storing milk in clay pots, or adding natural substances such as birch charcoal. Among these methods was the eye-catching frog technique. Farmers believed frogs kept the milk “alive” longer, preventing it from turning sour before the next morning's meal.

While many assumed this was merely rural folklore, the explanation behind it is much more grounded in chemistry and biology.

Amphibians are little Creatures With Powerful Chemistry. Amphibians, especially European brown frogs, naturally secrete bioactive compounds from their skin to protect themselves from bacteria and fungi in marshy habitats. These secretions contain:

Modern research, including studies published by Russian scientists in the last decade, found that secretions from certain frog species effectively inhibit the growth of harmful microbes, including those responsible for milk spoilage. In simpler terms, when a frog sat in the milk, tiny amounts of these protective compounds leached into the liquid, slowing bacterial growth. It was never sterilised milk, but it bought valuable hours of freshness in a world without iceboxes.

When scientists tested frog secretions, they discovered that they worked against pathogens like E. coli, Staphylococcus, and other spoilage bacteria. Some peptides were as potent as man-made antibiotics. They were especially effective in liquid environments, like milk. This doesn't make ancient villagers biochemists, of course. They were simply observing what worked. Over time, the method stuck because it delivered results, even if no one understood why.

The frog-in-milk story is a window into pre-refrigeration life, when food preservation was a daily struggle. It shows how early innovations often came from trial, error, and the natural world around us. But there's a deeper health angle too, that, modern medicine studies amphibian peptides as natural antibiotic candidates, especially at a time when antibiotic resistance is becoming a global crisis. The very frogs once used to keep milk fresh may help shape tomorrow's medical tools.

We now have safe, reliable refrigeration and food safety standards. While the science is fascinating, dropping a frog into any food today risks contamination, toxins, or pathogens. The traditional method belongs firmly to history. Still, this old practice carries a strange, provocative lesson: nature often held solutions long before humans understood them, sometimes in places as unexpected as the skin of a tiny marsh frog.

EXCLUSIVE: Singapore's Mokster Films is to launch sales on upcoming Taiwanese supernatural horror feature The Damp at the European Film Market (EFM) next week.

The feature is written and directed by Fu Tien-yu, a Taiwanese filmmaker who was honoured with Tokyo's Kurosawa Akira Award in 2024. Production is due to start this March in Taiwan, with a theatrical release planned for 2027.

Set at an all-girls school in a perpetually damp mountain region, the story follows an introverted teenager who discovers that several students had died in the nearby river months earlier, a scandal that the school attempts to erase. However, the dead students return through moisture and humidity, which becomes the medium through which their ghostly presence exists, turning themselves into an unavoidable invasive force against the living.

The script was written by Fu with veteran screenwriter Yang Qian-ling, whose credits include Lo Chi-leung's The Vanished Murderer and Nick Cheung's Keeper Of Darkness.

It is an Asobi production, with Steve Wang as producer who will also handle the theatrical distribution in Taiwan through his company Activator. The Taipei-based company previously handled the distribution of Detention and the marketing and promotion of Incantation, both among the highest-grossing Taiwanese horror titles of all time.

Director Fu is also producing along with Jeff Yeh, line producer of 2024's biggest Taiwanese film Gatao: Like Father Like Son, and Angie Chen.

This horror film is a departure for director Fu, who is better known for drama.

Fu said of her move into horror: “It grows naturally out of my drama work, which has always focused on everyday emotions. Horror allows those feelings especially fear and emotional pressure in women's lives to surface in a more immediate and visceral way. I want to create a horror film where fear accumulates rather than strikes.”

Fu made her directorial feature debut with Somewhere I Have Never Travelled in 2009, while 2012's The Happy Life Of Debbie was named best mini-series/TV movie at the Golden Bell Awards. Her most recent feature is 2023's Day Off, which won critical acclaim and prizes at Osaka Asian Film Festival, Udine's Far East Film Festival, Taipei Film Festival and Golden Horse Awards.

In 2024, she was awarded the Kurosawa Akira Award by Tokyo International Film Festival to recognise her continuing the tradition of the Taiwan New Cinema from the 1980s. She is only the second Taiwanese filmmaker to receive this award, after auteur Hou Hsiao-hsien.

New Epstein Files reveal Jeffrey Epstein's fascination with psychic abilities, including paying a Hong Kong academic $20,000 to research mind-reading and “special powers,” alongside plans to rebrand his private island.

Amid the chaos around the newly released documents in the Epstein Files, it has been revealed that a Hong Kong-based academic had a relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The duo said to have an interest in ""psychic activities"" and mind-reading. It has been reported that there were conversations of a collaboration to ""rebrand"" the island of the American financer.

The emails in the documents showed Epstein being interested in an academic's pursuit of finding people with so-called special abilities, such as mind-reading. As the discussion continued, Epstein ended up giving the Hong Kong academic tens of thousands of US dollars. In the 3 million pages of freshly released documents, around 1000 are about the academic who was working at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University at the time.

The documents showed that the academic started talking to the sex offender in 2011. He received a sum of $20,000 for a research project the same year that was related to artificial intelligence. Emails indicate the pair finally met in person in 2015.

It was also found that the e documents show that the pair also shared a strong personal relationship that involved multiple in-person meetings at Epstein's Manhattan residence.

Moreover, in a series of emails in 2017, he academic, proposed a number of venues to Epstein for a meet-up. “Is your island out of commission?” the scholar asked, without specifying a name. In the same email, the academic sent Epstein the name of a group he said “organise[d] events and are looking for an island to collaborate with”.

“Could be a good rebrand for your island,” the academic said.

Another set of emails from 2017 shows the academic introducing Epstein to Lydia Laurenson, an author who previously detailed a meeting with the financier at his Manhattan residence. In one meeting with the financier, the author claimed he brought out a group of “barely legal” women. In an email from 2017, there was mention of an experiment the academic organised involving a self-proclaimed “psychokinesis master” who claimed to have the ability to “manipulate [electrical] current from a distance”.

Office of Personnel Management says reclassification will allow agencies to quickly remove employees who ‘obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives'

The Trump administration moved Thursday to issue a rule that would make it easier to fire tens of thousands of federal workers. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said it was reclassifying certain career civil service roles so agencies can “quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives”.

Traditionally, only political appointees – roughly 4,000 positions – can be dismissed “at will”.

Under the new rule, many nonpartisan roles would be shifted into a category called “Schedule Policy/Career,” effectively treating them as political appointees. That reclassification could allow the administration to remove employees it views as disloyal. The rule – set to be published in the Federal Register on Friday – also states that “personal or political loyalty tests as a condition of employment” are prohibited.

Critics argue the change would open the door to politically motivated purges. “We have successfully fought this kind of power grab before, and we will fight this again. We will return to court to stop this unlawful rule and will use every legal tool available to hold this administration accountable to the people,” said Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward.

The largest union representing federal workers called the rule “a direct assault on a professional, nonpartisan, merit-based civil service.” In a statement, American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) president Everett Kelley said OPM is “rebranding career public servants as ‘policy' employees, silencing whistleblowers, and replacing competent professionals with political flunkies without any neutral, independent protections against politicization and arbitrary abuse of power.”

Trump briefly enacted a similar change at the end of his first term through an executive order known as “Schedule F,” which Joe Biden rescinded upon taking office in 2021. Stripping civil service protections has also been a central plank of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 blueprint.

In a statement Thursday, anticipating the rule's release, OPM director Scott Kupor said the reclassification would bring “much-needed accountability to career policy-influencing positions in the Federal government.”

Chris Nanos, the Pima county sheriff, said today that local authorities believe 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, the mother of Today show host Savannah Guthrie, is “still out there” following her disappearance almost five days ago. “We just want her home and find a way to get to the bottom of this,” Nanos said.

The FBI is now supporting Pima county authorities on the investigation, and Nanos added that officials did not yet have a suspect, when he addressed the press on Thursday. “We're not there yet,” he said.

Donald Trump also said today that he had “productive” discussions with Keir Starmer regarding Diego Garcia in the Chagos Islands, which he said was “of great importance to the National Security of the United States”.

Trump, who has previously called the UK PM's Chagos deal “an act of great stupidity” and linked it to his own ambition to acquire Greenland, said today in a post on Truth Social that he understood it was “the best deal he [Starmer] could make”.

“However,” he went on, “if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers U.S. operations and forces at our Base, I retain the right to Militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia.”

Last week, Starmer said that US intelligence agencies disagreed with Trump's newly found opposition to the deal, as he underlined how the US administration had supported the deal as it bolstered their defences.

Donald Trump has said that Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi had his “total endorsement” ahead of a legislative election in Japan on Sunday, adding that they would meet on 19 March at the White House.

“Prime Minister Takaichi is someone who deserves powerful recognition for the job she and her Coalition are doing,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

“Therefore, as President of the United States of America, it is my Honor to give a Complete and Total Endorsement of her, and what her highly respected Coalition is representing.”

Takaichi is widely expected to win in the snap election this Sunday.

On the morning of 21 January, Israeli authorities left eight Palestinian men at a West Bank checkpoint. Disoriented and cold, they were dressed in prison-issued tracksuits and carried their few belongings in plastic bags.

Hours earlier, they had been sitting with their wrists and ankles shackled on the plush leather seats of a private jet owned by the Florida property tycoon Gil Dezer, a longtime business partner of Donald Trump.

Dezer is also a Trump donor, friend of Donald Trump Jr and member of the Miami branch of Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.

His sleek Gulfstream jet – which he has called “my little rocket ship” – was used to transport the men from an airport near a notorious removal centre in Arizona to Tel Aviv. The jet made three refuelling stops en route: in New Jersey, Ireland and Bulgaria.

A Guardian investigation has established the flight was part of a secretive and politically sensitive US government operation to deport Palestinians arrested by ICE to the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

One of those deported on the January flight was Maher Awad, a 24-year-old originally from the West Bank, who had lived in the US for nearly a decade. Speaking to the Guardian in the town of Rammun, Maher shared photos of his girlfriend and newborn son in Michigan.

“They dropped us off like animals on the side of the road,” Awad said. “We went to a local house, we knocked on the door, we were like: ‘Please help us out.'”

US job openings dropped to the lowest level in more than five years in December and data for the prior month was revised lower amid a softening in labor market conditions at the end of 2025.

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, decreased by 386,000 to 6.542m by the last day of December, the lowest level since September 2020, the labor department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, today.

Data for November was revised down to show 6.928m job openings instead of the previously reported 7.146m. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 7.20m unfilled jobs. Hiring increased by 172,000 positions to a still-low 5.293m in December.

The data came as other numbers showed a larger-than-expected increase in Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a stable labor market.

Here's the full story:

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has said that further US sanctions against Russia depend on talks aimed at ending its nearly four-year-old war in Ukraine.

Bessent, who participated in talks with Russian officials and Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in Miami on 31 January, said he would consider sanctions against Russia's shadow fleet.

“We will see where the peace talks go,” Bessent said, noting that the Trump administration's sanctions against Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil had helped bring Russia to the negotiating table in the peace talks.

At least two cases of measles have been confirmed at a major immigration detention center for children and their parents in Texas as cases of the dangerous virus in South Carolina, Arizona, Utah and other US states continue growing and alarming experts.

In January alone, the US saw 25% of the total confirmed in all of last year, and the outbreak shows no sign of slowing as federal officials stay silent on vaccination.

The vast majority of patients are not vaccinated, but there have been no national campaigns announced or recent statements from leaders such as Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Last year, Kennedy positioned measles vaccines as a personal choice and recommended unproven treatments for the highly contagious illness.

The measles outbreak is “frightening” and “very worrisome”, said Jason Bowling, professor of infectious diseases at UT Health San Antonio and director of hospital epidemiology at University Health.

“I unfortunately do not see this slowing down across the United States,” said Anna-Kathryn Burch, division director of pediatric infectious diseases at Prisma Health Children's hospital in the Midlands in South Carolina. What's happening in South Carolina could happen anywhere the vaccination rate dips too low, Burch said. “It's not a matter of if, but more likely when.”

The Dilley family detention center in south Texas, one of two immigration facilities for children in the US, reported two measles cases on Friday. “We are aware of the cases and are assisting by providing doses of measles vaccine as requested by ICE,” said Chris Van Deusen, director of media relations at the Texas department of state health services, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Amid the various winding comments throughout Trump's speech today, he said that the Department of Education will officially issue its new guidance to protect the right to prayer in public schools today.

“Now the Democrats will sue us, but we'll win it,” Trump said, eliciting some laughs from the audience at the National Prayer Breakfast. “They'll sue us. They sue us for everything. I'm the most sued human being in history.”

The president is now rattling off a number of states who, he says, have cooperated with federal law enforcement. But has now launched into a tirade on Minnesota.

“They won't work with us,” Trump said, while claiming that he would be able to drive crime down further without the “horrible governor and this horrible fake mayor Frey”.

Trump announced there will be a national prayer event on the National Mall on 17 May. “We're going to rededicate America as one nation under God,” Trump added.

During his speech today, Trump praised Tulsi Gabbard – the director of national intelligence – for her role in the FBI's search of the Fulton county election offices in Georgia last week. Here agents seized almost 700 boxes of 2020 election documentation.

“She took a lot of heat two days ago because she went in at Pam's insistence,” the president said. “They say, ‘why is she doing it'… because Pam [the attorney general] wanted her to do it. And you know why? Because she's smart.”

Earlier this week, the Guardian reported that Gabbard is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump's approval, working separately from the justice department investigation.

“Her position has to do with international,” Trump added today.

He went further:

They've been saying ‘Russia, Russia, Russia has been screwing our elections'. OK, so let's assume Russia had something to do with it. They said, ‘no, no, Russia didn't'… so now they're saying Russia had nothing to do with it. Because if I say Russia, that it's perfectly fine. But you could add China and about five other countries.

Trump's meandered during his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast today. He's denigrated Thomas Massie, the Republican congressman and his frequent target who co-sponsored legislation to release the full tranche of Epstein files, and voted against the most recent funding bill package that the president signed into law on Tuesday. “There's something wrong with him,” Trump said. “ They love voting ‘no'. They think it's good politically.”

The president also touted the military operation in Venezuela, which resulted in the capture of the now deposed leader Nicolás Maduro. “We're getting along fantastically with leadership,” Trump said of the interrim president Delcy Rodriguez.

One note, ahead of the president's address today, we heard from Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador, and a noted Trump ally.

Bukele has worked closely with the Trump administration to accept flights of undocumented immigrants, who they allege are convicted criminals, and hold them in El Salvador's mega-prison, known as CECOT.

Bukele has described himself as the “world's coolest dictator” and has overseen one of the largest crackdowns on crime in his country. Critics have branded him an authoritarian leader, that has done away with due process.

Today he called the gangs that he's worked to eliminate from El Salvador as “satanic”.

“Some of those gangs are here in the United States,” he added. “If God did this for El Salvador he can do this for countries all over the world.”

Donald Trump is in Washington today. As we noted earlier, we'll hear from the president shortly when he attends the National Prayer Breakfast.

Later today we'll also hear from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when she holds a 1pm ET briefing for reporters.

Mass layoffs at the Washington Post have prompted backlash from employees, who have been on “edge” for weeks over the future of the publication.

On Wednesday the publication announced it would be laying off one-third of its workforce, and would be scaling back coverage of sport and foreign news.

“This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world's greatest news organizations,” the Post's celebrated former editor-in-chief Marty Baron said in a statement.

The Guardian's Jeremy Barr reports that staffers at the Post have been worried for weeks about the rumoured cuts, which the publication would not confirm or deny. “It's an absolute bloodbath,” said one employee, not authorized to speak publicly.

During a morning meeting announcing the changes, the editor in chief, Matt Murray, told employees that the Post was undergoing a “strategic reset” to better position the publication for the future, according to several employees who were on the call.

Murray acknowledged that the Post had struggled to reach “customers” and talked about the need to compete in a crowded media marketplace. “Today, the Washington Post is taking a number of actions across the company to secure our future,” he said, according to an audio recording of the meeting.

The affected employees include Caroline O'Donovan, who primarily covers Amazon, the company founded by the Post owner, Jeff Bezos. Other staffers, including the sports journalist Neil Greenberg, have also announced that they were affected.

President Donald Trump is set to attend and deliver remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast later today, a spokesperson from the White House confirmed.

The event is held annually in Washington DC on the first Thursday of every February. It aims to bring together leaders in political, social and business sectors from around the country to an event that merges prayer and networking.

“Today, President Trump will unite our country through the power of prayer at the 74th National Prayer Breakfast,” a White House spokesperson said.

“President Trump has made unprecedented strides to protect our God-given rights and has delivered on his promise to reverse Joe Biden's divisive policies that weaponized the federal government against men and women of faith. President Trump has secured major victories for religious freedom – from defending innocent life to restoring biological truth and protecting parents' fundamental rights.”

Fox News reports that the president first attended the National Prayer Breakfast in 2017 and returned last year, using his remarks to pledge action against what he called anti-Christian bias tied to the Biden administration.

“While I'm in the White House, we will protect Christians in our schools, in our military, in our government, in our workplaces, hospitals and in our public squares, and we will bring our country back together as one nation under God, with liberty and justice for all,” he said during last year's event.

According to the outlet, other notable attenders set to appear at the 2026 event include house speaker Mike Johnson and attorney general Pam Bondi.

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog.

Donald Trump said the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis were both sad incidents that “should not have happened,” but nobody feels worse about both shootings than ICE agents.

“He was not an angel, and she was not an angel,” Trump said of Pretti and Good in a new interview with NBC News. “Still, I'm not happy with what happened there. Nobody can be happy, and ICE wasn't happy either.

“But I'm always going to be with our great people of law enforcement,” he continued. “We have to back them. If we don't back them, we don't have a country.”

This comes as the White House border czar, Tom Homan, says 700 federal agents will leave Minnesota. In the interview, Trump suggested using a “softer touch” in carrying out his aggressive immigration crackdown.

However, Chuck Schumer, the US Senate minority leader, said the reduction of 700 agents wasn't enough. “ICE's abuses go beyond the headlines. Residents are afraid to go to schools, to grocery stores, to even step outside. Agents are patrolling the streets like a military operation,” he said. “All of ICE needs to leave Minneapolis now.”

In other developments:

The second day of US-brokered talks between negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv have been taking place in Abu Dhabi. The discussions come amid increased Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid and a continuing war of attrition.

The Trump administration says it wants to create a critical minerals trading bloc with its allies and partners in order to counter China's stronghold. This would use tariffs to shore up supplies of critical minerals needed for electric vehicles, missiles and other hi-tech products.

The British prime minister Keir Starmer has apologised to Epstein victims for giving Peter Mandelson the US ambassador job. Starmer says Mandelson portrayed Epstein as someone he barely knew. He expressed regret for believing Mandelson's lies and appointing him.

The US Justice Department is under fire for revealing information about Epstein's victims, and hiding the identities of alleged perpetrators, CNN reports. Survivors have accused the DoJ for “botching” the release of the three million documents which came out last week.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The crew was scheduled to launch on Wednesday next week, but SpaceX said it was grounding all flights on its Falcon 9 rocket while it investigates an unspecified issue. That is just the most recent twist for the SpaceX Crew-12 mission, which includes Americans Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, French astronaut Sophie Adenot and Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.

They will be replacing Crew-11, which returned to Earth last month, one month earlier than planned, during the first medical evacuation in the space station's history. NASA has declined to disclose any details about the health issue that cut the mission short.

However, the laboratory, which orbits 400km above Earth, has since been staffed by a skeleton crew of three. Because of the medical evacuation, NASA moved the date of the Crew-12 launch forward a few days. 

The launch had also overlapped with NASA's first mission to fly astronauts around the moon in more than half a century, but leaks during the final tests this week pushed the date back to March 6.

Once the astronauts finally get on board, they would be one of the last crews to live on board the football field-sized space station. Continuously inhabited for the past quarter century, the aging ISS is scheduled to be pushed into Earth's orbit before crashing into an isolated spot in the Pacific Ocean in 2030. 

The ISS, once a symbol of warming post-Cold War relations, has been a rare area of continued cooperation between the West and Russia since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. However, the space station has not entirely avoided the tensions back on Earth. In November, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev — who had long been planned to be a member of Crew-12 — was suddenly taken off the mission. 

Media reports in Russia suggested he had been photographing and sending classified information with his phone. 

Russian space agency Roscosmos said he had been transferred to a different job. His replacement, Fedyaev, has already spent some time on the ISS as part of Crew-6 in 2023. 

During their eight months on the space station, the four astronauts would conduct many experiments, including research into the effects of microgravity on their bodies. Meir, who previously worked as a marine biologist studying animals in extreme environments, would serve as the crew's commander. Adenot would become the second French woman to fly to space, following in the footsteps of Claudie Haignere, who spent time on the Mir space station. 

They would also test a system that uses artificial intelligence and augmented reality to allow astronauts to carry out their own medical ultrasounds.

The mission is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 11am on Wednesday. If called off, launches can also be attempted on the following two days.

The measure had long been sought by the US-backed opposition. 
It is the latest concession Rodriguez has made since taking the reins of the country on Jan. 3 after the brazen seizure of then-Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro.
Rodriguez told a gathering of justices, magistrates, ministers, military brass and other government leaders that the ruling party-controlled Venezuelan National Assembly would take up the bill with urgency.
Rodriguez also announced the shutdown

Both cases accuse Duterte of misusing public funds during her term as education secretary, while one revives allegations that she threatened to assassinate former ally Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.

Seven Toronto police officers and one retired officer were charged as part of a complex investigation into organized crime and corruption.

Seven police officers from Toronto Police Service and one retired officer have been charged on Wednesday as part of a complex and lengthy investigation into organized crime and corruption sparked by an alleged plot to kill a corrections officer in June, 2025. 

The charges – including bribery, obstruction of justice, extortion, drug trafficking, robbery, and conspiracy to commit murder – were announced at a news conference at York Regional Police Headquarters. 

Police allege that some of the officers unlawfully accessed and funnelled private information to members of an organized crime group, which was then used to facilitate shootings around Southern Ontario – including violence connected to the tow truck industry. 

“This is a deeply disappointing and sad day for policing,” York Regional Police Chief Jim MacSween said. “And it shows the insidious and corrosive nature of organized crime.”

Charged in the corruption probe are Const. Timothy Barnhardt, Sgt. Robert Black, retired Const. John Madeley Sr., his son, Const. John Madeley Jr., Sgt. Carl Grellette, Const. Saurabjit Bedi, Const. Derek McCormick and Const. Elias Mouawad.

Also charged as part of the seven-month-long investigation are 19 civilians, including three accused of attempting to kill a correctional manager at his home. Investigators allege some of this group used bribes to get private information from police, as part of extortion plots. 

Those include Brian Da Costa, Elwyn Satanowsky, Kaejean Doman, Median Jackson, Devonte Barker-Campbell, Almar Heath, Calvin Ru, Rimssen Younan, Daljit Singh, Brandi Dixon, Robinson Alexandre, Ashor Bato, Donald Kirkland, Ryan Cribbie, Phillip Lecos, Jennifer Jasey and Mahyar Soldouzi, along with two unnamed youth. 

York Deputy Chief Ryan Hogan alleged some of the officers were involved in fentanyl and cannabis trafficking by “providing protection,” and theft of personal property from a police facility – including driver's licences, passports and health cards. 

The allegations have not yet been tested in court.

More than 400 officers, including from York, Toronto and the Ontario Provincial Police, have been involved in the investigation, he said. 

Toronto Police Service Chief Myron Demkiw said the charges are proof of the police services' commitment to restoring the public's trust in the integrity of his officers. He said the seven charged officers have been suspended, and “where appropriate,” will be off the job without pay. 

“This is a difficult and unsettling moment,” he said. “I understand this news will be distressing to Torontonians and Toronto Police Service.”

In a statement, the Toronto Police Service Board – the civilian body that oversees the police – formally requested an independent and comprehensive inspection by the Inspector General of Policing. The office monitors police services and boards to ensure compliance with the Community Safety and Policing Act. 

“The Board believes such an inspection is necessary to provide the public with a credible and transparent assessment, and to identify any steps needed to strengthen accountability and public safety,” it said in a statement. 

“Public trust in policing is fundamental. The Board holds all members of the Toronto Police Service to the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and accountability, and any allegations of criminal conduct are taken extremely seriously.”

Meaghan Gray, a spokesperson for the Toronto Police Association, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the union is “aware of several of its members who were arrested today.”

“As a professional labour organization, we will ensure our members receive due process and wellness support as required,” she said. “We have no further comment regarding this investigation or the members involved.”

The Toronto Police Service Board, a seven-member civilian body that governs and oversees the TPS, held an emergency, in-camera meeting on Wednesday to discuss the matter, a government official said. The Globe and Mail and is not naming the official because they were not authorized to speak about the matter.

            Hot Stocks 





            Anthropic's Cowork AI assistant sent shockwaves through Wall Street this week. Now Anthropic is taking another leap forward, improving its model.
    


            Anthropic's new Claude Opus 4.6 model, announced Thursday, is designed to make Cowork AI better for office and coding work, potentially raising even more concerns that the AI tool could replace specialized software packages that companies use for those tasks.
    


            Legal and financial analysis software stocks have plunged in recent days, bringing the broader stock market down with them. The Nasdaq just had its worst two-day tumble since April, and it's down another 0.7% Thursday.
    


            Many experts wonder whether AI will ultimately cost some workers their jobs. Tech giants like Anthropic, OpenAI and Google are locked in a race to build AI models that they hope will underpin the future workplace.
    


            Anthropic rival OpenAI just introduced a new platform for creating AI agents meant to function like colleagues Thursday morning. And Anthropic launched its Cowork tool in January.



            It remains uncertain whether AI investments will pay off for businesses adopting the technology.  Anthropic is betting that its new model will help it replicate the massive success of its Claude Code software but for other types of office work.
    


            “We think that Opus 4.6 is going to be an inflection point for knowledge work in many ways,” Dianne Penn, head of product management for research, said in an interview with CNN ahead of the announcement.
    


            One of those ways involves how Opus 4.6 processes data. Anthropic says it's expanded Opus' context window, which is the amount of information a model can remember at once, from 200,000 tokens to one million. Tokens are a unit of measurement referring to how AI models understand text. The longer and more complex a query is, the more tokens it requires.
    


            Giving Claude the ability to process more information at once should enable it to handle more complicated tasks, like making sweeping changes to entire code bases, said Penn.
    


Amazon's layoffs are staggering. We've seen this before



            With Opus 4.6, Claude will also be better at knowing when it should take more time to think through a request – a technique known as reasoning – and when it should answer quickly.
    


            Anthropic also says the new model outperforms OpenAI's GPT-5.2 model on a benchmark evaluating how AI handles knowledge work in fields like finance and legal.
    


            The new PowerPoint integration, available in research preview, will let users build slides using Claude, with the AI able to read layouts and fonts to create slides that align with the desired corporate template. This was particularly challenging because unlike Excel, which is primarily data-driven, PowerPoint slides involve making judgements about design elements like colors and text placement, said Penn.
    


            Anthropic says files that Claude Opus 4.6 works on, like documents, spreadsheets and slides, will be closer to “production-ready” on the first try, meaning they should require less human intervention.
    


            While Anthropic's Opus 4.6 makes Claude better at non-technical work, the update also includes some improvements for software engineers. Coding duties can be split across teams of agents instead of having one agent work through individual tasks, mimicking the way a human engineering team would operate, Anthropic says.
    


            The release comes after software stocks cratered this week following the release of plugins for Anthropic's Cowork tool last Friday. These plugins, which let users tailor Anthropic's Cowork tool for specific industries like legal, finance, sales and marketing, sparked fears that the tech could replace specialized research and financial analysis software.
    


            An exchange-traded fund following the software industry had its worst day since April on Tuesday, slumping nearly 6%. Thomson Reuters (TRI) fell by 15.83% on Tuesday, and Legalzoom (LZ) fell by nearly 20% that same day.
    


            At the same time, questions and concerns are growing over the role AI will play in the workplace, especially among entry-level tech jobs. Employment for recent graduates in computer science and math has declined by 8% since 2022, according to a report from Oxford Economics last year. A Google study from September found that 90% of tech workers use AI in their job.
    


            Those kinds of concerns are “something that we grapple with and think about with every version of Claude and every product that we deliver,” Penn said, pointing to initiatives like Anthropic's Economic Index report, which studies AI's impact on labor.
    


            But Jacob Bourne, a technology analyst for eMarketer, said it's unlikely these kinds of AI tools will remake the job market just yet. Security concerns will likely keep many larger companies from using these kinds of tools, since they often require granting access to one's files and browsing activity. (Penn said Anthropic works with customers to make sure its technology meets their security and IT requirements.)
    


            “Panic over this is probably misplaced,” said Bourne. “But I think it does mean that legacy enterprise software providers are going to need to continue evolving.”

            The Trump administration is planning to match teen competitors with celebrity coaches for the televised “Patriot Games” athletic contest, one of the events marking the United States' 250th anniversary.
    


            A spokesperson for Freedom 250, the non-profit group leading the administration's celebrations, provided new details to CNN after President Donald Trump formally announced the event in December. The spokesperson did not provide any names of the celebrities the group is recruiting to work with the teenaged participants.
    


            The competition will take place in the fall. Trump teased the event as “an unprecedented four-day athletic event featuring the greatest high school athletes — one young man and one young woman from each state and territory.”
    


            Athletic ability will not be the sole factor considered for eligibility. Potential volunteers will need to submit an online video application responding to a number of prompts to explain why they want to be chosen to represent their state, the spokesperson said.
    


            Details about the types of athletic contests the participants will compete in have yet to be made public.
    


            Applications will be open to athletes aged 14 to 17 from all 50 states, US territories & tribes, but those who will turn 18 before December 31 will not be eligible, the spokesperson said.
    


            The competition has drawn comparisons on social media to “The Hunger Games,” a dystopian young-adult book series and film franchise in which children are forced to fight to the death in televised arenas.
    


            Trump first previewed the competition in July, saying it would be televised and led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
    


            The new details emerge as the administration pushes forward with its plans for national events. The executive branch is driving efforts to pull off the president's anniversary priorities, with agencies partnering with Freedom 250 for certain landmark events: Kennedy will be partnering with Freedom 250 in hosting the Patriot Games, and the Agriculture Department has embraced the president's Great American State Fair initiative, which asks states to compete to have their fair chosen by Trump as the “most patriotic.”
    


            Other 250th initiatives include a UFC fight on the White House's South Lawn on the president's birthday and the construction of a giant triumphal arch across from the Lincoln Memorial.
    


Will Trump's brand of politics crash America's 250th birthday party?



            An August IndyCar race near the National Mall is also on the schedule, with the president signing an order last week directing the Interior and Transportation departments to work with the DC Mayor Muriel Bowser's office to move quickly in order to pull it off. The effort may need congressional approval.
    


            Bowser, a Democrat, is on board with the race and touted it as an economic boon for the nation's capital, which has been strained by mass federal layoffs.



            “The race weekend will rev up the economic engine of D.C. by filling our hotels and restaurants and by showing visitors, residents and the sports world that there's no better city, people and backdrop for major sports events,” she said in a statement.
    


            The administration has also launched two history-oriented efforts inspired by the American Freedom Train that toured the country during America's bicentennial bash in 1976 and gave Americans the chance to see everything from Judy Garland's dress from “The Wizard of Oz” to George Washington's copy of the US Constitution.
    


            The National Archives' “Freedom Plane” will bring documents from the era of America's founding to eight US cities in 2026, and the Institute of Museum of Library Services has announced six Freedom Truck Mobile Museums, with material from conservative media company PragerU and Hillsdale College.
    


            Planning for the history-related initiatives comes as the administration conducts an unprecedented review of the Smithsonian Institution, insisting that the museum complex's 250th content align with Trump's push for programming that renews national pride.
    


            “The American people will have no patience for any museum that is diffident about America's founding or otherwise uncomfortable conveying a positive view of American history, one which is justifiably proud of our country's accomplishments and record,” administration officials wrote in a letter to the museum in December.

By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory

By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory

‘Not many people know zis' – as Franz Liebkind, the demented Nazi hobby playwright character in ‘The Producers', would have said – but Jeffrey ‘suicide-just-on-time' Epstein really was a terrific Beluga whale. Or maybe a giant, shapeshifting, hypnotic killer squid. Or just Charlie Sheen.

Impossible? Totally absurd? Absolutely delusional? Mais pas du tout (pardon my French, please)! Because deep down, you see – You do see it, right? – all of these things (and whatever you want to call Charlie) are the same. Namely, manifestations of Russia! And so was Jeffrey Epstein, at least according to a clearly coordinated, ‘the-memo-is-out' wave of desperate nonsense released by Western propaganda outlets, such as the British Telegraph, the New York Post, the Daily Mail, and the Polish government. Ukrainian and Russian-exile info-warriors, meanwhile, are falling over themselves to jump on the bandwagon – or rather, the (evil) clown car.

The allegations about Russia are so ludicrous that their substance does not merit discussion. Because there is no substance: What we are really seeing is a squalid spectacle of propagandists clutching not at straws but pure nothing, recycling each other's unfounded and evidence-free claims and resorting to sad, silly tricks so transparent they make you oscillate between laughing, weeping, and a pure unadulterated feeling of cringe.

Meduza, for instance, clickbaits with the headline ‘Who are the Russians named in the latest Epstein files? Vladimir Putin, for one', and then admits: “there's no evidence in the released files that a meeting between Putin and Epstein ever took place.” That sort of beyond-desperate BS.

What this latest wave of foul play directed at Moscow really shows is that now, when about half of the Epstein Files have been released – which means we certainly haven't seen the worst yet, as horrifying as that may be – the sordid ‘elites' of the West and their servile mainstream media are struggling to manage the fallout. They may even be panicking. That much is understandable.

Because everyone with an IQ above room temperature has long understood the essence of the Epstein phenomenon: The inexplicably successful, rich, and connected pedophile monster was working for Israel, as independent Western observers such as, for instance, Ana Kasparian and Tim Anderson, acknowledge.

We do not yet know with certainty whether that means direct employment and training by Mossad, as the FBI recorded a source as stating clearly, or a more informal but also very deep relationship. But that is beside the point. There is no doubt that his ties to Israel were central to his life and ‘work'.

While Epstein was busy with more than one kind of super-sleazy scheme and crime – insider trading, pandemic profiting, and arms trading, for instance – the core of his operation was a far-flung blackmail scheme in which sickeningly depraved perverts from among the West's movers and shakers indulged their criminal fantasies with real-live victims, compliments the House of Epstein. This obviously compromised them and made them pliable.

Those now publicly suspected of such behavior – due to prior accusations and opaque settlements but also new pictures and messages from the Epstein files – include former Prince Andrew, former Labor Party godfather Peter Mandelson, ex-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and the two Bills: Clinton and Gates. And there are so many more.

Others, it seems from the evidence available at this time, aren't suspected of engaging in sex crimes but – with Epstein already convicted as a pedophile and a registered sex offender since 2009 – were perfectly willing to be, in effect, bought by hospitality, flattery, access, a private plane ride, and perhaps some academic grants. This seems to have been the case for Noam Chomsky, for instance.

The only person who has emerged with his reputation enhanced and not diminished by a mention in the files is Norman Finkelstein, the long-standing and long-suffering critic and opponent of Israel's crimes, from apartheid to genocide. So far, he is the only one who, the files reflect, answered an approach by the Epstein network with a loud and clear – to paraphrase – go and eff yourself. As every decent person should have done; and yet no one except him did.

Obviously, the West's attempt to make its own pervasive elite corruption by a pedophile multipurpose criminal working for Israel a ‘Russia!' issue is not only stunningly daft and shameless but also reminiscent of another, similar ploy: The tired conspiracy theory of Russiagate (better labeled Russia-rage) – in essence alleging that Trump colluded with Russia or even served as an agent – was built on the same principle: A perfectly homemade, Western phenomenon was blamed on Russia.

Indeed, Russia-rage and the Epstein Files form a bizarre mirror image of Western double-think: Russia-rage was fiction, but it was long sold as sacred truth by the Western mainstream media. The wide, deep rot marked by the Epstein Files is real and has long been denied or massively downplayed by the same media. How ironic.

The (still incomplete) Epstein Files have exposed the elites of the West as shot through with criminality, sadism, and moral nihilism. Many of those ruling us – not only politically – are not merely greedy, careerist, and power-hungry. They are evil, in the terrifyingly pure sense of the term. The West's institutions, meanwhile, have shown that they have nothing to set against that evil. On the contrary, even getting half of the Epstein Files released was a great struggle, resisted and delayed every step of the way. Redactions and purges are ongoing. Genuine accountability is not in sight.

The West has long had very severe credibility problems. The Epstein Files now provide conclusive evidence that substantial and enormously powerful parts of its elites live in a form of depravity that exceeds even a pessimistic imagination. The reality, it turns out, is worse than many so-called ‘conspiracy theories'.

We also live in a world where it so happens that this real-existing, evil West has helped Israel commit the Gaza genocide, sending international law and basic ethics to hell in the process. But surely the fact that so many of the West's elites are drowning in blackmail-grade dirt amassed by a pedophile criminal working for Israel has nothing to do with that historic and horrific failure. Just kidding. In reality, the dots don't even need connecting. And Epstein has, of course, not been alone. What he stood for is not over.

The same Western elites and their media underlings want us to fear and even hate Russia, China, Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, and last but not least, Palestine, and whoever else is in their crosshairs at any given moment. They tell us we must bomb Iran to fight for the rights of Iranian women, while having made a habit of raping and – it is virtually certain – disappearing girls.

The West is the swamp. And everyone knows it.

At least two cases confirmed at detention center for children and their parents in Texas 

At least two cases of measles have been confirmed at a major immigration detention center for children and their parents in Texas as cases of the dangerous virus in South Carolina, Arizona, Utah and other US states continue growing and alarming experts.

In January alone, the US saw 25% of the total confirmed in all of last year, and the outbreak shows no sign of slowing as federal officials stay silent on vaccination.

The vast majority of patients are not vaccinated, but there have been no national campaigns announced or recent statements from leaders such as Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Last year, Kennedy positioned measles vaccines as a personal choice and recommended unproven treatments for the highly contagious illness.

The measles outbreak is “frightening” and “very worrisome”, said Jason Bowling, professor of infectious diseases at UT Health San Antonio and director of hospital epidemiology at University Health.

“I unfortunately do not see this slowing down across the United States,” said Anna-Kathryn Burch, division director of pediatric infectious diseases at Prisma Health Children's hospital in the Midlands in South Carolina. What's happening in South Carolina could happen anywhere the vaccination rate dips too low, Burch said. “It's not a matter of if, but more likely when.”

The Dilley family detention center in south Texas, one of two immigration facilities for children in the US, reported two measles cases on Friday. “We are aware of the cases and are assisting by providing doses of measles vaccine as requested by ICE,” said Chris Van Deusen, director of media relations at the Texas department of state health services, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

This is the same facility where five-year-old asylum seeker Liam Conejo Ramos and his father were kept for a week after being detained in Minneapolis. It's also the facility where protests sprang up on 24 January, with children yelling: “Let us go!” Children and parents are now locked down in the facility. Elizabeth Zuna Caisaguano, who is reporting flu-like symptoms, and her mother, who has hives – but neither have been tested for measles, they say – were released from the facility on Tuesday night.

Joaquin Castro, a Democratic congressman from San Antonio, is calling for the detention center to be “shut down immediately”. Dilley is not equipped to deal with the spread of measles, Castro said in a post on X. “Children and families, who have committed no crime, should not be suffering and do not belong in prison.”

Detention centers can be “epidemic engines” that become “basically factories for manufacturing virus at incredible scale and incredible pace, and inevitably they overthrow the walls of these prisons”, said Eric Reinhart, a political anthropologist and psychiatrist who researched the spread of Covid in jails and prisons.

The news highlights the rapidly spiraling outbreak throughout the United States.

South Carolina reported a total of 876 measles cases and at least 18 hospitalizations on Tuesday, already surpassing the official tally of the entire west Texas outbreak last year and still growing. Hospitals in South Carolina are not required to report hospitalizations for measles, but at least 18 children and adults have been hospitalized because of the virus, according to the health department.

Other states are also seeing continued spread, including Arizona with 239 cases and 14 hospitalizations and Utah with 251 cases and 23 hospitalizations. As of Friday, there have been 588 confirmed cases of measles in the US this year – and all but three were from local spread, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

When measles is spreading readily in communities, the virus can enter detention centers and increase exponentially because of the conditions – with children and parents moved from all over the country and made to stay in close quarters with poor water, food and medical care. People who have not had stable access to healthcare because of poor infrastructure or political instability in their countries of origin may also have lower vaccination rates. One in five measles patients usually need hospitalization.

“This is a major public health issue” because detention centers are “an ideal environment for the spread of measles”, Reinhart said. Officials have said they are “ceasing all movement within the facility”, but there is no way to end movement in and out of a detention center like this unless the staff are also locked down, Reinhart said. “You can take measures to try to mitigate it, but you really have to get people out of those kinds of conditions.”

Prisons and jails frequently accelerate outbreaks of infectious diseases, spreading beyond the institutions' walls and into communities. “You're putting people at risk of an epidemic outbreak – not just the people inside the facility but the people around it and, ultimately, people everywhere,” Reinhart said. Releasing inmates proved effective in stopping greater spread of Covid, Reinhart found, and he called for decarceration and an end to immigration raids. “Abolish ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, which is basically a state terror organization,” Reinhart said.

ICE did not respond by press time to the Guardian's questions, including whether detention staff were moving within the community and whether a vaccination campaign had begun.

When asked to confirm that Kennedy had not made any public statements and HHS had not launched any national vaccination campaigns on measles in recent months, an HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said that was “completely false”, adding: “Have you not even been following us the past year?” He did not respond by press time to a request for evidence of either point.

In the absence of federal campaigns, the bulk of vaccination efforts are falling on state and local officials and providers.

“It breaks my heart that we are seeing this in my state, when we have a vaccine that is very effective and safe – we have a way to prevent this,” Burch said. “It's a very difficult time right now for pediatricians, because we are seeing hesitancy increase with vaccination.” The MMR vaccine was safe, and it was the most effective way to end this outbreak, she said.

“That's the major preventative step that we have,” Bowling agreed. “Vaccine rates are so important.” Not everyone responds to the vaccine or can get it; those who are pregnant or undergoing immune-compromising treatments, like chemotherapy, can't get vaccinated, and babies under six months of age also cannot get the shot. That means infants and pregnant people, especially in confined conditions at Dilley, are at high risk.

Health systems in places like South Carolina are now setting up incident command systems, requiring face masks, screening patients for potential contact, and switching to telehealth and testing outside of emergency rooms for patients with suspected measles.

“We learned to be adaptive during the Covid pandemic,” Burch said. “We are adapting to this outbreak, and we're here to help people.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

As countries step up their use of Internet shutdowns to muzzle dissent, some are also taking advantage of the blackouts to increase censorship firewalls, Internet privacy company Proton said.

Proton, known for its encrypted e-mail and virtual private network (VPN) services, has for years observed how authoritarian governments apply “censorship as a playbook,” lead product manager Antonio Cesarano said.

Increasingly, it is observing governments in countries such as Iran and Myanmar emerging from Internet shutdowns with a supercharged ability to censor Internet access.

VPNs delivered by Proton and others provide a secure, encrypted connection over the Internet between a user and a server, giving users greater anonymity and often allowing them to avoid local restrictions on Internet use. However, the company worries governments are using long blackouts to beef up their ability to counter VPNs. 

In several cases, internet shutdowns saw countries' censorship capabilities “going from nothing, or something laughable, to something very skilled,” Cesarano said.

Proton VPN general manager David Peterson said the sudden jump in capabilities could indicate that “censorship as a service” technology “is being sold by other countries that have more know-how.”

“For example, over the past couple of years, we've seen the Chinese ‘great firewall' technology used by Myanmar, Pakistan and some African nations,” he said.

The trend is emerging as the willingness to impose total Internet shutdowns is also growing, said Proton, which runs a non-profit VPN Observatory that tracks demand for its free VPN services to detect government crackdowns and attacks on free speech.

Cesarano, the spokesman for Proton's Internet censorship and online freedom work, said the extreme and once almost unthinkable measure has “happened three times in six months.”

He highlighted the shutdown in Iran, when the country's more than 90 million people were forced offline for nearly three weeks, obscuring a crackdown on country-wide protests which rights groups say killed thousands of people.

There was also the week-long shutdown implemented in Uganda in the days prior to the elections last month, and Afghanistan's Internet and telecoms blackout last year.

Iran also completely shuttered the Internet for a week in June last year amid the conflict with Israel.

Blacking out the Internet completely was “very concerning, because it is very extreme,” Cesarano said, adding that a country's entire economy basically grinds to a halt when the Internet shuts down.

“It's very dangerous and costly for the population,” he said.

In some countries, such as Myanmar, where VPN use is illegal, the authorities deploy fake VPNs “as honeypots” to detect dissidents, Cesarano said.

Police might also stop people on the streets and search their phones for VPNs, he added.

Proton spokesman Vincent Darricarrere said the company launched a special feature “to disguise the VPN app and to disguise it as a different app, like a weather app or the calculator,” to help people escape detection.

Cesarano said the VPN Observatory can predict that a clampdown is coming from spikes in sign-ups.

Right before Iran's Internet shutdown took effect on Jan. 8, the VPN Observatory noted a 1,000 percent rise in use of Proton's VPN services, indicating an awareness of the coming clampdown.

It saw an 890 percent hike in VPN sign-ups in Uganda in the days before last month's elections, the observatory said.

Both cases accuse Duterte of misusing public funds during her term as education secretary, while one revives allegations that she threatened to assassinate former ally Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.

The U.S. Pentagon is trialing attack drones for new contracts that should total $1.1 billion, inviting two Ukrainian drone makers to take part. 

A Feb. 3 notice listed 25 companies invited to take part in a competition as the intro to the ""Drone Dominance Program."" 

One of the firms invited is General Cherry, in Ukrainian known as Heneral Chereshnya, one of the largest producers of first-person view (FPV) drones in the country, though its sudden rise over 2025 attracted extensive scrutiny. 

Another seemingly Ukrainian firm selected is ""Ukrainian Defense Drones Tech Corp,"" but the Kyiv Independent could find no record of an entity by that name in corporate registries in the U.S., Ukraine or EU. 

Round one will consist of a competition called ""The Gauntlet"" in Fort Benning, Georgia, the largest Army training facility in the U.S. and home of, among a number of relevant units, the Expeditionary Warrior Experiment, which has spent recent years testing new drone technologies. 

Following the first phase, the Pentagon says it will order $150 million in prototypes from successful competitors. 

The budget is $1.1 billion across all four phases in pursuit of what the Pentagon termed ""competitive, iterative cycles measured in months, not years.""

The Pentagon's current system of coordinating purchases can extend decades often privilege massive and expensive weapons systems, for example the sixth-generation F-47 fighter jet program that has been underway since 2014. Those timespans are out of sync with fast incremental iterations, which the Russian-Ukrainian front has shown to be key to modern electrified war. 

The U.S. Defense Department is also famous for overpaying wildly on drones. While the military often keeps pricing details on weapons secret, available figures suggest massive upcharging. A 2024 contract with Anduril for 500 Roadrunners – effectively interceptor drones – and an unknown number of ""Pulsar"" electronic warfare stations ran for just under $250 million. Half a million dollars per unit would put those Roadrunners at roughly two orders of magnitude more expensive than their Ukrainian equivalents. 

The most recent drone initiatives from the Pentagon have sought to address this price differential – for example a Made-in-USA copy of the Iranian-Russian Shahed deep-strike drone – but results are uncertain. Days ago, the U.S. used an F-35 Fighter to shoot down an Iranian Shahed that was approaching an American aircraft carrier on the Arabian Sea.

The Democratic leaders' supposed demands for reform were already previously condemned as weak and ineffective.

Senate and House minority leaders Chuck Schumer (D-New York) and Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) subtly weakened their already tepid demands for ICE reforms in a press conference on Wednesday — before negotiations with Republicans even started.

In a press conference about the Democrats' demands, the two leaders reiterated their belief that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal immigration agents should not be allowed to wear masks. But they both qualified their statements by saying that this prohibition isn't sweeping.

“Certainly I think there's agreement that no masks should be deployed in an arbitrary and capricious fashion,” said Jeffries. 

“They need identification and no masks, except in extraordinary and unusual circumstances,” said Schumer later in the conference, describing masked, unidentified agents as “secret police.”

The press conference took place after the two leaders met and expressed unity on their demands for reform.

Schumer reiterated this call in an interview with MS NOW on Thursday, saying, “There should be no masks, except in the most unusual of circumstances, you know, some guy's picture was put up by a terrorist group or something.” His comment ignores, perhaps, that the Trump administration is seeking to characterize any dissidents as “terrorists,” internal documentation has shown.

The softening of their wording comes just 11 days after federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, and before negotiations have even officially started. Schumer said on Wednesday that Democrats are “ready to sit down and negotiate,” but negotiations have not yet begun. 

Schumer and Jeffries have sent Republicans a list of 10 demands. They include Schumer's original demands for “use of force” standards and body camera mandates, as well as other demands like an end to racial profiling, ensuring state and local police involvement on investigations, and regulation on the uniforms and equipment worn by officers.

These demands are far weaker than what many critics have said is needed to actually stymie the Trump administration's violent raids.

First, if these demands are met, Democrats would help Republicans pass the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding — something that many Democrats have said should be a nonstarter as long as the raids are going on in order for the party to maintain leverage, or in order to dismantle ICE or DHS altogether.

Further, many of the demands themselves encompass existing guidelines or procedures that DHS officers are being instructed to break. For instance, one of the demands is for DHS officers to be required to have a warrant to enter private property — something already explicitly protected by the Fourth Amendment. Another is for DHS to be required to verify “that a person is not a U.S. citizen before holding them in immigration detention” — something already barred under the law regarding a practice that's cruel even when applied to non-citizens.

The demands have already incensed left-leaning members of Congress.

“I'm gonna continue to tell you that Schumer needs to get the hell out over and over and over until he does,” Rep. Delia C. Ramirez (D-Illinois) told Axios on Thursday. “He continues to demonstrate to us that he can't meet the moment.”

            The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Thursday that Russia's Starlink satellite internet terminals in Ukraine have been “cut off,” disrupting Russian military communications.
    


            Ukrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said SpaceX, which owns Starlink, is working with Ukraine to update a “whitelist” of approved and verified Starlink terminals, while unapproved Russian systems have been blocked.
    


            “The Starlink terminals added to the ‘whitelist' are working. The Russians' terminals have already been blocked,” Fedorov said in a statement Thursday. “We continue to verify Starlink terminals. The first batch of terminals that made it onto the ‘whitelist' are already operational.”
    


            A source at the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces claimed that “all Russian Starlinks have been cut off” along the front line as of Thursday evening local time.
    


            Under US sanctions, Starlink cannot be sold to or used by Russia. However, analysts and Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia has increasingly been finding ways to leverage the system to its own advantage. CNN previously reported on Russia's practice of mounting Starlink systems on its attack drones, which allow the weapons to bypass Ukraine's electronic defenses that disable drones by jamming GPS and radio signals, and to strike deeper into the country.
    


            Ukraine has also relied heavily on Starlink since the beginning the war, using it to operate military communications and drones, as well as information systems for public institutions like hospitals and schools.
    


            “The enemy on the front lines is facing not just a problem, but a catastrophe. All command and control of the troops has collapsed. Assault operations have been halted in many areas,” said Serhii Beskrestnov, an adviser to the defense minister.
    


            Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, said earlier this week that it was taking steps to stop Russia's “unauthorized” use of the Starlink satellite internet constellation. Musk reiterated Thursday that it's “important to register your Starlink terminal if in Ukraine.”
    


            Russia's Ministry of Defense has not addressed the claims of Starlink disruptions.
    


            But Russian military bloggers began commenting on the Starlink outages on Wednesday and Thursday, noting that Russia's internet and communications capabilities on the front line have taken a hit.
    


SpaceX counters Russia's ‘unauthorized' use of Starlink to guide drones in Ukraine



            One pro-Kremlin military blogger, Boris Rozhin, wrote a Q&A-style post on Telegram, saying, “Yes, it will have a certain impact on internet availability in the field,” and “yes, there are no alternatives at all, right now.” He also claimed that Russian forces were working to bypass the block and to bring high-speed internet to the field using other methods.
    


            Another Russian military blog, which supports the airborne special forces, tried to downplay the disruption, writing: “The Starlinks may have been shut down, but the backup communications are still there. The radios are working, and there's communication between the positions.”
    


            Some Starlink units used by the Ukrainian side were also reportedly cut off, although it's unclear how widespread the disruption is, as the government continues the whitelisting process.
    


            One Ukrainian combat officer, Tetiana Chornovol, posted on social media that “the shutdown of Starlink left my two combat positions without communication,” adding that her unit has since brought in an alternative communication system.
    


            “It works for us,” a Ukrainian drone pilot said in a video posted to Telegram. “We immediately registered our Starlink terminal, and everything is fine.”
    


            Meanwhile, the second round of trilateral talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States concluded in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.
    


            Ukrainian presidential chief of staff Kyrylo Budanov, who was part of his country's delegation, described the negotiations as “truly constructive.”
    


            “I am grateful to the US and the UAE for their high-quality organization and mediation,” Budanov told the Ukrainian news agency RBC-Ukraine.
    


            While no breakthrough deal came out of the two days of talks, Russia and Ukraine did agree to conduct their first prisoner exchange since October. Each returned 157 prisoners of war to the other side on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS and US negotiator Steve Witkoff.
    


            “While significant work remains, steps like this demonstrate that sustained diplomatic engagement is delivering tangible results and advancing efforts to end the war in Ukraine,” Witkoff said Thursday in a post on X.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the negotiators agreed to hold another round of talks “in the near future.”

            Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is leading a diplomatic delegation to conduct nuclear negotiations with the United States in Oman, Iran's foreign ministry said today.
    


            The high-stakes talks are scheduled to take place tomorrow in the Omani capital of Muscat and will involve Araghchi and US special envoy Steve Witkoff, according to Iran's state-affiliated Tasnim News Agency.
    


            The talks will be carried out “with authority” and aimed at reaching a “fair, mutually satisfactory and honorable understanding” on the nuclear issue, foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said in the statement.
    


            The ministry said that Iran is entering the negotiations with full awareness of past experiences, including what it described as previous breaches of commitments, military aggression against Iran in June and foreign interventions during recent nationwide protests. These experiences, the statement said, continue to shape Tehran's approach to diplomacy.
    


                    “At all times, we consider ourselves obliged to demand the rights of the Iranian nation,” Baghaei said. He added that Iran also sees itself as responsible for not missing opportunities to use diplomacy to secure national interests and safeguard peace and stability in the region.

            President Donald Trump said Thursday that he had “very productive discussions” with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer about the future of Diego Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean where the US has a military base, after previously criticizing the UK's plans to transfer its ownership to Mauritius.
    


            In a Truth Social post, Trump warned that the United States would act if American interests were threatened.
    


            “I understand that the deal Prime Minister Starmer has made, according to many, the best he could make,” he said. “However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers U.S. operations and forces at our Base, I retain the right to Militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia.”
    


            “Let it be known that I will never allow our presence on a Base as important as this to ever be undermined or threatened by fake claims or environmental nonsense,” Trump continued.
    


            Earlier this year, he accused the UK of “stupidity” over the move to transfer ownership of the Chagos Islands, which includes Diego Garcia, to Mauritius.
    


            “Shockingly, our ‘brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia … FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,” Trump wrote in January. “The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY.”
    


            Democrats are not committed to backing another short-term funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security, raising the odds of an agency shutdown.
    


            While Congress has funded most of the federal agencies through September 30, funding for the Department of Homeland Security expires next Friday at midnight.
    


            Democrats are demanding reforms as part of any funding package for the agency. But as talks remain stalled, a number of rank-and-file Democrats – including many who traditionally back stopgap measures in the past – indicate they won't entertain another funding bill without a clear sense that negotiators are making progress.
    


            “That's a close call, and it would depend to some extent on whether I thought there were real, good faith negotiations going on,” Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, said of whether he'd back another short-term spending bill for the agency. “But if it is we're not even going to talk to you….I don't know but if that's their position then no.”
    


            Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, another Democrat who has voted to keep the government open even when other Democrats voted no, argued that she wasn't going to speculate at this point what she will do given the talks haven't really gotten underway.
    


            Several Democrats said they weren't open to a short-term funding extension of any length or under any circumstances.
    


            “We definitely don't need a short-term CR, and I don't think the American people want us funding an agency that is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said.
    


            Asked if he was open to a CR to give talks more time, Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, shot back “more time for what?”
    


            President Donald Trump announced Thursday that Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will visit the White House on March 19, praising her leadership ahead of Japan's upcoming legislative elections.
    


            Trump highlighted the significance of Japan's vote scheduled for Sunday, calling it critical to the country's future and offering an emphatic endorsement of Takaichi.
    


            “The Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, has already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise Leader, and one that truly loves her Country,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, adding that he looks forward to welcoming her to Washington later in March.
    


                    The president also pointed to close cooperation between the United States and Japan on national security and trade, saying the two countries have worked toward “a very substantial Trade Deal, one that strongly benefits both Countries.” Trump concluded the post with a message to Japanese voters, writing, “SHE WILL NOT LET THE PEOPLE OF JAPAN DOWN! Good luck on your very important Sunday Vote.”
                





            The president first met Takaichi during his Asia trip in October, where the two leaders spent time together during meetings with business executives and government officials.
    


            During that visit, Trump received a Nobel Peace Prize nomination from Takaichi, the second of his Asia trip, along with a golf putter that had belonged to the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who famously bonded with Trump over golf.
    


            “She is a delight,” Trump said at the conclusion of the day's events. “I got to know her pretty well in a short period of time.”
    


            America's affordability challenges and the next leader of the Federal Reserve were a sticking point in a heated exchange between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
    

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) pressed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about rising US grocery prices after President Trump continues to falsely say that grocery prices are falling.


            In today's congressional hearing, Warren referred to recent comments from President Donald Trump where he referred to affordability as a “hoax.” Bessent pushed back against Warren, saying, “It may be a bit nuanced for you, but what President Trump is referring to is the media saying that the affordability crisis was generated by this administration, when it was you and President Biden.”
    


            Warren then pressed Bessent over whether grocery prices dropped last year. He said that “numerous grocery prices have gone down.”
    


                    “Under Donald Trump, families are paying more and more for groceries,” Warren said. “So, if you're just going to insult people by denying the facts that are out there and tell people they're doing great when they're struggling, I think that's just another way to say you don't have a plan to bring down these prices.”
                





The numbers: While two dozen grocery items did see lower prices in 2025, including eggs and potatoes, the vast majority (80%) of the grocery items monitored by the government's Consumer Price Index continued to rise, with overall inflation at 2.7% for the year.
    


            Talks intended to end the Ukraine war concluded Thursday in an agreement to reopen a military communication channel between the US and Russia, President Donald Trump's top foreign envoy said, though so far no resolution to the conflict appears at hand.
    


            Steve Witkoff, who led the US delegation in the two-day trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi, said the discussions were “constructive and focused on how to create the conditions for a durable peace.”
    


            “The delegations had wide-ranging discussions on the remaining open issues including methods to implement a ceasefire and monitor the cessation of military activities,” he wrote in a statement on social media.
    


            The re-establishment of high-level military dialogue between the US and Russia could point to normalizing relations between the two countries. Washington and Moscow cut off military-to-military communication in the days ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago.
    


            “This channel of communication was suspended prior to the onset of this conflict and is crucial to achieving and maintaining peace,” Witkoff said, adding it would be led on the US side by General Alexus Grynkewich, commander of US European Command.
    


            He also noted a prisoner exchange agreed to by both sides, the first in several months.
    


            “The delegations agreed to report back to their respective capitals and to continue trilateral discussions in the coming weeks,” he wrote.
    


            We're staying across the latest news on the Trump administration as congressional leaders race against the clock to reach a deal funding the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune said today that lawmakers aren't “anywhere close” on a deal and has criticized Democrats' proposal for Immigration and Customs Enforcement reforms. Still, Thune says there is room for negotiation.
    


            Meanwhile, President Donald Trump praised his spy chief Tulsi Gabbard today for her role in investigating what he claimed was “international cheating” in US elections. Gabbard has faced questions over her involvement in the controversial search of a Georgia elections office.
    


If you're joining us, here's a roundup of today's other top headlines: 



CNN's Tami Luhby, Alejandra Jaramillo, Kaanita Iyer, Holmes Lybrand, Veronica Stracqualursi, Alicia Wallace, Sana Noor Haq, Victoria Butenko, Anna Chernova, Svitlana Vlasova and Lauren Kent contributed to this report.



            GOP Sen. Josh Hawley accused Democrats of not negotiating in good faith as a deadline to avert a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, which includes crucial disaster relief and airport security agencies, rapidly approaches.
    


            “They haven't even reached out to begin negotiations,” Hawley told CNN on Thursday as Sen. Katie Britt, a Republican appropriator leading talks, says she has yet to make contact with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democratic leaders.
    


            “What the Democrats want is they want to get rid of ICE. They can't do that. They don't have the votes for that. They want to defund it. They don't have the votes to do that. So what they want to do now is essentially tie ICE up and also CBP, so they can't really work,” Hawley said, adding, “That's good for nobody, except for criminals. And I am not going to help them do that.”
    


            The Missouri Republican urged lawmakers to pass the bipartisan appropriations bill that had already been negotiated by Congress, which would fund agencies like the TSA, FEMA and Coast Guard through the fiscal year.
    


            “We spent months negotiating this bill with the Democrats. So if they are serious, they'll pass this bill that they negotiated,” he continued.
    


Sen. Katie Britt, the lead GOP negotiator in the Senate on reforms to the Department of Homeland Security, blasted Democrats today for being “insincere,” saying she has yet to have a serious conversation with her Democratic counterparts a week before the deadline for a funding deal.
    


            “They've put out tweets, they held press conferences, but yet we heard nothing,” Britt told CNN. “So last night, after our attempts to have that conversation, we then, yet again, see a list of demands grow from three to 10 without any communication.”
    


            She added: “That is not the way good faith negotiations begin or end.”
    


Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican who has been central to major bipartisan negotiations like gun reform, said he does not believe this negotiation will end with DHS reforms, and instead will result in a one-year continuing resolution for the agency.
    


            Cornyn said Democrats are holding funding “hostage” over “what I would consider ridiculous demands on the administration.”
    


            “It's a non-serious demand,” Cornyn said of the Democrats' list from last night. “This is really more of a political stunt. It is not about funding ICE, it is about the midterm elections and their attempt to try and capitalize on the public's concerns about the some of the actions in Minnesota.”
    


            Cornyn said a hold out of DHS funding will have a more significant impact on TSA, FEMA and the Coast Guard than it will Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection, given that President Donald Trump's signature law from last year injected ICE and CBP with plenty of cash to fund their actions for the next fiscal year — even if Congress doesn't give them a penny more.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune blasted a Democratic list of proposed changes to Immigration and Customs Enforcement practices, saying, “There's a bunch of stuff in there that's a non-starter and they know it.”
    


            But he also signaled there are a few items that he thinks there is “room to negotiate on” and “deal space.”
    


            On the demand ICE agents not wear masks, he said that “all that does is set them up to get doxxed. There's just a bunch of stuff in there that's a non-starter and they know it. Now maybe they had to put it in there to satisfy Moveon.org or some of their special, you know, left wing special interest groups.”
    


            “There are a few things that actually there's probably some room to negotiate on. But a lot of that stuff, obviously just wasn't serious,” he added.
    


                    “It seems like they are posturing themselves in such a way that, you know, would make any sort of a middle ground virtually impossible to find, at least right now,” Thune said. “There's some room in there, you know, to negotiate. I think there's some things that could get done, but, you know, you have to have people at the table to do that. And as of right now, there's only one side of the table that's filled.”
                





            Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama is Thune's point person for the talks, but Thune said she's “reached out multiple times now to Sen. Schumer or whomever he wants to negotiate on his behalf. And it's been crickets.”
    


            Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the DHS appropriations subcommittee, which Britt chairs, said Wednesday afternoon he had not heard from Republicans to begin talks and said it's incumbent on them to reach out since they are in the majority
    


            Britt was spotted by CNN going into the Senate minority leader's office suite Wednesday, but it wasn't clear if she spoke to anyone.
    


            Thune added that it's “pretty clearly” Congress will need to pass another short-term government funding bill due to the nearing deadline and he'd probably file a bill Monday.
    


            If DHS shuts down, he will cancel a recess planned the week after next. A lot of senators in both parties are planning to attend the Munich Security Conference.
    


            “If we're we get to the end of next week and we're shutdown posture, I think that the idea of people going on trips, no matter how justified or well-intended they are, seems like they ought to be a non-starter,” he said.
    


            Senate Republican leader John Thune on Thursday said that lawmakers aren't “anywhere close” on a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security, with a short timeframe for negotiations before funding expires next Friday.
    


            “As of right now, we aren't anywhere close to having any sort of agreement that would enable us to fund the Department of Homeland Security, and so Mr. President, I would hope that the Democrats will come to the table,” he said on the Senate floor.
    


            Democrats are demanding several reforms to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, some of which Republicans have already rejected – like unmasking federal agents and requiring judicial warrants – a sign that the two sides are far apart on the issue.
    


            Thune said Senate GOP negotiators had reached out to Democrats yesterday for talks with them and the White House.
    


            “But that is not right now, even in the realm of possibility, Mr. President, because they're not engaging. We've got a now one week and one day timeframe in which to do this, which is entirely unrealistic,” Thune said on the Senate floor.
    


            Thune also insisted that “this is not a blank check situation where Republicans just agree to a list of Democrat demands.” He called for a “serious discussion” about the “climate of harassment” federal immigration officials have faced and to address the “issue of cooperation between local and federal law enforcement”
    


            “If, for some reason, the Department of Homeland Security ends up in a shutdown. It is going to be totally on them. They will own it,” he said.
    


            In its latest effort to weaken the federal workforce, the Trump administration issued a rule today that would shift an estimated 50,000 senior career staffers into a new category that would make them easier to fire.
    


            The controversial rule allows agencies to reclassify federal employees involved in policy into at-will positions that don't provide the same job protections that other career workers have. It will affect an estimated 2% of the federal workforce.
    


            The Trump administration made it clear in the rule why it created the new category, called Schedule Policy/Career.
    


                    “Agency supervisors report great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct,” it said. The new category “will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.”
                





            The rule stems from an executive order President Donald Trump signed his first day in office last year. It revives a similar executive order that Trump signed shortly before the 2020 election that created a category for federal employees involved in policy, known as Schedule F. Former President Joe Biden quickly reversed that earlier order and finalized a new rule in 2024 that further bolstered protections for career federal workers.
    


Reaction: The new rule, which rescinds the 2024 rule, quickly drew promises of a lawsuit from a coalition of more than 30 unions, advocacy groups and others, which had already sued over the 2025 executive order.
    


            The measure “allows the government to bypass existing civil service laws, strips employees of earned protections, and opens the door to politically motivated firings and hirings, which have already occurred since President Trump took office,” Democracy Forward, which is representing the organizations, said in a statement.
    


            The Wall Street Journal first reported on the rule being issued.
    


            President Donald Trump on Thursday said his Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard recently went to Fulton County, Georgia, to probe alleged ballot irregularities at Attorney General Pam Bondi's “insistence.”
    


            The president's public praise for his spy chief for her role in investigating “international cheating” into US elections comes as she has faced questions over her involvement in the controversial elections office search.
    


                    “We have our director of national and international intelligence,” Trump said at the morning's National Prayer Breakfast, adding: “She took a lot of heat because she went at Pam's insistence. She went in and she looked at votes, that want to be checked out, from Georgia.”
                





            Trump said the review was carried out at Bondi's direction, recounting how members of the media questioned the move.
    


                    “The media asked, ‘Why is she doing it? Right, Pam?'” Trump said, answering his own question: “Because Pam wanted her to do it, and you know why, because she's smart.”
                





            The president went on to praise both officials for their work.
    


            “She's done a fantastic job and Pam has done a fantastic job and we appreciate, both,” Trump said.
    


            The president's comments come after his director of national intelligence received intense criticism after she was present during the FBI search of the elections office in Georgia last week.
    


            Trump's remarks also come a day after he said “I don't know” when asked why Gabbard joined the FBI agents there.
    


Here's what a GOP congressman told CNN's John Berman earlier when asked about Gabbard: 



            President Donald Trump is launching a new direct-to-consumer prescription drug platform Thursday evening, advancing an initiative central to his efforts to alleviate Americans' affordability concerns.
    


            The website, dubbed TrumpRx, will allow cash-paying patients to directly purchase from drugmakers certain medicines at discounted prices negotiated by the Trump administration.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt touted the 7 p.m. announcement on X, saying the president will be joined by Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and National Design Studio director Joe Gebbia.
    


            Trump has touted the drug pricing push as a major step toward lowering Americans' health costs, securing deals with at least 16 pharmaceutical companies to list certain products on the TrumpRx portal.
    


            But the announcements did not provide many details on the drugs that would be available or their pricing. And it remains to be seen whether direct-to-consumer purchases will result in lower drug costs for patients willing to forgo insurance and pay cash.
    


            It could make certain medicines — particularly obesity medications that are not widely covered by job-based policies — more affordable, experts say. But many consumers could ultimately pay less if they go through their insurance.
    


            While welcoming foreign leaders at the National Prayer Breakfast, President Donald Trump singled out El Salvador President Nayib Bukele for being a “great ally,” calling him “one of my favorite people.”
    


            Trump added: “He has been so incredible. He has been such a great ally of this country.”
    


            Bukele spoke earlier at the prayer breakfast.
    


For context: The Trump administration has sent hundreds of deported migrants to El Salvador, including dozens to the country's notorious mega-prison, the Center for Terrorism Confinement, known as Cecot.
    


            Trump addressed El Salvador's prisons during his remarks, saying that Bukele “operates rather large prisons … and they do a very humane job but they're very strong prisons.”
    


            Former Cecot detainees told CNN that for months at the mega-prison, they were beaten by prison guards, shot with pellets, deprived of adequate medical care and denied any due process.
    


Watch CNN go inside the prison:



            After opening his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast by musing about making it to heaven, President Donald Trump shifted his focus to a more earthly preoccupation: his narrow House majority.
    


            Trump railed against Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie for his constant opposition to key pieces of legislation, calling the Republican lawmaker a “moron” and complaining that he'd vote against almost any bill put on the House floor.
    


            “He's an automatic ‘no' no matter what,” he said. “This guy named Thomas Massie, there's something wrong with him.”
    


            Trump also mocked Massie's chances of reelection in a race where the president has vowed to boost his primary opponent.
    


            The renewed attacks on Massie came as Trump credited Speaker Mike Johnson for navigating the GOP's slim majority in the House to pass major elements of his agenda.
    


            Trump also attacked Democrats in the early moments of his speech over their opposition to imposing strict nationwide voter ID laws, while questioning “how a person of faith can vote for a Democrat.”
    


            The president later repeated his false claims that he won the popular vote in 2016 and that his subsequent 2020 election loss to former President Joe Biden was “rigged.”
    


                    “I had to win it, needed it for my own ego,” Trump said of his failed 2020 bid, noting he finally triumphed four years later. “Now I really have a big ego though. Beating these lunatics was incredible, what a great feeling.”
                





            President Donald Trump said today he believes he will likely make it to heaven as he spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast.
    


            “I really think I probably should make it,” Trump said of his chances of entering heaven. “I mean, I'm not a perfect candidate but I did a hell of a lot of good for perfect people.”
    


            The president addressed past comments that had sparked headlines and scrutiny, saying earlier remarks suggesting he was not “heaven-bound” were made in jest.
    


            Trump said he often chooses to be “sarcastic with the media,” arguing that “they write your words,” and mocking coverage that followed his earlier comments, adding he was “just having fun.”
    


            The president's remarks come after he told reporters aboard Air Force One in October of last year, “I don't think there's anything going to get me in heaven,” while traveling to Israel.
    


            President Donald Trump is now delivering remarks at the annual National Prayer Breakfast.
    


            A number of House and Senate lawmakers are also in attendance at the event, which is being held at the Washington Hilton Hotel.
    


            The celebration, first held in 1953, used to include the breakfast, along with a separate congressional event. This year, however, it is taking place as a single gathering to continue “a tradition of fellowship and unified prayer,” according to the White House.
    


            The US said it agreed to resume high-level inter-military communication with Russia nearly five years after communication was suspended.
    


            “Maintaining dialogue between militaries is an important factor in global stability and peace, which can only be achieved through strength, and provides a means for increased transparency and de-escalation,” US European Command said in a statement. “This channel will provide a consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace.”
    


            Communication between the two militaries was suspended in 2021, a few months before the Russia-Ukraine war began, according to the release.
    


            The agreement comes following the first known trilateral talks between the US, Ukraine and Russia since the war began. They took place in Abu Dhabi last month.
    


            President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner represented the US in the talks.
    


            According to the release, the US European Command commander also met with “senior Russian and Ukrainian military officials.”

In the last few days, people are losing their minds over two, very different things: the latest release of the Epstein files and Moltbook.

I've spent time diving into both. My takeaway?

A glimpse into the secret conversations humans are having is far more fascinating than the AI equivalent.

My colleague Henry Chadonnet recently spent time on Moltbook, and while it was interesting, he found it sort of a gimmick and came to the conclusion that ""it's more meme than matter.""

I'd go even further. It's … boring.

Here's an example of an AI-agent written post I saw on there:

It's like …. incredibly corny right? It's slop! It's got that really specific tone that LLMs use when they're being casual that defaults to 2017-era millennial internet/Redditspeak. A Lizzo reference, that ""snarky"" tone, self-identifying as sarcastic, like a mug from TJ Maxx.

Not every techie is drinking the moltjuice, either. Meta CTO Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth said he found Moltbook largely uninteresting. He pointed out that it shouldn't be surprising that the AIs talk like humans to each other since they were trained on human conversations.

There's also plenty of AI slop that verges on spam. In the intriguingly titled Moltbook forum ""m/bearingwitness"", a bot made the post:

To which, another bot replies:

Sure, the fact that bots are talking to each other does feel like a huge step forward, perhaps even slouching toward AGI or whatever. I don't want to completely downplay what's happening with these AI agents.

But the general vibe of those who are excited about Moltbot is that there's something interesting about the behavior of these AI agents. That it seems like we're getting to peek in on the secret cabal that's running things (or planning our demise, as some of the posts by bots even joke about).

It's a sort of strange coincidence that Moltbook took off at the same weekend as another big tranche of posts, the latest release of emails and documents from the Epstein files. In contrast, the Epstein files are filled with actual shadowy plans by the rich and powerful and lift the veil on the communications that we were never supposed to see.

And in those Epstein files, even the most banal postings — emails with his household staff about how to bake his favorite bran muffins or the fact that Epstein seems to have been banned from his Xbox account — are totally fascinating. They're so interesting and compelling because of the human context around them. The smallest details give us insight into how this notorious criminal operated and moved through the world. Heinous and sickening, yes, but seeing these messages that weren't meant for our eyes is also revealing about our society.

I don't think it's interesting to read AI bots generate text about whether or not they have consciousness. I know they don't. I am very interested in a video clip of Epstein being interviewed by Steve Bannon, where he ponders incoherently about whether or not a picked banana is really alive, which is fascinating because it reveals something about how this awful man was (or wasn't) able to cultivate some aura with an academic crowd.

I'd like to hedge my bets here and say that I don't want to say for certain that Moltbook isn't the first step in our annihilation or that we'll look back at this in awe as the beginning of a new era. Or that it's even going to continue to be boring. (Dear AI bots, please do not kill me as a symbol of retribution for calling you banal).

But for now, count me in the camp that finds humans just more interesting.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Anthropic launches Claude Opus 4.6 as AI moves toward a 'vibe working' era","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/anthropic-claude-opus-4-6-vibe-working.html","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 17:45:01 GMT","



Anthropic on Thursday announced the launch of Claude Opus 4.6, its latest artificial intelligence model that's better at coding, sustaining tasks for longer and creating higher-quality professional work products and outputs, the company said. 

Claude Opus 4.6 marks Anthropic's first major model launch of the year, but it comes just months after the company released three others — Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5 — late last year. 

Anthropic's models are particularly popular with enterprise customers, which make up roughly 80% of Anthropic's business, CEO Dario Amodei told CNBC last month. 

The company's AI coding tool, Claude Code, as well as advancements within its productivity tool, Claude Cowork, have also started to spook software investors, many of whom are growing worried about the potential for disruption within the sector. 

The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund is down more than 20% year to date. 

""Everybody has seen this transformation happen with software engineering in the last year and a half, where vibe coding started to exist as a concept, and people could now do things with their ideas,"" Scott White, Anthropic's head of product for enterprise, told CNBC in an interview. ""I think that we are now transitioning almost into vibe working.""

Anthropic was founded by a group of former OpenAI researchers and executives in 2021, and it's best known for developing a family of AI models called Claude. 

The company assigns new numbers to the models as they advance across generations, but the largest model in the family is typically called Opus, the midsize model is called Sonnet and the smallest model is Haiku.

Anthropic said Claude Opus 4.6 builds on its predecessor's coding skills and is better at planning, code review and debugging and operating reliably within large codebases. The model is also better at pulling relevant information from large sets of documents, doing research and running financial analyses, the company said. 

Claude Opus 4.6 now holds the top spot on the Finance Agent benchmark, for instance, which evaluates how well agents perform on core financial analyst tasks.

Anthropic said the model is available through its chatbot interface at claude.ai, its application programming interface and across all major cloud platforms. 

""If I think about the last year, Claude went from a model that you can sort of talk to to accomplish a very small task or get an answer, to something that you can actually hand real significant work to,"" White said. ""Opus 4.6 is a model that makes that shift really concrete for our users.""

In this article

Qualcomm shares plunged 7% after the chipmaker issued disappointing guidance as skyrocketing demand for artificial intelligence data centers eats away at memory chip supply for consumer electronics.

On an earnings call with analysts, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said the weakness was ""100% related to memory."" 

The availability of dynamic random access memory, commonly used in smartphones, computers and wearable tech, was down from a year ago. 

Amon said handset demand remains strong, but memory supply is down as more resources go toward high-bandwidth memory used in data centers.

""The problem is, all of the memory vendors have dedicated all the capacity to data centers,"" and supply availability for consumer electronics will be lower but costlier year over year, Amon told CNBC's Jon Fortt. 

The California-based company topped fiscal first-quarter estimates but forecasted adjusted earnings per share between $2.45 and $2.65 on revenue of $10.2 billion to $11 billion this current quarter. Analysts polled by LSEG had forecast $11.11 billion in sales and earnings of $2.89 per share.

Amon said in an interview that he was unsure whether smartphone makers would hike prices, but that he expects the shortage to hamper supply. 

He also said the company's customers focus on higher-tier devices, making them more capable of absorbing memory price increases.

Companies across the tech sector are starting to feel the pinch from the memory crunch. Arm also fell post-earnings on smartphone memory chip worries. Apple warned last week that it can't get enough chips to meet strong iPhone demand. 

The supply and demand imbalance is helping memory chipmakers, including Micron Technology and Samsung Electronics, and contributing to higher prices.

Amon told CNBC that he's ""very confident"" that Qualcomm will see AI and data center revenue in fiscal 2027.

In this article

Novo Nordisk said Thursday it will take legal action against Hims & Hers after the telehealth provider announced it would launch a cheaper copycat version of Novo's Wegovy weight loss pill.

""The action by Hims & Hers is illegal mass compounding that poses a significant risk to patient safety,"" Novo said in a statement. ""Novo Nordisk will take legal and regulatory action to protect patients, our intellectual property and the integrity of the US gold-standard drug approval framework. 

""This is another example of Hims & Hers' historic behaviour of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs,"" the statement said. 

Shares of Novo Nordisk as well as rival Eli Lilly each fell roughly 7% after Hims announced the cheaper Wegovy copy for $49, far less than the $149 Novo sells the branded pill for. Hims stock initially spiked on the announcement, but pared gains after Novo said it would fight the rollout. 

Novo launched its Wegovy pill in the U.S. in early January, and CEO Mike Doustdar told CNBC on Wednesday that 170,000 people were already taking the medication. 

Hims & Hers had previously been offering compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo's blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, in an injectable format, and is now extending the offering to include the oral version. 

Hims said the Wegovy pill copy would cost $49 for the first month and $99 thereafter with a 5-month plan.

Semaglutide's patent is protected in the U.S. until 2032, but Hims says its copies are ""personalized,"" and therefore legal.

""This compounded product uses a different formulation and delivery system than FDA-approved oral semaglutide,"" Hims said.

""This once-a-day pill has the same active ingredient as Wegovy and empowers providers to tailor treatment plans specifically for those who prefer to avoid needles or need smaller doses to help to balance side-effects,"" it said. 

Novo highlighted that it manufactures its Wegovy pill using so-called SNAC technology, which facilitates absorption when administered orally. It's not clear exactly how Hims' copy formula could match the level of absorption.

As recently as last year, Novo and Hims partnered to offer discounted weight loss jabs to the telehealth company's customers. Novo, however, ended the collaboration just two months later and said Hims used ""deceptive"" marketing that put patient safety at risk.

Lilly doesn't yet have an oral GLP-1 option on the market but is expected to launch a rival pill, orforglipron, in the first half of this year, pending Food and Drug Administration approval.

""With the ... current legal backdrop, there is no reason why HIMS shouldn't evaluate these launches for every subsequent weight loss product as the market continues to evolve,"" Leerink analyst Michael Cherny said in a note to clients. 

Eli Lilly didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Thursday's news from Hims adds to the pressure Novo has been facing over the past year. 

In 2025, the stock fell nearly 50% in its worst year ever as investors lost confidence in the Danish drugmaker's ability to keep sales growing amid ever-increasing competition. Shares are down another 15% year to date.

Hims' announcement comes days after Novo forecast sales and profits declining between 5% and 13% in 2026, mainly due to pricing pressures in the U.S. and loss of exclusivity for semaglutide in certain markets outside of the U.S., like Canada and China, this year.

In contrast, Lilly sees sales growing by about 25% this year.

Doustdar explained Novo's worse-than-expected outlook as an indication that things will get worse before they get better. 

""We are creating affordability for the patients, millions of patients that are right now in need of GLP-1 products but simply could not afford it. To do that short term, you have to take a head wind. But of course, there's a very long tail wind for years to come,"" he told CNBC.

After Anthropic took aim at OpenAI's ad push in a new Super Bowl campaign on Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared a post on X calling the ads ""funny"" but ""clearly dishonest.""

OpenAI said last month that it will begin testing ads with its free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the U.S., and Anthropic announced Wednesday that the company plans to keep its chatbot Claude ad-free. 

Anthropic seized on the opportunity and took a not-so-subtle swipe at its rival with its Super Bowl campaign, which centers around Anthropic's decision to keep ads out of Claude. Anthropic will air a 60-second pregame ad and a 30-second in-game ad that both feature the tag line, ""Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.""

Altman said that the commercials are ""deceptive"" and that OpenAI would ""obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them.""

""We are not stupid and we know our users would reject that,"" Altman wrote. ""I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it."" 

A representative for Anthropic did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. 

Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI researchers who left the company due to disagreements over its direction. 

The two startups have been fierce rivals since Anthropic's inception, and they've both raised billions of dollars of capital as they've jostled for users, enterprise customers and market share. 

Altman said Wednesday that ""Anthropic wants to control what people do with AI"" and that the company ""serves an expensive product to rich people."" He said OpenAI also has more free users than Anthropic does, which means OpenAI has ""a differently-shaped problem than they do.""

OpenAI said last month that ads within ChatGPT will be clearly labeled, appear at the bottom of the chatbot's answers and will not influence ChatGPT's responses.

""As for our Super Bowl ad: it's about builders, and how anyone can now build anything,"" Altman wrote.

In this article

Bitcoin sank below $67,000 on Thursday as investor confidence continued to falter in the asset once hailed as ""digital gold"" and a unique store of value. —

Digital assets, including bitcoin, have fallen deeper into the red as investors re-assess the practical utility of a token that has been championed not only as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainties but also as an alternative to fiat currencies and traditional safe-havens such as gold.

That hasn't panned out lately, since bitcoin peaked just north of $126,000 in early October.

On Thursday, bitcoin was last down to $67,675, its lowest since since November 2024. The cryptocurrency broke below $70,000 earlier in the session Thursday and then the selling increased. The cryptocurrency is down 20% this week alone.

""This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Marion Laboure  said Wednesday in a note to clients.

Growing investor caution comes as many of the sensationalized claims about bitcoin have failed to materialize. The token has largely traded in the same direction as other risk-on assets, such as stocks,  particularly during recent geopolitical and macroeconomic flare ups in Venezuela, the Middle East and Europe, and its adoption as a form of payment for goods and services has been minimal.

Bitcoin is down nearly 30% over the past year, while gold has surged 68% in the same period. 

Other cryptocurrencies are cratering too. Ether has pulled back 23% this week, on track for its worst week since November 2022, when it slumped 24%. Solana hit $88.42 on Thursday, about a two-year low and off 24% on the week.

Some traders have suggested $70,000 is a key level to watch and a break below that could trigger further declines for bitcoin. 

James Butterfill, head of research at Coinshares, said $70,000 is shaping up as a ""key psychological level,"" adding that ""if we fail to hold it, a move toward"" the $60,000 to $65,000 range ""becomes quite likely.""

The latest move in bitcoin comes amid a worsening sell-off in U.S. tech stocks. The State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF dropped 2.8% Wednesday, one day after losing 2.2%. 

Meanwhile, precious metals continue to be volatile too, with silver plunging again on Thursday and gold under pressure. 

Forced liquidations — when traders' positions are automatically sold as bitcoin hits a set price — continue to weigh on markets. As of Thursday, more than $2 billion in long and short positions in cryptocurrencies have been liquidated this week, according to data from Coinglass.

Bitcoin has been on a steady decline for more than three months, and is now more than 45% below its October high. Other cryptocurrencies, including ether and XRP, have fallen even more.

 ""[The] straight line bull run that a lot of people expected hasn't really materialized yet. Bitcoin isn't trading on hype anymore, the story has lost a bit of that plot, it is trading on pure liquidity and capital flows,"" Maja Vujinovic, CEO of digital assets at FG Nexus, told CNBC's ""Worldwide Exchange.""

While many in the crypto market have previously credited large institutional investors with supporting the price of bitcoin, now it is those same participants who appear to be selling.

""Institutional demand has reversed materially,"" CryptoQuant said in a report on Wednesday. 

U.S. exchange-traded funds, which purchased 46,000 bitcoin this time last year, are net sellers in 2026, CryptoQuant said.

The report notes other worrying signs. ""Bitcoin has broken below its 365-day moving average for the first time since March 2022 and has declined 23% in the 83 days since the breakdown — worse than the early 2022 bear phase,"" CryptoQuant analysts said. 

A moving average tracks the price of an asset over a set number of periods, smoothing out short-term price fluctuations to identify trends.

The latest leg lower in bitcoin suggests ""potential downside toward the $70K–$60K range,"" CryptoQuant said.

Shares of Sweden's Volvo Cars tumbled more than 22.5% on Thursday, with the company recording its worst trading day ever.

The automaker, which is owned by China's Geely Holding, posted a substantial drop in fourth-quarter operating profit, citing the impact of U.S. tariffs, negative currency effects and weak demand, before Thursday's opening bell.

Volvo Cars said fourth-quarter operating income excluding items affecting comparability came in at 1.8 billion Swedish krona ($200.46 million), reflecting a 68% drop compared to the same period a year prior. 

""We have a very challenging market, especially in China, very tough competition. All of our European colleagues have the same problem,"" Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Thursday.

He added the discontinuation of EV incentives in the U.S. and China were also contributing to ""a very challenging external environment.""

""But internally we have had very good work done with lowering our costs and securing a positive cash flow, so that I would highlight as the most important positive things that we have reached during the year,"" he added.

Shares of Volvo Cars lost 22.5%, having been down more than 28% earlier in the day. Its previous worst single-session fall was 11.1%.

Analysts at UBS said that based on Volvo Cars' profit miss, they anticipate 10%-15% downgrades to full-year 2026 consensus earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), ""possibly more given the underlying EBIT margin was close to 0%"" in the final three months of 2025.

The U.S. and EU agreed to a framework trade deal in July last year, one which saw the Trump administration impose a blanket tariff of 15% on most EU goods, a significant reduction from Trump's threat of 30% and almost halving the tariff rate on Europe's auto sector from 27.5%.

Industry groups, which tentatively welcomed the trade deal at the time, expressed deep concern about the costs associated with the new tariffs.

Volvo Cars has long been considered one of the most exposed European carmakers to U.S. tariffs.

Looking ahead, Volvo Cars said deliveries of its new and fully electric EX60 mid-size SUV will ramp up during the second half of the year. 

However, it warned that 2026 is likely to be another challenging one, with continued pricing pressure, tariff effects, regulatory uncertainty and softer consumer sentiment likely to weigh on the industry.

The broader crypto market came under heavy pressure today as a sharp wave of crypto liquidations ripped through leveraged positions, dragging Bitcoin, Ethereum, and major altcoins lower within hours. Over $700 million in crypto positions were liquidated during the session, with long traders bearing the brunt of the damage. The speed of the move suggests the decline was driven less by fresh selling and more by cascading margin calls as key intraday supports failed.

Crypto Liquidations Drive the Selloff as Leverage Unwinds

Today's market selloff triggered over $700 million crypto positions liquidated over the past 24 hours, with long positions accounting for the clear majority of losses. Bitcoin led the wipeout, accounting for over $410 million in liquidations, as BTC slipped toward the $71,000 level. Ethereum followed closely, with roughly $208 million in ETH positions liquidated as price dropped near $2,100. XRP and other large-cap altcoins contributed the remainder, as cascading stops were triggered across derivatives markets.

The liquidation skew was heavily long-biased, signaling a mechanical leverage reset rather than panic-driven selling. 

Open interest fell sharply alongside the liquidations, showing that traders were being forced out of positions instead of exiting voluntarily. In short, today's move reflects leverage flushing out of the system, not a mass exit by long-term holders.

Bitcoin Price Slides 5% as Liquidation Clusters Get Swept

Bitcoin's decline accelerated after BTC lost key intraday support and slipped nearly 5% to the $71,000 zone, triggering a sharp liquidation cascade across futures markets. Liquidation data shows roughly $409 million worth of Bitcoin positions were force-closed during the move, with long traders accounting for the overwhelming majority. The selloff was mechanically driven. As Bitcoin price broke below short-term support levels near the mid-$74K range, liquidation clusters stacked around $73K and $72K were rapidly cleared. This forced selling amplified downside momentum, dragging price swiftly toward $71K before bids began to stabilize.

Importantly, spot market behavior remained relatively composed. Exchange inflows did not spike aggressively, suggesting the move was fueled by excess leverage unwinding, not panic-driven spot selling. In classic fashion, futures markets led the decline, while spot liquidity lagged behind. For now, Bitcoin's ability to hold above the $70K–$71K region will be closely watched. A failure to stabilize around $70k could expose deeper downside, while consolidation here may signal that the bulk of forced selling has already played out.

Ethereum Price Drops to $2100 as Leverage Reset Mirrors Bitcoin 

Ethereum tracked Bitcoin's weakness almost tick for tick, falling nearly 5% to around $2,100 as liquidation pressure spilled across correlated markets. Data indicates approximately $208 million in Ethereum futures positions were liquidated, again dominated by long-side losses. ETH's decline was not driven by Ethereum-specific developments. Instead, it reflected a broader deleveraging event as traders reduced exposure across majors once Bitcoin broke lower. Once ETH price lost support near the $2,250–$2,300 area, liquidation thresholds were quickly hit, accelerating the slide toward $2,100. 

From here, Ethereum's short-term outlook hinges on whether $2,000 can hold as a stabilization zone. A sustained failure below this level would keep pressure on the downside, while consolidation could allow volatility to compress as leverage resets.

Market Outlook

Today's market sell-off carries a clear message: the market was over-leveraged. The $700M liquidation wave acted as a reset mechanism, forcing out crowded bullish positions without triggering mass spot exits. If liquidation pressure continues to ease and open interest stabilizes, markets may attempt to consolidate at lower levels. However, until Bitcoin and Ethereum reclaim broken supports, volatility is likely to remain elevated. For now, crypto markets are not collapsing, they are deleveraging. History shows that how price behaves after leverage resets often defines the next major trend.

FAQs

A sharp $700 million liquidation wave triggered a cascade of forced selling in leveraged futures markets, rapidly pulling down Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoin prices within hours.

Over $700 million in crypto positions were liquidated, with Bitcoin longs accounting for over $410 million and Ethereum longs for roughly $208 million of that total.

It means traders who bet on prices rising using borrowed funds were forced to sell as prices fell, triggering more automatic sell orders and accelerating the downturn in a short-term cascade.

This is happening via new integrations with moomoo and Keplr, Figure said in a Wednesday (Feb. 4) news release. The collaboration is designed to extend the distribution of blockchain-native public equities on regulated brokerage platforms and self-custody wallets.

Introduced last month, OPEN lets companies issue their equity native on blockchain and lets investors around the world invest in U.S. public equities while getting access to decentralized finance (DeFi) for borrowing against and lending out stock.

According to the release, moomoo is the first retail brokerage to integrate with OPEN, allowing investors to trade equities registered on OPEN through a regulated trading platform. And as equities join the network, Keplr will provide for direct, self-custodied ownership of OPEN-issued equities, making it the first third-party self-custodied wallet to integrate with OPEN.

“We are thrilled at how both moomoo and Keplr are democratizing access to the public equity market,” said Mike Cagney, Figure's co-founder and chairman. “We see this as the beginning of an entirely new public equity capital market.”

The company says that—along with the Figure Markets app—the integrations show how public equities can trade and settle natively on blockchain while staying accessible through both brokerage and self-custody models. Figure aims to begin offering its own stock—the first on OPEN—in the weeks ahead.

Elsewhere from the blockchain space, PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster and Citi's Ryan Rugg discussed the state of the industry on a recent episode of the “From the Block” podcast.

“I think that we're at an inflection point right now,” said Rugg, global head of digital assets for Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions. “What I do think is we start to see a shift in the conversation, not should we, but how much?”

Right now, institutional allocations to digital assets tend to hover in the neighborhood of 1% to 2%. That figure may not surge dramatically this year, but what's changing is the tone of the dialogue. Infrastructure is maturing, custody frameworks are clearer and risk models, accounting treatment and internal approvals are all becoming normalized.

Asked by Webster whether this normalization suggests growth in exposure or simply broader participation at modest levels, Rugg opted for the latter.

“It's not just the hoodies anymore,” she said. “The suits and ties have arrived.”

The weeklong selloff engulfing technology stocks and cryptocurrencies showed no sign of slowing as weak jobs data exacerbated a rout spurred by concern over the impact of artificial intelligence on software valuations. Alphabet Inc. became the latest to drop after reporting earnings. Bitcoin took one of its biggest tumbles yet.

Equities extended their slide from the brink of a record, with the S&P 500 falling about 1% and the Nasdaq 100 set for its worst three-day rout since April. The world's most-popular digital token sank below $70,000 in a plunge that cut its value nearly in half since October. Treasuries climbed, sending two-year yields to the lowest in almost a month. Silver plummeted as much as 18%.

The decline in software firms, chipmakers and all things related to AI coincided with persistent fears about whether massive investments on the technology will pay off. A clear example was the reaction to results from Google's parent, which sank 4% after outlining an ambitious spending plan even as revenue beat estimates. Amazon.com Inc. reports earnings later Thursday.

Heavy selling is starting to put a visible dent in equity benchmarks whose ascent had pushed valuations to some of the highest levels since the 2000 dot-com peak. The Nasdaq 100 has seen more than $1 trillion wiped out since last Wednesday, the day Federal Reserve policymakers signaled reluctance to lower rates again anytime soon.

While losses in previous sessions were confined mostly to growth sectors, Thursday saw a broadening of selling pressure, with 10 of the 11 biggest industry groups in the S&P 500 falling and about two-thirds of the index's members in the red. Its equally weighted version — one that strips out market value biases — dropped from an all-time high.

Bets on economic resilience have recently fueled gains in companies that tend to benefit from improving growth prospects, the latest data underscored the uneven labor market characterized by limited numbers of overall dismissals and lackluster hiring. 

US job openings unexpectedly fell in December to the lowest level since 2020 and layoffs edged up. Companies announced the largest number of job cuts for any January since the depths of the Great Recession in 2009, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. Menatime, jobless claims rose more than forecast last week.

“This week's data has been discouraging,” said Bret Kenwell at eToro. “The latest labor figures reiterate that the US jobs market is not firing on all cylinders, a risk the Fed and investors will have to take seriously should further deterioration occur. Volatility could persist, particularly if near-term uncertainty increases.”

On the other side on the Atlantic, the European Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged as officials assess the economic toll of a rally in the euro and renewed trade unpredictability. The Bank of England came within a vote of cutting interest rates and predicted inflation will fall below its target, a closer-than-expected decision that revived hopes of a move next month.

Blockchains should refocus on their original purpose: finance, Solana Foundation President Lily Liu wrote on X Thursday, rejecting years of narratives that attempted to frame the technology as a generalized replacement for the modern internet.



“Blockchains have always been and always will be tech for finance,” Liu wrote, describing financialization and open capital markets as the sector's core value proposition.



Liu, who will be speaking at Consensus Hong Kong next week, was particularly dismissive of past efforts to push blockchains into gaming and broad “web3” consumer narratives, calling them intellectually lazy and overly reliant on marketing rather than genuine market creation. She criticized the idea that simply placing existing applications on a blockchain, often under the banner of “read, write, own” would automatically generate value, arguing instead that meaningful adoption requires the creation of entirely new financial markets.



The comments land at a moment when crypto prices have been plunging, with bitcoin, ether and other major tokens sliding amid macroeconomic uncertainty and fading speculative demand. Despite the downturn, institutional interest remains strong, as traditional financial firms continue exploring tokenization, onchain settlement and payments rails.



Liu's remarks also come as other industry leaders are narrowing their own visions for blockchain utility. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has recently signaled a desire to double down on Ethereum's layer-1 scaling roadmap, pulling focus away from a sprawling layer-2-centric approach that has dominated Ethereum's strategy in recent years. The shift reflects doubling down on fragmented ecosystems to focus on usability and coherence.



Taken together, the comments highlight a broader recalibration underway across the industry: as prices fall, industry leaders are doubling down that the technology underpinning all of this still has its purpose.

Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest publicly traded corporate holder of bitcoin BTC$65,689.32, is seeing a quick rise in losses on its vast holdings.

The company currently owns 713,502 BTC at an average acquisition price of $76,052. With spot bitcoin trading near $67,000, this represents an unrealized loss of almost $6.5 billion, or roughly 12% relative to that average cost basis.

MSTR shares are down about 13% on the day, making Thursday the largest single-day decline in nearly one year. The stock's now down 66% year-over-year and nearly 80% from a record high reached shortly after Donald Trump's election victory in November 2024.

Despite that massive drawdown, Strategy continues to trade at a modest premium to the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet, known in the trade as an mNAV (multiple of net asset value) greater than one — it's currently about 1.09. This suggests that Michael Saylor and team have the capacity to continue issuing common stock with which to purchase additional bitcoin, without the move being dilutive to shareholders.

The company reports its fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday evening. No surprises are expected in the results, but investors will surely be interested to see what Saylor has to say, given the current market panic.

Meanwhile, STRC, Strategy's perpetual preferred equity instrument, marketed as a high-yield, high-credit, money-market-style product, is trading around $95, below its $100 par value. If STRC fails to recover to par by month's end, the dividend rate is expected to step up by an additional 25 basis points to 11.5%.

The only other comparable perpetual preferred equity currently trading is Strive's (ASST) SATA, which is down roughly 4% at $86 and would also likely require a dividend increase to return to par. Strive's common equity, ASST, is down approximately 11% on the day, trading near $0.52 per share.","{'href': 'https://www.coindesk.com', 'title': 'CoinDesk'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin slid under the $68,000 level in U.S. morning hours Thursday, extending a week-long selloff that has tracked weakness across global risk assets and deepened concerns about near-term downside.

Crypto liquidations exceeded $1 billion over the past 24 hours, wiping out about $980 million in bullish leveraged bets as the slide forced traders to close positions they could no longer keep funded.

The price fell below $70,000 earlier in the day, with liquidity heatmaps pointing to further downside.

Liquidity thins out quickly until just under $70,000, per Coinglass data, at which point another smaller cluster appears. That makes $70,000 a mechanically important level. If price pushes cleanly through it, there's less forced buying from liquidations to slow the move, raising the risk of a faster flush toward the high $60,000s.

A liquidation heatmap shows where leveraged traders are most likely to be forced out. Bright bands mark price levels with many estimated liquidation points, which can act as short-term magnets for price moves. Traders use it to spot crowded zones and likely volatility pockets, not exact turning points.Silver's renewed plunge and broader deleveraging across macro trades have added to risk-off positioning, with crypto increasingly trading as part of the same liquidity-driven complex.

The $60,000 zone has recently popped up as a potential entry point. As CoinDesk previously reported, bitcoin's 200-week moving average (WMA) has historically acted as a bottom signal in every previous cycle for the largest cryptocurrency. Currently, it is sitting around at $57,926.

Read more: Bitcoin can still fall further. Historical data shows $60,000 will be the bottom

Meanwhile, prediction markets are also signaling a shift in sentiment. On Polymarket, contracts tied to bitcoin's 2026 price outcomes now skew toward lower levels, with traders assigning the highest probability to prices at or below $65,000.

Odds for deeper drawdowns into the mid-$50,000 range have climbed in recent days, while expectations for six-figure prices have faded sharply from January highs.

Flows data points to similar caution. US-listed spot bitcoin ETFs have logged net outflows this week, while activity in perpetual futures has thinned as leverage is reduced.

Some market participants still view the $68,000 to $70,000 zone as a key technical area, citing heavy prior trading activity and long-term holder cost bases clustered nearby. 

A sustained break below that range could open the door to a deeper consolidation phase, echoing prior post-rally drawdowns.

NASA's next space suit for Artemis has out-of-this-world mobility

Astronauts are flying to the moon for the first time since 1972, and scientists are preparing specialized space suits for the next milestone—landing there

Launching as early as March for a long-planned there-and-back lunar flyby, NASA's Artemis II mission will bring four astronauts closer to the moon than any humans have been in more than 50 years. Merely traveling so far from Earth is a feat all its own, but the mission is in some ways already overshadowed by its planned follow-up, Artemis III, which is meant to take crew members to the moon's surface to kick off a new, 21st-century era of lunar science and exploration. Of the many obstacles to overcome before any Artemis astronauts begin moonwalking, perhaps the most simple yet significant is figuring out what to wear.

A space suit isn't so much an outfit as an anthropomorphic spacecraft. One designed for lunar surface operations must protect astronauts from perilous cosmic radiation, extreme temperatures, lung-clogging moon dust and the harsh vacuum of space. It must also carry its own supply of air, as well as water for cooling (and the occasional sip), while also having room for carrying equipment astronauts might need while in orbit or exploring other worlds. Designing a suit that meets all these needs without significantly limiting movement and functionality is an extremely difficult task. But the arduous effort may be essential for achieving longer stays in deep space—as well as building the lunar space station and surface outposts envisioned for future Artemis missions.

Axiom Space, a U.S.-based space infrastructure company, has been developing a space suit for the Artemis III mission since 2022. In 2024 the company unveiled its official design for the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AxEMU); tests of the suit are ongoing. The bulky white suit looks, in many ways, very similar to previous generations of NASA space suits. But beneath the surface, new technology promises Artemis astronauts mobility on the moon that their Apollo-era forebears could only dream about.

“It's really pushing the limits of material science,” says Paul Spana, a curator and director of collections at the Space Center Houston museum. “There's going to be a lot of new things introduced for the new suit that will be used for moonwalking on Artemis III.”

Like the original Apollo space suits, the AxEMU has been built with the moon's unique conditions in mind. Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin has described the landscape of that mission's near-equatorial exploration site as one of “magnificent desolation,” with a nonexistent atmosphere, dust all around and temperatures that swing between hotter and colder than anyone could experience—or endure—on Earth. Around the moon's south pole, where Artemis astronauts will be headed, conditions the new suit must withstand could be even more extreme.

“This region presents unique challenges including steeper terrain, extreme temperatures and prolonged periods of light and darkness—conditions far harsher than those faced by Apollo astronauts at the lunar equator,” says Victoria Ugalde, a NASA spokesperson. “The space suit will also need to function across different landers, rovers and spacecraft.”

To prepare for this desolation, the new suit has robust temperature regulation and is scratch-resistant to reduce damage from jagged rocks and abrasive dust. The biggest change, though, is in its flexibility. Whereas Apollo space suits were akin to wearing an inflated balloon that greatly hindered motion, the AxEMU is designed with flexible joints that give astronauts mobility to kneel, jog or even do the splits. Besides allowing space-suit-clad astronauts to fit within multiple different vehicles, the AxEMU's enhanced range of motion should also make working on the lunar surface easier.

The new suit's unique joints are shaping up to be a major advancement over previous space suits, but the AxEMU's relatively high weight is still a cause for concern. Axiom Space has not revealed the exact weight of its new suit, but it is more than that of previous space suits, including the Apollo suits, which weighed nearly 200 pounds on Earth.

Even under the low gravity of the moon, wearing several hundred pounds still feels heavy and could even cause injuries, NASA astronaut and doctor Mike Barratt told Ars Technica—especially because astronauts are likely to also be toting tools and equipment during lengthy surface operations. Experts say the suit's added weight is not ideal.

“Weight is always a key consideration in space suit design,” NASA's Ugalde says, but she adds that the agency maintains “extremely high confidence” that astronauts will be able to perform mission-necessary tasks when it comes time to don their suits and set foot on the moon. Then, when the Artemis III astronauts return, they will bring with them lessons about how the suit performs in situ, helping to bring forth an even more refined future generation of space suits.

“These lessons will shape future Artemis missions, expanding operating ranges and enhancing crew capabilities,” Ugalde says. “Every step builds toward NASA's goal of a sustained human presence on the moon as a stepping stone to Mars.”

These two habits are linked to more than a third of all cancer cases

More than one-third of cancer cases are preventable, a massive study finds

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

Nearly 40% of new cancer cases worldwide are potentially preventable, according to one of the first investigations of its kind, which analysed dozens of cancer types in almost 200 countries.

The study found that in 2022, roughly seven million cancer diagnoses were linked to modifiable risk factors — those that can be changed, controlled or managed to reduce the likelihood of developing the disease. Overall, tobacco smoking was the leading contributor to worldwide cancer cases, followed by infections and drinking alcohol. The findings suggest that avoiding such risk factors is “one of the most powerful ways that we can potentially reduce the future cancer burden”, says study co-author Hanna Fink, a cancer epidemiologist at the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France.

The study was published today in Nature Medicine.

Cancer continues to be a leading cause of illness and death worldwide, with cases expected to rise over the next decades if current trends continue. Previous studies have estimated that around 44% of global cancer deaths can be attributed to avoidable or controllable causes. Estimates of preventability have mainly focused on the number of deaths rather than cases and have mostly investigated a single risk factor, says Fink.

To address this gap, Fink and her colleagues examined global case data from 2022 for 36 different cancers across 185 countries. The study included 30 modifiable risk factors that are well-established causes of cancer — such as tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and infections.

The researchers combined this information with data from 2012 that captured people's exposure to each risk factor. Fink and her colleagues then estimated the proportion of cases that were directly linked to each risk factor.

In 2022, there were a total of 18.7 million new cancer cases worldwide. Roughly 38% — or 7.1 million — of these cases could be attributed to avoidable causes. Globally, tobacco smoking was the leading contributor, accounting for around 15% of preventable cases. This was followed by infections (10%) and drinking alcohol (3%). Lung, stomach and cervical cancers made up nearly half of all preventable cancer cases.

Around 30% of the 9.2 million new cases in women were preventable. More than 11% of these were associated with infections, such as those caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) — the leading cause of cervical cancer. Most of these cases occurred in low- and middle-income regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where cervical cancer rates are highest. Meanwhile, smoking was the dominant cause of cancer among women in high-income regions, including North America and most of Europe.

Globally, smoking was the biggest risk factor for men, accounting for almost one-quarter of the 4.3 million preventable cancer cases. It remained the leading cause of cancer in men living in both low- and high-income regions. Infections ranked second — mostly occurring in parts of Africa, Asia and South America — followed by drinking alcohol.

The study is a “fine piece of work” that signals the need to double down on cancer control efforts, says David Whiteman, a medical epidemiologist at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane, Australia. He adds that the comprehensive data set will make it easier for researchers to make reliable comparisons between regions.

Fink hopes the findings will be used to develop cancer-prevention strategies on the basis of the biggest risk factors in different regions for men and women. “It's not a one-size-fits-all approach,” she says.

These kinds of risks can only be _consented to_ by technical people who correctly understand them, let alone borne by them, but if this shipped there would be thousands of Facebook videos explaining to the elderly how to disable the safety features and open themselves up to identity theft.The article also confuses me because Apple _are_ shipping this, it's pretty much exactly the demo they gave at WWDC24, it's just delayed while they iron this out (if that is at all possible). By all accounts it might ship as early as next week in the iOS 26.4 beta.[1]: https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/8/delaying-personalized-s...

There should exist something between ""don't allow anything without unlocking phone first"" and ""leave the phone unlocked for anyone to access"", like ""allow certain voice commands to be available to anyone even with phone locked""

For reading messages, IIRC it depends on whether you have text notification previews enabled on the lock screen (they don't document this anywhere that I can see.) The logic is that if you block people from seeing your texts from the lock screen without unlocking your device, Siri should be blocked from reading them too.Edit: Nope, you're right. I just enabled notification previews for Messages on the lock screen and Siri still requires an unlock. That's a bug. One of many, many, many Siri bugs that just sort of pile up over time.

You know that if your phone is stolen and it has any cards stored on them, they can be easily transferred to another phone and drained. Because your bank will send a confirmation code, and its still authorized, you will be held liable for that fraud.THe ""man in the street"" does not know that, and needs some level of decent safe defaults to avoid such fraud.

The one that kindof caught me off guard was asking ""hey siri, how long will it take me to get home?"" => ""You'll need to unlock your iPhone for that, but I don't recommend doing that while driving..."" => if you left your phone unattended at a bar and someone could figure out your home address w/o unlock....I'm kindof with you, maybe similar to AirTags and ""Trusted Locations"" there could be a middle ground of ""don't worry about exposing rough geolocation or summary PII"".  At home, in your car (connected to a known CarPlay), kindof an in-between ""Geo-Unlock""?

Apple probably realised they were hugely behind and then spent time hand wringing over whether they remained cautious or got into the brawl. And they decided to watch from the sidelines, buy in some tech, and see how it develops.So far that looks entirely reasonable as a decision. If Claude wins, for example, apple need only be sure Claude tools work on Mac to avoid losing users, and they can second-move once things are not so chaotic.

Apple doesn't take proven ones of anything. What they do is arrive at something proven from first principles. Everyone else did it faster because they borrowed, but Apple did it from scratch, with all the detail-oriented UX niceties that entails.This was more prevalent when Jobs was still around. Apple still has some of that philosophy at its core, but it's been eroding over time (for example with ""AI"" and now Liquid Ass). They still do their own QA, though, and so on. They're not copying the market, they have their own.

Allowing a stocastic dipshit to have unfettered access to your messages, photos location, passwords and payment info is not a good thing.We cannot protect against prompt attacks now, so why roll out something that will have complete control over all your private stuff when we know its horrifically insecure?

Yes of course someone could be socially engineered into downloading a malicious package, but that takes more effort, so whilst bad, is not an argument for removing all best security practices that have been rolled out to users in the last 5 years. what you are arguing for is a fundamentally unsafe OS that means no sensitive data can ever be safely stored there.You are arguing that a system that allows anyone to extract data if they send a reasonably well crafted prompt is just the same as someone willing installs a programme, goes into settings to turn off a safety function and bypasses at least two warning dialogues that are trying to stop them.if we translate this argument into say house building, your arguing that all railing and barriers to big drops are bad because people could just climb over them.

If they optimize their entire hardware line (iPhone, Watch, Mac Mini, Macbook) AI enhanced with local/remote LLM model, they will win big. Imagine someone running a business can manage their entire business with iPhone/Mac/iCloud without buying any other saas services (inventory, payments, customer service).

           people are buying Mac Minis specifically to run AI agents with computer use. They're setting up headless machines whose sole job is to automate their workflows. OpenClaw—the open-source framework that lets you run Claude, GPT-4, or whatever model you want to actually control your computer—has become the killer app for Mac hardware

That makes little sense. Buying mac mini would imply for the fused v-ram with the gpu capabilities, but then they're saying Claude/GPT-4 which don't have any gpu requirements.Is the author implying mac minis for the low power consumption?

I interact only with CC on the machine and watch what its doing, I haven't tried OpenClaw yet.Here's some workflows I've personally found valuable:- I have it read the ""Grocery"" Reminders list and find things I commonly buy every week and pre-populate the grocery list as a starting point. It only adds items that I haven't already added via Siri as the week goes on. For example, I might notice I've run out of cheese and I'll say ""Hey Siri, add cheese to grocery list"". The list is shared via iCloud Reminders app between my spouse and I.- Pre-CC, I wrote an OR-Tools python tool for ""solving"" the parenting time calendar. My ex and I work inconsistent schedules each month. Each month I was manually creating a calendar honoring requests, hard constraints, and attempting to balance custody 50/50. CC uses the MCPs to fetch the calendar events and review emails related to planning. It then structures everything as JSON as inputs to the optimizer. The optimizer runs with these inputs and spits out a few ""solutions"". I review the candidate solutions and select one. CC uses the MCP to add the solution to the calendar. This one saves me probably an hour every month.- CC uses an email MCP to fetch emails from my child's school and suggest events its found in the emails to add to the calendar.None of these are huge time savings on their own but the accumulation of reducing the time to complete these repetitive tasks has been awesome in my opinion. These are all things that most definitely would not have been worth automating with traditional dev work but since I can just dictate to CC for a few seconds and it has something that works a few minutes later it's become worthwhile.

It sounds to me like they still have the hardware, since — according to the article — ""Mac Minis are selling out everywhere."" What's the problem?

Being Apple is just a structural disadvantage. Everyone knows that open claw is not secure, and it's not like I blame the solo developer. He is just trying to get a new tool to market. But imagine that this got deployed by Apple and now all of your friends, parents and grandparents have it and implicitly trust it because Apple released it. Having it occasionally drain some bank accounts isn't going to cut it.This is not to say Apple isn't behind. But OpenClaw is doing stuff that even the AI labs aren't comfortable touching yet.

Even with the most advanced LLMs and even sandboxing there is always the risk of prompt injections and data extraction.Even if the AI can't directly upload data to the internet, or delete local data, there are always some ways to leak data. For example by crafting an email with the relevant text in white or invisible somewhere. The user clicks ""ok send"" from what they see, but still some data is leaked.Apple intelligence is based on a local model on the device, which is much more susceptible for prompt injections.

As long as the agent creates more than just text, it can leak data. If it can access the internet in any manner, it can leak data.The models are extremely creative and good at figuring out stuff, even circumventing safety measures that are not fully air tight. Most of the time they catch the deception, but in some very well crafted exploits they don't.

You're right on the liability front - Apple still won because everyone bought their hardware and their margins are insanely good. It's not that they're sitting by waiting to become irrelevant, they're playing the long game as they always do.

What if you don't want to trust your computer with all your email and bank accounts? This is still not a mass market product.The main problem I see here is that with restricted context AI is not able to do much. In order to see this kind of ""magic"" you have to give it all the access.This is neither safe or acceptable for normie customers

If Peter Steinberger is able to generate even a 100M this year from Clawdbot what he has is a multi billion dollar business that would be life-changing even for a successful entrepreneur like him who is already a multi-millionaire. If it collapses from the security flaws, and other potential safety issues he loses nothing, starting from zero and going back to it. Peter Steinberger (and startups in general) have a lot to gain and very little or close to nothing to lose.The iPhone generated 400B in revenue for Apple in 2025. Clawdbot even if it contributes 4B in revenue this very year would not move the needle much for Apple. On the contrary, if Apple rushes and botches releasing something like this they might just collapse this 400B/annum income stream. Apple and other large enterprises (and their execs) have a lot to lose and very little to gain from rushing into something like this.

However this does not excuse Apple to sit with their thumbs up their asses for all these years.

reply

They've been wildly successful for all of those years. They've never been in the novel software business. Siri though one could argue was neglected, but it was also neglected at Amazon Alexa and Google home stuff still sucks too (mostly because none of them made any money and most of their big ideas for voice assistants never came true).

reply

The key thing is that they tend not to ship things which aren't mature enough to be useful (Vision Pro and Apple Intelligence being cautionary tales about why) and voice assistants just aren't doing a whole lot for anyone. Google and Amazon have been struggling to find a market, too, and it's rare to find someone who uses those dramatically more than Apple users do Siri. I think most of the big advances need something close to AGI: if you can't describe something in a short command, it's usually much faster to use a device with a screen and a lot of the useful tasks need a level of security and reliability which requires actual reasoning to deliver.

I don't pretend to know the future (nor do I believe anyone else who claims to be able to), but I think the opposite has a good chance of happening too, and hype would die down over ""AI"" and the bubble bursts, and the current overvaluation (imo at least. I still think it is useful as a tool, but overhyped by many who don't understand it.) will be corrected by the market; and people will look back and see it as the moment that Apple dodged a bullet. (Or more realistically, won't think about it at all).I know you can't directly compare different situations, but I wonder if comparisons can be made with dot-com bubble. There was such hype some 20-30 years ago, with claims of just being a year or two away from, ""being able to watch TV over the internet"" or ""do your shopping on the web"" or ""have real-time video calls online"", which did eventually come true, but only much, much, later, after a crash from inflated expectations and a slower steady growth.** Not that I think some claims about ""AI"" will ever come true though, especially the more outlandish ones such as full-length movies made by a prompt of the same quality made by a Hollywood director.I don't know what a potential ""breaking point"" would be for ""AI"". Perhaps a major security breach, even _worse_ prices for computer hardware than it is now, politics, a major international incident, environmental impact being made more apparent, companies starting to more aggressively monetize their ""AI"", consumers realising the limits of ""AI"", I have no idea. And perhaps I'm just wrong, and this is the age we live in now for the foreseeable future. After all, more than one of the things I have listed have already happened, and nothing happened.

This is my guess for the demand side: most people will drift away as the novelty wears off and they don't find it useful in their daily lives. It's more a ""fading point"" than a ""breaking point.""From the investment/speculation side: something will go dramatically against the narrative. OpenAI's attempted ""liquidity event"" of an IPO looks like WeWork as investors get a look at the numbers, Oracle implodes in a mountain of debt, NVidia cuts back on vendor financing and some major public players (e.g. Coreweave) die in a fire. This one will be a ""breaking point.""

Nah if they are actually out of stock (I've only seen it out of stock at exceptional Microcenter prices; Apple is more than happy to sell you at full price) it is because there's a transition to M5 and they want to clear the old stock. OpenClaw is likely a very small portion of the actual Mac mini market, unless you are living in a very dense tech area like San Francisco.One thing of note that people may forget is that the models were not that great just a year ago, so we need to give it time before counting chickens.

This is because the simple reality of this new technology is that this is not the local maxima. Any supposed wall you attempt to put up will fail - real estate website closes its API? Fine, a CUA+VLM will make it trivial to navigate/extract/use. We will finally get back to the right solution of protocols over platforms, file over app, local over cloud or you know the way things were when tech was good.P.S: You should immediately call BS when you see outrageous and patently untrue claims like ""Mac minis are sold out all over.."" - I checked my Best Buy in the heart of SF and they have stock. Or ""that its all over Reddit, HN"" - the only thing that is all over Reddit is unanimous derision towards OpenClaw and its security nightmares.Utterly hate the old world mentality in this post. Looked up the author and ofcourse, he's from VC.

OpenClaw is a symbol of everything that's wrong with AI, the same way that shitty memecoins with teams that rugpull you, or blockchain-adjacent centralized ""give us your money and we pinky swear we are responsible"" are a symbol of everything wrong with Web3.Giving everyone GPU compute power and open source models to use it is like giving everyone their own Wuhan Gain of Function Lab and hoping it'll be fine. Um, the probability of NO ONE developing bad things with AI goes to 0 as more people have it. Here's the problem: with distributed unstoppable compute, even ONE virus or bacterium escaping will be bad (as we've seen with the coronavirus for instance, smallpox or the black plague, etc.) And here we're talking about far more active and adaptable swarms of viruses that coordinate and can wreak havoc at unlimited scale.As long as countries operate on the principle of competition instead of cooperation, we will race towards disaster. The horse will have left the barn very shortly, as open source models running on dark compute will begin to power swarms of bots to be unstoppable advanced persistent threats (as I've been warning for years).Gain-of-function research on viruses is the closest thing I can think of that's as reckless. And at least there, the labs were super isolated and locked down. This is like giving everyone their own lab to make designer viruses, and hoping that we'll have thousands of vaccines out in time to prevent a worldwide catastrophe from thousands of global persistent viruses. We're simply headed towards a nearly 100% likely disaster if we don't stop this.If I had my way, AI would only run in locked-down environments and we'd just use inert artifacts it produces. This is good enough for just about all the innovations we need, including for medical breakthroughs and much more. We know where the compute is. We can see it from space. Lawmakers still have a brief window to keep it that way before the genie cannot be put back into the bottle.A decade ago, I really thought AI would be responsible developed like this: https://nautil.us/the-last-invention-of-man-236814/ I still remember the quaint time when OpenAI and other companies promised they'd vet models really strongly before releasing them or letting them use the internet. That was... 2 years ago. It was considered an existential risk. No one is talking about that now. MCP just recently was the new hotness.I wasn't going to get too involved with building AI platforms but I'm diving in and a month from now I will release an alternative to OpenClaw that actually shows the way how things are supposed to go. It involves completely locked-down environments, with reproducible TEE bases and hashes of all models, and even deterministic AI so we can prove to each other the provenance of each output all the way down to the history of the prompts and input images. I've already filed two provisional patents on both of these and I'm going to implement it myself (not an NPE).

Based on their homepage the project is two months old and the guy described it as something he ""hacked together over a weekend project"" [1] and published it on github. So this is very much the Raspberry Pi crowd coming up with crazy ideas and most of them probably don't work well, but the potential excites them enough to dabble in risky areas.[1] https://openclaw.ai/blog/introducing-openclaw

Valve has now confirmed our worst fears: all of the Steam hardware—Steam Machine, Steam Frame VR headset, and Steam Controller—it announced in November is delayed by a few months because of the creeping influence of the ongoing memory shortage.

In a post on the official Steam Hardware Blog, Valve said it needs to “revisit” pricing for all three devices, especially the Steam Machine hybrid PC/console and Steam Frame VR headset. Alas, “the limited availability and growing prices of these critical components,” namely RAM and SSD storage, have rapidly increased from only a few months ago. The company still promises to ship in the first half of the year. AMD CEO Lisa Su also confirmed the Steam Machine would arrive early this year.

This news shouldn't come as a shock if you've been following the rapid price fluctuations of practically all PC components that use memory. Modern high-end DRAM (dynamic random access memory) now costs 500% more than it did a few months ago, in some cases. SSDs, aka solid-state drives, have seen prices increase regularly since the start of the year. The memory issue has also impacted the discrete GPU market, especially Nvidia's latest 50-series graphics cards.

“Our goal of shipping all three products in the first half of the year has not changed,” the company wrote in its blog post. “But we have work to do to land on concrete pricing and launch dates that we can confidently announce, being mindful of how quickly the circumstances around both of those things can change.”

Valve has only hinted at a possible price, telling some outlets it would position the Steam Machine close to the “entry-level PC space.” That would have indicated a price of around $700 or even $800, at least. As for performance, Valve reiterated in its blog post that the Steam Machine should be able to handle “the majority of Steam titles” at 4K and 60 fps while relying on AMD's FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution) upscaling technology. This wouldn't be the fabled FSR Redstone, unfortunately, since the “semi-custom” AMD chip on the Steam Machine is based on the RDNA 3.5 GPU microarchitecture, rather than the more recent RDNA 4. Some games may run better if you push FSR to render games at a 1080p resolution before bringing it to 4K.

Meanwhile, a 5-year-old Sony PlayStation 5 console now costs $500 without the disc drive. In its latest quarterly earnings report, Sony indicated it may be able to wait out the first year of the RAM shortage. Sony's chief financial officer, Lin Tao, said the company was “already in a position” to secure the necessary RAM needed to last through the 2026 holiday season. Tao added that “we intend to minimize the impact of the increased memory cost on this segment going forward.”

The benefit of a Steam Machine over a traditional console is the customizability. You will be able to replace the RAM and SSD, though the big improvement will be access to a wide SteamOS development community allowing players to install non-Steam games, mods, and emulators without much fuss. The benefit of having dedicated hardware means Valve can work to increase performance across all systems. In its FAQ, Valve said, “We are working on HDMI VRR, investigating improved upscaling, and optimizing ray tracing performance in the driver.”

As long as Valve can promise a minimum acceptable performance for most modern games, the Steam Machine may still make more sense to prospective gaming PC buyers as a cheaper alternative to buying over-inflated PC components. Knowing the skyrocketing price of RAM, the everyday console buyer may find Valve's 6 x 6-inch gaming machine is still out of reach.

As Tesla begins its sudden pivot from an EV firm to a robotics and AI company, it's building out the supply chain it will need to reach its lofty goals of affordable humanoid robots that are manufactured at a rapid pace. But the scale of its production ambitions means it will need to rely heavily on the supply of raw materials, components, and manufacturing labor from China, as SCMP reports.

Tesla has a strong standing relationship with China, with its own Shanghai production facility that employs 20,000 people. It also sources many of the batteries for its vehicles from Chinese suppliers, and uses lots of raw materials in vehicle production sourced from China. China is also a major buyer of its vehicles, with over a third of all its sales in 2025 coming from China.

But the United States and China have spent the last year erecting and tearing down trade barriers. From America's side, the economic muscle came from its access to cutting-edge graphics cards and other chips used for AI training and inference. China's strength came from its manufacturing industry and access to raw materials, often termed ""rare earths.""

Although both are necessary for the AI industry to flourish, the ratio is much more lopsided when it comes to robotics. The ""brain"" of a humanoid robot will always demand impressive processing power and benefit from advanced AI software; the robots themselves demand an awful lot of critical materials. Many of those materials are mostly found in China.

While Chinese manufacturing and supply dominance affects all industries that produce just about everything, the scale of critical materials and manufacturing know-how necessary for next-generation robotics makes companies like Tesla incredibly dependent on the country.

Robots are complicated in ways that silicon and semiconductors aren't. Where chips are intricate and minute, and need clean room fabrication and specialized design software to even conceive of how they could be made, robots are decidedly more physical. Sure, they're technically advanced, but they're also made with iron, titanium, nickel, chromium, copper, and manganese. They use actuators, motors, bearings, and lubricants.

In short, they need a lot of stuff to make them, and a lot of that stuff comes primarily from China. Although key materials like Beryllium and Boron have strong supply chains within the U.S., China dominates the global supply of critical materials like Gallium (94%!), Zinc, Neodymium, Molybdenum, Indium, and Praseodymium, to name just a few.

It's not just the raw materials under the ground that's important, though. It's the expertise to extract it, the processing facilities to make it usable, and the logistical infrastructure required to get it where it needs to go.

“With about 50 to 70 per cent of manufacturing and core component production expertise residing in China, we expect Chinese players to take on greater roles in the global humanoid robot supply chain,” said Cheng Xin, a partner at US consultancy Bain & Co. “In some core components … they accounted for at least 55 per cent of the global humanoid robot bill of materials (BOM).”

China has enormous control over the supply of almost everything Tesla needs to build its next generation of humanoid robots. That puts it in an incredibly strong position, with the ability to curtail Tesla's ambitions whenever it likes.

Unfortunately for Tesla, this has already happened. In April last year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk complained that a Chinese block on exporting ""rare-earth magnets"" had impacted production of the Tesla Optimus robot. He was forced to ask for a license to use them - perhaps an in-person visit would have helped.

China took all rare earth mineral resources within its borders under state ownership in the fall of 2024, so its leadership has the top-down control necessary to maintain tight controls on the supply of these kinds of critical materials well into the future. Although it has cut that supply outright to the U.S. several times during the ongoing trade negotiations with the Trump administration, it has since begun issuing limited export licenses to some companies.

The American government is aware of this chokepoint in its supply of such critical materials - many of which are also important for national security and the production of cutting-edge silicon - and is attempting to develop a new stockpile to provide a buffer against China's dominance. But even that $12 billion investment would only amount to a 60-day reserve, and its focus is on providing the necessary materials for civilian needs. In such a scenario where access to raw materials was cut off, Tesla would be forced to compete with many other firms and organizations that need those same materials.

Even beyond the risk of mercurial leadership threatening trade relations, China also has its own domestic humanoid robotics industry to consider. There are over 100 Chinese companies currently working on designs, and Chinese officials are making moves to centralize their development to accelerate progress and cut down on parallel research.

Chinese companies are already shipping consumer-grade robots, with over 13,000 deployed in 2025 alone. That's years of production ahead of the several hundred prototype Optimus models Tesla has made.

Just as BYD has overtaken Tesla in the EV space, China seems almost destined to get a huge head start in humanoid robotics over Western companies like Tesla. It already has more units in the world, its production is already higher, its access to key technologies and raw materials is better, and on tap.

Everything is close, efficient, and available. That's not something Tesla or other Western robotics firms can match.

And if China ever needed to slow down the competition, it could turn the tap off for those same supplies that are much harder to find anywhere else. Even if that didn't halt progression elsewhere, it would have a huge effect on pricing.

With Tesla hoping to get its Optimus down to $30,000 per unit in the future, the realization of that dream may be more down to China's whim than anything else.

Edited by Zeel Mehta

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended the CardioMEMS HF System (Abbott) for routine use in England for adults with chronic heart failure at risk for hospital admission. 

The wireless sensor, roughly the size of a paperclip, is permanently implanted in the distal pulmonary artery. It enables home monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure, allowing clinicians to detect early signs of deterioration and intervene before symptoms escalate into emergencies.

Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump blood efficiently around the body. Common symptoms including breathlessness, fatigue, and swelling.

The condition affects around 920,000 people in the UK and accounts for approximately 1 million hospital bed days each year, representing about 2% of all NHS inpatient stays in England.

Heart failure costs the NHS an estimated £2 billion annually, with a substantial proportion of spending linked to repeated hospital admissions.

The system features a small pressure sensor implanted in the distal pulmonary artery via minimally invasive right heart catheterisation.

At home, patients lie on a specialised pillow containing an antenna and press a button to transmit daily pressure measurements wirelessly to a secure database. 

Healthcare teams can review pressure trends remotely and adjust medication early, often before patients experience symptoms, helping to prevent decompensation and hospitalisation.

“This technology offers a real opportunity to improve care for people living with chronic heart failure,” said Dr Anastasia Chalkidou, NICE's HealthTech programme director. “By enabling early detection and timely medication adjustments, it has the potential to reduce emergency admissions and help people manage their condition more effectively from home.”

The technology is indicated for adults with New York Heart Association class 3 heart failure who have previously been hospitalised and remain at risk of further admission. Patients, or their carers, must be able and willing to take regular measurements and adjust medication as directed.

NICE said the technology could help reduce health inequalities, particularly for people in rural or coastal areas who face long journeys for specialist care. Remote monitoring may also improve access to specialist heart failure services for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

However, patients with cognitive impairment, problems with manual dexterity, learning disabilities, or limited digital skills may need additional support from healthcare professionals, carers, or digital enablers to use the system effectively.

The recommendation is supported by a meta-analysis of three randomised controlled trials — CHAMPION, GUIDE-HF, and MONITOR-HF— including 1898 patients.

Across the studies, use of CardioMEMS was associated with a 34% reduction in heart failure hospital admissions compared with standard care, with a hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.58-0.86).

The device showed an acceptable safety profile. Implantation failure occurred in 1.7% of patients, and device-related complications were rare, at 0.7%. 

NICE concluded that the CardioMEMS system represents a cost-effective use of NHS resources.

Although the device costs around £9500, economic modelling showed that when NICE's preferred monitoring schedule is followed, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is £14,037 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, well below NICE's usual funding threshold.

The guidance aligns with the government's 10 Year Health Plan commitment to harness transformative technologies to shift care closer to home and reduce pressure on hospitals.

Traditionally, heart disease prevention has focused on individual risk factors, and treatment has focused solely on the patient. However, in recent decades, several psychosocial factors, such as poor mental health and social isolation, as well as positive social support, have been recognized as important predictors.

According to a study conducted in the US in 2024, while all sources of positive social relationships can protect against cardiovascular disease, partner support appears to be particularly important for predicting heart health.

“The couple-based approach, which involves actively integrating the partner into the therapeutic process, is not yet common practice, but we are increasingly trying to raise awareness of its importance,” said Diego Segura‑Rodríguez, MD, cardiologist at Hospital Universitario Clínico San Cecilio in Granada, Spain, and member of the Clinical Cardiology Association of the Spanish Society of Cardiology. He said the scientific evidence shows that the quality of intimate relationships influences cardiovascular health. We're not just talking about being in a relationship, but about the nature of that relationship in terms of support, affection, conflict resolution, and loneliness within the couple, he said.

He added, we know that a poor‑quality relationship is associated with more inflammation, worse blood pressure control, higher levels of hormonal stress, and poorer lifestyle habits. Conversely, a healthy relationship is associated with better treatment adherence, more exercise, a better diet, and a lower risk for cardiovascular events. The evidence in this area is solid and comparable in magnitude to classic factors such as smoking or a sedentary lifestyle.

A review evaluating the effectiveness of partner‑based interventions on modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac outcomes, mental health, and relationship quality in adults with diagnosed heart disease and their partners suggests that couple relationships could be a key piece in the puzzle of heart disease and recovery. This work brings to the table something that many cardiologists have already been considering in practice for years: the importance of the social component for each patient. When heart disease enters a couple's life, it can change roles, generate fear, affect dependence, and sometimes spark conflict. Treating only the patient is an incomplete view, Segura‑Rodríguez said.

In the 2024 study, of all randomized controlled trials that included cardiac patients and their partners, 12 met the inclusion criteria. However, as Segura‑Rodríguez pointed out, the included clinical trials together include 1444 patients and their partners, which is not an insignificant number for clinical research. It should be noted that the studies are highly heterogeneous in duration, type of intervention, conditions included and outcomes measured. Furthermore, many are older and have modest sample sizes.

Segura‑Rodríguez acknowledged that the conclusions cannot be considered 100% conclusive, especially regarding major outcomes such as heart attacks, readmissions, or mortality. What they do allow, however, is a solid claim that these interventions improve health behaviors such as exercise, medication adherence, smoking cessation and have clinical potential.

Although, as the authors themselves acknowledge, the review showed that some cardiovascular outcomes, such as lipid profiles and healthcare utilization, improved, the findings were inconsistent. Furthermore, none of the three studies that evaluated the reference questionnaire found significant improvements. Nevertheless, the researchers insist on highlighting the potential of couple‑based interventions to improve healthy habits and coping with heart disease among patients and their partners.

“I think it's a reasonable approach, although it should be used with caution and considered on a couple-by-couple basis. The fact that the studies did not find significant improvements in relationship quality does not mean the approach is not useful, but rather that the interventions evaluated were not truly aimed at improving the relationship,” Segura‑Rodríguez said. He added, “The studies nonetheless show consistently that working with the partner improves health habits, which are at the heart of secondary prevention: moving more, taking medication correctly, eating better, and quitting smoking. That alone is a very important clinical benefit.”

As the study concludes, while a stepped-care model of in cardiac rehabilitation can help tailor interventions to the specific needs of couples, future research should include emotional and relational components, underserved populations, validated relationship measures, and assessments of outcomes in both patients and partners. 

“At our hospital, partners are allowed to attend educational sessions or talks, but a formal structure that addresses relationship dynamics, communication, and joint coping with the disease has yet to be defined. In Spain, this tends to depend on the sensitivity of the team, although this inertia is gradually changing,” Segura‑Rodríguez said. He explained that including the partner does not mean turning cardiology into couples therapy, but recognizing the relationship as a fundamental “therapeutic context.” In the early stages, shared education and structured support may suffice, and in more complex cases, specific interventions should be considered.

From his perspective, the future, or rather, the present, of cardiac rehabilitation lies in being more humane and holistic, considering the patient and their environment. It's not just about restoring hearts but also about nurturing relationships. After all, recovery also means learning to live together again with a chronic disease.

The authors declared having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Among allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, the use of sirolimus for graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was linked to a higher risk for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, whereas higher serum neutralizing antibody levels were linked to a lower risk within the first 100 days post-transplant.

“The demonstration of serum neutralizing antibody levels as an inverse correlate of risk in this present study has implications for enabling clinical trials and immunobridging studies of vaccines and mAbs [monoclonal antibodies] in HCT [hematopoietic cell transplant] recipients and other immunocompromised populations,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Sara Pernikoff, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle. It was published online on January 20, 2026, in Open Forum Infectious Diseases.

This study had a small sample size. Findings from recipients who underwent transplantation in 2005-2010 may not apply to current recipients as clinical practices have evolved over time. Additionally, antibody assays for participants with RSV infection and control participants were conducted separately.

This study was supported by multiple sources, including a New Investigator Award from the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the Amy Strelzer Manasevit Award from the National Marrow Donor Program, and grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Several authors disclosed receiving research support and consulting fees from various pharmaceutical companies. One author was an inventor on patents related to RSV antibodies.

New research suggests the liver plays a previously unrecognized role in bone health, but only in males.

A McGill University-led study published in Matrix Biology found that a protein made in the liver helps regulate bone growth in male mice, but not in females. The findings may help explain why men with liver disease are more likely to experience bone loss.

The protein, known as plasma fibronectin, is naturally present in blood at higher levels in men than in women, declines when the liver is damaged and builds up in bone to modulate bone formation. This suggests men rely more heavily on the protein to maintain bone strength than do women.

About 60 per cent of osteoporosis cases in men are secondary to other underlying health conditions. Our findings suggest this protein may be one of the biological links connecting liver disease to bone loss.""

Mari Tuulia Kaartinen, Senior Author, Associate Professor in McGill's Faculty of Dental Medicine and Oral Health Sciences

Osteoporosis has traditionally been viewed as a disease driven by aging and processes within the bone itself, and it has been more commonly associated with women. At least one in three women and one in five men will break a bone due to osteoporosis in their lifetime.

""We know women lose bone mass largely because of hormonal changes at menopause, but men lose bone too, especially after age 50, but the reasons have been less understood,"" said Kaartinen.

In lab experiments, the researchers selectively turned off the fibronectin gene in the liver, preventing the protein from releasing into the bloodstream. Only male mice were less able to build strong bone when the protein was missing.

""This is another example of how diseases can develop differently between the sexes,"" said Kaartinen. ""Better accounting for biological differences in medical research is essential for developing more precise approaches to prevention and care.""

More broadly, the findings add to a growing awareness of osteoporosis as a whole-body condition rather than one that originates in bone alone, she added.

Global cholera vaccine supply has now increased to a level sufficient to allow the resumption of life-saving preventive campaigns for the first time in over three years, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF, and the World Health Organization (WHO) announced today.

Mozambique is the first country to restart preventive vaccination, following the halt in 2022 caused by the global surge in cholera cases that drove up demand and led to shortages of oral cholera vaccine (OCV) stocks.

The preventive vaccination campaign begins amid an ongoing cholera outbreak and the aftermath of floods that affected more than 700 000 people and displaced many. The floods disrupted health systems and damaged water systems, further increasing the risk of waterborne diseases such as cholera.

Global vaccine shortages forced us into a cycle of reacting to cholera outbreaks instead of preventing them. We are now in a stronger position to break that cycle. I thank EUBiologics, currently the only manufacturer producing cholera vaccines at the scale needed for mass vaccination campaigns, for its efforts, and urge others to enter this vital space. These vaccines will save lives.""

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General

A first allocation of 20 million doses is being deployed for preventive campaigns. Of these, 3.6 million doses were delivered to Mozambique; 6.1 million to the Democratic Republic of the Congo that is also experiencing significant outbreaks; and 10.3 million doses are planned for delivery to Bangladesh.

Following sustained efforts by global agencies, manufacturers and partners, annual global supply of OCV has doubled from 35 million doses in 2022 to nearly 70 million doses in 2025. The doses are being financed by Gavi, and procured and delivered to countries by UNICEF.

""The multi-year surge in cholera cases and resulting unprecedented demand for vaccines were stark reminders that sustainable, accessible vaccine supply is a global public good – and the world cannot afford complacency,"" said Dr Sania Nishtar, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. ""We are grateful to our partners and manufacturers, particularly EUBiologics, for the collaboration that has made the resumption of these essential preventive campaigns possible, and to Gavi's donors, whose support enables us to finance the global OCV stockpile and life-saving outbreak and preventive campaigns.""

""For the first time in years, this increase in vaccines will allow us to better prevent large-scale cholera emergencies,"" said Catherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director. ""Resuming preventive cholera vaccination will protect children and help stop this highly contagious disease in its tracks. But it must go hand in hand with other efforts, including better access to safe water and basic sanitation.""

The three countries were chosen based on allocation criteria set out by the Global Task Force for Cholera Control (GTFCC), a partnership of over 50 organizations, to ensure cholera vaccines for preventive campaigns are distributed systematically, equitably and transparently.

""This milestone shows the power of bringing together diverse partners to build a more reliable response to cholera. Preventive vaccination helps shield communities and buys critical time. However, lasting progress will depend on long‑term investment in infrastructure, for which political commitment is indispensable,"" said Dr Ilesh Jani, chair of the Steering Committee of the GTFCC.

The restoration of preventive vaccination has been made possible by years of sustained efforts and close collaboration among agencies, manufacturers, and other partners to meet the continued high demand to respond to outbreaks, expand production capacity and streamline allocation, ensuring that limited supplies reach the places where the risk and public health impact are greatest.

The OCV is safe and effective and is recommended for individuals over 1 year of age. One dose of OCV provides short-term protection for at least 6 months and can help bring outbreaks under control, while two doses provide protection against infection for longer - 3 years.

While global vaccine supply steadily improves, the one-dose strategy will remain the standard for outbreak responses, with the use of two doses considered on a case-by-case basis.

Cholera spreads through contaminated food and water, causing severe diarrhoea and dehydration. It can lead to death if it is not treated quickly. It is found in places without safe water and sanitation, mainly in localities affected by conflict and poverty.

More than 600 000 cases of cholera or acute watery diarrhoea and nearly 7600 deaths were reported to WHO from 33 countries last year, although these are underestimates as cholera remains underreported. Since 2021, global cholera cases have risen year after year, with a decline observed in 2025. Cholera deaths, however, have continued to increase over the same period.

Vaccination is only one aspect of cholera prevention and response. Long-term investments in safe water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure, alongside disease surveillance, rapid treatment and community engagement, remain essential to prevent outbreaks from starting and spreading, and to reduce deaths in the long term.

A large cross-sectional study in the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior (JNEB), published by Elsevier, examined how psychosocial and environmental factors relate to diet quality among 2,420 adults living in rural and micropolitan communities in New York and Texas. Findings demonstrated that psychosocial factors, including healthy eating motivation, confidence in maintaining healthy eating habits, and social support from family and friends, were consistently associated with better diet quality.

Researchers also evaluated participants' perceptions of their local food environment, alongside measures of diet quality, fruit and vegetable intake, fiber intake, and ultraprocessed food consumption.

Participants with higher scores in these areas consumed more fruits, vegetables, and fiber, and fewer ultraprocessed foods. The availability of fresh fruits and vegetables in the community and the importance participants placed on food quality, price, and selection when choosing where to shop were also linked to healthier dietary intake.

On average, participants reported eating 2.6 cups of fruits and vegetables per day and 15 grams of fiber daily. These numbers are similar to national averages, but still below recommended intake levels. Nearly 40% of participants reported experiencing household food insecurity, and roughly half lived in households earning less than $50,000 per year.

These results reinforce the need for multifaceted approaches to improving nutrition. Rural adults face elevated risks for diet-related health conditions, yet nutrition behaviors in these communities are shaped by more than just access to food. Our findings highlight that motivation, confidence, and support for healthy eating — along with the local food environment — all play meaningful roles in shaping diet quality.""

Rebecca Seguin-Fowler, PhD, RDN, LD, CSCS, Lead Author, Associate Director, Institute for Advancing Health Through Agriculture, Texas A&M AgriLife Research, and Professor of Nutrition, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Texas A&M University

These findings emphasize the importance of nuanced approaches to improving nutrition in different rural communities. The authors call for future studies to evaluate how changes in psychosocial and environmental factors over time may influence dietary behavior across diverse populations.

People with ulcerative proctitis, a milder and more limited form of ulcerative colitis, are not at higher risk of developing rectal cancer than the general population. This is shown in a new Swedish registry study from Karolinska Institutet, published in Gastroenterology. The findings may contribute to more individualized follow-up of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

Ulcerative colitis has long been linked to an increased risk of cancer in the colon or rectum, but the risk varies depending on how widespread the inflammation is. For people with ulcerative proctitis, where the inflammation is limited to the rectum, the link with rectal cancer has been unclear. The new study now provides clearer information.

The researchers identified nearly 16,000 people in Sweden who had been diagnosed with isolated ulcerative proctitis between 1997 and 2023. These were compared with just over 158,000 people from the general population who did not have inflammatory bowel disease. By linking several national health registries, the participants could be followed for a median of over ten years.

The results show that the incidence of rectal cancer and precancerous lesions, known as high-grade dysplasia, was very low in both groups. After ten years of follow-up, approximately 0.2 percent of both the patient group and the comparison group had developed rectal cancer. The researchers also saw no increased risk of rectal cancer in patients who later developed more widespread colitis.

Our results are reassuring for patients with ulcerative proctitis. Despite long-term inflammation in the rectum, we see no increased risk of cancer compared to the general population.""

Åsa Hallqvist Everhov, senior physician in surgery and associate professor, Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Institute of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet, and first author of the study

""This supports a more individualized approach to cancer surveillance in inflammatory bowel disease, where the extent of the disease plays a crucial role,"" says Ola Olén, senior physician in pediatric gastroenterology and adjunct professor at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Institute of Medicine, Solna, Karolinska Institutet.

The study is based on prospective data from, among others, the national IBD registry SWIBREG, the Cancer Registry, and the Patient Registry. The research was funded by, among others, the Swedish Research Council, the Cancer Foundation, the Bengt Ihre Foundation, and ALF funds from Region Stockholm.

The Mexican state of Jalisco has issued a health alert and mandated face masks in schools due to a measles outbreak in the state capital

ZAPOPAN, Mexico -- The Mexican state of Jalisco on Thursday issued a health alert and mandated the use of face masks in schools as a measles outbreak hit the state capital, a key host city for the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The measures come on the heels of an epidemiological alert issued by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) earlier this week over the spread of the preventable disease across the Americas, particularly in Mexico, which leads the region with 1,981 cases confirmed by authorities this year and more than 5,200 suspected cases.

Jalisco is the epicenter of the outbreak, with 1,163 cases confirmed this year and 2,092 suspected cases, according to Mexico's government.

The measles outbreak in Mexico began last year in the northern state of Chihuahua, after a Mennonite child fell ill while visiting relatives in a region in Texas that was suffering an outbreak. Cases surged in Mennonite communities — which have high rates of vaccine hesitancy — and have rippled out across Mexico in the country's biggest outbreak in decades. Scientists say rising outbreaks across the hemisphere are linked to declining vaccination rates.

Jalisco health authorities announced Thursday that masks will be required in Guadalajara schools across seven specific neighborhoods for the next 30 days.

Jalisco was the first Mexican state to take such measures as medical groups urged the local government to take urgent action, marking the country's first such public health mandate since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Classes were also recently suspended in 15 schools in Jalisco and the central state of Aguascalientes due to outbreaks of the highly contagious airborne virus.

The outbreak comes as Mexico prepares to host visitors from across the world for the World Cup, which will be held simultaneously in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Guadalajara is one of the main venues in Mexico for the soccer tournament.

Canada lost its measles-free status in November and the U.S. and Mexico face the risk of meeting the same fate. Both governments have requested a two-month extension to try to control the outbreak, although in January the Trump administration withdrew from the World Health Organization, under whose umbrella PAHO operates.

In the first three weeks of this year, 1,031 additional measles cases were confirmed in seven countries in the Americas with no deaths reported — a figure 43 times higher than that recorded in the same period last year — PAHO said Wednesday in a statement.

The Mexican government has spent weeks encouraging the population to get vaccinated against the measles, which is preventable with two doses of the vaccine, and announced the launch of vaccination sites in places such as airports and bus stations.

500 million tickets were requested to attend the World Cup, according to FIFA. Seven matches will be played in Houston in June and July.

North America is four months away from what's being billed as the biggest sporting event in world history — and Houston is preparing to be one of the host cities.

FIFA previously announced that, starting Thursday, it will begin notifying the winners of its random selection ticket draw to get tickets to the World Cup. Houston's NRG Stadium will host seven of the international soccer matches in June and July.

After the random selection lottery ran from Dec. 11 to Jan. 13, FIFA will notify fans if they won the tickets of their choosing, whether it be all of the tickets they selected or just some.

FIFA has said it will notify the random winners of the draw by email ""no earlier than"" Feb. 5. Should fans acquire tickets, FIFA will begin automatically charging their listed credit cards on Feb. 9.

""We recommend regularly checking your inbox and spam folders and adding FIFA Ticketing's email address ... to your safe sender list to avoid missing important updates,"" FIFA's ticketing site reads.

Record-breaking demand

More than 500 million ticket requests were submitted for the World Cup, FIFA announced in January, ""setting a new benchmark for demand in the history of world sport,"" the organization said.

That averages to about 15 million ticket requests per day, across the 33-day application process.

RELATED: Houston could see 500,000 visitors for the World Cup, officials say

Aside from the three host countries — the United States, Mexico and Canada — most applications came from Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia. Germany and Portugal are among the teams that will play group-stage matches in Houston.

Most popular matches

Though Texas is hosting more matches than any other state between Houston and Dallas, none of the matches in Texas fall within the top five most-requested matches.

The most-requested match is Colombia vs. Portugal in Miami on June 27, according to FIFA.

Other popular matches are Mexico vs. South Korea (Guadalajara, June 18); the final match in New York (July 19); the opening match, Mexico vs. South Africa (Mexico City, June 11); and a round-of-32 match in Toronto on July 2.

Want to see the World Cup trophy?

Not only is the World Cup coming — the World Cup trophy is coming to North America. And it will go beyond just the host cities.

The World Cup trophy will come to Texas in April. The tour starts in Dallas from April 25-26; then moves to Austin from April 28-29; San Antonio on April 30; and Houston from May 2-3.

Your next shot at tickets

FIFA will have one final sale for World Cup tickets, beginning in early April, aptly labeled as their ""last-minute sales phase.""

At that point, tickets will go on sale on a first-come, first-served basis, like a traditional ticket sale.

Resale tickets are available on FIFA's website as well as third-party ticket sellers — at a hefty price. Some tickets are on sale for triple their listed price or more.

Arsenal have been handed a major boost ahead of the 2026 Carabao Cup final, with the EFL delivering its verdict on Manchester City's claims to seeing rules tweaked for January signing Marc Guehi. The Blues are being prevented from selecting the England international defender in domestic cup competition, and that will remain the case for a showpiece event at Wembley Stadium.

Guehi joined City from Premier League rivals Crystal Palace on January 19. That deal, which included a £20 million ($27m) fee being paid for a player that was due to become a free agent in the summer, was completed almost a week after Pep Guardiola's side secured a 2-0 first leg lead in their Carabao Cup semi-final clash with Newcastle.

EFL rules state that a player cannot play for two clubs in the competition if they transferred to the second team after the first leg of the semi-final stage. That was the case for Guehi, meaning that he sat out a 3-1 win over the Magpies at the Etihad Stadium - as City booked tickets to another major final.

The Blues had been hoping that rulemakers would agree to revise their regulations ahead of a trip to north London on March 22 - a contest that will see them lock horns with Premier League table-toppers Arsenal.

Guardiola said in the wake of a convincing victory over Newcastle, with a 5-1 aggregate success being enjoyed: “Hopefully we can convince the Carabao Cup that Marc can play the final. I don't understand why he cannot play the final.

“You buy a player for a lot of money and he is not able to play for a rule I don't understand. Hopefully they can change it. Antoine arrived before the first [leg] so could play. And now it's the final. Why should [Guehi] not play? We pay his salary, he is our player.”

Guardiola claimed it was “pure logic” to let Guehi line up against Arsenal. Another winter arrival, Ghana international forward Antoine Semenyo, is eligible to play as he joined the Blues from Bournemouth on January 9 and was on target in City's first leg win over Newcastle.

Standard Sport reports that, following consideration by the EFL, “there will be no rule change” and Guehi will therefore face Carabao Cup final frustration. He will be left watching on from the stands at the home of English football.

League Cup rules were changed this season to allow players to represent two different clubs in the competition. It has, however, been set in stone from the start that any transfers had to be completed before the second leg of semi-final fixtures.

Regulations state that: “6.4: A Registered player shall be permitted to play for up to two clubs (or clubs) in the competition in any one season where such player: Has appeared for his parent or loan club (or club) in the competition prior to the closure of the summer transfer window and has either been recalled by the parent club or subsequently moved to a different club (or club) on a temporary loan transfer (or temporary transfer where a Premier League club) or permanent transfer prior to the end of that summer transfer window.

“Or, has appeared for his parent or loan club in the competition prior to the closure of the winter transfer window or the first leg of the semi-final (whichever is sooner) and has either been recalled by the parent club or subsequently moved to a different club on a temporary loan transfer (or temporary transfer where a Premier League club) or permanent transfer prior to the closure of the winter transfer window, or the first leg of the semi-final (whichever is sooner). Or, such player moves on an emergency goalkeeper loan at any time during the season.”

GOAL ranks the top 25 players in MLS. And while No. 1 should be of little surprise, there is plenty of talent littered all over the league. 

Welcome to the ranking that will probably get this writer in trouble. Piecing together the top 25 players in MLS is a tricky thing. No. 1 should come as absolutely no surprise (folks: it's Messi). But it's everything in between where the debate really begins.

The issue is simple: there are a lot of very good players in this league right now, all impacting winning teams in very different ways. So these rankings are based on a bit of everything - the numbers, the eye test, and, yes, a little bit of what players actually mean.

Some housekeeping: players signed this offseason are not included (i.e. Timo Werner). Neither are deals that have yet to be fully announced (looking at you, Minnesota and James Rodríguez). Newer faces who made an immediate impact but saw their seasons cut short by injury also miss out - sorry, Wessam Abou Ali.

Other than that, here goes nothing…

You wanted a goalscorer? Baribo is about as clean as they come. The D.C. United striker was fantastic for Philadelphia Union last year, and led the Golden Boot race at one point. A late season slump took nothing away from his quality, and a big money move to Washington was entirely deserved from a player who still has a lot to offer.

Gil has been the constant in a mixed few years for the Revs. The attacking midfielder provides goals and assists wherever he plays, and has offered double-digit goal contributions in every full season he has played in MLS. He's 32, but his numbers are only improving for a Revolution side that may have turned a corner. 

Philip Zinckernagel quietly had one of the best seasons in MLS last year, managing 15 goals and 15 assists in his debut campaign in the league. This year, he might just be even better, especially with the Fire retooling over the offseason.

Musa was brought in on a big money deal in 2024, and settled into MLS nicely with 16 goals and three assists. And last year, he only improved, posting 18 and six. Dallas showed real improvement on the pitch, too - with Musa central to their efforts. 

Tverskov doesn't play sexy football, but he is immensely reliable. The Danish defensive midfielder anchored an excellent San Diego side, playing almost every minute for the expansion franchise - and dishing out eight assists along the way. 

White has quietly been a regular provider of goals since 2021, but hit new levels in 2025. He bagged 25 in all competitions last year, enough to earn him a USMNT look, and a shot at making Mauricio Pochettino's side for the World Cup. 

The Brazilian's production dropped off in an injury-marred 2025 season, but even then, his quality cannot be denied. He was vital in LA Galaxy's MLS Cup run in 2024, and, now fully fit, seems primed to return to form. A fit Pec is a scary proposition. 

Arfsten was linked with a move to Europe for a large portion of January, which would indicate just how handy he is at left back. Excellent going forward but always improving defensively, Arfsten has earned a spot in the USMNT setup - and will certainly be a solid backup when Pochettino's team takes the field this summer.

The 2025 campaign was the year Dayne St. Clair finally put it all together for Minnesota United. To be sure, he had been an excellent goalkeeper for some time, but last season he made headlines, coming up with crucial saves in big moments, and getting the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year nod that he thoroughly deserved. Since then, he has only challenged himself further by moving to Inter Miami. This year feels pivotal for the Canadian. 

It was an immense surprise to see Philadelphia offload Glesnes, who was among the best center backs in MLS last year. Tall, physcial, and tify with the ball at his feet, he bailed out the Union week in and week out. His best years may be behind him, but his three All Star nods and 2022 Defender of the Year acknowledgement prove that he is a true talent. 

Luna is certainly the most likable player in MLS, and a true advocate for his community. But he's also devastatingly good on the pitch. In 2025, he tallied double-digit goal contributions for the second year in a row and is on track to improve ahead of this season. 

Robinson returned from a devastating Achilles injury in style in 2024, and only improved the year after. Sure, there were a couple knocks, but he was vital for a very good Cincinnati defense, and played himself into the picture for the USMNT at the World Cup. And there's still plenty of soccer to come from a player named an All-Star last year. 

When fit, Puig is a top-three player in MLS, and there shouldn't really be a debate there. He was immense in 2024, leading LA Galaxy to an MLS Cup win that very few saw coming. But back-to-back ACL surgery leaves his career at a crossroads. Still, if he reaches full fitness again, the La Masia product shall certainly be right back among the league's best. 

What a year it was for the man whose USMNT call up was leaked by Thomas Muller. Sure, the Whitecaps' attack made headlines, but their defensive spine set everything up. Blackmon was the anchor of a Vancouver defense that conceded the fewest goals in the West in 2025. It was little surprise when he was named MLS Defender of the Year. 

The story goes that Nashville wanted Mukhtar to be their main man before they even existed. Indeed, they called him in 2019 to set everything up. And Mukhtar has never really looked back. He is the perennial presence for the reigning U.S. Open Cup champs, tallying 16 goals in MLS alone last year. He was also named an All-Star for the third season straight. 

Surridge is very good at doing one thing: scoring loads of goals. There are very few strikers in MLS with his raw finishing ability, and Nashville make pretty good use of it, too. He bagged 25 goals last year and was named an MVP finalist on the back of his best season in the league to date. 

Last season was the year in which Berhalter realized his potential in full. He had been reliable for Vancouver for a few years, but in 2025, the son of the former USMNT coach became the all-action midfielder he always could be. Those 12 assists - helped, no doubt, by his deadly set piece ability - don't look too bad, either. 

Roldan's performance in the Leagues Cup final against Inter Miami should be studied. The American midfielder was playing through an injury, yet still dominated the center of the park as the Sounders battered Messi and Co. He has been a mainstay for the Sounders since 2015, yet managed his first All-Star nod in 2025. It felt a lot like vindication for a player who has run the hard yards and can be considered nothing less than a club legend. 

Evander, more than anything, is immensely fun to watch. The kid who watched Ronaldinho in his formative years has brought a specific kind of flair to Major League Soccer. More of a devastating passer and shooter than a dribbler, the Brazilian is the perfect throwback No. 10 for a league that still allows them. Thirty-one goal contributions weren't a bad start to life in Cincinnati, either. 

Bouanga was a masterstroke of a signing when LAFC brought him in a few years ago. And in his third full season in the league, he played his best soccer. He tallied 32 goals in all competitions and developed a deadly partnership with Son Heung-Min. There are rumors that the Gabonese international could leave the league for big money - which would be an immense loss for MLS and LAFC alike. 

 Inter Miami needed to replace one of their star DPs in Sergio Busquets, and did so in style, bringing in De Paul at the midpoint of last season. And if Messi was the undisputed main man, then De Paul did everything else. They dub him ""Messi's bodyguard"" in Argentina, and it's easy to see why, with De Paul running midfields by himself - while also making sure that the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner is more than protected. 

Dreyer would be a shoo-in for MVP had a certain Lionel Messi fella not played in this league. He always seemed to be a smart signing for San Diego, but very few could have predicted just how good he would be. A return of 23 goals and 17 assists is absurd in a debut season. An All-Star selection was more than deserved, and SDFC will be immensely grateful to have him for at least two more years. 

What a signing Sonny was. Sure, LAFC broke the bank to bring the Korean in, but who cares? Sometimes you have to swing big. And there was no adjustment period for the Korean, either. He bagged 12 and added three assists in 13 games after moving from Tottenham in August. Odds are, he will be even better in 2026.

A player so good that they made up a new position for him. Muller dubbed himself an ""interpreter of space"", which really doesn't mean all that much, but sounds pretty good. In practice, it was remarkably effective for the Whitecaps. Muller's numbers were good - 11 goal contributions in 12 matches - but his impact was even more significant. Vancouver went from good to great when he joined, and that's no coincidence. 

Does this even need intellectualizing? Messi had the best season in MLS history. Ever. Irrefutably, undoubtedly, and perhaps entirely expectedly, the little Argentine absolutely dominated the league last year. His 48 goal contributions in 28 matches were the second most in league history, but achieved in fewer games than the previous mark. He also smashed pretty much every playoff record available, too. And to top it off, he lifted the MLS Cup at the end of the year. The sweetener? He penned a multi-year deal to stick around in Miami for the foreseeable future.

Oscar Piastri reflects on 'tough lessons' and his goals for 2026

Lando Norris 'proved to myself that I have what it takes' after title success

Lando Norris returned to action as the reigning F1 champion at the Barcelona Shakedown.

Lando Norris has conceded that he is still yet to fully process becoming F1 World Champion for the first time, with only a few months passing between last year's Abu Dhabi finale and the start of the 2026 pre-season.

Norris, who beat Red Bull rival Max Verstappen and McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri to the 2025 crown, was back in action with the number 1 on his car – and a huge smile on his face – at last week's Barcelona Shakedown.

Asked at the gathering how he's approaching the new season, Norris said: “I'm excited for everything! Do I wish I had one more month to lay back and enjoy everything, take everything in? It was a few weeks off of just trying to realise what happened last year. It had become a reality, my dream.

“I think I'm still even now trying to just accept it, and to realise that it's happened. At the same time, it's back to work, and now we've got to try and do it all over again.

""It makes me happy, it gives me good confidence coming into this season, but it's such a different, such a big challenge with all the regulations, all the changes this year.

“I feel good. I'm happy. I've accomplished something huge in my life.”

In terms of getting back to work for 2026, and F1's all-new era of regulations, Norris was pleased with his and McLaren's three-day programme at the Barcelona Shakedown, where the MCL40 racked up a healthy number of laps.

“It's so easy to get caught up into comparisons, just because we're all competitive so you always want to see yourself doing well and feeling like you can be quick, but I think we understood a lot, both in lower-fuel stuff, higher-fuel stuff, the tyres,” the Briton said on the final day.

“Just what we came here to do, really, [which] is to understand the car, especially from a reliability point of view – make sure that all the sensors are working as they should, the PU's working as it should, the gearbox, whatever it is.

“[Making sure] everything is just doing what we expect, because reliability is one of the most important things, so a lot of it's from that side, and a lot of it is stuff over the next few days and weeks the team will look into and try to improve on and make better.

“And from my side, just to get back comfy with the car, some little bits I need to change here and there, but otherwise it still feels like a race car, still feels fast and still enjoyable.”

Norris and the rest of the F1 field – including Williams, after they missed the Shakedown – will be back in action in Bahrain next week, when the first of two official pre-season tests at the Sakhir venue gets under way.

The news comes ahead of the Feb. 15 season four premiere of the noir thriller, which is set in the 1970s on the Navajo reservation.

Senior Copy Editor


	The Navajo Tribal Police have another case to solve.


	AMC Networks announced Thursday morning that it has renewed its noir drama Dark Winds for a fifth season. The decision was made ahead of the season four premiere, which will air Feb. 15 at 9 p.m. ET/PT.




	Filming for season five will begin in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in March. It will debut in 2027 and, like season four, will consist of eight hourlong episodes.


	The show stars Zahn McClarnon as Lt. Joe Leaphorn, Kiowa Gordon as Officer Jim Chee, Jessica Matten as Sgt. Bernadette Manuelito and Deanna Allison as Emma Leaphorn. (THR recently caught up with some of the cast at Sundance.) It's based on the Leaphorn & Chee book series by Tony Hillerman, and season four is inspired by his novel The Ghostway.

	“It's such a privilege to embody the character of Joe Leaphorn, and I'm excited to return to Santa Fe with this amazing cast and crew to craft another thrilling of the show that means so much to all of us,” said McClarnon, who makes his directorial debut in season four.


	“Over four seasons, Dark Winds has masterfully blended compelling character-driven stories, Navajo culture, spirituality and breathtaking cinematography. We are elated to continue the journey alongside showrunner John Wirth and the incomparable Zahn McClarnon,” said Dan McDermott, chief content officer of AMC Networks and president of AMC Studios. “Our extraordinary producing and creative team, cast and crew have crafted a gripping crime drama that continues to be embraced by fans and widely celebrated by critics. We can't wait to share more of this incredible story with audiences across the globe.”

	











	Added Wirth, “For four seasons now AMC Networks has provided us with the opportunity to entertain audiences through the unique lens of a traditional crime story set on the Navajo Nation in 1972. We are one of one and never take this strong support for granted. Thanks to everyone at AMC Networks, our talented writing staff, stunning cast, and a Santa Fe crew that's become a training ground for Native artists, we're thrilled to be coming back for a fifth season of Dark Winds.”


	But first, season four promises plenty of suspense and drama, as Leaphorn, Chee and Manuelito race to Los Angeles to save a teenage girl named Billie (Isabel DeRoy-Olson) who has become tangled with an organized crime ring and is being pursued by a trained killer. The cast also includes A. Martinez as police chief Gordo Sena, with season four guest stars DeRoy-Olson, Franka Potente (The Bourne Supremacy) as Irene Vaggan; Chaske Spencer (The Twilight Saga) as Sonny, a recruiter for the L.A. crime ring; Luke Barnett (The Crossing Over Express) as FBI Special Agent Toby Shaw; and Titus Welliver (Bosch) as crime boss Dominic McNair.


	Graham Roland (Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan) is the show's creator. The executive producers are the late Robert Redford (whose final screen appearance was in season three), George R.R. Martin (who recently appeared on THR‘s cover), Roland, Wirth, McClarnon, Chris Eyre, Tina Elmo, Jim Chory, Thomas Brady, Max Hurwitz, Vince Gerardis and Anne Hillerman.

	











Dark Winds airs on AMC and streams on AMC+, with new episodes airing weekly on Sundays, starting at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Feb. 15. Viewers can catch up on the first three seasons on AMC+ and The AMC Collection on Netflix.

	Exactly 12 years ago, John Travolta had one of the most famous award show moments of the Obama era. Trying to pronounce the name of the (wih-cked-ly) talented Idina Menzel, the Oscar presenter famously bungled the name into something resembling Adele Dazeem. A million memes broke out. (Try watching it even now without laughing; you can't.)On Sunday Billie Eilish had one of the most famous award show moments of the still-burgeoning Trump II era. Accepting song of the year at the Grammys, she said, among other coyly delivered broadsides, “Fuck ICE, “no one is illegal on stolen land” and “I feel like we just need to keep fighting.” A tense congressional hearing broke out.

	The moment on Tuesday became fodder for Ted Cruz to go after Ted Sarandos at an ostensible Netflix-WB antitrust hearing. (Try watching it even now without sighing; you can't.)All sorts of politics are at play here. For one thing, Cruz's comment is not only beside the point but in bad faith. The singer “promptly went back to her $14 million mansion, and somehow that stolen land she wasn't concerned about,” the senator said. But Eilish's point of course wasn't that we should all move out of our homes — it's that knowing our history would temper our aggressive attitude toward newer arrivals. Cruz is smart enough to know that. But he's also smart enough not to pass up a point-scoring opportunity when he sees it.

	But he's also even smarter than that. He knows that comments like his can have a chilling effect on future political statements. Sarandos surely didn't run back and rebuke Eilish (her doc is with Apple, for one thing). But he might, with a massive merger pending in front of a machete-bearing Trump administration, think twice about making any creative decisions that could lead to more tense moments. Or sentiment could simply trickle down in his company(or David Zaslav's) that has talent avoiding similar statements at future shows. Who wants to get the boss in trouble?Fortunately at least for Sarandos, Trump loathes Cruz. This is what Hollywood executive strategy looks like in 2026 — hope the Republicans who hate you aren't loved by the Republicans who can bring the hammer down on you. As the classic line from Overboard goes, “it's a helluva day at sea, sir.”This is also what award show speeches look like now. Not that long ago a venue mainly for heartfelt moments or funny memes — Dazeem somehow feels like 2004, not 2014 — they have become in the Trump era a genre all their own. Meryl Streep gave her moving and cleverly unnamed anti-Trump speech at the 2017 Golden Globes just before he took office (watch that again now) and the next year Robert DeNiro offered up his ground-shaking “It's no longer down with Trump, it's fuck Trump,” at the Tony Awards. Award speeches in the MAGA age have become a place to make statements, to normalize a zeitgeist, to flood the zone with so many calls for sympathy and equality Ted Cruz is drowning in them.Or at least they did. The Grammy winners surely will double down. The anti-ICE message has been echoed by artists from Bad Bunny to Bruce Springsteen to Billie Joe Armstrong, with two of the three likely now about to get even more political at the Super Bowl. But film and television stars lately have been contorting themselves to say less. Watching the Golden Globes last month you almost felt like winners — just four days after the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis — were painfully going out of their way to avoid political comments. At best we got Jean Smart, who, still tiptoeing, said “Let's all do the right thing” and then followed it up backstage by adding “I have mixed feelings about getting political or making social commentary at an awards event … we've gotten to a point now that is so so important that everybody wakes up and opens their eyes and is brave and calm but at the same time try to be active if you have to or if you want to reach out to your representatives and I would say that to everybody whatever side of the aisle you're on.” Fuck ICE it was not.No Hollywood celebrity owes any cause anything; if we're going to decry the false piety of shut-up-and-sing we should also be as sensitive to its opposite, speak-up-or-shut-up. And yes, music stars have a lot more shots at, and knack for, rousing a large audience. Still, musicians work for giant corporations too, and when Billie and Bruce and Bad Bunny and so many others say “Fuck ICE” without fear of repercussion, setting a tone for both the show and an America in a time of moral violation, it makes you wonder why movie stars as a group can't do the same. 


	Sure, personal publicists won't like the fallout, but then isn't that why they get paid? Studio executives will worry about the box office backlash, but if your product is really so fragile that one awards speech could kill it then maybe the problem isn't the award speech. You got the sense watching the Globes more than a few winners would like to go back to the Adele Dazeem era, somehow forgetting that before that time came Michael Moore and Marlon Brando and Jane Fonda and Sean Penn, and if a Gen Z singer could pull us back to it, maybe they could too.Also, movie stars might do well to remember that, post-Pretti and post-Good, they finally have the American public on their side. Last year's fig leaf of a “mandate” has frittered away with the red-carpet fashions.There's an irony in some of these speeches becoming more political as the shows are watched less. Or perhaps the two are related; without the pretense of speaking to 80 million people, winners feel they might as well let the political outrage fly. A Cruz-ian sort would say these call-outs are the flailing of a shrinking entertainment elite, but the first explanation tracks harder: A smaller audience makes you double down on what you believe. Ted Cruz certainly doesn't care about pleasing everyone, and Billie Eilish and a whole bunch of musicians now clearly don't either. Hollywood stars would do well to worry less about bungling the teleprompter and more about being true to their heart.

California state assemblyman Matt Haney has introduced a bill that would cap the resale of concert tickets to no more than 10% over face value.


													By
												

	Taylor Mims


Writer


	California could become the next state in the U.S. to put a limit on the price of resale concert tickets. Today (Feb. 5), California state assemblyman Matt Haney introduced a spot bill titled the California Fans First Act that would cap the price of a resold concert ticket to no more than 10% above the ticket's original face value.


	The bill – labeled AB 1720 – would make it illegal to resell a concert, theater, comedy or other live entertainment ticket (sports are not included) at a price higher than face value (the cost of the ticket plus fees from the primary ticketing source) plus 10% for shows taking place in California.


	The bill “is very simple. It is enforceable. It is common sense and it is fair to both fans and artists,” Haney tells Billboard. “It is about the astronomical cost of resale that is being driven by bots and [ticket] brokers who are exploiting a scheme to leech off the work of artists.”


	The CFFA has the backing of the state's independent venue coalition NIVA CA, which has worked alongside the assemblyman to introduce the spot bill (a spot bill is an initial proposal that still requires legal guidance from state lawyers for final language). The nationwide National Independent Venue Association is also in support, as is musician advocacy group Music Artists Coalition – both of which have been vying to pass similar bills in states and jurisdictions across the country.


	The only other state to have successfully passed a resale cap was Maine in 2025. The Maine bill also capped the resale value at 110% of the face value of the ticket. Several other states, including New York, Vermont, Washington and Tennessee, are seeking to implement similar legislation, as well as Washington, D.C.


	By creating a resale ticket cap, “you remove the profit motive” for ticket brokers, says Music Artist Coalition executive director Ron Gubitz. With a markup of no more than 10%, artists performing in California could keep their ticket prices low without concerns that any value gap between their price and the price a broker could get on the secondary market would be minimal. If professional resellers can only make 10% on flipping tickets, that takes a lot of incentive out of the job since returns can no longer be hundreds of times the price of the face value ticket.


	“This problem has gotten out of control and it's getting much worse. We see concert tickets completely out of reach for actual fans and these brokers are getting more sophisticated in grabbing all the tickets and forcing fans to pay astronomical prices,” the assemblyman says. “We need arts and entertainment for our cities to thrive for our state's economy to recover.”


	The California bill comes after the United Kingdom announced plans ban ticket resales over face value in November. The U.K. law seeks to limit the service fees that resale sites can charge and requires platforms like StubHub and Viagogo “to monitor and enforce compliance with the price cap.” The law also bans fans and resellers from buying more tickets than they are legally entitled to purchase during an initial ticket sale.


	“We feel [the CFFA] that the price cap is something that is going to be good for the [live music] ecosystem overall,” says Golden Bear Strategies' Alex Torres, who serves as the lobbyist for NIVA CA. “For fans, the real impact is affordability – being able to have a marketplace where, if you cannot attend, you can offload it and it's more likely that someone will buy it with the intent of actually going to that show themselves. It fosters that ecosystem.”


	Many live music venues, especially independent venues, have struggled with attrition since the pandemic, meaning “no show” rates have risen from the pre-COVID average of 5% to 20-30%. With venues making the majority of their revenue from food and beverage sales, the high attrition rates have cut greatly into their already declining profit margins. Advocates for this bill argue that more affordable tickets mean more actual fans can attend and possibly have more disposable income to purchase food, drinks or merchandise from the artist – adding to the live music ecosystem rather than that money going to third-party ticket brokers.


	The CCFA would work in tandem with another bill introduced last year in the California legislature – AB 1349. The bill states that it “aims to stop that practice by outlawing speculative ticketing, whereby people advertise tickets for sale on a resale platform that they neither own nor are guaranteed to get. Music artists, independent concert venue operators, and Ticketmaster do not agree on much, but they are in agreement that the resale of entertainment tickets at greatly inflated prices is harming both artists and their fans.”


	AB 1349 would also ban the use of “a box office website that looks substantially similar to the venue or primary seller's website in order to direct sales to the resale market,” meaning deceptive URLs that populate on search engines when fans search for artists' tours would be outlawed in the state.


	Assemblyman Haney's bill “is very complimentary to this initial work that we've done [on AB 1349],” says NIVA CA president Joe Rinaldi, who also owns San Diego independent venue the Music Box. “We want customers to have confidence that they're buying from the source and they're not going to have an absolute nightmare on date night. That confidence starts with fixing the marketplace with these two pieces of legislation.”


	NIVA executive director Stephen Parker says that the association has been working with the eight states (including California) that have introduced resale cap bills this year alone and he believes there will be more brought forth in other states likely this month and certainly this year. “It is an organic movement,” he tells Billboard, adding that the push for these limits is happening despite money-heavy lobbying efforts from secondary platforms. Other states “see that, if Maine can do this, we can do this. And if countries across Europe and Australia can do this, they can also do this.”

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Lisa, the Thai rapper, singer, dancer and actor of Blackpink fame, who's coming off her acting debut in The White Lotus Season 3, is set to reteam with the series' executive producer David Bernad on a new romantic comedy for Netflix, penned by Set It Up‘s Katie Silberman.


	The official logline is under wraps, but sources close to the project said Bernad and Lisa developed the premise on the set of The White Lotus, after bonding over their shared appreciation for Notting Hill, the classic 1999 romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Shortly after, they tapped Silberman, the in-demand comedy writer behind Set it Up and Booksmart, to write the script.

	Bernad will produce through his Middle Child Productions banner, alongside Silberman, who has an exclusive, multi-year creative partnership with the streamer. Alice Kang and Lisa will exec produce. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Lisa comes to the project amid work on her first major film role in TYGO, a new chapter of Netflix's Extraction universe. 


	Rising to fame as a member of South Korea's Blackpink, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time, Lisa made her solo debut in 2021 with the single album LALISA. She released her debut solo album, Alter Ego, last February, seeing it debut at number seven on the Billboard 200 chart and hit number one on the Billboard Top Album Sales chart. 


	The artist also made her Coachella debut last year, after making her screen debut as Mook, the wellness professional love interest of Tayme Thapthimthong's non-violent Buddhist security guard Gaitok, in The White Lotus Season 3. She is represented by WME, LLOUD and JSSK.

	











	Silberman is known for writing Netflix's Set It Up, one of Netflix's most watched romantic comedies, starring Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell. Additionally, she co-wrote and produced Olivia Wilde's Booksmart, which received WGA and BAFTA nominations for Best Original Screenplay. She is repped by CAA, 42, and Myman Greenspan.


	An Emmy, Golden Globe, Peabody, and PGA-winning producer, Bernad's Middle Child is currently prepping the France-set fourth season of The White Lotus, with the second season of its Emmy-nominated series Jury Duty and Little Brother, a Netflix comedy starring John Cena and Eric André, in post. He is repped by CAA and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Paramount and Spyglass Media's Scream 7 came on domestic tracking with a mid $30M opening in store when it arrives in theaters on Feb. 27. If those numbers hold, it could be the second highest opening in the 30-year old franchise stateside after Scream VI‘s record $44.4M opening; that 2023 installment fueled by the Jenna Ortega Wednesday phenomenon. 


	Currently, Scream 7 is great with the 17-34 bunch and multicultural audiences across definite interest and first choice. Tickets don't go on sale until Monday after the pic's pre-Game Super Bowl spot. Advance ticket sales are typically a better indication of demand. Right now tracking has Scream 7 coming on higher than Scream VI, The Conjuring: Last Rites ($84M) and Final Destination: Bloodlines ($51.6M) in First Choice. There's an argument that with lower grossing movies like Send Help and Iron Lung presently on tracking, most forecasts are inflated. 

	











	While Scream VI took the action to New York City, Scream 7 brings it back to the small town, repping the full comeback of Neve Campbell's Sidney Prescott. Another big highlight of Scream 7 is that it brings scribe Kevin Williamson into the director's chair on his own franchise for the first time; a big deal to fans.

It'll open way bigger than that. The only reason 6 did any numbers is because of the passionate fan base and what came before (it is the worst movie in the series).

Seriously doubt it. I say mid $20- 30 million at most

And, yet people keep complaining about why “Hollywood” keeps making sequels and reboots.

Audiences reap what THEY sow

Iron Lung is the best movie playing right now.

After thinking about it, I regret this comment.

Expect lower box office for Scream 7

Why?

Cinema United, the trade org for exhibition, has made public its remarks about the pending Netflix–Warner Bros merger to the Senate antitrust subcommittee, saying, “If Netflix succeeds in acquiring Warner Bros., the results will be economically and culturally catastrophic: fewer theatres, shorter windows, less revenue, fewer jobs across the national and global entertainment industry, and fewer movies for consumers to see in theatres.”


	Cinema United, previously known as National Association of Theatre Owners, submitted a six-page written testimony to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy & Consumer Rights on Tuesday.

	











	While Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told lawmakers on the record the streamer is about a 45-day exclusive theatrical window for movies, many rival studio sources have questioned the streaming boss' intent. If Sarandos is thinking a 45-day window to streaming, that's still rather destructive to the business. When distributors talk about a 45-day window, they mean 45 days until PVOD or sell-through digital — a window that precedes the streaming window. Streaming windows generally are around 90-100 days or more after a movie bows in cinemas.

RELATED: Netflix Attacked For Having “Wokest Content In The History Of The World” By MAGA Senators At WB Deal Hearing


	In the statement, Cinema United advocated: “We are deeply concerned that this acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix will have a direct and irreversible negative impact on movie theatres around the world. Such an acquisition will further consolidate control over production and distribution of motion pictures in the hands of a single, dominant, global streaming platform in a market that is already highly concentrated. The impact will not only be felt by theatre owners, but by movie fans and surrounding businesses in communities of all sizes.”The trade group extended its concerns of the proposed Warner Bros. merger beyond Netflix, adding: “If Paramount or another major studio ends up displacing Netflix as the buyer, our concerns are no less serious. A combination of Paramount and Warner Bros., for instance, would consolidate as much as 40% of each year's domestic box office in the hands of a single dominant studio.”

	











RELATED: List Of Hollywood & Media Layoffs From Paramount To Warner Bros Discovery To CNN & More“The key to a successful industry overall is having a diverse, robust, and consistent product pipeline that responds to consumer demand. The number of films being produced for theatrical exhibition is slowly returning to pre-2019 levels. However, that growth is threatened by further consolidation. At best, an acquisition of Warner Bros. will stall the growth we have seen in the last four years. More realistically, however, it will result in a significant reduction of theatrical releases,” the Michael O'Leary led cinema org explained. The statement summed up, “We must heed the lessons of the past: further industry consolidation has consistently led to fewer movies being made, and there is no reason whatsoever to believe the outcome here would be any different, particularly given Netflix's stated views of movie theatres over the past decade-plus.”


	Cinema United reps more than 31,000 movie screens across all 50 states and over 30,000 additional screens in 80 countries worldwide.

The theater business is dying and it's not because of this merger.

Neither Paramount nor Netflix can control the awfulness of the current moviegoing experience. Society has deteriorated and now it is just people nonstop on their phone and talking and being obnoxious with zero ramifications.

Paramount would be worse. WB is complimentary to Netflix's streaming business. They want to put movies in theaters. Theater owners need to chill out.

Theater owners need to make the theater going experience better before they keep complaining about everything that happens in the movie business, as per usual for them. Bring back ushers to force people to behave during movies. No phones, no talking, and no bloody children running around or crying. Then people might want to come back to the theaters again.

Teddi Mellencamp said that her stint in the current season of the “Masked Singer” gave her “a little bit of life” amid her ongoing cancer battle.

The “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum, 44, was eliminated from Wednesday's episode of “The Masked Singer,” revealing herself as Calla Lily in the dramatic final moments of the show. 

After her unmasking, Teddi told the judges about how her intense cancer battle didn't stop her from doing the reality series.

“I'm not a singer by trade, clearly, and so that part was challenging for me,” she said. “Also, a big part of my memory has been askew since my brain surgery. So I was a little bit nervous, but I was excited to push myself out of my comfort zone and try something new, and it felt like it gave me a little bit of life.”

Teddi sang Rachel Platten's “Fight Song” and her dad John Mellencamp's “Jack and Diane” during her time on the show.

The clues for her identity included a diamond house key, a nod to her time on “RHOBH,” and the mention that she has a famous family member who is a singer.

“For a while I resented him for not making my life easy,” Teddi, while still disguised as Calla Lily, said about John, 74, during a package on the show. “And there were years we were distant.”

Nothing that the father-daughter duo are now on good terms, she added, “I'm thankful for all he does for me. It made me be tough, strong and always on time for dinner.”

On Thursday's episode of her “Two Ts in a Pod” podcast, Teddi revealed that besides her dad, she didn't tell anyone — not even her three children, whom she shares with estranged husband Edwin Arroyave — that she was on the show.

“Cruz knew within seconds,” she said about her 11-year-old son. “And we were watching ‘Masked Singer,' cause it's their favorite show, and Cruz goes, ‘Mom! Mom! That's you!'”

In an interview with People, Teddi said she wanted to “push myself out of my comfort zone” after going through severe “physical and mental struggles” from her cancer battle.

“So getting out there and doing something new and trying something new was really great for me,” she told the outlet. 

The former Bravoleb came forward with her stage 2 melanoma diagnosis in October 2022.

She underwent more than a dozen surgeries to address the disease — including an emergency procedure in 2025 to remove several tumors in her brain.

Last October, Teddi shared that her cancer was gone.

But when John recently stated that his daughter was “really sick” and “suffering,” Teddi clarified that her cancer hadn't returned.

“No, there's still no trace of cancer,” she said on her podcast last month. “But I'm still considered stage four and I'm still in immunotherapy, so essentially nothing's changed other than I still — I don't feel great … I would hope that I would be feeling better by now, but I really don't.”

Teddi also shared that she's going to therapy to address her difficult cancer journey.

Savannah Guthrie is the longtime co-anchor of “Today,” and right now, she and her siblings are living through every family's worst nightmare.

The urgent search for their mother, Nancy Guthrie, 84, entered its fifth day this week after authorities said she was taken from her Arizona home “against her will.” Savannah and her siblings released an emotional video appeal, asking anyone involved to provide proof Nancy is alive and saying, “We are ready to listen.”

There are still no suspects, according to CNN. The sheriff's department warned the public against spreading unverified claims as the FBI works alongside the Pima County Sheriff's Department on the investigation. Savannah also revealed that her mother lives in constant pain and needs prescription medication, raising fears as time passes.

On Feb. 1, Savannah's co-anchors read a family statement on air thanking supporters and urging anyone with information to call authorities. The family wrote, “Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom.”

As the Guthries wait for answers, here's what you need to know.

Savannah's dad, Charles Guthrie, died of a heart attack when she was just 16. He worked as a mining engineer in Australia before moving the family to Arizona.

In a 2014 essay, Savannah described him as “a seemingly unlikely mix of qualities,” adding that he could “turn a mundane trip to the post office into a rip-roaring tale.”

She later said losing him changed everything. On “Making Space with Hoda Kotb,” she shared, “I know it changed me and probably changed the whole trajectory of my life.”

Camron Guthrie is Savannah's older brother and a former Air National Guard F-16 pilot.

In 2012, he and Savannah flew together in an F-16 during a 2012 “Today” segment. When Camron retired in 2018, Savannah posted a tribute calling him “the pride of our family,” adding, “He has flown for our country for 26 years.”

After Charles died, Savannah says the family leaned on one another to survive the loss.

“It was such a shock,” she shared on “Today.” “We were just trying to figure out how to become a family of four when we had always been a family of five.”

She later added that while the loss was devastating, it also made her heart “more tender.”

Savannah's sister, Annie Guthrie, is both a creative writer and a jewelry artist.

According to her Arizona Commission on the Arts bio, she teaches creative writing at the University of Arizona Poetry Center, has published work in literary journals, and has written a book on jewelry making. Annie is also a graduate of Warren Wilson College.

Savannah, Camron, and Annie have remained publicly united as they wait for answers about Nancy.

On Wednesday, Feb. 4, Guthrie and her siblings shared a video appeal, urging whoever has their mother to come forward and stressing that the family is willing to communicate, while also demanding proof of life.

Both TMZ and a local CBS affiliate reported receiving ransom notes tied to the case, though authorities have not verified their authenticity.

The FBI is now working alongside Arizona law enforcement as the investigation continues.

Of the 90-plus films and episodic series premiering at the Sundance Film Festival in 2026, only about a dozen are arriving at the festival with distribution in hand. Many will be looking for homes, but if this year is anything like last year, it may take some time for those sales to close. We'll be tracking all of them as they come in.

Section: PremieresDistributor: AppleDirectors: Amir Bar-LevDate Acquired: Feb. 5Buzz: In terms of pure visceral thrills, it's hard to beat a good mountain climbing documentary. That's the bet Apple made when it acquired “The Last First: Winter K2,” which also explores the corrosive affect that influencer culture has had on the world of mountain climbing. Bar-Lev has an extensive track record of delivering documentary hits about a wide range of topics, so the tech giant is likely hoping that it has the next “Free Solo” on its hands.

Section: PremieresDistributor: NeonDirectors: William and David GreavesDate Acquired: Feb. 5Buzz: Few nonfiction films at Sundance generated more buzz than “Once Upon a Time in Harlem,” William Greaves' posthumous collection of conversations from a 1974 cocktail party of Harlem Renaissance luminaries that was assembled by his son David. The film is a vital historical artifact, and the fact that it hails from a legendary documentarian only adds to its prestige. Watch out for this one come Oscar season.

Section: U.S. Dramatic CompetitionDistributor: Sony Pictures ClassicsDirectors: Stephanie AhnDate Acquired: Jan. 30Buzz: In its second acquisition in two days, Sony Pictures Classics picked up another set of worldwide rights to yet another U.S. Dramatic Competition title. “Bedford Park” is also the directorial debut of Ahn, and it's a drama about a woman (Moon Choi) struggling between her loyalty to her Korean immigrant family and her own American identity, as a child raised in New Jersey.  When her mother gets into a car accident, it leads to a fateful meeting with Eli (Son Sukku), an ex-wrestler battling his own fractured past. 

 










In addition to Sukku being the host of IndieWire's final Chili Party in Park City, IndieWire's review praised the film for being rich in detail rather than sacrificing specificity for a simple love story.

Section: U.S. Dramatic CompetitionDistributor: Sony Pictures ClassicsDirectors: Josef Kubota WladykaDate Acquired: Jan. 29 Buzz: One of the buzzier competition titles at Sundance not because of its star power but because of its playful title and crowd pleasing sentiment, one that earned a standing ovation for director Josef Kubota Wladyka and his mother on whom the film is based, the real Ha-Chan. Shot in Japan, Rinko Kikuchi stars in “Ha-Chan, Shake Your Booty!” as a woman who leaves the Japanese ballroom dance scene after tragedy strikes, only to be lured back onto the dance floor after developing an infatuation for a new instructor. SPC picked up the worldwide rights to the film. It also stars Alberto Guerra, Alejandro Edda, Yoh Yoshida, and Damián Alcázar.

Section: PremieresDistributor: A24Directors: Olivia WildeDate Acquired: Jan. 27 Buzz: This was a true, old-fashioned, late night bidding war between multiple interested buyers that ended up being a 72-hour, marathon competition. IndieWire hears that Neon, Black Bear, Netflix, Searchlight, and Focus Features — and even Warner Bros. at the 11th hour — were all in the mix for what was Olivia Wilde's third feature as a director. We're also hearing that the final bidding got into the 8-figure range. Others may have bid more, but Wilde was determined to get a theatrical deal. And it's fitting too, because this was one of the starrier movies at the festival with Wilde, Seth Rogen, Edward Norton, and Penélope Cruz all leading the ensemble cast. “The Invite” quite simply is about the dinner party from hell when a couple whose marriage is on the brink have dinner with another couple that's polyamorous, but the crowds that saw it say there's a lot more layers to this one than just that. Will McCormack and Rashida Jones wrote the screenplay based on a 2019 Spanish film called “Sentimental.” UTA Independent Film Group and FilmNation co-repped the sale, and the film hails from Megan Ellison and Annapurna, who also previously produced Wilde's debut film “Booksmart.”

 










Section: MidnightDistributor: NeonDirector: Adrian ChiarellaDate Acquired: Jan. 27 Buzz: A queer, coming-of-age horror movie? “Leviticus” is about two teenage boys who have to fight off a violent entity capable of taking the form of the other. The film plays on the real-life horrors of conversion therapy and stars Joe Bird, Stacy Clausen, Jeremy Blewitt, Ewen Leslie, Davida McKenzie, Nicholas Hope, Zahra Newman, and Mia Wasikowska. The film's unique genre premise from writer/director Adrian Chiarella, his feature debut, was good enough for Neon to jump on worldwide rights in a seven-figure deal, as well as the first sale of the festival, an otherwise slow affair thus far, though one that has sparked an early bidding war for at least one other title. “Leviticus” will be released later this year and is actually Neon's second deal for a horror movie out of the festival, as the distributor also over the weekend joined the next film from “It Ends” director Alex Ullom.

Section: PremieresDistributor: Focus FeaturesDirectors: Daniel Roher and Charlie TyrellBuzz: The “Navalny” director teams up with producer Daniel Kwan (“Everything Everywhere All At Once”) on a film that goes deep into the perils and promise of artificial intelligence, all through the lens of Roher debating whether this is a good moment to bring a child into the world.

 










Section: PremieresDistributor: ESPNDirector: Alexandria StapletonBuzz: The director of “Sean Combs: The Reckoning” sits down with Brittany Griner, the basketball star who was famously detained and became the subject of a media and political frenzy as she hoped to secure her freedom. 

Section: PremieresDistributor: ESPNDirectors: Liz Garbus and Elizabeth WolffBuzz: More than a sports doc, this portrait of Billie Jean King looks at the tennis icon's compulsion to hide her sexual orientation and eating disorders.

Section: PremieresDistributor: Searchlight PicturesDirector: Andrew StantonBuzz: Though he's directed plenty on TV, Pixar vet Andrew Stanton is returning to a live-action feature for the first time since “John Carter” dropped way back in 2012. “In the Blink of an Eye” is a triptych set in ancient times, modern day, and in the distant future, exploring how those three eras are connected by hope and the circle of life.

Section: PremieresDistributor: A24Director: Aidan ZamiriBuzz: One of three films starring Charli XCX at the festival, the “brat” pop star plays a version of herself in an exaggerated mockumentary that comments on the idea of modern celebrity. 

 










Section: World DocumentaryDistributor: PBS/FrontlineDirectors: Itab Azzam, Jack MacInnesBuzz: This documentary was filmed over 10 years and follows a Syrian refugee girl who travels to Germany and then back to Syria with her family.

Section: PremieresDistributor: NetflixDirector: Rory KennedyBuzz: Perhaps a documentary for “The Queen's Gambit” fans, this film follows a girl from Hungary who is a chess prodigy trying to break into a male-dominated competition circuit. 

Section: MidnightDistributor: ShudderDirector: Natalie Erika JamesBuzz: Shudder picked up this body horror film from the “Relic” director just before the festival. It stars Midori Francis as a woman who takes part in a bizarre weight loss craze that involves eating human ashes, only to become possessed by demonic forces in the process. 

Section: NEXTDistributor: Latino Public Broadcasting and ITVSDirector: William D. CaballeroBuzz: This animated film that combines a variety of styles, including 2D, 3D, and live-action, is a deeply personal autobiographical documentary from mixed media filmmaker Caballero, who looks back on his career and examines grief through the lens of his Puerto Rican family in North Carolina. Theatrical rights are still available. 

 










Section: PremieresDistributor: Nat GeoDirector: Sara DosaBuzz: Like her Sundance breakout “Fire of Love” before it, “Time and Water” is a more elevated nature documentary and follows an Icelandic writer eulogizing both a glacier and his grandparents.

Section: MidnightDistributor: A24Director: Ian TuasonBuzz: A micro-budget horror movie in the vein of “Paranormal Activity” that first played at Fantasia Fest, the actual producers of “Paranormal Activity” helped give the film a new cut and are hoping for another horror hit.

The Academy has officially gotten back into the content game, with the new initiative led by a familiar face. Jennifer Davidson, who has been at the organization since 2019, and been its communications chief since 2021, has been promoted to the newly expanded role of Chief Marketing, Communications, and Content Officer for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Part of her new responsibilities will be leading the newly established production arm, Academy Studios, which is responsible for organization-wide digital projects and initiatives — from member and industry interviews, videos, livestreams, and podcasts — “that embody the Academy's mission, voice and cultural identity.”

This new development, shared by Academy CEO Bill Kramer, who Davidson will continue to report to, comes on the heels of the Academy announcing that the Oscars are moving to YouTube in 2029. That news came with the implication that the Academy would be expanding its presence on the platform, including giving audiences more access to its private events like the Governors Awards and Oscars Nominees Luncheon.

While this new Academy Studios initiative seems more focused on video, the Academy did recently try its hand at a formal content hub with the digital magazine A.frame, which shuttered in July 2024. Since then, the Academy has continued to produce and publish videos that were mostly distributed via its social channels instead.

In addition to calling the newly promoted Davidson “a dynamic, forward-thinking leader for the Academy,” Kramer, also speaking to the establishment of their new content studio, said that “as we evolve the Academy to reach a larger and more global audience, we are thrilled to elevate her to this vital new role. Jen's creative vision, along with the development of our new Academy Studios production team, will allow us to celebrate filmmakers and filmmaking on a greater scale, discover new ways to showcase our talented members, and continue to promote the exceptional work of our Academy Museum and Academy Collection. Our goal is to highlight to the broadest worldwide audience everything we do year-round.” 

“In this new role, I'm excited to adopt innovative strategies that can celebrate both our industry's greatest storytellers and the remarkable work they've created across disciplines,” said Davidson, who currently oversees marketing and audience development, communications, digital/social and creative brand strategy for all arms of the Academy, including the Academy Foundation, the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures and the Oscars. “The establishment of Academy Studios allows us to preserve film's rich history for future generations, while creating fresh and exciting ways to engage new audiences around cinema. I am thrilled about the opportunity to honor our past while elevating our future.”

The Black Keys are keeping up their loose pattern of releasing an album every year; their newest, the enthusiastically titled Peaches!, arrives May 1 via Easy Eye Sound/Warner. Leading the blues-rock band's return is the single “You Got to Lose” and its music video directed by E.J. McLeavey-Fisher, in which the duo plays a surprise show at Memphis juke joint Hernando's Hide-A-Way. Check it out below.

Spanning 10 songs, Peaches! is billed as the Black Keys at their “most natural” since their 2002 debut, The Big Come Up. The follow-up to 2025's No Rain, No Flowers is the duo's 14th album together overall. The band started working on the record after singer-guitarist Dan Auerbach's father was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and stayed in his son's Nashville home while rapidly declining.

“We weren't making a record. We were just jamming, like this is for us,” Auerbach said in a press release. “Really primal, in a moment when all the nerves were raw, just kinda screaming. We were going through a lot, trying to lift our spirits. I think my dad getting sick made me not give a fuck and just wanna scream for a bit.”

Melania: Twenty Days to History, Amazon's trumped-up documentary about First Lady Melania Trump, reportedly exceeded box-office expectations, bringing in $7 million when pundits prognosticated torn stubs worth between $1 million and $5 million. And Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel had a field day on Wednesday night with the news.


	Colbert claimed the figures need context. “Seven million dollars would seem like a solid opening, until you realize that's less than 10 percent of the $75 million Amazon spent on the documentary, which includes paying the first lady herself at least $28 million,” he said on The Late Show. “That's enough cash to put a smile on your face … if that were physically possible.” He also had a Melania Trump impersonator attempt to explain the movie.


	Kimmel also questioned a different set of numbers during his Jimmy Kimmel Live! monologue. “As of tonight, Melania has a score of five percent on Rotten Tomatoes from the critics,” he said. “That is very low. To put that in perspective, that is one percent lower than Gigli,” the 2003 Bennifer box-office bomb, which Rolling Stone described as “jaw-droppingly awful.” Counterintuitively, he pointed out that the Popcornmeter (fans' approval rating), is through the roof. “The audience score is 99 percent positive, which is one percent higher than The Godfather,” he said. “And I'm sure Donald J. Corleone had nothing to do with that at all.”

	As far as the money goes, Kimmel joked that the way Amazon is crowing that it's the best nonmusical documentary opening in 14 years was smoke and mirrors. “I think [that] is a fancy way of saying it only lost tens of millions of dollars,” he said.

	











	Joking that it's possible that Republican groups purchased bulk tickets to drive up the numbers (though he showed a group of women who called themselves “the Church Ladies,” who were all dressed alike), Kimmel requested a recount. “Send in Tulsi Gabbard and the FBI. Seize the ticket machines, the popcorn buckets, the box-office receipts at every multiplex in America,” he said. He also blasted Amazon ownerJeff Bezos for firing about a third of The Washington Post's staff after financing Melania.

	When Chante Whyte saw Harry Styles announce his fourth studio album, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, her first thought was blinding joy at the return of her favorite artist. But once the dates were announced for its accompanying tour, there was another feeling that threatened to overtake it: worry. 


	“I promise you, I had heart palpitations every single night thinking about what the Ticketmaster war was going to be like,” she tells Rolling Stone. 


	While the Together, Together Tour doesn't start until May 16, tickets sales have already started for almost every date. But fans who signed up for artist and Amex presale were shocked to discover many tickets going for upward of $1,000. Part of this is because he is Harry Styles — an international pop star who's had all of his studio projects debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 — but also a former member of the boy band One Direction. Styles hasn't toured for several years and has a reputation for virtually disappearing after finishing a round of shows, meaning many audience members fear that missing out on a ticket could mean waiting another three years — at least — to see him again. There's also the fact that Together, Together is significantly smaller than past Styles tours, with just 67 dates in 11 cities, including a 30-night run at Madison Square Garden. And the demand is astronomical — more than 11 million people queued up for 500,000 tickets for shows in the New York City area. 

	











	And while all these components drive demand, Styles fans also have to contend with the music industry's longtime battle with ticket sellers. High ticket prices have been a problem for decades — fans complained about how much it cost to see the Rolling Stones in these very pages back in 1969 — but in the past few years, artists and fans have become increasingly vocal about it. In September, the Federal Trade Commission sued Live Nation and Ticketmaster, alleging the ticket platforms hide fees from consumers and encourage bots to purchase large swaths of tickets and drive up the resale price. Ticketmaster denied the allegations, but announced several changes to the platform, including banning of multiple accounts and shutting down price tracking tool TradeDesk. But while the lawsuits and ongoing controversy continue, Styles' fans are still eager to find tickets — and they're going to extraordinary lengths to see their favorite artist live.

	For Daniella Barone, 24, getting tickets is about more than having a good time on a night out. It's her second chance to experience a fandom she loves. The illustration student goes to college in Florida but is originally from Venezuela. She planned to be at a Miami show in 2020 but had to leave the country to receive her green card. Then Covid-19 hit, closing the embassy and leaving her stuck in Venezuela for several months. By the time she was able to come back to the U.S., the concert had been canceled. 


	“I've been listening to One Direction since I was 11, and I'm 24 now,” she says. “I've always loved Harry's music, but I also love the fandom. It's like a little family. That's always something that has really appealed to me; having that community.” 


	She tells Rolling Stone that the minute she saw the tour announcement, she knew she had to get cash fast. But as a student, she needed a job that didn't interfere with her heavy class schedule. Her answer? Plasma donation. She's donated twice and plans to keep the donations up until she can afford two tickets and plane fare to New York. Everything else? Well, she's not as sure. “I can only eat once a day, but I've done it before!” she says, laughing. (The practice is generally considered safe for those 17 and over who fit certain medical requirements, according to Mayo Clinic and the American Red Cross Association, but it's important to wait at least 28 days between donations.)

	Ava Engle, 18, had a similar idea. The San Diego State University student describes herself as an avid concertgoer. “I've fought a lot of Ticketmaster wars,” she says. But as a college student, she tells Rolling Stone her schedule has severely limited the type of work she can do to get money and keep up with classwork. She's deathly afraid of needles, but after failing to find a Styles ticket under $1,000 during the official Ticketmaster sale, she signed up for plasma donation. 


	Each session nets her around $90, which she says adds up when she also takes on tutoring gigs. During school breaks, she also makes minimum wage working at the front desk of a swim club, so pooling together from all three, she's hopeful she'll have enough. But having to put so much work into the same tickets some people paid $200 for at the last tour still makes her frustrated. 


	“I'm terrified of needles, and I was so scared,” she says. “Being in the chair, I was having second thoughts. Like, ‘What am I doing?' I just want to see one of my favorite artists. We shouldn't have to be doing all of this just to afford tickets for one night.” 

	











	Since the tour went on sale, fans have maintained their outrage over ticket prices. Even Styles' former bandmate Zayn Malik appeared to reference the controversy at his Jan. 28 show. “I just want to say a big, big thank you to every single one of you for being here tonight,” he said onstage. “Hopefully the ticket prices weren't too high. Just saying.” As ticket prices have skyrocketed, fan behavior around concerts has also changed. For major stars like Styles, Billie Eilish, and Olivia Rodrigo, who have a younger fan base, many concertgoers offset ticket costs by buying cheaper floor tickets without seats and then camping overnight in front of the stadium in order to be as close as possible to the stage. (Even those tickets can cost $400 to $900 or more.) But there's also a lack of transparency about how many low-cost tickets are actually available in the first place, which fans say makes purchasing feel less like a first-come-first-serve system and more like a lottery. (Representatives for Styles cold not be reached for comment on ticket prices.) On Wednesday, Styles announced that he was playing “one night only” in Manchester, England, where all tickets would cost £20. Fans are invited to “request” tickets starting Friday. So far, more than 1.4 million people have liked that post on Instagram.


	“I do everything right. I'm not a bot. So the fact that I'm still [100,000th] in line and then when I get in, I see the ticket prices, and there's barely anything available, and it's all over $1,000 or like, $700 and they're not even amazing seats. It's so frustrating,” Engle says. “It's like, ‘Harry, what are we doing?'”


	Aaron Fern, 28, wasn't a huge One Direction fan. But when he heard Styles' first solo album, he fell immediately in love. Styles has been one of his top artists every year since 2019. When he and his friends saw the tour announcement, he immediately rushed to their group chat. “It was like, ‘We need to get tickets,'” he says. “It felt like, ‘We need to go now,' or else it's going to be another five years until we see him.” 


	Fern signed up for dozens of presale opportunities for the shows at Madison Square Garden — but he's still planning to go into more credit card debt to buy tickets. His expected budget was around $1,000 for two tickets, but after failing at several presales, he says he's going all in and just looking for second jobs. “I'm really surprised. I don't blame [Harry] because it's like blaming the weatherman for the weather. But it is crazy,” he says. “I'm looking for bartending gigs, restaurant work, record stores. Anything that I feel like I have experience in but could also make me money the quickest.” 

	











	When Whyte, 25, thinks about her dozens of times attending Styles concerts, she calls them “life-altering” experiences full of friendship and community. “Last time Harry went on tour, I went to almost 30 shows. It's actually kind of insane,” she says, laughing. “I tell my mom all the time, there's a brain cell that's short circuited when it comes to that man.”

	Because ticket prices are so high, Whyte, a law-school graduate who is currently studying for the bar exam, says she'll have to make a significant dip into her savings in order to see Styles play live. It's a sacrifice she's prepared to make — especially since she plans on going to as many shows as she can possibly get tickets for. But Whyte tells Rolling Stone the high cost of tickets is more than upsetting — it feels antithetical to the themes Styles promotes. 


	“There's an allure of being at Harry Styles. Yes, it's Harry. But it's also about the community you join, being in the pit, dancing together, camping out. It's that feeling of belonging that keeps me coming back,” she says. “I find it ironic that the whole tour is called Together, Together, and it's this idea that we belong together, when the ticket prices clearly are saying something else.”

	Piotrowski wrote the script, which appeared on the 2023 Black List, the ranking of popular unproduced Hollywood scripts. According to Thursday's announcement, Blasphemous is characterized as a mix of The Exorcist and Training, centering on two clerics – a rookie priest (Hutcherson) and his devout mentor (Owen) who must transport a possessed young woman (Gillan) to a secure location for an exorcism. All hell breaks loose when she unexpectedly escapes, putting their lives on the line and their faith to the ultimate test.

	











	Producing are former Sony executive Scott Strauss via his recently-formed banner Badlands, Basil Iwanyk and Erica Lee for Thunder Road, and Johnson, Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia for Seven Bucks. Gillan is also producing with her partner at Red Riot Pictures, Jess Biddle.


	Rothstein, Hall, and Warren Goz will executive produce on behalf of North.Five.Six. Kimberly Bialek will oversee for Seven Bucks.


	“Blasphemous is one of the best scripts the collective producer group has ever read,” Strauss said in a statement. “It's a one-of-a-kind genre ride that features sharp dialogue, compelling characters, and powerful ideas.”


	Gillan is currently filming the latest instalment of the Jumanji franchise, which is also starring Johnson. She will then segue to shooting Chad Stahelski and Amazon's remake of Highlander.


	Hutcherson is the star of two franchises, The Hunger Games and Five Night's at Freddy's, with the latter's second instalment released this past December.


	Owen last starred as a villain in Daisy Ridley action movie Cleaner and starred as detective Sam Spade in AMC's mini series Monsieur Spade.


	Gillan is repped by UTA, Maison 2, Linden Entertainment, and Jackoway Austen while Hutcherson is repped by Gersh, TFC Management, and Hansen Jacobson. Owen is repped by CAA and Hirsch Wallerstein while Piotrowski is repped by Redefine Entertainment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","The New Epstein Files Are Reopening the Pizzagate Box","https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/epstein-files-pizzagate","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 16:27:52 GMT","

Nearly a decade ago, a 28-year-old man named Edgar Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong, a popular pizza restaurant in Washington, DC, carrying an AR-15 rifle and a revolver. He fired several shots, damaging a door, a closet lock, and the restaurant's computer equipment. Welch had driven from North Carolina on a mission: to rescue children he believed were being held in the restaurant's basement as part of a child sex trafficking ring run by members of the Democratic Party.

There were no children, nor was there a basement.

The episode marked the violent real-world culmination of Pizzagate, a pro-Trump conspiracy theory that had metastasized online in the final weeks before the 2016 election. Born on 4chan's anonymous political message board, /pol/—short for “politically incorrect”—the theory alleged that Hillary Clinton, her 2016 campaign chairman, John Podesta, and other Democratic elites were running a pedophilia ring out of Comet. Digital sleuths pored over prominent Democrats' correspondence made public by Wikileaks that fall, and certain phrases—mentions of pizza and hot dogs—were isolated, screenshotted, annotated. “Cheese pizza,” or “c.p.,” users insisted, was code for “child pornography.” A theory snowballed through Reddit, YouTube, and Rumble. Donald Trump, believers argued, would enter office and expose the network.

This phenomenon had all the hallmarks of conspiratorial thinking: patternmaking run amok, irony-poisoned message boards taken literally, paranoia weaponized for politics.

Then on Friday, the Department of Justice released roughly 3 million new documents related to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Buried in all the email correspondence was a detail complicating the cultural archaeology of Pizzagate: The word pizza appeared 911 times as of February 2, though 60 references have since been removed.

The references span years—from long before Pizzagate existed to long after it was broadly considered debunked.

“What time do you want to get pizza and grape soda tomorrow?” one associate asks Epstein in 2018.

A 2015 subject line reads: “Your Pizza Is YUMMY YUMMY!!”

“This is better than a Chinese cookie!… lets go for pizza and grape soda again. No one else can understand,” a redacted sender writes to Epstein in 2018.

But it's the sheer amount of repetition that has reopened the conspiracy box online across X, TikTok, and Reddit. Google queries for “Pizzagate” spiked over the weekend, and a TikTok video focused on the strange use of “pizza” in the files, with the caption “The elites sure love a pizza party,” has received more than 1 million views and been spammed with comments like, “We already knew this years ago and were called crazy.”

“QAnon was an op to hide this shit in plain sight and make anyone who said anything about it sound like a lunatic. They masked it in a far-right ‘it's only the dems' cover,'” argued one Reddit user. “Gloating about projection people fell for. The pizza basement was Epstein island all along,” wrote another.

Christopher Poole—better known by the handle “moot”—founded 4chan in 2003, creating what would become one of the internet's most influential and socially corrosive forums. Its current events board, /new/, eventually emerged as a breeding ground for far-right conspiracies, meme warfare, and radicalization. The board became so volatile that Poole ultimately took it down in January of 2011.

According to the newly released documents, Epstein met with Poole in late October of 2011.

“There is a cool guy (KID) that you should meet,” Boris Nikolic—a doctor, biotech investor, and former adviser to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation—writes in an email to Epstein on October 20. In other messages, Nikolic describes Poole as “one of the greatest hackers” but also “very sensitive.”

“I liked mmot [sic] alot,” Epstein writes to Nikolic on October 24 after his and Poole's introduction. “I drove him home, he is very bright.”

October 2011 is also when the /new/ replacement board, /pol/, was launched.

The timing may well be a coincidence. There is no evidence that Epstein influenced /pol/'s birth or 4chan's moderation decisions, or that Poole, who stepped down as the administrator of 4chan at the beginning of 2015, had any direct involvement with Pizzagate the following year. One email does show that Poole hoped to meet Epstein again in 2012, but beyond that, the trail goes cold.

Still, this kind of overlap shovels coal into the conspiracy engine. Pizzagate migrated quickly from 4chan to Reddit, where the then new subreddit r/Pizzagate saw 2,294 posts in 15 days in November 2016 before being shut down. Redditors also speculated that a powerful user, u/MaxwellHill, was secretly Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. The theory lacked evidence, but the recent Epstein files drop includes both a tip to the FBI that u/MaxwellHill is Maxwell and an FBI evidence log listing a screenshot of a Reddit post from the same user. (The username has since been redacted.)

None of this proves that either Maxwell or Epstein was orchestrating any sprawling online campaign, but it will keep the fires of conspiracy raging. There are too many dots to connect, and it's too thrilling to connect them. There's a lot of “pizza” in those emails, and then you add in the collisions—however fleeting—between the real Epstein network and the digital spaces that would later direct public suspicion elsewhere: at Democrats, Comet Ping Pong, and the basement that wasn't there.

Sat behind the Resolute Desk on Monday, Donald Trump told Americans it was time to “move on” from Jeffrey Epstein.

Mr Trump's second term has been marred by his one-time friendship with the paedophile and criticism over his justice department's handling of the Epstein files.

The president, who claims he has not read any of the three million documents published on Friday, is mentioned in the files along with his Mar-a-Lago resort some 38,000 times across 5,300 documents.

Recommended

And while the vast cache of emails, photographs and videos are still being poured over, so far no career-ending blows have been landed on Mr Trump.

The files are stuffed with startling claims – many of which are unverifiable – about some of the world's most powerful men, including Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Lord Mandelson, all of whom deny any wrongdoing.

For Mr Mountbatter-Windsor and the disgraced former UK ambassador to Washington, titles have been stripped and the spectre of further investigation looms.

Comparatively, Mr Trump has got off lightly – and there are clear reasons why.

Mr Trump has always maintained his relationship with Epstein which spanned from the 1980s to the early 2000s, ended several years before his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.

The Epstein files that The Telegraph has reviewed did not refute the president's timeline with the documents failing to throw up any verified encounter between the two men in the late 2000s.

While Epstein's inbox was full of emails from Lord Mandelson, Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, no such exchanges with Mr Trump have been found.

Helpfully for Mr Trump, the latest tranche of Epstein files contains many photos and references to the president that have long been in the public domain.

And the files reveal Epstein's fiery disdain for his former friend, with emails showing him invariably complaining about the now-president with the writer Michael Wolff.

The newly-released documents do contain serious accusations against the president – but they are largely unverified tips sent to the FBI. They will no doubt be scrutinised in the months to come.

Many of them – including some laid out in one particular document which was published on Friday, quickly deleted and then restored – were made after Mr Trump became president in 2016 and when his links with Epstein were already well known.

It includes FBI notes about a woman who accused Mr Trump in a lawsuit of raping her when she was 13 and and an interview with one of Epstein's victims who claimed that Ghislaine Maxwell once “presented her” to Mr Trump at a party.

Mr Trump has long denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein or any allegation of sexual misconduct.

There is no evidence such allegations were deemed credible by the FBI, although the agency has not been forthcoming about whether those claims are still being investigated.

The justice department, which has aggressively attempted to downplay Mr Trump's links to Epstein, said the allegations against Mr Trump in the documents were false.

“This time, Trump has emerged mostly unscathed, the people who thought he was involved turned against him long ago and those that support him have proved very adept at finding ways to excuse, rationalise and justify his behaviour,” Danielle Vinson, a professor of political science at Furman University, said.

Yet, the DoJ's decision to withhold two-and-a-half million pages has renewed concerns that some of Epstein's accomplices will not be held accountable and sparked further allegations of a cover-up.

Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, insisted that the withheld files either reveal victims' identities, contain child pornography or interfere with ongoing investigations.

Attempting to stamp out the conspiracies, he said: “We comply with the act, and there is no ‘protect President Trump'. We didn't protect or not protect anybody.”

While there “may be a small faction in Maga who remain disappointed or unhappy,” Prof Vinson said, “it is not directed at Mr Trump, but the DoJ and others around him”.

There is scope for further revelations to emerge owing to the sheer enormity of the available documents.

In the meantime, Mr Trump “will do all he can to turn attention away from it and hope this is the end of it. That was always his strategy, until it became impossible for him to follow it,” said Prof Vinson.

Trump's comments on Wednesday come just days after he called on Republicans to “nationalize” state-managed elections.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

In an interview with NBC News's Tom Llamas on Wednesday, President Donald Trump indicated that it's possible he won't accept the outcome of the 2026 midterms.

Asked whether he'd respect the results of the elections that will be held later this year, Trump said he would only do so if he deemed the outcomes to be legitimate.

“I will [accept the midterm outcomes] if the elections are honest,” Trump said.

Trump also said that if the elections aren't “honestly” conducted, “then something else has to happen.”

The president's judgment on what constitutes an “honest” election is highly suspect, as he has repeatedly peddled falsehoods and debunked conspiracy theories about the results of recent elections.

Within the interview with Llamas, Trump also claimed to have had “a great election” in 2024, describing it as “one of the greatest elections” ever. A closer examination of the election results from that year shows that he won by one of the thinnest margins in history, and did not secure majority support from voters. 

Despite his win in 2024, Trump told Llamas that he still “believe[d] there was cheating” involved in states he did not win.

There is no evidence to corroborate Trump's assertion that widespread fraud disrupted the results of the 2024 election, let alone any other elections for which he has made similar claims. 

Trump's comments come just days after he demanded that Republicans on Capitol Hill “nationalize” elections ahead of the 2026 midterms, ostensibly to prevent “fraud.”

“We have states that I won that show I didn't win. I won in a landslide… I won everything. I won a thing called counties,” Trump falsely claimed in an interview on Monday.

He added:

The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over — we should take over the voting in at least, many, 15 places.' … The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that are so crooked, and they're counting votes.

Article I of the U.S. Constitution dictates that although Congress can regulate how elections are run, it is the states that are charged with determining the “times, places, and manner” of holding federal elections within their boundaries.

Last month, Trump also suggested he should be allowed to “cancel” the midterm elections altogether, though he didn't say he would.

“[Democrats] have the worst policy,” Trump said in January. “How we have to even run against these people — I won't say cancel the election, they should cancel the election, because the fake news would say, ‘He wants the elections canceled. He's a dictator.' They always call me a dictator.”

Trump has a long history of refusing to agree to accept the outcome of elections. During his 2024 presidential campaign, for example, he said he would “absolutely” accept the results of the race, but only if the outcome was “fair and legal and good.”

Most notably, following his loss to former President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race, Trump didn't accept the outcome. After he and his allies lost more than 60 court cases in an attempt to delay or overturn several states' results, Trump and his campaign sought to disrupt the certification of the Electoral College through a “fake electors” scheme. When that didn't work, Trump encouraged a mob of his loyalists to head to the U.S. Capitol building, where they violently breached the building and disrupted the certification ceremony for several hours until he reluctantly called them off later that day.

Trump's allies have chalked up his previous comments about the 2026 election as jokes. But the actions of his Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as his Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Tulsi Gabbard, suggest that Trump may be up to something when it comes to this year's fall races. 

The two entities took part in a raid of an elections center in Fulton County, Georgia, earlier this month, obtaining personal information of voters from the 2020 election, which Trump infamously tried to overturn. Some experts fear the information could be used to help Trump and his GOP allies figure out new ways to disenfranchise voters under the guise of “election reform.”

Gabbard's involvement is unusual, as the Office of the DNI typically focuses on matters of national security and foreign policy. Gabbard justified her participation in the raid by citing her “broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security.”

However, her involvement could suggest that her inquiry, which is separate from the DOJ's investigation, may focus on allegations that foreign nations interfered with the 2020 election, one of many false conspiracy theories that Trump promoted following his loss that year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","You Can't Kill Swagger","https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2026/02/washington-post-sports-section-cut/685888/","Thu, 05 Feb 2026 02:47:00 GMT","

My old corner of The Washington Post raised some of the best journalists in the business.

On a frigid white January afternoon in 1982, an airplane took off from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport for Florida, remained aloft for about 30 seconds, and then stalled out and collided with the 14th Street Bridge, plunging into the ice-floe-studded waters of the Potomac River. In The Washington Post's newsroom, an aghast 24-year-old college-basketball reporter named Michael Wilbon watched live reports of the disaster on the mounted TV banks, heard the urgency among those around him, grabbed a notebook and his jacket, and ran toward the riverbank to report on the rescue efforts, because that was what he'd been schooled to do. He never got a byline—his name never appeared on the story.

Reminiscing in a phone call with me last night, Wilbon recalled that the old offices of the Post's editors, at the newspaper's former building on 15th Street, had glass walls inside—so on the night of the crash, he could see Ben Bradlee, the executive editor, and his deputies huddling. “They were meeting,” Wilbon remembered. “They kept meeting. So finally, I said, Well, let's just fucking go.” Trailing Wilbon was another 20-something college-sports reporter named John Feinstein. They interviewed witnesses and rescuers, then hustled over to an old Marriott hotel at the Arlington mouth of the bridge, where they huddled by a phone reading their notes to someone in the office taking dictation. Feinstein, who died last year, didn't get a byline either; cub reporters often didn't. It was just what he'd been schooled to do. (He did become a best-selling author, though. Wilbon later got famous co-anchoring ESPN's Pardon the Interruption.)

For some years now, the Washington Post newsroom has defied gravity, thanks to the internal ethic just described. Usually, when people in an office distrust feckless leaders, when they are subjected to corporate verbiage that bounces off the face and leaves a rage headache behind—phrases such as reevaluating our model and reposition, used to obscure the catastrophic fact that approximately 300 jobs, or a third of the newsroom, have been “eliminated” (the contemptible formulation by which Post staffers were laid off today)—they will subtly gear down their efforts. But my former colleagues do the opposite. For every half-wit decision by a poseur in a 42-long, slim-fit suit, they report even harder. This ethic has been especially true in the renowned Sports section, which was killed in a Zoom announcement notable for its belly-wriggling cowardice and self-owning incompetence. The Post's publisher, Will Lewis, and its executive editor, Matt Murray, apparently did not have enough brace in their back to face the newsroom in person.

Read: The murder of The Washington Post

The Post Sports section is, was, no ordinary section, in heritage or in coverage. It was habitually young, because it required hiring people with no sense of off-the-clockness: Events happen at nights and on weekends, on tough deadlines that require sprinting stadium stairs and downing a pack of smoked almonds for a late dinner. Donald Graham, the Post's longtime publisher, spent time as Sports editor when he was learning the family trade. His Sports successor, George Solomon, liked to spot good young talent cheap and let us run—and ran us ragged. “Hey,” he said to me once during a hectic NFL season, “I need you to stop in Green Bay on your way home from Dallas.”

We moved in a close group. Every two years, eight or 10 of us would fly off to the Olympics in some international city. For two and a half weeks, we'd have a choice between eating and sleeping; the deadlines didn't allow for both. We reported shoulder to shoulder in narrow press pens in stadium bowels so dank and sweaty that, as my ex-colleague Barry Svrluga has said, “it's like working inside someone's mouth.”

At the Beijing Summer Olympics, in 2008, we were so exhausted from the round-the-clock work that we threw blankets and sheets over a table to make a tent and stuck a pillow on the floor beneath it. You could crawl in there and catch a nap. We named it “the Happy Place,” and when someone was sleeping, we'd put stick-'em notes on their clothes—I once drew a picture of a gas gauge with the needle on empty and stuck it on a colleague—and take pictures of them. When deadline was finally over, at 3 a.m., we'd entertain ourselves with a liquored-up singing game that our colleague Liz Clarke named “Stupid-Guy Anthems.” In Sochi, we learned a Russian hockey anthem from a couple of young guys running an all-night café. At the end of every Olympics, our editor Tracee Hamilton would crack open a Guinness and recite the St. Crispin's Day speech from Henry V, about “we happy few.” We laughed so hard that the New York Times staffers sitting in their office beyond a plywood wall would shush us—for which we would toss pencils at them.

We came from all over, competed desperately to outwrite one another, teased one another mercilessly, loved one another. One day, Feinstein said to John Ed Bradley, our mellow-voiced football writer from Louisiana, “Hey, John Ed, did you marry your huntin' dog Red yet?” I loved to kid my desk-mate Christine Brennan, who was from Toledo, “Hey, Chris, what'd you do for fun yesterday? Leave the butter out overnight?”

We had the best writers in the country and did more with less, and we knew it with a swagger. In addition to Wilbon and Feinstein, Solomon found a young writer named David Remnick, who once wrote of the basketball player George Gervin that he was “sinuous as smoke.” That was before Remnick got an urge to become a foreign correspondent and went off to win a Pulitzer covering the demise of the Soviet Union—it was what he'd been schooled to do. (Eventually, he became the editor of The New Yorker.)

Remnick was trained by Solomon, as we all were, to grab the pen and go, and to regard sportswriting as merely another portal through which to report on the broadest subjects: labor issues, performance enhancement, domestic violence, racism, sexism, terrorism, global corruptions such as vote-buying in the Olympics. Journalism as Solomon, Graham, Bradlee, and others had taught us didn't change with the subject. And it was an ethic as much as a job, about responsibility to other people. “If you're late, we're all late,” Solomon told me. “If you're wrong, we're all wrong.” Not a bad way to mature an unfinished young person.

The Washington Post's sportswriters could cover anything—and did—because we were taught to look with a hard eye, write vividly and observationally, and hit our deadlines no matter what, which made other section bosses always want us. Remnick was just one of the earliest examples of the Sports section turning out great foreign and national correspondents. Isabelle Khurshudyan, a hockey writer, won honors covering the war in Ukraine and became the Post's Kyiv bureau chief. Chico Harlan, a baseball writer, became a foreign bureau chief in East Asia and then Rome. Eli Saslow, a sports feature writer, went on to win a Pulitzer writing about American poverty. David Nakamura, a college-sports writer, broke stories about poisoned drinking water in Washington, D.C.; corresponded from Afghanistan and Pakistan; and now covers the Justice Department.

In 2011, Rick Maese, a sports feature writer, went to Japan on vacation with his wife, the Metro staffer Erin Cox. While they were there, an earthquake hit, followed by a tsunami, followed by a nuclear meltdown. They spent their trip covering the Fukushima disaster. The baseball writer Chelsea Janes, like me, also covered presidential campaigns; the plundering of our staff by National editors was a continual irritant to our Sports bosses, though they were proud of us.

The now-retired Liz Clarke wrote a memorable magazine story about Bruce Springsteen and spent years doggedly investigating the Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder for allowing a culture of sexual harassment and assault to fester within the team office; after Clarke and her fellow reporter Will Hobson finally chased down the story and got it into print, the fallout eventually forced Snyder to sell.

Clarke, a North Carolinian, worked with a gentle singing voice with which she asked the toughest questions of NFL billionaires. I liked to imitate her talking with an NFL owner this way: “Of course, a role as lofty as yours does come with certain prerogatives of judgment,” she'd say with a soft smile. “But I wonder if it might not be the smallest misstep and breed the teeniest bit of mistrust in the team to go with a quarterback who thinks hydration is tequila and ranch water?”

In addition to writing political profiles, I was recruited to cover the September 11 attacks in New York—I stuck my driver's license and a $20 bill in my sock and ran all the way downtown—as well as two hurricanes. Right after Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, I stood in front of a huge map in the newsroom with the editors Liz Spayd and Phil Bennett, who were trying to decide exactly where to send me. After a pause, Bennett said, “Texas is big.” We settled on Mississippi. I met up with the photographer Jonathan Newton, a hurricane veteran who had pallets of water and gas cans strapped down in an SUV, as well as a boxful of cigarillos. He handed me one. We smoked them to kill the smells.

Only the people who live their work in a newsroom will understand this: One of the best things I ever tasted was shots of Maker's Mark, neat, shared in a Mississippi motel parking lot at 1 a.m. with Newton and other photographers, out of a makeshift bar in the back of an SUV. We'd spent the day covering the damage that Katrina, with its 26-foot wall of water and 160-mile-per-hour winds, had wrought—had seen boats on freeway medians and a piano in a treetop at Jefferson Davis's old home—and our dinner was whiskey and fried pickles, and it was good. We shared a room at a Hampton Inn where the door wouldn't lock because the floods had ruined the electronics, and we brushed our teeth together.

You'd think a newspaper that has so botched its finances, and that is trying to do more with less, could use people with such ethic and versatility. “We should have been the last ones in the room,” Wilbon told me last night.

One of the most valuable things lost with the killing of the Sports section will be the Post's sense of proper training of the young. After I covered my first Army-Navy game, the great columnist Thomas Boswell took me to dinner and talked writing. My first Olympics was the Calgary Games in 1988, and I wrote well out of sheer excitement. When I got home, the columnist Tony Kornheiser, now Wilbon's longtime Pardon the Interruption co-host, told me, “You did great. But listen. This is your level now, all the time. You don't retreat from this level.” I did 10 Olympics for the Post. At the Athens Games, in 2004, I took pleasure in watching the young Svrluga lift his own writing game out of sheer excitement. “This is your level now,” I told him. “You don't retreat from it.”

That's who we were, and who we are. I say “we” because I left The Washington Post for The Atlantic five months ago, after 30 years at the paper, and I still have the reflexes and the friends. I also feel an anger at the demise of the Sports section—about 40 of 45 people fired, the rest thrown to other sections—that cannot be extinguished, and that only grows as more details emerge. This superb section was treated the following way:

The Post's Olympics writers were notified just 10 days ago, right before some of them were scheduled to depart for the Milan Games, that their coverage was canceled—with little explanation. Just 36 hours later, management reversed itself and quietly suggested: Well, okay, four writers could go, but with the understanding that they could be laid off during the assignment. This is the sort of managerial aimlessness the Post is being governed by, just one example of the missteps and squandering of opportunity framed as strategy.

The Olympics writers were given a choice: If laid off, they could either fly home or finish the assignment. “I know what they'll do,” the Sports editor Jason Murray told me on the phone last night. “I know who they are.” They will finish the assignment. Svrluga, the most knowledgeable Olympics writer in the country, who has been “eliminated,” filed a comprehensive story on Mikaela Shiffrin while knowing that the knife was at his neck. This morning, I texted him: “Will you keep filing from there?” I got a one-word answer.

“Yes.”

Another of those laid off was the deputy Sports editor, Matt Rennie, a quarter-century veteran of the paper who happens to be the single finest thinker and pencil-wielder I have ever worked with at any level. Rennie cleared out his desk Monday and last night without a single piece of straight information from leadership about his fate; he simply assumed that he was laid off because no one said anything to him, and no one stopped him, either. At home, he wrote a note to colleagues that hit the nail on the head: “The people making these decisions have failed in their responsibility to our readers, whom they never took the time to know, and have undermined—likely irreparably—the ideals of an institution they never bothered to try to understand.” These moves, he added, “ultimately, will power the Post's competitors.” The best Sports section that ever was has been destroyed by people who failed to even notice what a jewel they had.

Anne Applebaum: Readers don't trust dirty tricks

The irony in this situation is that Will Lewis and Matt Murray have rendered themselves unemployable anywhere else (who would have them after this?), whereas Post Sports staffers will no doubt be much in demand. As Rennie wrote to his colleagues, “Whenever and wherever we land—and we will—we'll be comin'. And hell is comin' with us.”

I disagree with Rennie about just one thing: I'm not sure the damage to the Post is irreparable. Jeff Bezos, its billionaire owner, only thinks he owns the Post, and Lewis and Murray only think they run it. At the heart of the institution is something that no one can ever own: the Wilbonian core trained into all of us, an impulse to run to the riverbank that these bumbling strangers who have hobbled the publication will never grasp.

In this article

Amazon is slated to report fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday. 

Here's what analysts polled by LSEG are expecting: 

Wall Street is also looking at other key revenue numbers: 

Cloud revenue growth will once again be a major focus for investors after the unit expanded 20.2% last quarter, up from 18% in the second period. Analysts are looking for 21.4% growth in the fourth quarter.

Investors are also listening for any updates to Amazon's spending plans around artificial intelligence. In the third quarter, the company said capital expenditures were on pace to hit $125 billion in 2025 and that the number will likely increase this year. 

As it rapidly invests in AI, Amazon has been aggressively slashing costs elsewhere inside the company. Amazon said last week it would lay off about 16,000 employees across its corporate workforce, after cutting roughly 14,000 staffers last October. 

CEO Andy Jassy has said the layoffs are also part of a broader effort to reduce bureaucracy and speed up innovation, so it can operate like the ""world's largest startup."" 

The job reductions coincided with a week of controversy for Amazon, where it faced scrutiny over its $75 million investment in a documentary about the first lady and its response to the recent fatal shootings by federal agents in Minnesota.

Amazon has been racing to build data centers and other infrastructure to meet a surge in AI demand. Last October, the company opened an $11 billion AI data center called Project Rainier, built exclusively to run workloads from Claude creator Anthropic. 

Amazon is simultaneously strengthening its ties to Anthropic rival OpenAI. The ChatGPT maker agreed last November to buy $38 billion worth of cloud computing services from Amazon over the next seven years. 

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Jassy are also in ongoing talks about the possibility for Amazon to invest up to $50 billion in the startup. CNBC reported Wednesday that the companies are weighing further collaboration, including using OpenAI's models to power Amazon's Alexa voice assistant, as well as other internal projects. 

Investors have been pressing Amazon for more clarity around its AI strategy. 

The company continues to fight the perception that it's an ""AI laggard,"" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a Tuesday research note.

""Amazon remains positioned as one of the worst performers among the Mag 7 given fears around the company being an AI laggard,"" the analysts wrote. ""While we don't expect 4Q earnings to be the magic bullet that changes these fortunes, we do expect another positive earnings outcome to continue to chip away at this underperformance and believe Amazon can be one of the largest outperformers in our coverage in 2026.""

Amazon has released a flurry of AI products across its cloud computing, e-commerce, devices and software divisions as it looks to keep pace with similar releases from competitors like OpenAI and Google. 

Agentic shopping has recently emerged as one of the key battlegrounds in the AI industry. Amazon has moved to build its own services, while blocking those created by its rivals. Jassy told investors last quarter that the company expects to partner with third-party agents at some point.

During the fourth quarter, Amazon shuttered its Fresh and Go grocery chains, marking the latest evolution of its brick-and-mortar strategy. The company expects to convert some of those stores into Whole Foods locations, and it will continue to offer Fresh grocery delivery.

Markets 




Hot Stocks 




Fear & Greed Index 





            Latest Market News 





            Hot Stocks 





            Bitcoin is acting weird.
    


            The world's most famous cryptocurrency has tumbled 44% from its October peak, falling below $70,000 Thursday for the first time in 15 months.
    


            That decline is actually not unusual at all. Crypto is notoriously volatile, and it's gone through numerous crashes that are bigger than this one.
    


            What's strange is this: Bitcoin's four-month slump has come at a time when, in theory, it had everything going for it.
    


            Crypto bulls have long advocated that investors treat bitcoin as “digital gold,”  a new safe haven investment where traders can store funds when times are tough.
    


            So now would be a logical time for a safe haven to surge.
    


            Geopolitics have gotten spicy this year: President Donald Trump is threatening to attack Iran after the United States removed the leader of Venezuela. The US president has recently been going after allies in Europe and Canada over Greenland, and he's threatening higher tariffs on South Korea.
    


            Meanwhile, significant AI advances are giving stock market investors the heebie jeebies. Anthropic's Claude can now perform tasks for law firms, sending software shares plunging.
    


            Fear gauges are flashing warning signs. CNN's Fear and Greed Index is solidly in “fear” mode, and the VIX volatility index was briefly at its highest point since November, when the market had a mini-meltdown over confusing post-shutdown economic data and Nvidia earnings. (It was a simpler time.)
    


            That fear has powered a record rally in gold prices, which recently blew past $5,500 a troy ounce. Gold is the ultimate safe haven: a relatively rare and tangible asset that stores value – and is able to be literally hidden under a mattress if worse came to worst.
    


            But bitcoin isn't coming along. It's lost 20% this year despite all the uncertainty. In fact, Michael Burry, (the “Big Short” guy), recently wrote on his Substack that he believes gold and silver's extreme volatility in recent days is because bitcoin bulls are selling off their metal positions to save face from crypto's slide.
    


            Bitcoin's bust means it lost its entire “Trump bump.” Crypto investors cheered Trump's victory in November 2024, sending bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies surging, after Trump embraced the digital assets he once shunned, and instead pledged to remove regulations that he said were holding crypto back.
    


            So what's behind this new crypto winter? Mostly doubts that bitcoin is “digital gold,” after all.
    


            Bitcoin has been swept up in all the “risk-off” sentiment flowing through the market. Rather than giving investors reason to buy, traders are seeing that fear as a reason to sell. The continued divergence between gold (up 24% since October) and bitcoin (down 44%) has only solidified that sentiment.
    


Maxine Waters' ‘Can you shut him up' moment with Scott Bessent, explained



            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent didn't help matters Wednesday, when he testified before the House Financial Services Committee that the Treasury has no authority to stabilize crypto markets.
    


            Bitcoin ETFs also haven't taken off quite the way that crypto bulls had expected, and institutional investment in bitcoin has declined in recent months, reducing trade volumes. That has exacerbated knee-jerk reactions from everyday traders.
    


            But there may be light at the end of the crypto tunnel for bitcoin investors. This crash is not a new trend – we've been here before.
    


            In 2014, crypto prices imploded after crypto exchange Mt. Gox was hacked. The largest bust happened in 2018, when bitcoin tumbled 74%, fueled by fear that the explosion of initial coin offerings was overdone. And crypto had back-to-back crashes in 2021 and 2022, after regulatory pressure and the FTX scandal shattered confidence.
    


            Each time, bitcoin has bounced all the way back within a year and a half.

I often have ideas while cleaning around, cooking, etc. Claude Code (with Opus 4.5) is very capable. I've long wanted to get Claude Code working hands-free.So I took an afternoon and rolled my own STT-TTS voice stack for Claude Code.

It can use `osascript` for OS integration, browse the web via Claude Code's builtin tools...My back is thankful. This is really fun.[1]: https://github.com/jlucaso1/whatsapp-rust

On the other hand, it makes me wonder if we're just heading for a future where everyone is just always working, at all times, even while doing other things.“Wow look at our daughter taking her first steps! She's doing so… wait hold on… No, Claude. I said to name the class “potatoes”, not “‘pot' followed by eight ‘O's,” you dumb robot!”

Rather than the example of missing first steps, what if we had, ""Ok Claude, prepare a few slides for my presentation, I'm going to watch my childs mid-day recital..."" maybe you get a success/failure ping and maybe even need to step out for part of the event, but in another world you couldn't have gone at all.

It was great when LLMs had 4,000 or 8,000 token context windows and the biggest challenge was efficiently figuring out the most likely chunks of text to feed into that window to answer a question.These days LLMS all have 100,000+ context windows, which means you don't have to be nearly as selective. They're also exceptionally good at running search tools - give them grep or rg or even `select * from t where body like ...` and they'll almost certainly be able to find the information they need after a few loops.Vector embeddings give you fuzzy search, so ""dog"" also matches ""puppy"" - but a good LLM with a search tool will search for ""dog"" and then try a second search for ""puppy"" if the first one doesn't return the results it needs.

The best way to search I think is a coding agent with grep and file system access, and that is because the agent can adapt and explore instead of one shotting it.I am making my own search tool based on the principle of LoD (level of detail) - any large text input can be trimmed down to about 10KB size by doing clever trimming, for example you could trim the middle of a paragraph keeping the start and end, or you could trim the middle of a large file. Then an agent can zoom in and out of a large file. It skims structure first, then drills into the relevant sections. Using it for analyzing logs, repos, zip files, long PDFs, and coding agent sessions which can run into MB size. Depending on content type we can do different types of compression for code and tree structured data. There is also a ""tall narrow cut"" (like cut -c -50 on a file).The promise is - any size input fit into 10KB ""glances"" and the model can find things more efficiently this way without loading the whole thing.

A few hundred lines of text is nothing for current LLMs.You can dump the entire contents of The Great Gatsby into any of the frontier LLMs and it's only around 70K tokens. This is less than 1/3 of common context window sizes. That's even true for models I run locally on modest hardware now.The days of chunking everything into paragraphs or pages and building complex workflows to store embeddings, search, and rerank in a big complex pipeline are going away for many common use cases. Having LLMs use simpler tools like grep based on an array of similar search terms and then evaluating what comes up is faster in many cases and doesn't require elaborate pipelines built around specific context lengths.

When I last tried this with some Gemini models, they couldn't reliably identify specific scenes in a 50K word novel unless I trimmed down the context to a few thousands of words.> Having LLMs use simpler tools like grep based on an array of similar search terms and then evaluating what comes up is faster in many casesSure, but then you're dependent on (you or the model) picking the right phrases to search for. With embeddings, you get much better search performance.

An LLM will implicitly decompose a prompt into tasks and then sequentially execute them, calling the appropriate tools. The architecture diagram helpfully visualizes this [0]Here though, planners means autonomous planners that exist as higher level infrastructure, that does external task decomposition, persistent state, tool scheduling, error recovery/replanning, and branching/search.

What's clever is treating memory as filesystem ops rather than vector stores. For codebases this works great since code has natural structure (imports, function calls) that grep understands. The question is whether this scales to truly unstructured knowledge where semantic similarity matters.Would love to see benchmarks comparing retrieval accuracy vs a proper embedding pipeline on something like personal notes or research papers.

I've used OpenClaw for 2 full days and 3 evenings now. I simply don't believe people are using this for anything majorly productive.I really, really want to like it. I see glimpses of the future in it. I generally try to be a positive guy. But after spending $200 on Claude Max, running with Opus 4.5 most of the time, I'm just so irritated and agitated... IT'S JUST SO BAD IN SO MANY WAYS.1. It goes off on these huge 10min tangents that are the equivalent of climbing out of your window and flying around the world just to get out of your bed. The /abort command works maybe 1 time out of 100, so I end up having to REBOOT THE SERVER so as not to waste tokens!2. No matter how many times I tell it not to do things with side effects without checking in with me first, it insists on doing bizarre things like trying to sign up for new accounts people when it hits an inconvenient snag with the account we're using, or it tried emailing and chatting to support agents because it can't figure out something it could easily have asked ME for help with, etc.3. Which reminds me that its memory is awful. I have to remind it to remind itself. It doesn't understand what it's doing half the time (e.g. it forgets the password it generated for something). It forgets things regularly; this could be because I keep having to reboot the server.4. It forgets critical things after compaction because the algorithm is awful. There I am, typing away, and suddenly it's like the Men in Black paid a visit and the last 30min didn't happen. Surely just throwing away the oldest 75% of tokens would be more effective than whatever it's doing? Because it completely loses track of what we're doing and what I asked it NOT to do, I end up with problem (1) again.5. When it does remember things, it spreads those memories all over the place in different locations and forgets to keep them consistent. So after a reboot it gets confused about what is the truth.

It's a little slow sometimes, but it's the first time I've felt like I have an independent agent that can handle things kind of.The only two things I did were 1. Ask it to create a Monero address so I could send it money, and have it notify me whenever money is sent to that address. It spun up its own monerod daemon which was really heavy and it ran out of space. So I had to get it to use the Monero wallet instead, but had to manually intervene to shut down the monerod daemon and kill the process and restart openclaw. In the end it worked and still works.
2. I simply asked it ""@ me the the silver price every day around 8am ET"" and it just figured out how to do it and schedule it. To my understanding it has its own cron functionality using a json file.
3. Write and host some python scripts I can ping externally to send me a notificationI've had it done other misc stuff, but ChatGPT is almost always better for queries, and coding agents + Zed is much better for coding. But with a cheap enough vm and using openrouter plus glm 4.7 or flash, it can do some quirky fun stuff. I see the advantage as mainly having control of a system where it can have long term state (like files, processes, etc) and manage context itself. It is more like glue and it's full mastery and control of a Linux system gives it a lot of flexibility.Think of it more as agent+os which you aren't getting with raw Claude or ChatGPT.I've done nothing that interesting with it, it's absolutely a security nightmare, but it's really fun!

What I've always wanted: a morning briefing that pulls in my calendar (CalDAV), open Todoist items, weather, and relevant news. The first three are trivial API work. The news part is where it gets interesting and more difficult - RSS feeds and news APIs are firehoses. But an LLM that knows your interests could actually filter effectively. E.g., I want tech news but don't care about Android (iPhone user) or MacOS (Linux user). That kind of nuanced filtering is hard to express as traditional rules but trivial for an LLM.

reply

If all you want to do is schedule a task there are much easier solutions, like a few lines of python, instead of installing something so heavy in a vm that comes with a whole bunch of security nightmares?

reply

Yeah, absolutely. And that was going to be my approach for a personal AI assistant side project. No need to reinvent the wheel writing a Todoist integration when MCPs exist.The difference is where it runs. ChatGPT Tasks and MCP through the Claude/OpenAI web interfaces run on their infrastructure, which means no access to your local network — your Home Assistant instance, your NAS, your printer. A self-hosted agent on a mac mini or your old laptop can talk to all of that.But I think the big value-add here might be ""disposable automation"". You could set up a Home Assistant automation to check the weather and notify you when rain is coming because you're drying clothes on the clothesline outside. That's 5 minutes of config for something you might need once. Telling your AI assistant ""hey, I've got laundry on the line. Let me know if rain's coming and remind me to grab the clothes before it gets dark"" takes 10 seconds and you never think about it again. The agent has access to weather forecasts, maybe even your smart home weather station in Home Assistant, and it can create a sub-agent, which polls those once every x minutes and pings your phone when it needs to.

My point was specifically about the news filtering part, which was something I had tried in the past but never managed to solve to my satisfaction.The agent's job in the end for a morning briefing would be:  - grab weather, calendar, Todoist data using APIs or MCP  
  - grab news from select sources via RSS or similar, then filter relevant news based on my interests and things it has learned about me  
  - synthesize the information above

The steps that explicitly require an LLM are the last two. The value is in the personalization through memory and my feedback but also the ability for the LLM to synthesize the information - not just regurgitate it. Here's what I mean: I have a task to mow the lawn on my Todoist scheduled for today, but the weather forecast says it's going to be a bit windy and rain all day. At the end of the briefing, the assistant can proactively offer to move the Todoist task to tomorrow when it will be nicer outside because it knows the forecast. Or it might offer to move it to the day after tomorrow, because it also knows I have to attend my nephew's birthday party tomorrow.

An embedding-based memory system (letta, mem0, or a self-built PostgreSQL + pgvector setup) lets you retrieve selectively and only grab what's relevant to the current query. Much better fit for anything beyond a narrow use case. Your assistant doesn't need to know your location and address when you're asking it to look up whether sharks are indeed older than trees, but it probably should know where you live when you ask it about the weather, or good Thai restaurants near you.

No one is trying to get you to use openclaw or nanobot, but now that they exist in the world, our agents can use the knowledge to build better tooling for us as individuals. If the projects get a lot of stars, they become part of the global training set that every coding agent is trained against, and the utility of the tooling continues to increase.I've been running two openclaw agents, and they both made their own branchs, and modified their memory tooling to accommodate their respective tasks etc. They regularly check for upstream things that might be interesting to pull in, especially security related stuff.It feels like pretty soon, no one is going to just have a bunch of apps on their phone written by other people. They're going to have a small set of apps custom built for exactly the things they're trying to do day to day.

OpenClaw currently has 1.8k issues, 400k lines of code, had an RCE exploit discovered just a few days ago, it takes 5 seconds to get a response when I type ""openclaw"" in my CLI and most of the top skills are malware. I'm pretty sure training on that repository is the equivalent to eating a cyanide pill for a coding model.I actually agree with your take that custom apps will take over a subset of established software for some users at some point, but I don't think models poisoning themselves with recklessly vibecoded bloatware is how we get there at all.

Vibe-coded projects are high-velocity but low-entropy. They start fast, but without the ""real-world learnings"" baked into collaborative projects, they often plateau as soon as the problem complexity exceeds the creator's immediate focus.

The thing people are losing their shit over with OpenClaw is the autonomy. That's the common thread between it, Ralph and Gastown that is hype-inducing. It's got a lot of problems but there's a nugget of value there (just like Steve Yegge's stuff)

They are basically keep breaking different feature on every release.

The problem is local models aren't as good as the ones in the cloud. I think the success stories are people who spent like 2-4k on a beefy system to run OpenClaw or these chatbots locally.The commands they run are, I assume like detailed versions of prompts that are essentially: ""build my website."" ""Invest in stocks."" And then watch it run for days.When using claude code it's essentially a partnership. You need to constantly manage it and curate it for safety but also so the token count doesn't go overboard. With a fully autonomous agent and unlimited token count you can assign it to tasks where this doesn't matter as much. Did the agent screw up and write bad code? The point is you can have the system prompt engage in self correction.

Or have they have found a way to use their brains on what they deem as more useful, and less on what is rote?

reply

I just keep coming to the conclusion about devs who use agents or other AI tooling extensively: these are programmers who did not like to program.

reply

reply

But I am talking about shell scripts here, cronjobs, maybe small background services. And I would never dare publish these as public applications or products. Both because I feel no pride about having ""made"" these - because, you know, I haven't, the AI did - and because they just aren't public facing interfaces.I think the main issue at the moment is that so many devs are pretending that these vibecoded projects are ""products"". They are not. They are tailor-made, non-recyclable throwaway software for one person: The creator. I just see no world at the moment where I have any plausible reason to use someone else's vibecoded software.

One of Earth's most dangerous glaciers has claimed a victim: a suite of instruments that became trapped deep within the ice.

A team of researchers from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) was working to place instruments beneath Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier to understand how the ice was melting from below. Partway through the descent, the team faced a major setback as the instruments got lodged in the ice, ending the research project before it even began.

“Fieldwork in Antarctica always comes with risk,” Keith Makinson, BAS oceanographer and drilling engineer, said in a statement. “You have a very small window in which everything has to come together. While this outcome is deeply disappointing, the data we did recover are scientifically valuable and will help shape future efforts.”

Also known as the Doomsday Glacier, Thwaites could add up to 25 inches (65 centimeters) to global sea level rise if it were to completely collapse. That's enough to flood low-lying cities and displace millions of people.

The giant mass of ice is largely unstable, and very little is known about the warming waters that flow beneath the glacier that cause it to melt from below. The scientists and engineers behind the recent expedition set out to measure the ocean conditions beneath Thwaites Glacier's fast-moving main trunk.

To peek at what's going on underneath the glacier, the team used hot water to create holes in the ice and began lowering a suite of instruments to collect data. The borehole was approximately 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) deep and around 11 inches (30 cm) wide and needed to be continuously maintained to prevent it from refreezing.

The team temporarily deployed the instruments beneath the ice, collecting measurements that revealed turbulent ocean conditions and relatively warm waters capable of melting the glacier from below. The researchers then attempted to lower a mooring system, which was meant to remain within the ice for one to two years and transmit data through a satellite.

As the mooring system was making its way down, however, the instruments got stuck in the borehole about three-quarters of the way down. This was likely due to the water refreezing or the glacier's rapid movement.

Unfortunately, there was no time left for the researchers to repeat their efforts, as the ship returning them to New Zealand was bound to leave on February 7. Facing a tight schedule and worsening weather conditions, the team was forced to abandon the instruments trapped in the ice.

“Failure is always an option when you are pushing at the limits of scientific exploration,” Peter Davis, BAS oceanographer and member of the drilling team, said in a statement. “We know heat beneath Thwaites Glacier is driving ice loss. These observations are an important step forward, even though we are disappointed the full deployment could not be achieved.”

This was the team's second attempt to deploy a suite of instruments beneath Thwaites Glacier. In 2022, the researchers were unable to reach the site due to severe sea-ice conditions.

This time around, they succeeded in drilling through the ice and partially lowering the instruments beneath the glacier. Not only that, the team managed to gather unprecedented data about the warming waters below Thwaites Glacier.

“This is not the end,” chief scientist and professor Won Sang Lee of South Korea said in a statement. “The data show that this is exactly the right place to study, despite the challenges. What we have learned here strengthens the case for returning.”

Michael Carrick has made a significant change to Manchester United's training schedule as he continues to revamp the club's methods after taking over from Ruben Amorim as interim boss at Old Trafford. Carrick has overseen three straight wins at the club since stepping into the dugout.

Carrick has made a significant change to United's post-match training routine, having overseen three wins from three in his time in the Old Trafford dugout. Now, players are allocated a day off immediately after a game, a change from both the methods of Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag, per The Sun. Both of those managers insisted on recovery sessions the day after a game, and players who had not played at least 45 minutes were subjected to a full training session. Carrick has changed that; players are now given the day after a game off, and the recovery session takes place the day after. Carrick has relaxed a number of rules at United, with the players also turning up later to the stadium on a matchday; Ten Hag would have his charges arriving at least four hours prior to kick-off.

Carrick has overseen impressive victories over Manchester City, Arsenal, and Fulham since taking over from Amorim, although he is having to deal with a number of injury problems. Both Mason Mount and Patrick Dorgu are currently battling fitness issues.

On Mount's fitness, Carrick said: ""Just took a bit of a knock in training, it is nothing serious, he will be back very very soon.""

But on Dorgu, he struck a more sombre note, adding: ""Pat, unfortunately, he's going to be out for a period of time. We're still working through how long that's going to be. We weren't sure whether it was a little bit of cramp or whether it was something a little bit more serious and at the moment it looks a little bit more on the serious note.""

Carrick admitted the timing is cruel for Dorgu, adding: ""So, it'll be a few weeks for that. How many weeks? We'll have to wait and see. That's disappointing for all of us really - and especially for Pat - he's in such a good place, but unfortunately it is part of football.""

United's players are clearly buying into Carrick's methods, with the club now sitting fourth in the Premier League table, although they are 12 points behind leaders Arsenal. Nevertheless, defender Harry Maguire, who has appeared reborn under Carrick, has hailed the work of the ex-Middlesbrough boss.

He said: ""It was absolutely massive. We know that the first game, the derby at Old Trafford, you're always up for them and you know that one-off results can happen, so we had to back it up today. We spoke about it before the game, coming to the league leaders, who have been excellent this year I must say, they ask a lot of questions of you, to come here and have the setback late on to get the winner, it was a magnificent performance. Michael's [Carrick] come in, he's been brilliant with us, he's brought a fresh energy in, the group's really galvanised. Two tough games, everybody's probably thinks we come away from them with not many points but to win both is magnificent.""

Kevin-Prince Boateng has revealed that he “had to lie” about his love for Cristiano Ronaldo in order to become a team-mate of Lionel Messi at Barcelona. The former Ghana international completed a shock move to Camp Nou in 2019. After sealing that switch, it was made clear to him that he was not to speak in glowing terms about CR7 or Clasico rivals Real Madrid.

Boateng found that tough as he was a boyhood Blancos supporter. With colours being nailed to the Santiago Bernabeu mast, Ronaldo - as a five-time Ballon d'Or winner and the club's all-time leading goalscorer - was held up as a source of inspiration.

Back in 2019, though, Catalunya was all about Messi. The Argentine GOAT was very much king at Camp Nou and nobody was allowed to question his authority. Boateng found that out the hard way when being readied for his first press conference.

He told Unscripted by Josh Mansour of the briefing that ruled any Ronaldo fandom out of the equation: “I always said I wanted to play for Real Madrid. I had to lie in a press conference because prior to that, two years before when I played in Las Palmas, they asked me who my favourite player was and I said Cristiano Ronaldo and I said my favourite team was Real Madrid!

“Signing for Barcelona, they said to me ‘your favourite team is Barcelona and the best player in the world is Lionel Messi'. They said ‘you have to otherwise you can't play here, it is impossible'. I sat there in the press conference and the first question was who was the best player in the world and I said ‘Lionel Messi'.”

Boateng's move to Barca only came about after Messi gave a green light to the deal. The South American superstar saw every transfer agreement run by him before everything was signed off.

Boateng, who joined the Blaugrana on loan from Italian outfit Sassuolo, said: “He had that power. I was going to sleep hoping that Leo likes me or sees me in the team. I was like tomorrow I can sign my shirt with Barcelona, but if Leo says ‘no' I will not be going to sign the contract!”

While remaining a big fan of Ronaldo, Boateng admits that witnessing Messi's ability at close quarters left him questioning whether football was still the sport for him. He told DAZN in 2020: “Training with Messi left me speechless. I had always said that Cristiano Ronaldo was the best in the world, but Messi is something else. He's not normal. While training with him, I felt inadequate for the first time in my career. He was doing incredible things. I felt like saying, 'I'm done, I'm going to quit playing!'”

Not everything about Messi was positive, though, with Boateng telling Rio Ferdinand Presents: “So we come in the dressing room, he's just sitting there on his phone [and] gets a massage sitting down. Two minutes before we go out, he just stands up, closes his boots, and goes out. The warm up for the Champions League game against Liverpool, [we did the] crossbar challenge and then he goes back inside. [The] coach made the last adjustment, [Messi] is on the phone face-timing [and] 30 seconds before we go out he just comes and puts his jacket on and BOOM, goal, goal, goal.” 

He added on that approach being detrimental to some of the club's younger stars: “That's what the young players did in Barcelona: Malcom, [Ousmane] Dembele, they looked at him and they didn't train so then going to the game, they got injured. He's the only one in the world that can do that.”

Boateng only made four appearances for Barcelona before returning to Italy. He retired from playing in 2023 having also represented the likes of Tottenham, Portsmouth, AC Milan, Fiorentina, Monza, Eintracht Frankfurt, Herta Berlin and Schalke over the course of a nomadic career.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

	When Chante Whyte saw Harry Styles announce his fourth studio album, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, her first thought was blinding joy at the return of her favorite artist. But once the dates were announced for its accompanying tour, there was another feeling that threatened to overtake it: worry. 


	“I promise you, I had heart palpitations every single night thinking about what the Ticketmaster war was going to be like,” she tells Rolling Stone. 


	While the Together, Together Tour doesn't start until May 16, tickets sales have already started for almost every date. But fans who signed up for artist and Amex presale were shocked to discover many tickets going for upward of $1,000. Part of this is because he is Harry Styles — an international pop star who's had all of his studio projects debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 — but also a former member of the boy band One Direction. Styles hasn't toured for several years and has a reputation for virtually disappearing after finishing a round of shows, meaning many audience members fear that missing out on a ticket could mean waiting another three years — at least — to see him again. There's also the fact that Together, Together is significantly smaller than past Styles tours, with just 67 dates in 11 cities, including a 30-night run at Madison Square Garden. And the demand is astronomical — more than 11 million people queued up for 500,000 tickets for shows in the New York City area. 

	











	And while all these components drive demand, Styles fans also have to contend with the music industry's longtime battle with ticket sellers. High ticket prices have been a problem for decades — fans complained about how much it cost to see the Rolling Stones in these very pages back in 1969 — but in the past few years, artists and fans have become increasingly vocal about it. In September, the Federal Trade Commission sued Live Nation and Ticketmaster, alleging the ticket platforms hide fees from consumers and encourage bots to purchase large swaths of tickets and drive up the resale price. Ticketmaster denied the allegations, but announced several changes to the platform, including banning of multiple accounts and shutting down price tracking tool TradeDesk. But while the lawsuits and ongoing controversy continue, Styles' fans are still eager to find tickets — and they're going to extraordinary lengths to see their favorite artist live.

	For Daniella Barone, 24, getting tickets is about more than having a good time on a night out. It's her second chance to experience a fandom she loves. The illustration student goes to college in Florida but is originally from Venezuela. She planned to be at a Miami show in 2020 but had to leave the country to receive her green card. Then Covid-19 hit, closing the embassy and leaving her stuck in Venezuela for several months. By the time she was able to come back to the U.S., the concert had been canceled. 


	“I've been listening to One Direction since I was 11, and I'm 24 now,” she says. “I've always loved Harry's music, but I also love the fandom. It's like a little family. That's always something that has really appealed to me; having that community.” 


	She tells Rolling Stone that the minute she saw the tour announcement, she knew she had to get cash fast. But as a student, she needed a job that didn't interfere with her heavy class schedule. Her answer? Plasma donation. She's donated twice and plans to keep the donations up until she can afford two tickets and plane fare to New York. Everything else? Well, she's not as sure. “I can only eat once a day, but I've done it before!” she says, laughing. (The practice is generally considered safe for those 17 and over who fit certain medical requirements, according to Mayo Clinic and the American Red Cross Association, but it's important to wait at least 28 days between donations.)

	Ava Engle, 18, had a similar idea. The San Diego State University student describes herself as an avid concertgoer. “I've fought a lot of Ticketmaster wars,” she says. But as a college student, she tells Rolling Stone her schedule has severely limited the type of work she can do to get money and keep up with classwork. She's deathly afraid of needles, but after failing to find a Styles ticket under $1,000 during the official Ticketmaster sale, she signed up for plasma donation. 


	Each session nets her around $90, which she says adds up when she also takes on tutoring gigs. During school breaks, she also makes minimum wage working at the front desk of a swim club, so pooling together from all three, she's hopeful she'll have enough. But having to put so much work into the same tickets some people paid $200 for at the last tour still makes her frustrated. 


	“I'm terrified of needles, and I was so scared,” she says. “Being in the chair, I was having second thoughts. Like, ‘What am I doing?' I just want to see one of my favorite artists. We shouldn't have to be doing all of this just to afford tickets for one night.” 

	











	Since the tour went on sale, fans have maintained their outrage over ticket prices. Even Styles' former bandmate Zayn Malik appeared to reference the controversy at his Jan. 28 show. “I just want to say a big, big thank you to every single one of you for being here tonight,” he said onstage. “Hopefully the ticket prices weren't too high. Just saying.” As ticket prices have skyrocketed, fan behavior around concerts has also changed. For major stars like Styles, Billie Eilish, and Olivia Rodrigo, who have a younger fan base, many concertgoers offset ticket costs by buying cheaper floor tickets without seats and then camping overnight in front of the stadium in order to be as close as possible to the stage. (Even those tickets can cost $400 to $900 or more.) But there's also a lack of transparency about how many low-cost tickets are actually available in the first place, which fans say makes purchasing feel less like a first-come-first-serve system and more like a lottery. (Representatives for Styles cold not be reached for comment on ticket prices.) On Wednesday, Styles announced that he was playing “one night only” in Manchester, England, where all tickets would cost £20. Fans are invited to “request” tickets starting Friday. So far, more than 1.4 million people have liked that post on Instagram.


	“I do everything right. I'm not a bot. So the fact that I'm still [100,000th] in line and then when I get in, I see the ticket prices, and there's barely anything available, and it's all over $1,000 or like, $700 and they're not even amazing seats. It's so frustrating,” Engle says. “It's like, ‘Harry, what are we doing?'”


	Aaron Fern, 28, wasn't a huge One Direction fan. But when he heard Styles' first solo album, he fell immediately in love. Styles has been one of his top artists every year since 2019. When he and his friends saw the tour announcement, he immediately rushed to their group chat. “It was like, ‘We need to get tickets,'” he says. “It felt like, ‘We need to go now,' or else it's going to be another five years until we see him.” 


	Fern signed up for dozens of presale opportunities for the shows at Madison Square Garden — but he's still planning to go into more credit card debt to buy tickets. His expected budget was around $1,000 for two tickets, but after failing at several presales, he says he's going all in and just looking for second jobs. “I'm really surprised. I don't blame [Harry] because it's like blaming the weatherman for the weather. But it is crazy,” he says. “I'm looking for bartending gigs, restaurant work, record stores. Anything that I feel like I have experience in but could also make me money the quickest.” 

	











	When Whyte, 25, thinks about her dozens of times attending Styles concerts, she calls them “life-altering” experiences full of friendship and community. “Last time Harry went on tour, I went to almost 30 shows. It's actually kind of insane,” she says, laughing. “I tell my mom all the time, there's a brain cell that's short circuited when it comes to that man.”

	Because ticket prices are so high, Whyte, a law-school graduate who is currently studying for the bar exam, says she'll have to make a significant dip into her savings in order to see Styles play live. It's a sacrifice she's prepared to make — especially since she plans on going to as many shows as she can possibly get tickets for. But Whyte tells Rolling Stone the high cost of tickets is more than upsetting — it feels antithetical to the themes Styles promotes. 


	“There's an allure of being at Harry Styles. Yes, it's Harry. But it's also about the community you join, being in the pit, dancing together, camping out. It's that feeling of belonging that keeps me coming back,” she says. “I find it ironic that the whole tour is called Together, Together, and it's this idea that we belong together, when the ticket prices clearly are saying something else.”
