                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Findings demonstrated that psychosocial factors, including healthy eating motivation, confidence in maintaining healthy eating habits, and social support from family and friends, were consistently associated with better diet quality. Researchers also evaluated participants' perceptions of their local food environment, alongside measures of diet quality, fruit and vegetable intake, fiber intake, and ultraprocessed food consumption. The availability of fresh fruits and vegetables in the community and the importance participants placed on food quality, price, and selection when choosing where to shop were also linked to healthier dietary intake. On average, participants reported eating 2.6 cups of fruits and vegetables per day and 15 grams of fiber daily. These numbers are similar to national averages, but still below recommended intake levels. Nearly 40% of participants reported experiencing household food insecurity, and roughly half lived in households earning less than $50,000 per year. These results reinforce the need for multifaceted approaches to improving nutrition. Rural adults face elevated risks for diet-related health conditions, yet nutrition behaviors in these communities are shaped by more than just access to food. Our findings highlight that motivation, confidence, and support for healthy eating — along with the local food environment — all play meaningful roles in shaping diet quality."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ability to run medical services from a PC is essential in today's digital landscape. The need to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and ease of use is also more prevalent than ever, though this is not a new requirement in the medical sector. PC-based audiometry has seen significant advancements in recent years. It offers improved features, increased user support, and an increasing capacity to integrate seamlessly into clinical practice. PC-based audiometry also stores data rapidly and easily, helping to prepare for further stages of a subject's rehabilitation. Non-PC-based audiometers are familiar to many professionals and offer a rapid testing solution; however, these instruments do not integrate into current EMR systems, slowing down the process by adding further steps to the workflow. This results in a more connected, efficient, and streamlined clinical workflow. The transition to PC-based audiometry is straightforward, offering a number of key advantages. Conventional audiometry leverages manually controlled devices and often requires significant time-consuming paperwork. PC-based audiometers streamline these tasks via the upfront preparation and automation of a range of behaviors before prompting the next steps. Traditional audiometers typically have high upfront costs, particularly in the case of models designed for bone conduction testing or speech audiometry that boast many features or special abilities. PC-based audiometers generally feature user-friendly interfaces, including simple menus, touch screens, and clear instructions. While a historic focus has been on physical reports and record files, these hardcopy data formats were not easy to access across larger systems. Each patient has individual needs, and PC-based systems can better accommodate personal preferences by making the overall workflow more tailored to specific patient requirements. For instance, an audiologist working with a child may alter a tests' loudness, pitch, duration or use more detailed tests when working with older patients. It is also possible to apply test protocols and parameters across wide computer system installations, ensuring that all users in an organization perform tests in the same way. Many PC-based audiometric systems have built-in tools, however, allowing hearing data to be analyzed and presented in various formats. PC-based audiometers enable rapid visualization of relevant audiometry and tympanometry data in graphical form, minimizing human bias in interpreting thresholds and allowing more objective findings. PC-based audiometers also enable simpler communication of the results to subjects and healthcare providers, and the digital storage of test data allows audiologists to more easily track changes in a patient's hearing over time. Long-term data is highly beneficial when looking to track hearing loss, as well evaluating the success of treatments like surgeries or hearing aids. Seamless connectivity via PC-based systems allows instant access to patient data, allowing timely and informed decision-making. Ultimately, this integration is key to facilitating a bespoke, task-focused end-to-end workflow.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mozambique is the first country to restart preventive vaccination, following the halt in 2022 caused by the global surge in cholera cases that drove up demand and led to shortages of oral cholera vaccine (OCV) stocks. The preventive vaccination campaign begins amid an ongoing cholera outbreak and the aftermath of floods that affected more than 700 000 people and displaced many. The floods disrupted health systems and damaged water systems, further increasing the risk of waterborne diseases such as cholera. We are now in a stronger position to break that cycle. I thank EUBiologics, currently the only manufacturer producing cholera vaccines at the scale needed for mass vaccination campaigns, for its efforts, and urge others to enter this vital space. A first allocation of 20 million doses is being deployed for preventive campaigns. Of these, 3.6 million doses were delivered to Mozambique; 6.1 million to the Democratic Republic of the Congo that is also experiencing significant outbreaks; and 10.3 million doses are planned for delivery to Bangladesh. Following sustained efforts by global agencies, manufacturers and partners, annual global supply of OCV has doubled from 35 million doses in 2022 to nearly 70 million doses in 2025. "The multi-year surge in cholera cases and resulting unprecedented demand for vaccines were stark reminders that sustainable, accessible vaccine supply is a global public good – and the world cannot afford complacency," said Dr Sania Nishtar, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. "We are grateful to our partners and manufacturers, particularly EUBiologics, for the collaboration that has made the resumption of these essential preventive campaigns possible, and to Gavi's donors, whose support enables us to finance the global OCV stockpile and life-saving outbreak and preventive campaigns." "For the first time in years, this increase in vaccines will allow us to better prevent large-scale cholera emergencies," said Catherine Russell, UNICEF Executive Director. "Resuming preventive cholera vaccination will protect children and help stop this highly contagious disease in its tracks. But it must go hand in hand with other efforts, including better access to safe water and basic sanitation." The three countries were chosen based on allocation criteria set out by the Global Task Force for Cholera Control (GTFCC), a partnership of over 50 organizations, to ensure cholera vaccines for preventive campaigns are distributed systematically, equitably and transparently. Preventive vaccination helps shield communities and buys critical time. However, lasting progress will depend on long‑term investment in infrastructure, for which political commitment is indispensable," said Dr Ilesh Jani, chair of the Steering Committee of the GTFCC. The restoration of preventive vaccination has been made possible by years of sustained efforts and close collaboration among agencies, manufacturers, and other partners to meet the continued high demand to respond to outbreaks, expand production capacity and streamline allocation, ensuring that limited supplies reach the places where the risk and public health impact are greatest. One dose of OCV provides short-term protection for at least 6 months and can help bring outbreaks under control, while two doses provide protection against infection for longer - 3 years. More than 600 000 cases of cholera or acute watery diarrhoea and nearly 7600 deaths were reported to WHO from 33 countries last year, although these are underestimates as cholera remains underreported. Cholera deaths, however, have continued to increase over the same period. Vaccination is only one aspect of cholera prevention and response.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gavin Newsom, who is eyeing a presidential bid, has incensed both Democrats and Republicans over immigrant health care in his home state, underscoring the delicate political path ahead. For a second year, the Democrat has asked state lawmakers to roll back coverage for some immigrants in the face of federal Medicaid spending cuts and a roughly $3 billion budget deficit that analysts warn could worsen if the artificial intelligence bubble bursts. Newsom has proposed that the state not step in when, starting in October, the federal government stops providing health coverage to an estimated 200,000 legal residents — comprising asylees, refugees, and others. Progressive legislators and activists said the cost-saving measures are a departure from Newsom's "health for all" pledge, while Republicans continue to skewer Newsom for using public funds to cover any noncitizens. Newsom's latest move would save an estimated $786 million this fiscal year and $1.1 billion annually in future years in a proposed budget of $349 billion, according to the Department of Finance. State Sen. Caroline Menjivar, one of two Senate Democrats who voted against Newsom's immigrant health cuts last year, said she worried the governor's political ambition could be getting in the way of doing what's best for Californians. "You're clouded by what Arkansas is going to think, or Tennessee is going to think, when what California thinks is something completely different," said Menjivar, who said previous criticism got her temporarily removed from a key budget subcommittee. And he slammed Newsom for continuing to cover California residents in the U.S. without authorization. It's a political tightrope that will continue to grow thinner as federal support shrinks amid ever-rising health care expenses, said Guian McKee, a co-chair of the Health Care Policy Project at the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs. Should Newsom run, McKee added, the priorities of Democratic primary voters — who largely mirror blue states like California — look very different from those in a far more divided general electorate. Americans are deeply divided on whether the government should provide health coverage to immigrants without legal status. Even in California, support for the idea has waned amid ongoing budget problems. In a May survey by the Public Policy Institute of California, 41% of adults in the state said they supported providing health coverage to immigrants who lack legal status, a sharp drop from the 55% who supported it in 2023. Trump, Vice President JD Vance, other administration officials, and congressional Republicans have repeatedly accused California and other Democratic states of using taxpayer funds on immigrant health care, a red-meat issue for their GOP base. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz has accused California of "gaming the system" to receive more federal funds, freeing up state coffers for its Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal, which has enrolled roughly 1.6 million immigrants without legal status. California state officials have denied the charges, noting that only state funds are used to pay for general health services for those without legal status because the law prohibits using federal funds. Instead, Newsom has made it a "point of pride" that California has opened up coverage to immigrants, which his administration has noted keeps people healthier and helps them avoid costly emergency room care often covered at taxpayer expense. "No administration has done more to expand full coverage under Medicaid than this administration for our diverse communities, documented and undocumented," Newsom told reporters in January. Newsom warns the federal government's "carnival of chaos" passed Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he said puts 1.8 million Californians at risk of losing their health coverage with the implementation of work requirements, other eligibility rules, and limits to federal funding to states. Nationally, 10 million people could lose coverage by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Health economists have said higher numbers of uninsured patients — particularly those who are relatively healthy — could concentrate coverage among sicker patients, potentially increasing premium costs and hospital prices overall. Immigrant advocates say it's especially callous to leave residents who may have fled violence or survived trafficking or abuse without access to health care. Federal rules currently require state Medicaid programs to cover "qualified noncitizens" including asylees and refugees, according to Tanya Broder of the National Immigration Law Center. With many state governors yet to release budget proposals, it's unclear how they might handle the funding gaps, Broder said. For instance, Colorado state officials estimate roughly 7,000 legal immigrants could lose coverage due to the law's changes. Both states, like California, expanded full coverage to all income-eligible residents regardless of immigration status. Their elected officials are now in the awkward position of explaining why some legal immigrants may lose their health care coverage while those without legal status could keep theirs. California lawmakers last year voted to eliminate dental coverage and freeze new enrollment for immigrants without legal status and, starting next year, will charge monthly premiums to those who remain. Even so, the state is slated to spend $13.8 billion from its general fund on immigrants not covered by the federal government, according to Department of Finance spokesperson H.D. This includes green-card holders who haven't yet met the five-year waiting period for enrolling in Medicaid. Calling the governor's proposal "arbitrary and cruel," Savage-Sangwan criticized his choice to prioritize rainy day fund deposits over maintaining coverage and said blaming the federal government was misleading. It's also a major departure from what she had hoped California could achieve on Newsom's first day in office seven years ago, when he declared his support for single-payer health care and proposed extending health insurance subsidies to middle-class Californians. "I absolutely did have hope, and we celebrated advances that the governor led," Savage-Sangwan said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Announcing a new article publication for BIO Integration journal. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound nanoparticles secreted by cells and have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for osteoarthritis (OA). To enhance therapeutic efficacy, EVs can be bioengineered to improve biological activity and targeting capacity toward specific cells or tissues. Strategies for EV engineering primarily involve modifications to cargo, membranes, or the pretreatment of parental cells. In recent years advances in EV engineering have led to growing interest in the application of engineered EVs for OA treatment, offering new possibilities for clinical translation. Finally the remaining challenges and future directions necessary to advance EV-based therapies toward clinical use in OA are outlined. Liu, J., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research in U.S. firefighters reveals how workplace practices, personal factors, and environmental exposures shape PFAS levels, offering insights into practical strategies to reduce long-term chemical exposure risk. Study: Predictors of serum per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) levels among U.S. career firefighters. In a recent study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, researchers investigated factors predicting serum concentrations of multiple per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) among American firefighters. The findings identified distinct personal and workplace predictors for specific PFAS analytes rather than uniform effects across all compounds, reflecting differences in chemical subclasses and exposure pathways and highlighting potential targets for exposure-reduction interventions. PFAS are synthetic chemicals widely used for their water- and grease-resistant properties and are often referred to as “forever chemicals” due to their environmental persistence. They are present in numerous consumer and industrial products, including aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF), textiles, cookware, and food packaging, resulting in widespread contamination of air, water, soil, and food. As a consequence, nearly the entire U.S. population has detectable PFAS levels, with these compounds accumulating in human tissues over the years. Exposure has been associated with adverse health outcomes, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, endocrine disruption, and accelerated biological aging. Firefighters may experience elevated PFAS exposure through occupational use of AFFF, combustion of PFAS-containing materials, contaminated dust, and contact with protective gear. Previous studies have reported higher serum PFAS concentrations among firefighters and identified limited predictors such as years of service and blood donation. However, knowledge of modifiable individual- and organizational-level predictors remains limited. Researchers evaluated agency-level, occupational, lifestyle, and demographic predictors of serum PFAS concentrations in a large, multi-state cohort of United States firefighters. This cross-sectional analysis included 2,056 participants from the Fire Fighter Cancer Cohort Study (FFCCS), a national cohort established to examine occupational exposures and health outcomes. Participants provided blood samples between July 2023 and October 2024 during baseline or follow-up visits and were employed at fire agencies across seven states. Individual-level data were collected via electronic surveys covering demographics, lifestyle behaviours, health history, firefighting practices, and occupational exposures. Agency-level data, including departmental policies and resources, were obtained from designated fire service liaisons. Blood samples were processed and analysed for 20 PFAS analytes using a standardized CDC laboratory method. Eight analytes with concentrations above the limit of detection in at least 75% of participants were included in the primary analyses. Results were reported as percent changes in geometric mean concentrations with corresponding confidence intervals. The cohort was predominantly male, White, and non-Hispanic, with a mean age of 40 years and an average firefighting career length of 14 years. All eight primary PFAS analytes were detected at high frequencies. Age was positively associated with all measured compounds, while female firefighters exhibited significantly lower concentrations across analytes. Drinking water source also influenced exposure: bottled water was associated with lower concentrations of certain PFAS (notably PFOA-related measures and PFNA), whereas well water use was associated with higher concentrations. Military service was associated with elevated PFAS-related measures. Longer service duration, higher rank, and current AFFF use were primarily associated with increased concentrations of PFOA-related analytes rather than uniformly higher PFAS levels. Protective practices such as on-scene decontamination and participation in hood swap or cleaning programmes were associated with lower concentrations of some PFAS, particularly PFOA-related compounds. Practices such as washing gear before storage, providing gear bags, frequent dusting of living quarters, and the use of reverse osmosis water filtration were associated with reduced concentrations of specific PFAS analytes, for example, PFNA. Conversely, carpeted station living areas were linked to higher levels. Some findings were unexpected, including higher PFHxS levels in departments with marked contamination zones and higher PFHpS concentrations under less frequent dusting schedules, suggesting complex, potentially compound-specific exposure pathways. This study identified multiple individual- and department-level predictors of serum PFAS concentrations among United States firefighters, underscoring the importance of both personal behaviours and workplace practices. Associations with age, sex, military service, drinking water source, and AFFF use were consistent with prior research, while novel findings emerged for firefighter rank and specific agency policies. Notably, blood and plasma donation were strong predictors of lower PFAS concentrations, supporting evidence that these practices may reduce body burden. Protective occupational practices and station policies were associated with lower concentrations of selected analytes rather than across all PFAS, highlighting heterogeneity between subclasses and exposure routes and pointing to actionable intervention opportunities. Strengths of the study include its large sample size, multi-state design, and integration of individual- and agency-level data. Despite these constraints, the findings provide valuable evidence to guide PFAS exposure-reduction strategies. She has experience in teaching, science writing, and mangrove ecology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research explores how attention difficulties, sleep disruption, and cognitive control challenges intersect with internet use patterns, highlighting lifestyle factors like exercise that may help reduce risk while underscoring the need for cautious interpretation of cross-sectional findings. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hyperactivity, inattention, cognitive deficits, emotional impulsivity, and learning difficulties. IA has also emerged as a substantial public health concern. Despite evidence of co-occurrence, the precise directional relationship remains unclear. Because this study used a cross-sectional design, causal relationships cannot be established, and the findings should be interpreted as associations rather than cause-and-effect relationships. Executive dysfunction is a common comorbidity in ADHD, affecting domains such as attention control, working memory, inhibitory control, and planning. Executive function (EF), which broadly refers to cognitive processes involved in self-regulation, organization, and goal-directed behaviour, plays a key role in impulse control. Deficits in EF may elevate the risk of IA among individuals with ADHD. Insomnia, which is also common in people with ADHD, may further aggravate executive dysfunction. These relationships may be bidirectional, as problematic internet use itself can worsen sleep patterns. Previous studies have reported that physical activity can reduce IA symptoms and improve mental health outcomes. Physical activity may also alleviate executive dysfunction and insomnia. However, most prior research has examined these factors in isolation, with limited attention to their combined effects. Consequently, the complex interactions among physical activity, sleep, executive function, and IA remain underexplored, particularly in non-Western educational settings such as Chinese universities, where digital engagement patterns may differ. In the present study, researchers evaluated associations among ADHD symptoms, IA, insomnia, and executive dysfunction. Students aged 16 years and older from six universities in Hunan, China, were recruited, and surveys were administered in June 2024. The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) was used as a screening tool, comprising hyperactivity and inattention subscales, with scores ranging from 0 to 9. Executive dysfunction was assessed using the Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale, Short Form (BDEFS-SF), with higher scores indicating more severe impairment. A total CIAS-R score above 53 indicated clinically significant IA symptoms. Information on physical activity, including duration, frequency, and type, was also collected. Group differences were assessed using chi-squared tests for categorical variables, and Mann–Whitney U tests for continuous variables. Mediating effects of insomnia and executive dysfunction in the relationship between ADHD symptoms and IA were evaluated using structural equation modelling. This method identifies statistical associations but cannot confirm causality or temporal ordering. The study initially recruited 2,188 students, of whom 263 were excluded due to incomplete responses, yielding an analytic sample of 1,925 participants. Among these, 14 percent met criteria for IA symptoms, and 12.5 percent met criteria for ADHD symptoms. No significant differences in age, sex, or academic grade were observed between participants with and without IA symptoms. Because the data were cross-sectional, these mediation findings should be interpreted cautiously, as temporal sequencing cannot be confirmed. Compared with no physical activity, moderate physical activity was negatively associated with IA symptoms, and this association was stronger at high levels of physical activity. These relationships were also mediated by executive dysfunction and insomnia. Low levels of physical activity were not significantly associated with IA symptoms. Unmeasured factors such as stress, mood symptoms, or academic pressure may also have influenced these associations. Overall, ADHD symptoms were associated with IA symptoms in Chinese college students, with insomnia and executive dysfunction acting as mediating factors. Moderate and high levels of physical activity were associated with lower IA risk, with the association mediated by sleep quality and executive function. These findings suggest that interventions for IA may benefit from addressing sleep, physical activity, and executive functioning. Longitudinal and interventional studies are needed before firm clinical recommendations can be made. Tarun is a writer based in Hyderabad, India.
