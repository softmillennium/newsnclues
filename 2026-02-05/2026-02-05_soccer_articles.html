                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Mexican state of Jalisco has issued a health alert and mandated face masks in schools due to a measles outbreak in the state capital ZAPOPAN, Mexico -- The Mexican state of Jalisco on Thursday issued a health alert and mandated the use of face masks in schools as a measles outbreak hit the state capital, a key host city for the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup. Jalisco is the epicenter of the outbreak, with 1,163 cases confirmed this year and 2,092 suspected cases, according to Mexico's government. Cases surged in Mennonite communities — which have high rates of vaccine hesitancy — and have rippled out across Mexico in the country's biggest outbreak in decades. Scientists say rising outbreaks across the hemisphere are linked to declining vaccination rates. Jalisco health authorities announced Thursday that masks will be required in Guadalajara schools across seven specific neighborhoods for the next 30 days. Classes were also recently suspended in 15 schools in Jalisco and the central state of Aguascalientes due to outbreaks of the highly contagious airborne virus. Both governments have requested a two-month extension to try to control the outbreak, although in January the Trump administration withdrew from the World Health Organization, under whose umbrella PAHO operates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Welcome to the ranking that will probably get this writer in trouble. Piecing together the top 25 players in MLS is a tricky thing. 1 should come as absolutely no surprise (folks: it's Messi). But it's everything in between where the debate really begins. The issue is simple: there are a lot of very good players in this league right now, all impacting winning teams in very different ways. So these rankings are based on a bit of everything - the numbers, the eye test, and, yes, a little bit of what players actually mean. Some housekeeping: players signed this offseason are not included (i.e. Timo Werner). Neither are deals that have yet to be fully announced (looking at you, Minnesota and James Rodríguez). Newer faces who made an immediate impact but saw their seasons cut short by injury also miss out - sorry, Wessam Abou Ali. The D.C. United striker was fantastic for Philadelphia Union last year, and led the Golden Boot race at one point. The attacking midfielder provides goals and assists wherever he plays, and has offered double-digit goal contributions in every full season he has played in MLS. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Musa was brought in on a big money deal in 2024, and settled into MLS nicely with 16 goals and three assists. Dallas showed real improvement on the pitch, too - with Musa central to their efforts. Tverskov doesn't play sexy football, but he is immensely reliable. White has quietly been a regular provider of goals since 2021, but hit new levels in 2025. He bagged 25 in all competitions last year, enough to earn him a USMNT look, and a shot at making Mauricio Pochettino's side for the World Cup. The Brazilian's production dropped off in an injury-marred 2025 season, but even then, his quality cannot be denied. He was vital in LA Galaxy's MLS Cup run in 2024, and, now fully fit, seems primed to return to form. Arfsten was linked with a move to Europe for a large portion of January, which would indicate just how handy he is at left back. Excellent going forward but always improving defensively, Arfsten has earned a spot in the USMNT setup - and will certainly be a solid backup when Pochettino's team takes the field this summer. To be sure, he had been an excellent goalkeeper for some time, but last season he made headlines, coming up with crucial saves in big moments, and getting the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year nod that he thoroughly deserved. Since then, he has only challenged himself further by moving to Inter Miami. It was an immense surprise to see Philadelphia offload Glesnes, who was among the best center backs in MLS last year. Tall, physcial, and tify with the ball at his feet, he bailed out the Union week in and week out. His best years may be behind him, but his three All Star nods and 2022 Defender of the Year acknowledgement prove that he is a true talent. Luna is certainly the most likable player in MLS, and a true advocate for his community. But he's also devastatingly good on the pitch. In 2025, he tallied double-digit goal contributions for the second year in a row and is on track to improve ahead of this season. Sure, there were a couple knocks, but he was vital for a very good Cincinnati defense, and played himself into the picture for the USMNT at the World Cup. And there's still plenty of soccer to come from a player named an All-Star last year. When fit, Puig is a top-three player in MLS, and there shouldn't really be a debate there. He was immense in 2024, leading LA Galaxy to an MLS Cup win that very few saw coming. But back-to-back ACL surgery leaves his career at a crossroads. Still, if he reaches full fitness again, the La Masia product shall certainly be right back among the league's best. Sure, the Whitecaps' attack made headlines, but their defensive spine set everything up. The story goes that Nashville wanted Mukhtar to be their main man before they even existed. Indeed, they called him in 2019 to set everything up. He is the perennial presence for the reigning U.S. Open Cup champs, tallying 16 goals in MLS alone last year. He was also named an All-Star for the third season straight. Surridge is very good at doing one thing: scoring loads of goals. There are very few strikers in MLS with his raw finishing ability, and Nashville make pretty good use of it, too. He bagged 25 goals last year and was named an MVP finalist on the back of his best season in the league to date. Those 12 assists - helped, no doubt, by his deadly set piece ability - don't look too bad, either. Roldan's performance in the Leagues Cup final against Inter Miami should be studied. He has been a mainstay for the Sounders since 2015, yet managed his first All-Star nod in 2025. Evander, more than anything, is immensely fun to watch. The kid who watched Ronaldinho in his formative years has brought a specific kind of flair to Major League Soccer. Thirty-one goal contributions weren't a bad start to life in Cincinnati, either. He tallied 32 goals in all competitions and developed a deadly partnership with Son Heung-Min. There are rumors that the Gabonese international could leave the league for big money - which would be an immense loss for MLS and LAFC alike. And if Messi was the undisputed main man, then De Paul did everything else. They dub him "Messi's bodyguard" in Argentina, and it's easy to see why, with De Paul running midfields by himself - while also making sure that the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner is more than protected. He always seemed to be a smart signing for San Diego, but very few could have predicted just how good he would be. An All-Star selection was more than deserved, and SDFC will be immensely grateful to have him for at least two more years. And there was no adjustment period for the Korean, either. Odds are, he will be even better in 2026. Muller dubbed himself an "interpreter of space", which really doesn't mean all that much, but sounds pretty good. In practice, it was remarkably effective for the Whitecaps. Muller's numbers were good - 11 goal contributions in 12 matches - but his impact was even more significant. Vancouver went from good to great when he joined, and that's no coincidence. Messi had the best season in MLS history. He also smashed pretty much every playoff record available, too. He penned a multi-year deal to stick around in Miami for the foreseeable future.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack of All Trades, Difference Maker: Weston McKennie's Moment Has Arrived The USMNT will rely on key players to step up and perform at a high level at the World Cup. Christian Pulisic will need to create and score goals, the midfield will need to be controlled by Tyler Adams, Folarin Balogun has to lead the attacking line, and Chris Richards is going to be tasked with leading the defense. McKennie has always been a talented player and has shown that he can fill nearly any position on the field. That has been helpful as he's able to fill gaps in the lineup but at times kept him from establishing himself as a starter in a single position in his club career. That began to change last season with Juventus, but this season he is proving that a jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one. His versatility was recognized as he was named the Juventus' player of the Month for January after scoring three goals in seven games. Last year, Thiago Motta talked about McKennie's ability to play multiple positions, noting “he has played fullback, holding midfielder, attacking midfielder, winger. He's a top-level player.” Motta went on to note that, “Weston plays everywhere, and he has to be on the field. It's hard for me to leave him out. Maybe not as a goalkeeper, but in every other position, it's difficult to put him on the bench. That's what being a top-level player means.” What's exciting about McKennie is that the USMNT has never had a player like him playing at this high of a level and unique talents like him have made the difference for championship winning sides. McKennie has a chance to add his name to the likes of similar players like James Milner and Federico Valverde. Currently, he is solidly in the prime of his career and playing the best soccer of his life for Juventus. That aspect of his game is well known, but his versatility and ability to play anywhere also make him the kind of player who can make a lung busting run to break up an attack or find space to score while opponents are focused on shutting down Pulisic and Balogun. He's always been a special player with unique skills, this summer those abilities will be on the world's stage and give the team a chance to exceed expectations and change the way the world looks at American soccer. The home kit has a chance to be an icon The league has a chance to innovate and keep its best players Fans want to get excited for the World Cup, but sky high costs have people feeling priced out.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. After a whirlwind free agency period highlighted by the situations of Trinity Rodman and Sophia Wilson, the 2026 NWSL regular season is nearly a month away. While the league will welcome a new season, two expansion teams, and its first-ever 16-team, 30-game campaign, clubs will celebrate roster moves as they build during preseason camps. Expansion sides Denver Summit FC and Boston Legacy FC are obvious teams that made new player acquisitions for their inaugural seasons, while Portland Thorns FC and Washington Spirit made key signings to retain their biggest stars. NWSL clubs can also complete interleague transfers until October. The introduction of the HIP rule also presents a new financial mechanism for teams to sign marquee players who meet specific criteria. Schlegel opted into free agency, and North Carolina now have a player who can contribute in attack, is effective on aerials, and is unafraid to get physical. Alyssa Naeher and Katie Lind, Chicago Stars FC: The longest tenured player for Chicago Stars FC is back once again on a one-year contract for her 11th season. Having an iconic goalkeeper you can trust in Alyssa Naeher, while locking in a player who can contend for a starting spot with Katie Lind, means the Stars will feel secure in net throughout the long season. New head coach Emma Coats is already using her U23 England credentials to recruit youth internationals to the NWSL, but it might be the players with NWSL experience who need to lead the way. Bay FC made things official by making Brooklyn Courtnall's loan more permanent with a new three-year deal. If you're the gambling type, make sure you bet on yourself with the same confidence as forward Midge Purce. The 30-year-old two-time NWSL champion re-signed with the club on another one-year deal after a late season comeback from an ACL injury she sustained in 2024. There's always a mix of anticipation and grace whenever an expansion side builds out its inaugural roster. When Boston Legacy FC signed Brazilian international Amanda Gutierres, it immediately placed some expectation on their attacking game ahead of their debut season. The 24-year-old was a 2025 Ballon d'Or nominee, thanks to her proficient goal scoring. She was the co-leading goal scorer for Brazil at the 2025 Copa America Femenina and is a two-time Golden Boot winner in Brazil (2023, 2024) with Palmeiras. San Diego then parted ways with winger Delphine Cascarino, their 2025 NWSL MVP finalist, and simmered some of the reaction. There's no use crying over what could've been, and if anything, there's still plenty to look forward to as the move reunites her with Brazilian teammate Dudinha. Utah Royals made an early offseason move in a trade with the Washington Spirit for Japanese international midfielder Narumi Miura. With connective passing and defensive efforts, she's often the link between her defensive teammates and the attacking line. Her addition to Utah's roster could alleviate some of the playmaking responsibilities from Japan national teammate Mina Tanaka. One day, we will all look back on this past offseason and laugh that the first player announced with the intent to use future HIP money was Lindsey Heaps, not Rodman. Back when the club introduced Heaps, general manager Curt Johnson clarified that conversations with Heaps began before the HIP rule was introduced. With the player's arrival set for June and a debut potentially as late as July, the mechanism could very likely be in play. The 23-year-old defender joined PSG following a standout college career at Notre Dame and won the Coupe de France, making 45 appearances. She also made UEFA Women's Champions League history by becoming the youngest American to score in the knockout rounds at 21. Mace was a key figure for Kansas City Current, especially during their 2025 NWSL Shield campaign. A versatile defensive piece who can function as both center and outside back, Mace often contributed to a historic season where Kansas City led the league and set a record for regular-season clean sheets, and she was named to the NWSL Best XI second team in 2025. In a major intraleague move, Angel City bolstered their backline and traded for Orlando Pride defender Emily Sams. The $650,000 intraleague transfer fee is a record for the highest fee ever paid for a defender in the NWSL and signals a clear trajectory for Angel City moving forward. Sams signed with her new club through 2028 and had requested a trade to pursue new challenges in the league. She'll be getting one as Angel City conceded 41 goals last season (third most in the league) and struggled on set-piece defending. The move immediately pairs Sams with club captain Sarah Gorden, an NWSL veteran who is sturdy and realiable. One-third of the U.S. women's national team's attacking trio, dubbed "triple espresso," Wilson has made one of the more intriguing free-agent moves this offseason. The club had periods of navigating ownership changes and rotating head coaches, but with enough talent on the roster, they have found a way into consecutive playoff appearances, and the Thorns were able to maintain that with and without Wilson. The USWNT striker exercised her player option (a first-of-its-kind contract mechanism) and opted in for one more year with the club after she and her husband, NFL Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Michael Wilson, welcomed their daughter, Gianna, in September. No other player in the world had a contract status that captivated the globe this offseason more than Rodman. Washington Spirit were always in the mix, but European clubs were reported as interested, and in between contract vetoes and two grievances filed, a new deal was finally announced by the Spirit last month. There is no gambling offered on this site.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Atlético Madrid has announced Johnny Cardoso will miss out against former side Real Betis on Thursday, Feb. 5 due to a muscle injury. The U.S. men's national team midfielder did not make the trip to Seville for the Copa del Rey quarterfinal after suffering an injury in training. "Johnny will be unavailable due to discomfort he felt in the final training session before the match against Real Betis, which forced him to leave yesterday's session," Atlético said on social media. "Medical staff carried out tests on the midfielder, confirming a low-grade muscle injury." The 24-year-old has played in 14 of a possible 34 games with the La Liga club, missing time with multiple injuries. Cardoso suffered an ankle injury early in the season, then dealt with a knee issue in December. The injuries have harmed Cardoso's chance to make an impression on USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino ahead of the World Cup. Cardoso is on the roster bubble despite his success in Spain over the past two years. He has yet to fully impose himself at the international level, turning in a series of underwhelming displays with the USMNT. In 2025, Cardoso made four appearances for the U.S. as he dealt with an injury that limited him to just two brief cameos at the Gold Cup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Scaloni has successfully built a highly competitive roster with Argentina. Lionel Messi not only shines, but he is also supported by standout teammates like Rodrigo De Paul, Emiliano Martínez, and others, who excel in their respective positions and enhance the team's overall competitiveness. One of the national team's top players reportedly plans to leave his club post-2026 World Cup, attracting interest from Atlético Madrid and Barcelona. Unlike in previous seasons, Cristian Romero has been critical of Tottenham Hotspur's management. Following their 3-2 defeat to Brentford, the Argentine defender shared a blunt post on his Instagram account: “In moments like this, there should be others who come out to speak, but they don't. They only show up when things are going well.” With a negative streak in the current season, he could leave the team, with Atletico Madrid and Barcelona chasing his arrival. Following four years of shining at Tottenham Hotspur, Cristian Romero has reportedly decided to leave the club. However, his exit could prove to be quite costly, as he is under contract until 2029 and remains a key piece of the team. In light of his potential departure from England, Atlético Madrid have reportedly identified him as a possible reinforcement, according to TyC Sports. Alongside Los Colchoneros, Barcelona have also listed him as an option, TEAMtalk reports. While Hansi Flick has remained quiet on the Argentine star potential arrival, Diego Simeone has already spoken on Romero's potential arrival. While his excessive defensive aggression caused him several problems in his first season, Cristian Romero has already managed to control this approach, establishing himself as one of the most difficult defenders to beat. Argentina FA confirms U.S. base for Lionel Messi's national team at 2026 World Cup Cristian Romero is even regularly compared to Virgil van Dijk, something that has reportedly caught the attention of several Premier League clubs that are also keeping a close eye on a potential move for the 2026–27 season. Lamine Yamal's Barcelona has reportedly set its sights on a promising youngster from Ajax. Although he is only 18 years old, Lamine Yamal has remained one of Barcelona's best players over the last two years, finishing second in the 2025 Ballon d'Or. In light of this, Blaugrana legend Andrés Iniesta did not hesitate to praise the young star, making clear the challenge that lies ahead.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Owen Wilson stars in a new teaser for a Super Bowl spot kicking off the road to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. In the trailer, a couch-bound Wilson stops studying a script as he becomes enamored by the sounds of soccer. The “Wedding Crashers” star, both intrigued by and invested in the game on screen, mutters a “This is good” before putting his script away and turning the volume up. Throughout the teaser, Wilson (a real-life soccer fan) attempts to parse the Spanish spoken by the game's commentator, repeating what phrases he can make out to himself. The video ends with Wilson calling someone in his phone labeled “SOFIA :)” before leaving a “To be continued…” promise, pointing to a full commercial coming during Sunday's Super Bowl. “I wonder what he said,” Wilson says before picking up his phone. Viewers can expect a lot more advertising as the World Cup approaches. In December, NBCUniversal shared that Telemundo had nearly sold out of 2026 FIFA World Cup ads, with 90% of its inventory for the Spanish-language presentation of the tournament sold. “The growth of soccer in the United States coupled with the domestic nature of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and rising demand for both live sports and Spanish language content has proved to be the winning formula for our company, as NBCUniversal sits in its strongest position ever this far out from a FIFA World Cup tournament,” NBC Sports and Olympics EVP of advertising and partnerships Peter Lazarus said in a statement at the time. “The upcoming competition in Spanish-Language on Telemundo and Peacock, will captivate a highly engaged and passionate audience that our partners are eager to connect with, and we are excited to deliver both brands and fans a world-class experience this summer.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Football Association is experiencing difficulties in securing suitable opposition for England's World Cup warm-up games owing to their late start to the expanded 48-team tournament. England open against Croatia on the last day of the first round of games on 17 June, six days after the first match between Mexico and South Africa, and Thomas Tuchel wants final preparation games as close to his team's tournament kick-off as possible. Tuchel is understood to have requested friendlies near England's pre-tournament training camp in Florida on 6 and 10 June – the night before the World Cup starts – and finding high-calibre opponents for the latter date is proving particularly challenging. That means only teams playing on 16 and 17 June – who will include two qualifiers from March's intercontinental playoffs – could face England on 10 June. With its options limited, New Zealand, who have qualified, and Costa Rica, who have not, are understood to be under consideration. World Cup participants remain prevented from organising friendlies against sides in the same group, although this was never a consideration for England, whose group is completed by Ghana and Panama. England's late start to the World Cup has left also them facing a congested schedule, with eight games in 33 days if they reach the final, and a large amount of travelling. Their three group matches will take place in an 11-day period. Tuchel wants to give his players a holiday at the end of the season, which has influenced his request for late friendlies, although anyone involved in the Champions League final on 30 May will be denied a break with the squad due to fly to Florida on 1 June. England's warm-up games are expected to take place in Orlando and Tampa before they move to Kansas City in advance of the start their tournament. The FA has announced England will face Uruguay and Japan at Wembley in March in their final matches before Tuchel names his World Cup squad.</p>

New valuation

Chelsea have set a price for Enzo Fernández amid interest from Real Madrid.

World Cup-winning midfielder Enzo Fernández is having a good season in England with Chelsea; the Argentine has scored 11 goals and provided 4 assists from his role as an orchestrating midfielder. This shows that the player is not only important in orchestrating plays but also has the ability to reach the opponent's penalty area

This shows that the player is not only important in orchestrating plays but also has the ability to reach the opponent's penalty area



Flexibility



During his time at Chelsea, Enzo Fernández shifted his position and began playing a bit further forward in midfield under the guidance of Enzo Maresca, the Italian coach with whom Chelsea won the first Club World Cup in history, making the midfielder the only player to have won the highest competitions in world football with his national team and at club level







Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain



Rumors have spread from England of strong interest from Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain in acquiring this player during the next transfer window. Therefore, in light of this situation, Chelsea has set a price on one of its key players, valuing him at between €100 million and €120 million, which would mean that offers for the midfielder will hover around those figures and, if there is competition, could even exceed them. As a player with both offensive and defensive facets, he's a wildcard for any team that wants to acquire him, and he also delivers in terms of goals and contributions during the match.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crystal Dunn won a World Cup and multiple Olympic medals with the USWNT. Crystal Dunn won a World Cup and multiple Olympic medals with the USWNT. Crystal Dunn is one of the most versatile players in American soccer history. Her career will, and should, be remembered as such. And yet, as I reflect on the legacy of the 33-year-old New Yorker, whose vast soccer intellect and abundance of fly dance moves saved her teams countless times, I find myself desperate to wedge some distance between Dunn and the word versatile. It is, of course, a coveted quality in elite sports. Versatility also widens the door of opportunity in modern soccer, where center backs are expected to capitalize on offensive set pieces, strikers to defend in a high press and fullbacks to be as technically flamboyant as wingers. A Black soccer player's athletic prowess, combined with a desire to get past doors that have historically and systemically been more narrow for them, can conceal an institution's lack of planning or player development. U.S. Soccer failed to develop high-caliber, left-footed fullbacks on the women's side for years, and when the 2019 World Cup came around, they didn't have one to call upon. As a field player, she found success in every region of the pitch throughout her decorated career. Classified as a midfielder at the University of North Carolina, Dunn was crowned ACC Defender of the Year as a freshman. Why would you ever have a player with this extraordinary dribbling ability as your center back?” In UNC's quarterfinal against BYU that year, Dunn played the No. (Dunn's height is somewhere between 5-foot-1 and 5-foot-2, depending on who you ask.) Even then, Dunn was playing out of her preferred role. “If I had to choose a position, I would definitely choose an outside mid position,” Dunn said back then in the same ESPN story. For me, it fits my personality better because, as an outside mid, you have to worry about attacking and defending as a whole. Dunn has been clear about what she wanted for more than a decade. As we celebrate her retirement, we must also consider what the game may have lost because she wasn't always listened to — and what she still managed to accomplish despite that. When Dunn went pro in 2014, she needed just one season in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) to earn both the Golden Boot and MVP awards. Yet when then-U.S. women's national team head coach Jill Ellis named her roster for the 2015 World Cup in April of that year, Dunn was not on it. She was the last player to be cut. Dunn's star shone too brightly to be overlooked, yet her status on the USWNT was essentially set as a defender. The 2019 World Cup was a watershed moment in equality for women's soccer as the U.S. women were locked in a legal battle with U.S. Soccer over equal pay during their campaign and still managed to win a fourth title. From a sporting perspective, however, Dunn was arguably the most vital player on that roster. She played every minute of six of the USWNT's seven matches in that tournament at left back and put on consistent game-saving performances, including a defensive masterclass against hosts France in the quarterfinal. Back and forth she went over the next few years as a club midfielder and a national team fullback. She earned a bronze medal with the U.S. at the 2021 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and added one more NWSL Championship and shield each to her trophy case with the Portland Thorns in 2022; she subbed on in the final that November, six months after giving birth to her son Marcel. She is, in a lot of ways, like a big sister to me,” said Thorns and USWNT star Sophia Wilson. “I feel like she kind of took me under her wing early on and was someone that I connected with really well.” After winning Olympic gold as one-third of the iconic “Triple Espresso” alongside Trinity Rodman and Mallory Swanson, Wilson took a year off from soccer to have a baby. She gave birth to her daughter, Gianna, last September, and in December Wilson agreed to a record-setting $1 million option year on her current contract to stay in Portland and play for the Thorns in 2026. “I saw Crystal go through a lot of things. I saw her have a baby, go through that. At a national team camp held shortly after, she remained open about her commitment to transparency. “It's really important that I'm always going to be my most authentic self,” Dunn said from a national team camp mixed zone in Nashville. “It's not a secret that I've always struggled with identity on the field. Dunn's accomplishments are all the more impressive considering the emotional fatigue she likely endured from not only working in less-than-ideal positions but excelling in them. Up until her move to Paris-Saint Germain, after her contract with Gotham FC ran short last year, Dunn seemed poised to remain a part of the USWNT project that had since been taken over by Hayes, with whom she already had a relationship from their Chelsea days. She continued to receive national team call-ups after that, the last being in May 2025 for friendlies against China and Jamaica. “I was shocked to hear the news,” Washington Spirit and USWNT midfielder Croix Bethune told Soccer Girl Probs in reaction to the announcement. “Her retiring, I just feel like isn't right,” Bethune added. And then there's the word that's impossible to overlook in Dunn's retirement announcement posted on Instagram last week. “This decision has not come easily, but I am at peace and deeply fulfilled with all that I have accomplished,” she wrote. It does not negate her plans to spend more time with her family and be a more present mom, as she also wrote, but it also suggests that she is leaving the pitch with unfinished business. That reality is not unique to the arc of an athlete's career; rarely is there ever a right or satisfying time to retire, but Dunn's contract with PSG was set to run through 2027. The question of how close she was to achieving that “nearly” will linger forever, and for a player of Dunn's expansive skillset, that feels tragic. She also hosts the weekly “Full Time” women's soccer podcast. As a freelance journalist, she covered the 2023 World Cup in Australia and the CONCACAF W Gold Cup for The Athletic, as well as women's soccer stories for ESPN Andscape, USA Today's Pro Soccer Wire, and other publications.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Well, not exactly his backyard, but somewhere in South Florida, not far from where Messi and his Inter Miami teammates live and train. Meanwhile, indications are that Ronaldo will be in or near Miami. Two media outlets, the Record in Portugal and O Jornal, a bilingual publication serving the Portuguese-speaking communities of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, reported in the past week that Portugal national team coach Roberto Martinez said Miami was chosen as their World Cup base camp. Curacao, the smallest country to qualify for the World Cup, will be based in Boca Raton and train at Florida Atlantic University. A facility that might attract a team like Portugal is the Gardens North County District Park in Palm Beach Gardens, which is where Real Madrid trained during the 2025 Club World Cup. It has 10 lighted grass fields that were built to FIFA regulations and plenty of posh lodging options nearby. A source with knowledge of the World Cup team site visits said England, Netherlands, Scotland and Ecuador had inquired about the Nova facilities and that Beyond Bancard Field could host training for Portugal or Colombia on the eve of their June 27 match at Hard Rock Stadium. Another obvious site for a World Cup base camp is Inter Miami's state-of-the-art Florida Blue Training Center, a 50,000-square-foot facility in Fort Lauderdale, adjacent to Chase Stadium. It cost $60 million and the 30-acre complex features seven professional fields (six natural grass, one turf). It has locker rooms, recovery areas with hydrotherapy pools and an underwater treadmill, a player lounge, a kitchen, and office space. Several national teams and club teams have used Inter Miami's training grounds over the years, including Argentina, FC Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund, but it seems unlikely Ronaldo's team would wind up in Messi's home. Barry University in Miami Shores has a rich soccer history, having hosted the U.S. national team and most recently Boca Juniors and Chelsea during the 2025 Club World Cup. But, Barry's athletic facilities are undergoing extensive renovations as part of a joint project with Miami Country Day School, so the soccer fields will not be available until Fall. Manchester City trained at Lynn University of Boca Raton. FIU is another local college campus with strong soccer history that could land a World Cup team for training this summer. Then, on June 23, they are back in Houston for a match against Uzbekistan. On June 27, Ronaldo and Portugal will face Colombia in a highly anticipated and high-priced 7:30 p.m. match at Hard Rock Stadium (renamed Miami Stadium during the tournament). That game is the most sought-after group stage ticket in the entire tournament with resale tickets going from $1,800 to $80,000 for a VIP suite. It is a hot ticket because global superstar Ronaldo, who turned 41 on Thursday, has 668 million Instagram followers, is captain of the Portuguese team and has said this World Cup will be his last. Also, Colombia's national team, nicknamed “Los Cafeteros” (the coffee makers) has an extremely passionate following and South Florida is home to nearly 240,000 Colombians. Among the teams whose camps have already been made public: South Korea (Guadalajara, Mexico), Germany (Winston-Salem, North Carolina, training at Wake Forest University), Spain (Chattanooga, Tennessee, training at Baylor School), Uruguay (Playa del Carmen, Mexico), France (Boston, training at Babson College), Colombia (Guadalajara, Mexico), and Croatia (Alexandria, Virginia, training at Episcopal High School).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This story was updated at 11:30 a.m. on Feb. 5 to include a statement from Gov. Foxborough officials said Wednesday they're willing to try to stand in the way of Gillette Stadium hosting 2026 World Cup soccer games this summer if security funding issues aren't resolved in the next few weeks. Select Board Chair Bill Yukna said town officials will not grant the entertainment license necessary for the matches to be played in Foxborough until the parties involved figure out who will pay the event's estimated $7.7 million in security costs up front. Seven World Cup matches are planned this summer for Gillette Stadium, which will be known as Boston Stadium, for the tournament. The approximately $7.7 million is needed for security across 39 days, town officials told MassLive on Wednesday, and would be used to cover associated costs for security, medical and communication to host the international sporting event. While the town may eventually receive federal grant money allocated for this purpose, it would first have to foot the bill and get reimbursed later. And if they aren't met, then as this board has discussed in the past, the license won't be granted. We are going to be very clear with that,” Yukna said at a Foxborough Select Board meeting Tuesday night. Foxborough Town Manager Paige Duncan said the town does not have enough money in its accounts to cover such a price tag, and Yukna emphasized the need to protect taxpayer dollars. Foxborough town officials are currently looking to the Kraft Group or FIFA to foot the bill for security costs, but nothing has been decided. The entertainment license must be granted by March 17. Asked to respond to reports of the Foxborough Select Board's concerns, Julie Duffy, the chief marketing and communications officer of FIFA World Cup Boston, issued a brief statement from the Super Bowl, where World Cup officials are promoting this summer's event. “We are working closely with FIFA, the stadium, and the town of Foxboro to reach an agreement,” Duffy said. The Kraft Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday evening. Still, Duncan said she is confident the World Cup matches scheduled to take place in Foxborough this summer will go forward as planned. Up until November 2025, Foxborough officials were under the impression the Kraft Group would foot the bill for police details and other security costs during the World Cup as it does for New England Patriots games and other events at Gillette, Yukna said. The grant was part of President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill and is designated to be used on security costs for the tournament. Massachusetts is slated to get $47 million from the grant, but municipalities such as Boston and organizations such as the MBTA are competing with Foxborough for money, Yukna said. The Select Board chair was unsure which state agency will decide how the grant money is allocated, but Foxborough was supposed to find out whether it was approved for the $7.7 million on Jan. 30 and did not. “We are committed to ensuring that municipalities, especially Foxborough, have the support they need to make this a successful event through state, federal and private funds.” Healey's office is evaluating the need for other funding sources, though they expect to see funds coming in from the federal government soon, Hand said. Duncan said she was doubtful the town would be reimbursed for the full security costs even if they are awarded the grant, but she did not specify why. Yukna described his confidence level surrounding resolving the security funding issue as “low” on Wednesday. “I do hope that they take us seriously. FIFA has so far submitted a license application, but not all the details have been agreed upon or finalized, town officials said. Five more matches will be hosted in Canada (3) and Mexico (2). The other U.S. host cities are Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area. “There's a little bit coming in, but certainly there is not enough to cover our cost,” said Lisa Gillmor, mayor of the Bay Area city of Santa Clara, California, where six matches will be played, according to Politico. Houston and Dallas are pulling tens of millions from Texas' Major Events Reimbursement Program Fund, Politico reported. Maura Healey signed into law — only half of what the governor had requested.
