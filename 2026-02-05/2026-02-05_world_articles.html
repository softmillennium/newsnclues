In an interview with NBC News's Tom Llamas on Wednesday, President Donald Trump indicated that it's possible he won't accept the outcome of the 2026 midterms. Trump also said that if the elections aren't “honestly” conducted, “then something else has to happen.” The president's judgment on what constitutes an “honest” election is highly suspect, as he has repeatedly peddled falsehoods and debunked conspiracy theories about the results of recent elections. Within the interview with Llamas, Trump also claimed to have had “a great election” in 2024, describing it as “one of the greatest elections” ever. A closer examination of the election results from that year shows that he won by one of the thinnest margins in history, and did not secure majority support from voters. Despite his win in 2024, Trump told Llamas that he still “believe[d] there was cheating” involved in states he did not win. There is no evidence to corroborate Trump's assertion that widespread fraud disrupted the results of the 2024 election, let alone any other elections for which he has made similar claims. Trump's comments come just days after he demanded that Republicans on Capitol Hill “nationalize” elections ahead of the 2026 midterms, ostensibly to prevent “fraud.” I won a thing called counties,” Trump falsely claimed in an interview on Monday. We have states that are so crooked, and they're counting votes. Article I of the U.S. Constitution dictates that although Congress can regulate how elections are run, it is the states that are charged with determining the “times, places, and manner” of holding federal elections within their boundaries. After he and his allies lost more than 60 court cases in an attempt to delay or overturn several states' results, Trump and his campaign sought to disrupt the certification of the Electoral College through a “fake electors” scheme. When that didn't work, Trump encouraged a mob of his loyalists to head to the U.S. Capitol building, where they violently breached the building and disrupted the certification ceremony for several hours until he reluctantly called them off later that day. Trump's allies have chalked up his previous comments about the 2026 election as jokes. The two entities took part in a raid of an elections center in Fulton County, Georgia, earlier this month, obtaining personal information of voters from the 2020 election, which Trump infamously tried to overturn. Some experts fear the information could be used to help Trump and his GOP allies figure out new ways to disenfranchise voters under the guise of “election reform.” Gabbard justified her participation in the raid by citing her “broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security.” Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Democratic leaders' supposed demands for reform were already previously condemned as weak and ineffective. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! Senate and House minority leaders Chuck Schumer (D-New York) and Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) subtly weakened their already tepid demands for ICE reforms in a press conference on Wednesday — before negotiations with Republicans even started. In a press conference about the Democrats' demands, the two leaders reiterated their belief that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal immigration agents should not be allowed to wear masks. But they both qualified their statements by saying that this prohibition isn't sweeping. “Certainly I think there's agreement that no masks should be deployed in an arbitrary and capricious fashion,” said Jeffries. “They need identification and no masks, except in extraordinary and unusual circumstances,” said Schumer later in the conference, describing masked, unidentified agents as “secret police.” Schumer reiterated this call in an interview with MS NOW on Thursday, saying, “There should be no masks, except in the most unusual of circumstances, you know, some guy's picture was put up by a terrorist group or something.” His comment ignores, perhaps, that the Trump administration is seeking to characterize any dissidents as “terrorists,” internal documentation has shown. Schumer said on Wednesday that Democrats are “ready to sit down and negotiate,” but negotiations have not yet begun. These demands are far weaker than what many critics have said is needed to actually stymie the Trump administration's violent raids. First, if these demands are met, Democrats would help Republicans pass the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding — something that many Democrats have said should be a nonstarter as long as the raids are going on in order for the party to maintain leverage, or in order to dismantle ICE or DHS altogether. Further, many of the demands themselves encompass existing guidelines or procedures that DHS officers are being instructed to break.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Barrick Mining Corp. ABX-T is moving forward with plans to spin out its North American assets into a new publicly listed company and also named Mark Hill as its permanent chief executive officer, providing some certainty around its future following an intense period of leadership turmoil. Former CEO Mark Bristow was ousted in September, with Mr. Hill, a two-decade company veteran, appointed as interim CEO in the wake. Two months later, Barrick's lead independent director resigned – only six months after joining the board of directors – and several other senior executives also left the company, including Barrick's chief financial officer. Yet through it all, Barrick's share price has soared after years of underperformance. Amid the turmoil, activist investor Elliott Investment Management L.P. amassed a large stake in Barrick and started pushing a split into two companies – one that would own Barrick's lower-risk mines in the Americas and another that would hold higher-risk properties in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Mark Hill had served as interim president and CEO since September.Matthew Plexman/Supplied On Thursday, Mr. Hill was named permanent CEO, and the miner also said it would move forward with plans to pursue the split. The new publicly listed company will hold joint venture interests in: Nevada Gold Mines, Barrick's operating assets in Nevada; Pueblo Viejo, its operating mine in the Dominican Republic; and Barrick's recently announced Fourmile gold discovery in Nevada, which looks to be a new world-class gold deposit. Barrick will keep its African assets, which includes the Loulo-Gounkoto complex in Mali that has caused problems for the miner of late, as well as assets such as the undeveloped Reko Diq copper-gold project in Pakistan. Because of this structure, a major question for investors will be whether the spin out changes all that much. The company will now target paying out 50 per cent of its free cash flow, with the goal of returning more cash to shareholders. Barrick's shares fell six per cent in early morning trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Study and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Office of Personnel Management says reclassification will allow agencies to quickly remove employees who ‘obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives' The Trump administration moved Thursday to issue a rule that would make it easier to fire tens of thousands of federal workers. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said it was reclassifying certain career civil service roles so agencies can “quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives”. Traditionally, only political appointees – roughly 4,000 positions – can be dismissed “at will”. Under the new rule, many nonpartisan roles would be shifted into a category called “Schedule Policy/Career,” effectively treating them as political appointees. That reclassification could allow the administration to remove employees it views as disloyal. The rule – set to be published in the Federal Register on Friday – also states that “personal or political loyalty tests as a condition of employment” are prohibited. The largest union representing federal workers called the rule “a direct assault on a professional, nonpartisan, merit-based civil service.” In a statement, American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) president Everett Kelley said OPM is “rebranding career public servants as ‘policy' employees, silencing whistleblowers, and replacing competent professionals with political flunkies without any neutral, independent protections against politicization and arbitrary abuse of power.” Trump briefly enacted a similar change at the end of his first term through an executive order known as “Schedule F,” which Joe Biden rescinded upon taking office in 2021. Stripping civil service protections has also been a central plank of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 blueprint. Donald Trump has said that Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi had his “total endorsement” ahead of a legislative election in Japan on Sunday, adding that they would meet on 19 March at the White House. “Prime Minister Takaichi is someone who deserves powerful recognition for the job she and her Coalition are doing,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Takaichi is widely expected to win in the snap election this Sunday. On the morning of 21 January, Israeli authorities left eight Palestinian men at a West Bank checkpoint. Hours earlier, they had been sitting with their wrists and ankles shackled on the plush leather seats of a private jet owned by the Florida property tycoon Gil Dezer, a longtime business partner of Donald Trump. His sleek Gulfstream jet – which he has called “my little rocket ship” – was used to transport the men from an airport near a notorious removal centre in Arizona to Tel Aviv. The jet made three refuelling stops en route: in New Jersey, Ireland and Bulgaria. A Guardian investigation has established the flight was part of a secretive and politically sensitive US government operation to deport Palestinians arrested by ICE to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Data for November was revised down to show 6.928m job openings instead of the previously reported 7.146m. Hiring increased by 172,000 positions to a still-low 5.293m in December. The data came as other numbers showed a larger-than-expected increase in Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a stable labor market. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has said that further US sanctions against Russia depend on talks aimed at ending its nearly four-year-old war in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Bessent, who participated in talks with Russian officials and Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in Miami on 31 January, said he would consider sanctions against Russia's shadow fleet.

Stripping civil service protections has also been a central plank of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 blueprint. At least two cases of measles have been confirmed at a major immigration detention center for children and their parents in Texas as cases of the dangerous virus in South Carolina, Arizona, Utah and other US states continue growing and alarming experts. The vast majority of patients are not vaccinated, but there have been no national campaigns announced or recent statements from leaders such as Robert F Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Last year, Kennedy positioned measles vaccines as a personal choice and recommended unproven treatments for the highly contagious illness. The measles outbreak is “frightening” and “very worrisome”, said Jason Bowling, professor of infectious diseases at UT Health San Antonio and director of hospital epidemiology at University Health. “I unfortunately do not see this slowing down across the United States,” said Anna-Kathryn Burch, division director of pediatric infectious diseases at Prisma Health Children's hospital in the Midlands in South Carolina. What's happening in South Carolina could happen anywhere the vaccination rate dips too low, Burch said. “It's not a matter of if, but more likely when.” The Dilley family detention center in south Texas, one of two immigration facilities for children in the US, reported two measles cases on Friday. The president is now rattling off a number of states who, he says, have cooperated with federal law enforcement. But has now launched into a tirade on Minnesota. “They won't work with us,” Trump said, while claiming that he would be able to drive crime down further without the “horrible governor and this horrible fake mayor Frey”. “We're going to rededicate America as one nation under God,” Trump added. “They say, ‘why is she doing it'… because Pam [the attorney general] wanted her to do it. “Her position has to do with international,” Trump added today. OK, so let's assume Russia had something to do with it. Because if I say Russia, that it's perfectly fine. But you could add China and about five other countries. Trump's meandered during his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast today. “We're getting along fantastically with leadership,” Trump said of the interrim president Delcy Rodriguez. One note, ahead of the president's address today, we heard from Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador, and a noted Trump ally. Bukele has worked closely with the Trump administration to accept flights of undocumented immigrants, who they allege are convicted criminals, and hold them in El Salvador's mega-prison, known as CECOT. Bukele has described himself as the “world's coolest dictator” and has overseen one of the largest crackdowns on crime in his country. Critics have branded him an authoritarian leader, that has done away with due process. “Some of those gangs are here in the United States,” he added. Later today we'll also hear from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when she holds a 1pm ET briefing for reporters. On Wednesday the publication announced it would be laying off one-third of its workforce, and would be scaling back coverage of sport and foreign news. “It's an absolute bloodbath,” said one employee, not authorized to speak publicly. Murray acknowledged that the Post had struggled to reach “customers” and talked about the need to compete in a crowded media marketplace. Other staffers, including the sports journalist Neil Greenberg, have also announced that they were affected. President Donald Trump is set to attend and deliver remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast later today, a spokesperson from the White House confirmed. It aims to bring together leaders in political, social and business sectors from around the country to an event that merges prayer and networking. “Today, President Trump will unite our country through the power of prayer at the 74th National Prayer Breakfast,” a White House spokesperson said. “President Trump has made unprecedented strides to protect our God-given rights and has delivered on his promise to reverse Joe Biden's divisive policies that weaponized the federal government against men and women of faith. President Trump has secured major victories for religious freedom – from defending innocent life to restoring biological truth and protecting parents' fundamental rights.” According to the outlet, other notable attenders set to appear at the 2026 event include house speaker Mike Johnson and attorney general Pam Bondi. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. Donald Trump said the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis were both sad incidents that “should not have happened,” but nobody feels worse about both shootings than ICE agents. “He was not an angel, and she was not an angel,” Trump said of Pretti and Good in a new interview with NBC News. “But I'm always going to be with our great people of law enforcement,” he continued. This comes as the White House border czar, Tom Homan, says 700 federal agents will leave Minnesota. Agents are patrolling the streets like a military operation,” he said. The second day of US-brokered talks between negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv have been taking place in Abu Dhabi. The discussions come amid increased Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid and a continuing war of attrition. The Trump administration says it wants to create a critical minerals trading bloc with its allies and partners in order to counter China's stronghold. This would use tariffs to shore up supplies of critical minerals needed for electric vehicles, missiles and other hi-tech products. Starmer says Mandelson portrayed Epstein as someone he barely knew. He expressed regret for believing Mandelson's lies and appointing him.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seven Toronto police officers and one retired officer were charged as part of a complex investigation into organized crime and corruption. Seven police officers from Toronto Police Service and one retired officer have been charged on Wednesday as part of a complex and lengthy investigation into organized crime and corruption sparked by an alleged plot to kill a corrections officer in June, 2025. The charges – including bribery, obstruction of justice, extortion, drug trafficking, robbery, and conspiracy to commit murder – were announced at a news conference at York Regional Police Headquarters. Police allege that some of the officers unlawfully accessed and funnelled private information to members of an organized crime group, which was then used to facilitate shootings around Southern Ontario – including violence connected to the tow truck industry. “This is a deeply disappointing and sad day for policing,” York Regional Police Chief Jim MacSween said. Toronto Police chief Myron Demkiw addresses media during a press conference at the York Regional Police headquarters in Aurora, Ont., on Thursday.Cole Burston/The Globe and Mail Also charged as part of the seven-month-long investigation are 19 civilians, including three accused of attempting to kill a correctional manager at his home. Those include Brian Da Costa, Elwyn Satanowsky, Kaejean Doman, Median Jackson, Devonte Barker-Campbell, Almar Heath, Calvin Ru, Rimssen Younan, Daljit Singh, Brandi Dixon, Robinson Alexandre, Ashor Bato, Donald Kirkland, Ryan Cribbie, Phillip Lecos, Jennifer Jasey and Mahyar Soldouzi, along with two unnamed youth. York Deputy Chief Ryan Hogan alleged some of the officers were involved in fentanyl and cannabis trafficking by “providing protection,” and theft of personal property from a police facility – including driver's licences, passports and health cards. The allegations have not yet been tested in court. More than 400 officers, including from York, Toronto and the Ontario Provincial Police, have been involved in the investigation, he said. “This is a difficult and unsettling moment,” he said. “I understand this news will be distressing to Torontonians and Toronto Police Service.” Demkiw says the seven officers facing charges have been suspended.Cole Burston/The Globe and Mail “The Board believes such an inspection is necessary to provide the public with a credible and transparent assessment, and to identify any steps needed to strengthen accountability and public safety,” it said in a statement. Meaghan Gray, a spokesperson for the Toronto Police Association, said in a statement Wednesday evening that the union is “aware of several of its members who were arrested today.” “As a professional labour organization, we will ensure our members receive due process and wellness support as required,” she said. “We have no further comment regarding this investigation or the members involved.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following. © Copyright 2026 The Globe and Mail Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A spokesperson for Freedom 250, the non-profit group leading the administration's celebrations, provided new details to CNN after President Donald Trump formally announced the event in December. Trump teased the event as “an unprecedented four-day athletic event featuring the greatest high school athletes — one young man and one young woman from each state and territory.” Athletic ability will not be the sole factor considered for eligibility. Details about the types of athletic contests the participants will compete in have yet to be made public. Applications will be open to athletes aged 14 to 17 from all 50 states, US territories & tribes, but those who will turn 18 before December 31 will not be eligible, the spokesperson said. The competition has drawn comparisons on social media to “The Hunger Games,” a dystopian young-adult book series and film franchise in which children are forced to fight to the death in televised arenas. Trump first previewed the competition in July, saying it would be televised and led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The new details emerge as the administration pushes forward with its plans for national events. The executive branch is driving efforts to pull off the president's anniversary priorities, with agencies partnering with Freedom 250 for certain landmark events: Kennedy will be partnering with Freedom 250 in hosting the Patriot Games, and the Agriculture Department has embraced the president's Great American State Fair initiative, which asks states to compete to have their fair chosen by Trump as the “most patriotic.” Will Trump's brand of politics crash America's 250th birthday party? An August IndyCar race near the National Mall is also on the schedule, with the president signing an order last week directing the Interior and Transportation departments to work with the DC Mayor Muriel Bowser's office to move quickly in order to pull it off. The effort may need congressional approval. Bowser, a Democrat, is on board with the race and touted it as an economic boon for the nation's capital, which has been strained by mass federal layoffs. “The race weekend will rev up the economic engine of D.C. by filling our hotels and restaurants and by showing visitors, residents and the sports world that there's no better city, people and backdrop for major sports events,” she said in a statement. The National Archives' “Freedom Plane” will bring documents from the era of America's founding to eight US cities in 2026, and the Institute of Museum of Library Services has announced six Freedom Truck Mobile Museums, with material from conservative media company PragerU and Hillsdale College. Planning for the history-related initiatives comes as the administration conducts an unprecedented review of the Smithsonian Institution, insisting that the museum complex's 250th content align with Trump's push for programming that renews national pride. “The American people will have no patience for any museum that is diffident about America's founding or otherwise uncomfortable conveying a positive view of American history, one which is justifiably proud of our country's accomplishments and record,” administration officials wrote in a letter to the museum in December.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Owner of local cinema says Amazon is upset at way they marketed movie as some in US say healthy ticket sales are not reflected by empty seats An independent cinema in Oregon has claimed Amazon pulled screenings of their documentary about Melania Trump in protest at the cinema's marketing strategy. Writing on the cinema's Instagram, Jordan Perry said: “Got a call that the higher ups (ie, at Amazon) were upset with how our marquee marketed their movie (ie, Melania), that, per them, Sunday would be its last day here.” Perry added that he hoped Amazon wouldn't cancel his Prime membership and directed devoted Amazon fans to “show your support at Whole Foods instead”. In a post titled Why I, Jordan, Got Melania Here,” Perry wrote that his overriding instinct was that the programming “would be funny”. There was also a financial imperative, he added: “The film marketplace this week and next were a desert … So, to fill a screen, why not get this inexplicable vanity piece from the current president's wife? ), and wouldn't it then be exponentially weirder, to the point of being funny, to show it here, at your obviously anti-establishment, occasionally troublemaking, neighbourhood cinema?” Citing the Substack of industry pundit Tom Brueggemann, the article claims: “Industry sources say there were signs that blocks of tickets were purchased for the weekend, then distributed to senior citizen homes, Republican activitists, other interested parties for free to help boost audiences.” Meanwhile Puck reporter Matthew Belloni said Amazon and cinema chains AMC and Regal told him that they “did not experience unusual block purchases of tickets” for the film, while adding “the theatre chains might not necessarily know, of course”. Exit reports from weekend screenings in the US suggested that “older white women” were the demographic most responsible for propelling it to success. In the UK, where Melania opened across 155 screens, takings were considerably softer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marco Rubio now has one less critical role to worry about in the Trump administration. After nearly a year as acting archivist of the United States, Rubio's tenure has ended. The National Archives and Records Administration's general counsel confirmed in a statement to CNN that Rubio was no longer serving as acting archivist. Rubio has worn several hats over the course of President Donald Trump's second term. Along with becoming the first person since Henry Kissinger to serve as secretary of state and national security adviser simultaneously, Rubio has been tasked with helping to run the transition of the Venezuelan government after the US ousted Nicolás Maduro – an operation in which Rubio played a key role. Rubio posted on social media in August that he would give that job to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought. Trump, who used to criticize Rubio and call him “Little Marco,” named Rubio to the role of archivist last February after the surprise dismissal of Colleen Shogan, a Joe Biden appointee and the first woman to hold the post. The National Archives preserves US government records, including paper documents, photographs, maps, films and computer records. The Federal News Network was first to report that Rubio is no longer acting archivist. At a State Department event Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance joked about the many hats Rubio wears. “When he asked me to come and speak today, I said, man, this is your building; why don't you come and give a speech? And he said, well, because I've got five jobs and you've only got one,” Vance said. “And so, I figured I might as well do Marco a solid, since he's also the archivist and the official White House florist and has a number of other jobs in addition to Secretary of State.” Other members of the administration have poked fun at Rubio's multiple jobs. During the first cabinet meeting of the year, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin joked that Rubio should help him in the administration's efforts to rebuild homes impacted by the California wildfires. President, your great secretary of state was looking for another job,” Zeldin said, before the room erupted with laughter. This story has been updated with additional information.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a government meeting on Tuesday that “more and more leads, more and more information, and more and more commentary in the global press all relate to the suspicion that this unprecedented pedophilia scandal was co-organized by Russian intelligence services.” Warsaw must investigate allegations of Epstein working for Moscow because they are “serious… for the security of the Polish state” and could mean that Russia possesses “compromising materials against many leaders still active today,” he claimed. In a post on X on Wednesday, Dmitriev rejected Tusk's accusations, arguing that through them “the exposed liberal cabal is desperately trying to change the narrative.” “But people have awakened, see through the lies & fake news to the Truth: the Satanic Liberal West, hidden decision-making and influence networks, double standards, dirty media tricks have all been exposed,” he wrote. The envoy also attached to his post a screenshot from an Epstein email from 2014, in which he told Ariane de Rothschild, the head of the Swiss private banking firm Edmond de Rothschild Group, that the “ukraine upheaval should provide many opportunites , many [sic].” The exchange happened a few months after a violent Western-backed coup in Kiev in which democratically elected President Viktor Yanukovich was deposed. In a later message, Dmitriev joked that Moscow should launch its own “investigation into whether Polish PM Tusk is actually a secret brother or son of Epstein” as, according to the envoy, the two have a lot of similarities in their looks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that he couldn't seriously comment on claims of Epstein's alleged ties with Russia. “One would want to make a lot jokes about such suggestions, but let's not waste our time,” he told journalists. Last week, the US Department of Justice released the final batch of over 3 million pages, 2,000 videos, and 180,000 images related to Epstein, who died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. They revealed that the disgraced financier maintained ties with prominent figures in politics, finance, academia and business, including former US President Bill Clinton and billionaires Bill Gates and Elon Musk, before and after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to prostitution charges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Pentagon is trialing attack drones for new contracts that should total $1.1 billion, inviting two Ukrainian drone makers to take part. One of the firms invited is General Cherry, in Ukrainian known as Heneral Chereshnya, one of the largest producers of first-person view (FPV) drones in the country, though its sudden rise over 2025 attracted extensive scrutiny. Another seemingly Ukrainian firm selected is "Ukrainian Defense Drones Tech Corp," but the Kyiv Independent could find no record of an entity by that name in corporate registries in the U.S., Ukraine or EU. The budget is $1.1 billion across all four phases in pursuit of what the Pentagon termed "competitive, iterative cycles measured in months, not years." The Pentagon's current system of coordinating purchases can extend decades often privilege massive and expensive weapons systems, for example the sixth-generation F-47 fighter jet program that has been underway since 2014. Those timespans are out of sync with fast incremental iterations, which the Russian-Ukrainian front has shown to be key to modern electrified war. The U.S. Defense Department is also famous for overpaying wildly on drones. While the military often keeps pricing details on weapons secret, available figures suggest massive upcharging. A 2024 contract with Anduril for 500 Roadrunners – effectively interceptor drones – and an unknown number of "Pulsar" electronic warfare stations ran for just under $250 million. Half a million dollars per unit would put those Roadrunners at roughly two orders of magnitude more expensive than their Ukrainian equivalents.

MOSCOW, February 5. /TASS/. Moscow believes that the recognition of Donbass as part of Russia by all countries should be part of a major agreement, a Western source close to the Abu Dhabi talks told TASS.

"Russia sees the aspect concerning the recognition of Donbass by all countries as crucial," the source said.

Russia, the US and Ukraine held the first round of trilateral security consultations in Abu Dhabi on January 23-24. The second round of talks began in the Emirati capital on Wednesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's flagship liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminal, Yamal LNG, exported a total of 1,690,517 metric tons of LNG to European markets last month, accounting for an 8% increase compared to January 2025, German environmental NGO Urgewald found in a report published Feb. 4. The report follows an agreement reached in December 2025 by EU countries to ban Russian gas imports beginning Jan. 1, 2028, with LNG imports set to be prohibited at the start of 2027. Urgewald, citing data from global trade tracking website Kpler, reported that of the 25 Yamal LNG cargos delivered abroad in January, 23 of the loads were delivered to European ports — with the remaining deliveries destined for China. Amid the continued imports, sanctions campaigners, including Urgewald, have called on restricting British and French Arc7 LNG carriers from delivering imports to European port, suggesting that restrictions would "significantly curb Russia's ability to sustain LNG exports during winter operations." "Sanctioning and restricting these vessels would directly cut off Putin's Arctic LNG revenues and close one of the most important remaining energy loopholes funding the Kremlin's war," Sebastian Rötters, a sanctions campaign at Urgewald, said in a statement. Gas and oil exports have played a crucial role in helping Russia fund its all-out war against Ukraine, which is soon to hit its fourth-year anniversary. While the Yamal LNG project does not account for all of Russia's LNG exports to Europe, the terminal, a non-sanctioned venture based in northwestern Siberia on the Yamal Peninsula, serves as Russia's key export hub to Europe. Of the 19.7 million metric tons of LNG exports from Yamal, over 15 million tons — or 76.1% — are shipped to European ports. In 2025, France served as the largest importer of Russian LNG from Yamal LNG, accounting for nearly 42% — or 6.3 million tons — of all imports, according to Urgewald. While another 4.2 million tons of LNG delivered to Belgium's Zeebrugge terminal. The news comes amid growing Western pressure against Russian LNG trade.
