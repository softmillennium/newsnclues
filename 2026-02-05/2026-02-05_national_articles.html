                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Funding fight: Senate Republican leader John Thune says lawmakers aren't “anywhere close” on a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security, as Democrats have demanded a list of reforms for ICE. • Trump remarks: During a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, President Donald Trump said Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard went to Fulton County, Georgia, to probe alleged ballot irregularities at Attorney General Pam Bondi's “insistence.” He also attacked Democrats over their opposition to voter ID laws. • Immigration crackdown: Trump's border czar Tom Homan said DHS will immediately withdraw 700 personnel from Minnesota, leaving about 2,000 officers on the ground. Trump said the fatal shootings by federal agents in Minneapolis “should not have happened.” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is leading a diplomatic delegation to conduct nuclear negotiations with the United States in Oman, Iran's foreign ministry said today. The high-stakes talks are scheduled to take place tomorrow in the Omani capital of Muscat and will involve Araghchi and US special envoy Steve Witkoff, according to Iran's state-affiliated Tasnim News Agency. The ministry said that Iran is entering the negotiations with full awareness of past experiences, including what it described as previous breaches of commitments, military aggression against Iran in June and foreign interventions during recent nationwide protests. He added that Iran also sees itself as responsible for not missing opportunities to use diplomacy to secure national interests and safeguard peace and stability in the region. Learn more about Iran's position ahead of tomorrow's talks in this video: President Donald Trump said Thursday that the United States should negotiate a “new, improved, and modernized” nuclear treaty with Russia instead of agreeing to extend the New START treaty. “Rather than extend ‘NEW START'(A badly negotiated deal by the United States that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future,” the president wrote on Truth Social. In a Truth Social post, Trump warned that the United States would act if American interests were threatened. “Let it be known that I will never allow our presence on a Base as important as this to ever be undermined or threatened by fake claims or environmental nonsense,” Trump continued. “Shockingly, our ‘brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia … FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,” Trump wrote in January. “The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY.” Democrats are demanding reforms as part of any funding package for the agency. But as talks remain stalled, a number of rank-and-file Democrats – including many who traditionally back stopgap measures in the past – indicate they won't entertain another funding bill without a clear sense that negotiators are making progress. “That's a close call, and it would depend to some extent on whether I thought there were real, good faith negotiations going on,” Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, said of whether he'd back another short-term spending bill for the agency. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, another Democrat who has voted to keep the government open even when other Democrats voted no, argued that she wasn't going to speculate at this point what she will do given the talks haven't really gotten underway. “We definitely don't need a short-term CR, and I don't think the American people want us funding an agency that is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said. Asked if he was open to a CR to give talks more time, Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, shot back “more time for what?” President Donald Trump announced Thursday that Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will visit the White House on March 19, praising her leadership ahead of Japan's upcoming legislative elections. Trump highlighted the significance of Japan's vote scheduled for Sunday, calling it critical to the country's future and offering an emphatic endorsement of Takaichi. “The Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, has already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise Leader, and one that truly loves her Country,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post, adding that he looks forward to welcoming her to Washington later in March. The president first met Takaichi during his Asia trip in October, where the two leaders spent time together during meetings with business executives and government officials. During that visit, Trump received a Nobel Peace Prize nomination from Takaichi, the second of his Asia trip, along with a golf putter that had belonged to the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who famously bonded with Trump over golf. “I got to know her pretty well in a short period of time.” America's affordability challenges and the next leader of the Federal Reserve were a sticking point in a heated exchange between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) pressed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about rising US grocery prices after President Trump continues to falsely say that grocery prices are falling. In today's congressional hearing, Warren referred to recent comments from President Donald Trump where he referred to affordability as a “hoax.” Bessent pushed back against Warren, saying, “It may be a bit nuanced for you, but what President Trump is referring to is the media saying that the affordability crisis was generated by this administration, when it was you and President Biden.” Warren then pressed Bessent over whether grocery prices dropped last year. “So, if you're just going to insult people by denying the facts that are out there and tell people they're doing great when they're struggling, I think that's just another way to say you don't have a plan to bring down these prices.” Talks intended to end the Ukraine war concluded Thursday in an agreement to reopen a military communication channel between the US and Russia, President Donald Trump's top foreign envoy said, though so far no resolution to the conflict appears at hand. “This channel of communication was suspended prior to the onset of this conflict and is crucial to achieving and maintaining peace,” Witkoff said, adding it would be led on the US side by General Alexus Grynkewich, commander of US European Command. He also noted a prisoner exchange agreed to by both sides, the first in several months. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said today that lawmakers aren't “anywhere close” on a deal and has criticized Democrats' proposal for Immigration and Customs Enforcement reforms. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump praised his spy chief Tulsi Gabbard today for her role in investigating what he claimed was “international cheating” in US elections. Gabbard has faced questions over her involvement in the controversial search of a Georgia elections office. If you're joining us, here's a roundup of today's other top headlines: CNN's Tami Luhby, Alejandra Jaramillo, Kaanita Iyer, Holmes Lybrand, Veronica Stracqualursi, Alicia Wallace, Sana Noor Haq, Victoria Butenko, Anna Chernova, Svitlana Vlasova and Lauren Kent contributed to this report. “They haven't even reached out to begin negotiations,” Hawley told CNN on Thursday as Sen. Katie Britt, a Republican appropriator leading talks, says she has yet to make contact with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democratic leaders. So what they want to do now is essentially tie ICE up and also CBP, so they can't really work,” Hawley said, adding, “That's good for nobody, except for criminals. And I am not going to help them do that.” “So last night, after our attempts to have that conversation, we then, yet again, see a list of demands grow from three to 10 without any communication.” She added: “That is not the way good faith negotiations begin or end.” Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican who has been central to major bipartisan negotiations like gun reform, said he does not believe this negotiation will end with DHS reforms, and instead will result in a one-year continuing resolution for the agency. Cornyn said Democrats are holding funding “hostage” over “what I would consider ridiculous demands on the administration.” “It's a non-serious demand,” Cornyn said of the Democrats' list from last night. Cornyn said a hold out of DHS funding will have a more significant impact on TSA, FEMA and the Coast Guard than it will Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection, given that President Donald Trump's signature law from last year injected ICE and CBP with plenty of cash to fund their actions for the next fiscal year — even if Congress doesn't give them a penny more. But a lot of that stuff, obviously just wasn't serious,” he added. “It seems like they are posturing themselves in such a way that, you know, would make any sort of a middle ground virtually impossible to find, at least right now,” Thune said. I think there's some things that could get done, but, you know, you have to have people at the table to do that. Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama is Thune's point person for the talks, but Thune said she's “reached out multiple times now to Sen. Schumer or whomever he wants to negotiate on his behalf. Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the DHS appropriations subcommittee, which Britt chairs, said Wednesday afternoon he had not heard from Republicans to begin talks and said it's incumbent on them to reach out since they are in the majority Thune added that it's “pretty clearly” Congress will need to pass another short-term government funding bill due to the nearing deadline and he'd probably file a bill Monday. If DHS shuts down, he will cancel a recess planned the week after next. A lot of senators in both parties are planning to attend the Munich Security Conference. “If we're we get to the end of next week and we're shutdown posture, I think that the idea of people going on trips, no matter how justified or well-intended they are, seems like they ought to be a non-starter,” he said. Senate Republican leader John Thune on Thursday said that lawmakers aren't “anywhere close” on a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security, with a short timeframe for negotiations before funding expires next Friday. Democrats are demanding several reforms to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, some of which Republicans have already rejected – like unmasking federal agents and requiring judicial warrants – a sign that the two sides are far apart on the issue. Thune said Senate GOP negotiators had reached out to Democrats yesterday for talks with them and the White House. We've got a now one week and one day timeframe in which to do this, which is entirely unrealistic,” Thune said on the Senate floor. Thune also insisted that “this is not a blank check situation where Republicans just agree to a list of Democrat demands.” He called for a “serious discussion” about the “climate of harassment” federal immigration officials have faced and to address the “issue of cooperation between local and federal law enforcement” “If, for some reason, the Department of Homeland Security ends up in a shutdown. In its latest effort to weaken the federal workforce, the Trump administration issued a rule today that would shift an estimated 50,000 senior career staffers into a new category that would make them easier to fire. The controversial rule allows agencies to reclassify federal employees involved in policy into at-will positions that don't provide the same job protections that other career workers have. “Agency supervisors report great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct,” it said. The new category “will allow agencies to quickly remove employees from critical positions who engage in misconduct, perform poorly, or obstruct the democratic process by intentionally subverting Presidential directives.” The rule stems from an executive order President Donald Trump signed his first day in office last year. President Donald Trump on Thursday said his Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard recently went to Fulton County, Georgia, to probe alleged ballot irregularities at Attorney General Pam Bondi's “insistence.” The president's public praise for his spy chief for her role in investigating “international cheating” into US elections comes as she has faced questions over her involvement in the controversial elections office search. “We have our director of national and international intelligence,” Trump said at the morning's National Prayer Breakfast, adding: “She took a lot of heat because she went at Pam's insistence. The president went on to praise both officials for their work. Trump's remarks also come a day after he said “I don't know” when asked why Gabbard joined the FBI agents there. Here's what a GOP congressman told CNN's John Berman earlier when asked about Gabbard: President Donald Trump is launching a new direct-to-consumer prescription drug platform Thursday evening, advancing an initiative central to his efforts to alleviate Americans' affordability concerns. Trump has touted the drug pricing push as a major step toward lowering Americans' health costs, securing deals with at least 16 pharmaceutical companies to list certain products on the TrumpRx portal. It could make certain medicines — particularly obesity medications that are not widely covered by job-based policies — more affordable, experts say. But many consumers could ultimately pay less if they go through their insurance. While welcoming foreign leaders at the National Prayer Breakfast, President Donald Trump singled out El Salvador President Nayib Bukele for being a “great ally,” calling him “one of my favorite people.” He has been such a great ally of this country.” Former Cecot detainees told CNN that for months at the mega-prison, they were beaten by prison guards, shot with pellets, deprived of adequate medical care and denied any due process. Trump railed against Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie for his constant opposition to key pieces of legislation, calling the Republican lawmaker a “moron” and complaining that he'd vote against almost any bill put on the House floor. “This guy named Thomas Massie, there's something wrong with him.” Trump also mocked Massie's chances of reelection in a race where the president has vowed to boost his primary opponent. Trump also attacked Democrats in the early moments of his speech over their opposition to imposing strict nationwide voter ID laws, while questioning “how a person of faith can vote for a Democrat.” The president later repeated his false claims that he won the popular vote in 2016 and that his subsequent 2020 election loss to former President Joe Biden was “rigged.” The president addressed past comments that had sparked headlines and scrutiny, saying earlier remarks suggesting he was not “heaven-bound” were made in jest. Trump said he often chooses to be “sarcastic with the media,” arguing that “they write your words,” and mocking coverage that followed his earlier comments, adding he was “just having fun.” The president's remarks come after he told reporters aboard Air Force One in October of last year, “I don't think there's anything going to get me in heaven,” while traveling to Israel. President Donald Trump is now delivering remarks at the annual National Prayer Breakfast. This year, however, it is taking place as a single gathering to continue “a tradition of fellowship and unified prayer,” according to the White House.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Tearful plea: “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie is pleading for her 84-year-old mother's safe return. • Still no suspects: Investigators believe Nancy Guthrie was taken from her home against her will, but there are no suspects yet, the sheriff's department said yesterday, warning that sharing unverified accusations or false information is “irresponsible.” The Pima County Sheriff's Department is expected to hold a news conference about the investigation at 1 p.m. It will be the first time since Tuesday Sheriff Chris Nanos has held a formal briefing on the case, which is now in its fifth day. Director Kash Patel is receiving personal updates from his team. A large law enforcement presence was seen at Guthrie's home Wednesday, carrying evidence bags. Wednesday evening, as hundreds gathered for a candlelight vigil to pray for Nancy Guthrie's safe return, her children posted a video on social media with a simple plea: Please pray for our mother and bring her home. Speaking at times through tears, Savannah Guthrie described her mom as a strong, faithful woman and “God's precious daughter.” “Psalm 23 is our secret code, God and me,” she writes of the famous scripture. Guthrie writes she's learned to find hope and comfort in the verse that proclaims, “though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil.” “We believe and know that even in this valley, (God) is with you,” Guthrie said. Nancy Guthrie's three children shared an emotional plea for her return in a video released yesterday. Holding a law degree, she also is NBC News' chief legal correspondent. The eldest sibling, Camron Guthrie, is a retired military pilot. In a 2018 social media post, Savannah noted he had taken his final flight as an F-16 pilot, had “flown for our country for 26 years,” and at the time was serving with the Vermont Air National Guard with the rank of colonel. At least three media outlets — TMZ and CNN Tucson affiliates KOLD and KGUN — received ransom notes this week demanding millions of dollars in bitcoin for Nancy Guthrie's safe return. Bitcoin and other digital currencies have long been a preferred payment method for criminals because the funds can be moved instantaneously around the globe without needing a bank as an intermediary. Bitcoin or other tokens can be sent from one anonymous digital wallet to another, making it difficult for law enforcement to identify the people behind the transfers. Vast money-laundering networks have expanded as crypto crime has grown more sophisticated, further hindering law enforcement. Physical crimes such as kidnapping involving crypto are also on the rise. Last year, there were more than 30 so-called “wrench attacks” involving crypto extortion, according to industry researcher Chainalysis, though it notes many of the crimes go unreported. One of those attacks made national news over the summer, when a 28-year-old crypto investor escaped from a luxury Manhattan apartment, accusing two men of holding him captive for weeks while he was beaten and threatened with death. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated,” she said, adding the family needs proof Nancy Guthrie is alive. CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe breaks down the video from Savannah Guthrie and her siblings pleading for their mom's safe return. “I feel like this is a fairly strong signal that they do not believe that they've had a legitimate ransom demand yet,” he says. Savannah Guthrie, flanked by her brother and sister, released a desperate plea Wednesday for their mom's safe return, calling out the 84-year-old woman's fragile health as she pleaded with whoever has Nancy Guthrie to contact them. “Our mom is a kind, faithful, loyal, fiercely loving woman of goodness and light. She is without that medication, according to Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos. “The clock is ticking here because the victim is so uniquely vulnerable due to her age, due to her physical ailments and things of that nature,” Andrew McCabe, CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former deputy director of the FBI, said Thursday. “The stress of being detained in the way she likely is, is just enormous for anyone, and particularly for … an older person like her.” One of the key goals of the emotional video put out Wednesday night by Savannah Guthrie and her siblings is to find out whether purported ransom notes that have surfaced this week are authentic, a criminologist tells CNN. It was a demand for proof of life,” Casey Jordan told CNN's Rahel Solomon on Thursday morning. The Pima County Sheriff's Department has said it does not have a suspect in the abduction of Nancy Guthrie and has very little physical evidence to go on, though Jordan noted investigators aren't always fully forthcoming. If clues really are that sparse, it is a sign of how elaborate the kidnapping was, she said. CNN's Erin Burnett speaks with KOLD anchor Mary Coleman, who describes how her station received a possible ransom note via email in connection to Nancy Guthrie's disappearance. They could be seen carrying evidence bags into the house and appeared to bring some of them back outside and loaded them into a vehicle, CNN's Ed Lavandera reported. The law enforcement presence, which included FBI agents, eventually cleared. Sniffing dogs were also on the scene, CNN affiliate KXNV reported. Authorities are also looking into a possible recent trespassing that occurred near the 84-year-old's home, as well as “all other cases within a close radius” to the residence, sheriff's officials  said in an update Wednesday. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said Nancy's daughter, ‘Today” show anchor Savannah Guthrie, “has a security team” that has been staying in touch with the sheriff's department. Nancy Guthrie's home has been turned back over to her family. The beloved mother and grandmother, who needs crucial medication daily, was last seen at her home in the Catalina Foothills near Tucson Saturday night. In a wrenching video shared Wednesday evening, her three children pleaded for their missing mother's safe return. As detectives continue to comb through evidence in the apparent abduction, they are also facing questions over alleged ransom notes and a deluge of rumors on social media. Perched along the Santa Catalina Mountains, the Catalina Hills community where Nancy Guthrie lives is known for outdoor activities, not crime scene investigations. Homes in the desert community are spaced out and tucked away behind desert foliage, according to Nancy Guthrie's neighbor, Jeff Lamie, and the quality of life is, as the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show anchor Savannah Guthrie has described, “laid back and gentle.” “I like to watch the javelinas eat my plants,” Savannah Guthrie once said, referring to pig-looking animals that are often seen in the area. In 1988, Charles died of a heart attack when Savannah was just 16 years old, a moment that the anchor told NBC tore her “whole world apart.” “We had a spoken or unspoken pact that on the weekends, even though we were college girls, one of us would always stay home on one of the weekend nights so that my mom wouldn't be alone,” Savannah said in 2017. Arizona's Pima County Sheriff says they are not dismissing unverified ransom notes that were sent to multiple media outlets in the Nancy Guthrie case. Arizona's Pima County Sheriff says they are not dismissing unverified ransom notes that were sent to multiple media outlets in the Nancy Guthrie case. Hundreds of people from the Tucson, Arizona, community gathered at a church Wednesday night for a candlelight service to pray for Nancy Guthrie's safe return, CNN affiliate KOLD reported. “What is happening is heart-wrenching and this community needed this,” Sally Shamrell, a friend of Nancy's daughter Savannah Guthrie, who helped put together the service, told KOLD. In a statement on her social media accounts Tuesday, “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie spoke of her mother's faith and asked supporters to “raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in the very moment.” “It's to show that we are still hopeful, and I do believe in the power of prayer,” Guthrie family friend Cindy Klingberg told the outlet. “We don't know her, but … we wanted to show the support that Tucson has for her in the community,” attendee Brian Salado said. But, the “Today” host said, the family needs proof their 84-year-old mother is alive, because “we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated.” Investigators searching for Nancy Guthrie have encountered several key challenges in the days since the 84-year-old mother of “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie went missing, suspected of being taken from her home. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he is directing “ALL Federal Law Enforcement” to help the Guthrie family and local law enforcement in Arizona in finding Nancy Guthrie. “I spoke with Savannah Guthrie, and let her know that I am directing ALL Federal Law Enforcement to be at the family's, and Local Law Enforcement's, complete disposal, IMMEDIATELY. We are deploying all resources to get her mother home safely,” he wrote on Truth Social.

President Donald Trump joked during Thursday's National Prayer Breakfast that he can't sleep on planes because he's busy watching for "missiles and enemies." President Donald Trump quipped during his speech at the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, "I don't sleep on planes. I don't like sleeping on planes. I like looking out the window, watching for missiles and enemies, actually," Trump said on Thursday, drawing laughter from the crowd. Trump joined the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday morning, which pulls together bipartisan lawmakers, business leaders and foreign dignitaries to reflect on faith and prayer for the nation. It was the sixth time Trump has attended the event since his first administration in 2017. The president has long been known to avoid sleeping while flying on Air Force One. His quip about looking for missiles came as he recounted first meeting Daniel "Raizin" Caine, who now serves as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about defeating ISIS during his first term. President Trump speaks during the National Prayer Breakfast at the Washington Hilton in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 5, 2026. Caine told Trump that an area had been prepared for him to nap during the 20-hour journey, which Trump refused so the pair could discuss strategies to wipe out ISIS. And I say, ‘what the hell kind of a name is that? Lt. Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attends the special session of Israel's Knesset on Oct. 13, 2025, in Jerusalem. They don't want us to hit them. You know, we have a big fleet going over to Iran. But so Razin was there at the bottom of the plane," he said. Trump continued his speech by taking a victory lap for the strength of the U.S. military under his second term, including capturing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and striking Iran's nuclear facilities. "Two years ago, you couldn't get anybody to go into the military. They didn't respect our president. They thought he was a joke. They thought our country was a joke," Trump said. President Donald Trump speaks during a visit with Michigan Air National Guard troops on April 29, 2025, at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan. And we weren't allowed to charge, and they were allowed to charge. But we are allowed to charge, and I hope we get that Supreme Court decision, because we have taken in hundreds of billions of dollars of money." Trump also reflected on his faith and administration's mission to protect religious liberty. "They declared that all of us are made free and equal by the hand of our Creator," Trump said of the Founding Fathers in 1776. "A lot of presidents refuse to say that. Some major politicians refuse to say the word ‘God.' They don't want to say it. I say it, that we are endowed with our sacred rights to life, liberty, and not by government, but by God Almighty himself."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Thursday that Russia's Starlink satellite internet terminals in Ukraine have been “cut off,” disrupting Russian military communications. Ukrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said SpaceX, which owns Starlink, is working with Ukraine to update a “whitelist” of approved and verified Starlink terminals, while unapproved Russian systems have been blocked. The Russians' terminals have already been blocked,” Fedorov said in a statement Thursday. Under US sanctions, Starlink cannot be sold to or used by Russia. However, analysts and Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia has increasingly been finding ways to leverage the system to its own advantage. CNN previously reported on Russia's practice of mounting Starlink systems on its attack drones, which allow the weapons to bypass Ukraine's electronic defenses that disable drones by jamming GPS and radio signals, and to strike deeper into the country. Ukraine has also relied heavily on Starlink since the beginning the war, using it to operate military communications and drones, as well as information systems for public institutions like hospitals and schools. All command and control of the troops has collapsed. Assault operations have been halted in many areas,” said Serhii Beskrestnov, an adviser to the defense minister. Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, said earlier this week that it was taking steps to stop Russia's “unauthorized” use of the Starlink satellite internet constellation. Musk reiterated Thursday that it's “important to register your Starlink terminal if in Ukraine.” SpaceX counters Russia's ‘unauthorized' use of Starlink to guide drones in Ukraine One pro-Kremlin military blogger, Boris Rozhin, wrote a Q&A-style post on Telegram, saying, “Yes, it will have a certain impact on internet availability in the field,” and “yes, there are no alternatives at all, right now.” He also claimed that Russian forces were working to bypass the block and to bring high-speed internet to the field using other methods. One Ukrainian combat officer, Tetiana Chornovol, posted on social media that “the shutdown of Starlink left my two combat positions without communication,” adding that her unit has since brought in an alternative communication system. “We immediately registered our Starlink terminal, and everything is fine.” Ukrainian presidential chief of staff Kyrylo Budanov, who was part of his country's delegation, described the negotiations as “truly constructive.” While no breakthrough deal came out of the two days of talks, Russia and Ukraine did agree to conduct their first prisoner exchange since October. Each returned 157 prisoners of war to the other side on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS and US negotiator Steve Witkoff. “While significant work remains, steps like this demonstrate that sustained diplomatic engagement is delivering tangible results and advancing efforts to end the war in Ukraine,” Witkoff said Thursday in a post on X.

Asked if he will remove Kristi Noem as DHS secretary, President Trump on Thursday said 'No...We have the strongest border in the history of our country.' A majority of voters say Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem should be removed from her job, according to a new national poll. Fifty-eight percent of those questioned in a Quinnipiac University survey in the field from Jan. 29 to Feb. 2 said it's time for Noem to go, with 34% saying she should remain on the job. The survey was conducted amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and in the wake of two fatal shootings by federal agents of U.S. citizens in Minnesota who were opposing the administration's aggressive deportation efforts. In the immediate aftermath of the second shooting last month of Alex Pretti, who at the time was legally armed with a handgun, Noem claimed Pretti was threatening federal agents and labeled his actions "domestic terrorism." Mourners gather at a makeshift memorial in the area where Alex Pretti was shot dead a day earlier by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Jan. 25, 2026. But videos of the shooting depicted Pretti, an ICU nurse at a VA Hospital, appearing to attend to a woman whom agents had knocked down when he was sprayed with an irritant, pushed to the ground and beaten. On the ground, bystanders said he was brandishing a cell phone rather than his weapon, and an agent was seen pulling Pretti's gun from his waistband before other agents fired several shots and killed him. The Trump administration has faced mounting criticism and political backlash, with some top Democrats in Congress and at least two Republican senators — Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — calling on Noem to be removed. But Trump is standing by Noem, saying in a social media post last Friday that she "has done a really GREAT JOB!" And on Thursday, during remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump reiterated that he's not removing Noem. Noem, in an interview last week on Fox News' "Hannity," argued that "radicals" are behind the calls for her to be fired. "These radicals are attacking me, but I'm just doing my job. I'm following the law, enforcing the laws like President Trump promised that he would do to keep people safe in this country," she told Fox News' host Sean Hannity. And taking aim at Democratic leaders in Minnesota, Noem charged Wednesday in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital along the U.S.-Mexico border that "the way that it has been in Minneapolis is largely due to the rhetoric. The Quinnipiac poll spotlights a massive partisan divide over Noem, with 91% of Democrats and 63% of Independents but just 17% of Republicans saying she should be removed as DHS secretary. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks during a roundtable in the State Dining Room of the White House on Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2025. The latest Fox News national poll, conducted Jan. 23–26, indicates the president's approval on handling border security at 52%-47%, but his approval on immigration is underwater at 45%-55%. The Trump administration on Wednesday announced it was removing 700 of the roughly 3,000 federal immigration agents in Minnesota. And Trump, in an NBC News interview, said immigration agents should be using a "softer touch." "But you still have to be tough."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>National Democratic officials have drilled down on cost-of-living issues, while progressives and grassroots activists have criticized party leaders, arguing their opposition to President Donald Trump has been anemic. They've railed against immigration enforcement, condemned the deaths of two Minneapolis protesters shot by federal agents and bemoaned the erosion of democratic norms. Four candidates have emerged as perceived front-runners: Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, former New Jersey Rep. Tom Malinowski, former New Jersey Working Families Alliance leader Analilia Mejia, and former Lt. Gov. “For each of those four people, I could give you a list of reasons why they will win and a list of reasons why they won't,” said Laura Matos, a New Jersey-based Democratic strategist. The rest of the field includes former paratrooper Zach Beecher; community advocate, lawyer and comedian J-L Cauvin; Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett; Cammie Croft, who worked in the Obama administration; Jeff Grayzel, a two-term mayor of Morris Township; Chatham Borough Council Member Justin Strickland; and community advocate Anna Lee Williams. Once a Republican stronghold, Democrats have held the 11th District – which includes parts of northern New Jersey's Essex, Morris and Passaic counties – since Sherrill flipped the seat in 2018. The district shifted further left in 2022 after redistricting. Leading into Thursday's vote, the candidates have called on their party to take on a more confrontational stance in Washington, particularly towards US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Several candidates argued the agency should be defunded. “We see what's going on out in Minnesota,” said Way, the former lieutenant governor and secretary of state. “Totally unacceptable, unconstitutional and un-American, with the ICE raids, but also trying to extort personal data off of the voter rolls.” Way noted her own fights against Republicans who sued to access New Jersey's voter data as an example of her record pushing back on the administration. Gill has pointed to his experience as both an elected official and former congressional staffer, as well as his work with his local Democratic Party, which organized a “No Kings” protest. “I think I have, at certain times, felt that we needed to be more aggressive in our pushback against what's coming out of Washington,” he said, arguing Democrats should have rejected more of Trump's political appointees. Mejia, a longtime Democratic activist who served as the national political director for independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, said she was drawn to enter the race after Democrats ended last year's government shutdown without securing an extension of the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax subsidies. Mejia has solidified her position in the progressive lane with endorsements from Sanders, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others. “What I hope we will see on Thursday, is regular, everyday voters reclaiming the drive, tone, tenor, focus of our own party,” Mejia said. Malinowski, who flipped New Jersey's 7th District during the 2018 wave but lost his 2022 reelection bid, has argued he's the only who has already pushed back on Trump in Congress. He has led the field in fundraising and has broader name recognition thanks to his years as a swing-district lawmaker. But he's also been subject to attack ads over his failure to properly disclose his stock trades while in office. United Democracy Project, a group aligned with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, has spent more than $1.7 million on TV ads attacking Malinowski, according to AdImpact. The group has highlighted his stock trading and sought to tie him to Trump, pointing to his vote for a bipartisan 2019 omnibus spending bill that include funding for ICE. Malinowski has been vocal about what he called the agency's “unlawful and despicable” enforcement operations, and called the attack “outrageous.” “It's our goal to build the largest bipartisan pro-Israel majority in Congress,” said Patrick Dorton, a spokesperson for the United Democracy Project. Gill has also laid into Malinowski over the disclosure issue, arguing the controversy contributed to his 2022 loss to Republican Tom Kean Jr. The county commissioner, who launched his own campaign outside his childhood home in the district, has also knocked Malinowski for switching districts. While in office, Malinowski described his failure to disclose his trades on time as “a matter of carelessness on my part, which I regret and take full responsibility for,” according to a report from the former Office of Congressional Ethics. The House Ethics Committee's investigation into his stock trade disclosures ended when Malinowski left office and would need to be reopened by the committee to continue. Malinowski said the attacks on stock trading Gill has raised in this race mirror those Republicans made against him in 2022. “Their goal is to intimidate the Democratic Party,” he said. “If it works here, we're going to see the same play in multiple other Democratic primaries. If we stop it here, the party will be more immune.”</p>

Former SJSU volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser revealed to Fox News Digital she developed severe anorexia and sleep issues, she says was due to a national controversy over her trans teammate. The parents of former San Jose State University volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser made their first public statement since the U.S. Department of Education determined the school violated Title IX while Slusser was enrolled. Slusser filed a lawsuit against representatives of SJSU and the Mountain West Conference after she allegedly was made to share a bedroom and changing spaces with Fleming without being told of Fleming's biological sex. Slusser's parents, Paul and Kim Slusser, provided a joint statement to Fox News Digital addressing the crackdown on the university. Former SJSU volleyball star Brooke Slusser and her parents Paul and Kim Slusser at a game on Sept. 8, which Kim claims is "the last fond memory we have of her playing." San Jose State University completely failed its female athletes, and it's about time they're held accountable," the statement read. "We're watching closely to see how they respond, and our next step is to fight for justice in court. San Jose State and the Mountain West Conference betrayed the volleyball team, and they will have to answer for it." "I went from around 160 to 128 [pounds] in that one semester. It definitely isn't healthy for someone of my size to be that weight, and I ended up losing my menstrual cycle for nine months. So it was definitely severe," the 5-foot-11 Slusser previously told Fox News Digital. "As soon as the season was over, she came home for Christmas, and we were like, 'You're not going back,'" Paul Slusser previously told Fox News Digital, adding that he told his daughter, "You can go get your stuff next summer when your lease is up, and stay here." Once winter break was over, and what was supposed to be her final semester began, Brooke attempted to complete her courses online. Her parents said she began online classes, but dropped them shortly later. As a Division I scholarship athlete, dropping the classes resulted in her losing the scholarship, and her family had to pay for the full semester's worth of tuition and her housing out of pocket. So it was a pretty large financial burden on us when that happened," Paul Slusser said. The Education Department gave SJSU an ultimatum to comply with a series of agreements or risk "imminent enforcement action." SJSU responded to the ultimatum in a statement. "San Jose State, a member of the California State University system, received notification from the federal Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights regarding its investigation into athletics participation on our past women's volleyball teams. "We remain committed to providing a safe, respectful, and inclusive educational environment for all students while complying with applicable laws and regulations."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kamala Harris is relaunching — part of her social media presence. The former vice president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee on Thursday rebooted the KamalaHQ account, which has over 1 million followers on X and more than 5 million on TikTok, as just Headquarters, which in a partnership with the left-leaning People for the American Way she's calling “an online organizing project for next generation campaigning.” Progressives have historically built machines that dismantle after Election Day. Headquarters is the end of that cycle,” reads a press release from the new group, which also now plans to post on Substack, YouTube and other platforms. Stay engaged, and I'll see you out there,” Harris says in a video recorded for the launch. Harris recently began a second leg of touring around her best-selling campaign memoir that is less about recounting the stories in “107 Days” and more geared to her interest in talking about what she thinks needs to happen next. Though Harris says she﻿ has stepped out of politics for the moment, she has left the door open to another presidential run. So far, Harris has been talking regularly about how both Democrats and Republicans failed people, so that, as she put it in a speech to the Democratic National Committee meeting in Los Angeles in December, “The American dream has become more of a myth than reality.” “Government is viewed as fundamentally unable to meet the needs of its people. In these and so many other ways, the people feel that the very institutions that were designed to support them have failed them,” Harris said then. Harris will have an honorary role in Headquarters as chair emerita, with a group of advisers and operatives drawn from both her campaign alumni and People for the American Way, including her top senior adviser Kirsten Allen and Rob Flaherty, who served as deputy campaign manager for Joe Biden and then Harris in 2024. Parker Butler and Lauren Kapp, who led the KamalaHQ team in 2024, will remain involved. She will, though, continue on her book tour through the spring.

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File) TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — NBC “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie sent a public message to her 84-year-old mother's kidnapper on Wednesday saying that her family is ready to talk but wants proof that she is alive. Guthrie said in a recorded video posted on social media that her family has heard media reports about a ransom letter for Nancy Guthrie, who authorities believe was taken from her home in Arizona against her will. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated,” Savannah Guthrie said while reading from a prepared statement. She was last seen around 9:45 p.m. Saturday, when she was dropped off at home by family after having dinner with them, the sheriff's department said. The family posted the message after police conducted a search in and around Nancy Guthrie's home for several hours Wednesday. “This is a follow up investigation,” he said in reference to officials returning Wednesday. Multiple media organizations reported receiving purported ransom notes Tuesday that they handed over to investigators. The sheriff's department had said it was taking the notes and other tips seriously but declined to comment further. Savannah Guthrie was at times emotional during the recording, with her voice cracking. She smiled and looked into the camera when addressing her mother directly, saying that the family was praying for her and that people were looking for her. This image provided by the Pima County Sheriff's Department, on Monday, Feb. 2, 2026, shows a missing person alert for Nancy Guthrie. “Talk to her and you'll see,” she said. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos' office said detectives still were speaking with anyone who had contact with Nancy Guthrie last weekend but that no suspect or person of interest had been identified. Nanos suggested there was video from some cameras, though he didn't elaborate, adding: “That's all been submitted and we're doing our best with the companies that own those cameras or built those cameras.” Law enforcement officers are present outside the home of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie, near Tucson, Ariz., Monday, Feb. 2, 2026. Guthrie has limited mobility, and officials do not believe she left on her own. Jim Mason, longtime commander of a search-and-rescue posse in Maricopa County, isn't involved in the search for Guthrie but said desert terrain can make looking for missing people difficult. He said it can be hard to peer into areas that are dense with mesquite trees, cholla cactus and other desert brush. A couple hundred people attended an evening vigil for Nancy Guthrie at a Tucson church where they heard prayers and placed lit candles on an altar. Afterward, Jeremy Thacker had tears in his eyes as he described the heartbreak and helplessness he was experiencing over Guthrie's disappearance. He worked with Savannah Guthrie at a local news station and they shared losing their fathers at a young age. Thacker said he knew Nancy Guthrie to be sharp, grounded and earnest. On the other side of the country, Victory Church in Albany, New York, said it's offering a $25,000 reward for information that leads to finding Nancy Guthrie. “Me and my wife, we watch Savannah every single morning. And she's got such a sweet spirit,” Pastor Charlie Muller said. The White House said President Donald Trump called and spoke with Savannah Guthrie on Wednesday.

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File) “I spoke with Savannah Guthrie, and let her know that I am directing ALL Federal Law Enforcement to be at the family's, and Local Law Enforcement's, complete disposal, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “We are deploying all resources to get her mother home safely.” For a third day, “Today” opened with Guthrie's disappearance, but Savannah Guthrie was not at the anchor's desk. NBC Sports said Tuesday that she will not be covering the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics “as she focuses on being with her family during this difficult time.” The “Today” host grew up in Tucson, graduated from the University of Arizona and previously worked as a reporter and anchor at Tucson television station KVOA. The youngest of three siblings, she credits her mom with holding their family together after her father died of a heart attack at 49, when Savannah was just 16.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The names and faces of sexual abuse victims. Bank account and Social Security numbers in full view. All of these things appeared in the mountain of documents released Friday by the U.S. Justice Department as part of its effort to comply with a law requiring it to open its investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein. That law was intended to preserve important privacy protections for Epstein's victims. Their names were supposed to have been blacked out in documents. Their faces and bodies were supposed to be obscured in photos. A review by The Associated Press and other news organizations has found countless examples of sloppy, inconsistent or nonexistent redactions that have revealed sensitive private information. A photo of one girl who was underage when she was hired to give sexualized massages to Epstein in Florida appeared in a chart of his alleged victims. Police reports with the names of several of his victims, including some who have never stepped forward to identify themselves publicly, were released with no redactions at all. Some accusers and their lawyers called this week for the Justice Department to take down the site and appoint an independent monitor to prevent further errors. As a rule, the AP does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted or subjected to severe abuse. We typically only identify them if they have publicly identified themselves — at a news conference or in court, for example. But that lawyer, Brittany Henderson, said they were still weighing “all potential avenues of recourse” to address the “permanent and irreparable” harm caused to some women. “The failure here is not merely technical,” she said in a statement Wednesday. “It is a failure to safeguard human beings who were promised protection by our government. Annie Farmer, who said she was 16 when she was sexually assaulted by Epstein and his confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, said that while her name has previously been public, other details she'd rather be kept private, including her date of birth and phone number, were wrongly revealed in the documents. “At this point, I'm feeling really most of all angry about the way that this unfolded,” she told NBC News. “The fact that it's been done in such a beyond careless way, where people have been endangered because of it, is really horrifying.” FILE - Annie Farmer, one of the four accusers who testified against Ghislaine Maxwell at trial, speaks to members of the media with her lawyer Sigrid McCawley outside federal court June 28, 2022, in New York. The Justice Department has blamed technical or human errors on the problems and said it has taken down many of the problematic materials and is working to republish properly redacted versions. Hundreds of lawyers were pulled from their regular duties, including overseeing criminal cases, to try and complete the document review — to the point where at least one judge in New York complained that it was holding up other matters. Associated Press reporters analyzing the documents have so far found multiple examples of names and other personal information of potential victims revealed. They have also found many cases of overzealous redactions. “A Nativity scene depicting Jesus, Mary and (REDACTED),” it said. In an email released in the files, a dog's name appeared to have been redacted: “I spent an hour walking (REDACTED) and then another hour bathing her blow drying her and brushing her. The Justice Department has said staff tasked with preparing the files for release were instructed to limit redactions only to information related to victims and their families, though in many documents the names of many other people were blacked out, including lawyers and public figures. The Justice Department has said it intended to black out any portion of a photo showing nudity, and any photos of women that could potentially show a victim. In some photos reviewed by The AP, those redactions did obscure women's faces, but left plenty of their bare skin exposed in a way that would likely embarrass the women anyway. One set of more than 100 images of a young woman were nearly all blacked out, save for the very last image, which revealed her entire face. Associated Press reporters from around the world contributed to this report. Journalists from each newsroom are working together to examine the files and share information about what is in them. Each outlet is responsible for its own independent news coverage of the documents.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A government attorney who told a federal judge this week that her job “sucks” and asked to be held in contempt so she “could get 24 hours of sleep” is no longer detailed to the U.S. attorney's office in Minnesota. An official familiar with the matter told a local NBC affiliate Wednesday that Le's detail ended following those remarks she made during a court hearing in Minneapolis. Le expressed frustration during a Tuesday immigration hearing before U.S. District Judge Jerry Blackwell, as the Trump administration continues a sweeping immigration enforcement operation in the state. I wish you could hold me in contempt so that I could get 24 hours of sleep,” Le said, according to reporting by NBC affiliate KARE. Le reportedly commented inside the court hearing that it was like “pulling teeth” to get DHS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Justice Department to comply with court orders. In a written order issued this week, Blackwell described the government's conduct as “alarming,” noting that “persistent noncompliance with orders in this District was extensively detailed just last week.” He cited a recent notice from Chief U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz, a George W. Bush appointee, who wrote that his “patience is at an end” and outlined what he said were 96 court orders in 74 immigration detention cases in which he claims the government failed to follow court orders. Meanwhile, independent reporting by Julie Kelly has suggested that Schiltz may not have accurately counted the cases he claimed reflected defiance by the Trump administration. “I truly hope the DOJ calls Schlitz out for these blatant misrepresentations,” Kelly wrote on X. “It is clear he did not check his work, simply compiled a list either based on staff input or these judges themselves (I suspect the latter).” The Washington Examiner asked a representative from Schiltz's chambers whether he has full confidence in the accuracy of Schiltz's tally of order violations. The office has struggled to retain career prosecutors and support staff in recent months, forcing the DOJ to detail attorneys from other agencies and surge temporary personnel into the district to keep cases moving.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump, left, and Chinese President Xi Jinping pose ahead of their summit talk at Gimhae International Airport in Busan, South Korea, Oct. 30, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed the situation in Iran in a wide-ranging call as the U.S. administration pushes Beijing and others to further isolate Tehran. Trump said the two leaders also discussed a broad range of other critical issues in the U.S.-China relationship, including trade and Taiwan and his plans to visit Beijing in April. “The relationship with China, and my personal relationship with President Xi, is an extremely good one, and we both realize how important it is to keep it that way,” Trump said in a social media posting about the call. The Chinese statement, however, made no mention of Trump's expected April visit to Beijing. Trump and Xi discussed Iran as tensions remain high between Washington and Tehran over Iran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month. Trump is also pressing Iran to make concessions over its nuclear program, which his Republican administration says was already set back by the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites during the 12-day war Israel launched against Iran in June. U.S. and Iranians officials said Wednesday they have agreed to hold high-level talks on Friday i n Oman. Trump announced last month that the U.S. would impose a 25% tax on imports to the United States from countries that do business with Iran. Years of sanctions aimed at stopping Iran's nuclear program have left the country isolated. China also made clear that it has no intention of stepping away from its long-term plans of reunification with Taiwan, a self-governing, democratic island operating independently from mainland China, though Beijing claims it as its own territory. The Trump administration in December announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones. The move continues to draw an angry response from Beijing. “Taiwan will never be allowed to separate from China,” the Chinese government statement said. Trump has made his case for the U.S. taking over the strategic island as necessary to rebuff Chinese and Russian encroachment, even as experts have repeatedly rebuffed Trump's claims of Chinese and Russian military forces lurking off Greenland's coastline. Separately, Xi also spoke on Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has indicated he would like to keep limits on nuclear weapons but wants to involve China in a potential new treaty. “I actually feel strongly that if we're going to do it, I think China should be a member of the extension,” Trump told The New York Times last month. The call with Xi also coincided with a ministerial meeting that the Trump administration convened in Washington with several dozen European, Asian and African nations to discuss how to rebuild global supply chains of critical minerals without Beijing. Critical minerals are needed for everything from jet engines to smartphones. China dominates the market for those ingredients crucial to high-tech products. “What is before all of us is an opportunity at self-reliance that we never have to rely on anybody else except for each other, for the critical minerals necessary to sustain our industries and to sustain growth,” Vice President JD Vance said at the gathering. Xi has recently held a series of meetings with Western leaders who have sought to boost ties with China amid growing concerns about Trump's tariff policies and calls for the U.S. to take over Greenland, a Danish territory. Vietnam and the European Union upgraded ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership last month, two days after the EU and India announced a free-trade agreement. And Canada struck a deal last month to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andrea Lucas, nominee to be a member of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, testifies during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing, June 18, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington. NEW YORK (AP) — The federal agency for protecting workers' civil rights revealed Wednesday that it is investigating sportswear giant Nike for allegedly discriminating against white employees through its diversity policies. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission disclosed the investigation in a motion filed in Missouri federal court demanding that Nike fully comply with a subpoena for information. The EEOC sought the company's criteria for selecting employees for layoffs, how it tracks and uses worker race and ethnicity data, and information about programs which allegedly provided race-restricted mentoring, leadership, or career development opportunities, according to court documents. “We have shared thousands of pages of information and detailed written responses to the EEOC's inquiry and are in the process of providing additional information,” Nike said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.” EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas has moved swiftly to target diversity and inclusion policies that she has long criticized as potentially discriminatory, tightly aligning the agency with one of President Donald Trump's top priorities. In November, the EEOC issued a similar subpoena against financial services provider Northwestern Mutual. “When there are compelling indications, including corporate admissions in extensive public materials, that an employer's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion-related programs may violate federal prohibitions against race discrimination or other forms of unlawful discrimination, the EEOC will take all necessary steps — including subpoena actions — to ensure the opportunity to fully and comprehensively investigate,” Lucas said in a statement. The disclosure comes two months after Lucas posted a social media call-out urging white men to come forward if they have experienced race or sex discrimination at work. Rather, Lucas filed her own complaint in May 2024 through a more rarely used tool known as a commissioner's charge, according to the court documents. Her charge came just months after America First Legal, a conservative legal group founded by top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, sent the EEOC a letter outlining complaints against Nike and urging the agency to file a commissioner's charge. America First Legal has flooded the EEOC with similar letters in recent years urging investigations into the DEI practices of major U.S. companies. It is unclear how many other companies the EEOC may be targeting through such commissioner's charges. The EEOC is prohibited from revealing any charge — by workers or commissioners — unless it results in fines, settlements, legal action or other such public actions. Lucas' charge, according to court filings, was based on Nike's publicly shared information about its commitment to diversity, including statements from executives and proxy statements. The charge, for example, cited Nike's publicly stated goal in 2021 of achieving 35% representation of racial and ethnic minorities in its corporate workforce by 2025. Companies have said such commitments are not quotas but rather goals they hoped to achieve through methods such as widening recruitment efforts and rooting out any bias during hiring process. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, employers are prohibited from using race as a criteria for hiring or other employment decisions. In its statement, Nike said it follows “all applicable laws, including those that prohibit discrimination.
