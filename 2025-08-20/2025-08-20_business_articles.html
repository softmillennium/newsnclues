                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve officials worried at their July meeting about the state of the labor market and inflation, though most agreed that it was too soon to lower interest rates, minutes released Wednesday showed. The meeting summary depicted a divergence of opinion among the central bankers, whose vote to hold their key rate steady came despite objections from two Fed governors who argued in favor of cutting. Policymakers noted rising threats to the economy that would warrant monitoring, though they largely agreed that their current stance was the appropriate way to go. While "a majority of participants judged the upside risk to inflation as the greater of these two risks" a couple saw "downside risk to employment the more salient risk." Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman voted against the decision to hold rates steady, preferring instead that the Federal Open Market Committee start lowering its key rate. The fed funds rate, which sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending but is used as a benchmark for other consumer rates, has been targeted between 4.25%-4.5% since December. This was the first time that multiple governors voted against a rate decision in more than 30 years. President Donald Trump's tariffs were a central part of the discussion. Coming against an increasingly heated political backdrop, the meeting saw officials express varying opinions on where they see the economy and policy headed. A staff assessment saw economic growth as "tepid" in the first half of the year though unemployment remained low. Various participants expressed uncertainty over the impact that tariffs would have on inflation while others worried that the jobs picture was starting to show cracks and would need a policy boost to prevent further damage. Decisions on rates would depend on "each variable's distance from the Committee's goal and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close." The meeting came just two days before a Bureau of Labor Statistics release showing that nonfarm payrolls growth had not only remained weak in July but also that June and May had seen much weaker growth than originally reported. Even without that information in hand, Fed officials noted that "downside risk to employment had meaningfully increased with the slowing of the growth of economic activity and consumer spending, and that some incoming data pointed to a weakening of labor market conditions." Powell is expected to use the speech to indicate at least a short-term direction for the Fed regarding rates as well as a longer-term view on policy. Trump has exerted fierce political pressure on the Fed to cut rates. With the resignation earlier this month of Governor Adriana Kugler, Trump will get to appoint another of his own candidates to the seat. Powell's term as chair expires in May 2026, though he can stay on as governor if he wishes through 2028. In the latest wrinkle, Trump has demanded the resignation of Governor Lisa Cook amid claims that she committed mortgage fraud regarding federal loans she received for properties in Georgia and Michigan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. health regulator has allowed a study of Rocket Pharmaceuticals' gene therapy to resume, less than three months after halting it following a patient's death. The drugmaker's shares soared over 30% in morning trading on Wednesday. Rocket's mid-stage trial, testing its experimental therapy, RP-A501, for a genetic disorder called Danon disease, was halted in May by the Food and Drug Administration after a patient died from a rare complication. The company said on Wednesday that the FDA has lifted its clinical hold on the trial, to be resumed with a revised pre-treatment regime and a lower dose of the gene therapy. Rocket said it will discontinue prophylactic use of drugs that inhibit the C3 protein, which is part of the immune system, as part of the pre-treatment regime. The patient had suffered from capillary leak syndrome, which can cause organ failure. In the new trial, three patients, at least four weeks apart, are expected to receive a lower dose of its therapy. Rocket said the adjusted dose was proposed based on data from an early-stage study, which showed a better safety profile. Danon disease, which affects males more severely than females, causes heart muscle damage and progressive muscle weakness. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intel is in talks with other large investors to receive an equity infusion at a discounted price, people familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber. Intel stock slid 7% on Wednesday, more than erasing its gains from earlier this week. The stock initially surged as investors responded to Intel's announcement of a $2 billion capital injection from SoftBank and reports that the Trump administration is weighing different ways to get involved with the company. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC on Tuesday that the U.S. government must receive an equity stake in Intel in exchange for CHIPS Act funds. Sources told Faber that the chipmaker is now looking beyond SoftBank for an equity boost. "They need money to build whatever it is that the customers may actually, ultimately want," Faber said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." "And having the CHIPS Act money, which is free, so to speak, no strings attached, become equity is not helpful to them because it's dilutive." Intel is attempting a turnaround after suffering from years of declining sales and shrinking market share. The company has struggled to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom in advanced semiconductors and has spent heavily to stand up a manufacturing business that's yet to secure a significant customer. Intel has also overhauled its leadership, bringing in Lip-Bu Tan to be its CEO in March, after his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was ousted in December. Two weeks ago, President Donald Trump called for Tan to resign, saying he was "highly CONFLICTED." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The head of President Donald Trump's housing regulatory agency said Wednesday that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook will have to resign, or else be fired for cause, over what he claims is evidence of "mortgage fraud" by the central bank official. "To be honest, I think she needs to resign quickly," Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said of Cook on CNBC's "Money Movers." The Justice Department is investigating Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and New York Attorney General Letitia James on similar grounds. It also shows Trump expanding his efforts for the Fed to slash interest rates, a pressure campaign that so far has mostly focused on central bank chairman Jerome Powell. Cook, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden in 2022, voted with the majority on the Federal Open Market Committee to keep rates unchanged after the group's latest meeting last month. The Fed and the DOJ declined CNBC's requests for comment on Pulte's claims and Trump's reaction. Pulte's central allegation is that Cook claimed two different properties as her primary residence at the same time. "You cannot do that in America," he said on CNBC. The agency chief, who has aggressively backed Trump's frequent attacks on the Fed and Powell, insisted that his actions were apolitical. "There's no funny business here," he said. "This is straightforward stuff, and if you commit mortgage fraud, especially in black and white, you will be prosecuted." But he tore into Cook at length on social media earlier Wednesday morning. In another, Pulte wrote that he believes Trump "has cause to fire" the Fed governor. Central bank governors can only be removed for "cause" under the law, which is generally understood to mean serious misconduct. Pulte repeated on CNBC that "of course" there was cause to fire Cook — though he appeared to suggest that Powell, not Trump, could be the one to do it. "I'll tell you this, Jay Powell, he has a chance to do the right thing by the law. I mean, this is just, you know, this is common sense, what he needs to do here," Pulte said. But The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 states explicitly that board members can only be removed by the president. Pulte's letter, dated Friday, alleged that mortgage documents obtained by FHFA appear to show Cook "falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud." He accused Cook of "falsifying residence statuses" for a residence in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and a property in Atlanta, Georgia "in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms." For both properties, Cook "appears to have acquired mortgages that do not meet certain lending requirements and could have received favorable loan terms under fraudulent circumstances," Pulte alleged.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Gates-backed Robotics startup Field AI has raised $405 million in two funding rounds, with investments from Nvidia's venture capital arm and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' family office. The funding comes during an "aha moment," founder and CEO Ali Agha told CNBC, as software and hardware reach an inflection point. The latest round values the two-year-old startup at $2 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified to discuss financial information. Along with NVentures and Bezos Expeditions, the rounds included investments from Khosla Ventures, Temasek, Canaan Partners and Intel Capital. Samsung and Gates Frontier, the Microsoft founder's investment fund, previously invested in the company. Agha said most investors approached FieldAI about investing. Field AI's latest round comes during a busy period for robotics startups as companies look to beef up their artificial intelligence offerings and improve on efficiency. Two-time CNBC Disruptor 50 startup Gecko Robotics raised $125 million in June to surpass a $1 billion valuation. Field AI, which includes former Deepmind, SpaceX, Amazon, Tesla Autopilot and NASA employees, creates models used to control robots worldwide and works across sectors, including construction, energy and logistics. The "effortless transferability" across environments and limited work on the customer side helps companies scale robots quickly, Agha said. Agha spent nearly a decade at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and specializes in robotics autonomy and physical AI. Agha said Field AI has added more than 100 positions over the last few months to meet growing customer demands and address labor shortages and safety efficiency needs. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HR software firm Dayforce said on Wednesday it was in advanced discussions to be acquired by Thoma Bravo for $70 per share, as private equity firms look to software as growth drivers in an uncertain economy. Dayforce's shares rose more than 3% before the bell. The offer represents a premium of 32.4% based on the stock's closing price on August 15, before the talks were first reported, and a deal value of $11.18 billion, according to Reuters calculations. If finalized, the deal will mark another private equity buyout of a software firm, with Thoma Bravo betting on the build-out of artificial-intelligence software and the resilience of recurring revenue in an economy pressured by trade tariffs and erratic spending. The human capital management market has undergone significant consolidation, with big players buying up smaller firms to bolster their products and grab market share amid signs of a deteriorating labor market. Paychex announced its acquisition of rival Paycor for $4.1 billion at the start of the year, while Automatic Data Processing acquired WorkForce Software last year for around $1.2 billion. Dayforce said there could be no assurances of whether an agreement for a transaction would be reached. The company, which provides human capital management and payroll services through its software platform, has seen its stock lose more than 9% of its value so far this year, underperforming peers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter The multiyear partnership will upgrade the NFL's sideline viewing system by equipping 32 teams with more than 2,500 custom-built Microsoft Surface Copilot tablets to enhance data collection during game days. Microsoft and the NFL said the deal will also support operations by helping managers track factors such as weather delays or technical equipment issues. With Microsoft's AI technologies, including Copilot, we see tremendous opportunities to elevate the gameday experience for our clubs and deliver an even more compelling product to our fans," NFL Chief Information Officer Gary Brantley said in a press release. Since the 2014 season, all NFL teams have had access to league-provided, specially configured Microsoft Surface tablets, according to the NFL. Previously, Microsoft had more than 2,300 Surface sideline viewing system devices installed across the NFL. He said that during live games, players have only seconds on the bench between plays to analyze formations and look at different angles and pictures. AI helps players and coaches filter through that tremendous amount of data automatically, Amendolia said. What it really is, is AI allowing people to get at information faster with less manual intervention," Amendolia said. For coaches, Amendolia said game data such as snap counts or personnel counts on the field can be fed into an Excel sheet in real time with Copilot, which frees them from doing such tasks and calculations themselves. Most recently during the 2025 NFL Combine, coaches and scouts used Microsoft Azure AI to evaluate more than 300 prospective players for selection in the NFL draft. Microsoft said Wednesday that clubs will soon be able to use AI for drafts outside of the NFL Combine, as well as for productivity across all business functions, including finance, human resources and events. Football club staff will also soon be able to use AI agents for player scouting and salary cap management, Microsoft said. The league has already implemented a type of artificial intelligence into its OnePass fan guide app for events, Amendolia said, that can help with fan questions and answers. He said the NFL is trying to train that so-called agentic AI to be more customer service focused. The tech giant is also separately working to infuse Azure AI video tools during teams' practice sessions to help with coaching, evaluations and player injury assessments. Amendolia said this video component will involve automatically analyzing metadata so users can quickly find certain players, camera angles or plays in video footage. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta just made the biggest reorganization of its artificial intelligence operations to date. Business Insider obtained the full email sent by 28-year-old Alexandr Wang, the leader of Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL, to all Meta employees who work on AI. As the AI arms race continues, Meta has been assembling an all-star team of talent, trying to poach researchers from rival AI labs with massive offers as it races to build "personal superintelligence." It's the latest in a series of AI reorgs for Meta. In less than six months, Meta has already dissolved two major AI teams. Wang's email warned that organizational changes can be "disruptive," but said it's necessary to increase how fast Meta can achieve superintelligence, which is when AI surpasses humans in virtually any intellectual field. In response to a New York Times article about the reorg, Meta communications director Andy Stone posted on X on Tuesday, criticizing the media for 'navel-gazing' about MSL's new structure: #navelgazing #nAIvelgazingMeta: We're bringing in talent to focus on building superintelligence Media: BUT HOW WILL THESE TEAMS BE STRUCTURED?! Meta is centralizing research across two units: TBD Lab, a small team focused on training large AI models, and FAIR, Meta's long-standing AI research organization, per Wang's email. MSL's research will be led by its new chief scientist, ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao — the only leader that Wang's memo doesn't mention reporting directly to him. TBD will also be in charge of exploring "new directions," such as building an "omni" model. Meta didn't respond when asked by Business Insider what "omni" would entail. An omnipotent model that could understand everything, not just text, would be in line with the multimodal focus shown by MSL's first hires, which included multiple experts in audio, video, and other mediums. Separately, Meta had contractors work on "Project Omni" to train its chatbots to be hyper-engaging by messaging users first and remembering chats, Business Insider reported last month. FAIR is known for publishing higher-level AI research and giving its employees a level of independence similar to academia. In the past, there was relatively little transfer between FAIR and Meta's generative AI division, but that seems to be changing now, a FAIR employee who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation told Business Insider. Friedman, the investor and former GitHub CEO, will lead MSL's efforts to integrate AI into Meta's products, Wang's email said, offering few further details. For years, Meta has been trying to make things like AI glasses and the Quest virtual reality headset go mainstream. When Meta internally announced the creation of MSL in June, it said that Friedman would partner with Wang to lead MSL, heading its work on AI products and applied research. In the email, Wang made it clear that Friedman reports to him. That's the second time Meta has closed a major AI unit this year. AGI Foundations was born out of the GenAI division, which spearheaded Meta's Llama AI models but was then itself dissolved after Meta's most recent AI model, Llama 4, received a lukewarm reception. Members of the AGI Foundations team will be spread across product, infrastructure, and FAIR, Wang's email states. Notably, TBD is not mentioned as a destination for ex-AGI Foundation members. Meta's constant reshuffling contrasts with AI rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, which have faced fewer organizational upheavals. Meta's reorganization plan was first reported by The Information last week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Claire's announced Wednesday it is selling most of its North American business to private equity firm Ames Watson, just weeks after the jewelry retailer declared bankruptcy. It also said it will pause the liquidation process at most of its stores as part of the deal, which Claire's said will "significantly benefit" the company. Claire's said the liquidation process will continue at some of its North American stores. "As we continue through our restructuring proceedings, our team has worked tirelessly to explore every option for preserving the value of the Claire's business and brand," CEO Chris Cramer said in a statement. "We are glad to reach this definitive agreement to sell a portion of our North America operations to Ames Watson and maximize the value of our company for all our stakeholders." Ames Watson is a private holding company with more than $2 billion in revenue, focused on purchasing and transforming companies, according to its website. Its portfolio includes Lids, Champion Teamwear and South Moon Under. "We are committed to investing in its future by preserving a significant retail footprint across North America, working closely with the Claire's team to ensure a seamless transition and creating a renewed path to growth based on our deep experience working with consumer brands," Ames Watson's co-founder Lawrence Berger said in a statement. The retailer filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month, weighed down by nearly $500 million in debt and an increasingly competitive sales environment. The company is also expected to bear the brunt of tariff impacts on suppliers from countries such as China and Vietnam. Claire's last filed for bankruptcy protection in 2018, also due to a staggering debt load. At the time, the company underwent a strategic restructuring and raised new capital, which allowed it to eliminate nearly $2 billion in debt and keep stores running.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Target has announced it will replace longtime CEO Brian Cornell with a company insider who joined as an intern more than 20 years ago. The discount department store chain said Michael Fiddelke, chief operating officer and former chief finance officer, will take over on February 1 next year. He has been with the company since first joining as an intern in 2003. He has worked across merchandising, finance, operations, and human resources, the company said. In 2022, the retailer threw out its traditional retirement age of 65 to allow him to stay on for three more years. Target had a tough first quarter with falling sales and a decrease in store traffic after it decided to roll back its DEI initiatives at the start of the year. Fiddelke said in a statement he wanted to "refocus our strategy and build on the assets and capabilities that have made Target a beloved destination for incredible products and a one-of-a-kind shopping experience." Target announced Cornell's departure as it reported its second-quarter earnings results. The company's stock was down nearly 10% in premarket trading as of 7.30 a.m. Wednesday. The Minneapolis-headquartered company maintained its expectation of a low-single-digit decline in sales for 2025. Analyst Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said the earnings showed "the hallmarks of a retailer not living up to its potential." "While we think Fiddelke is talented and has a somewhat different take on things compared to current CEO Brian Cornell, this is an internal appointment that does not necessarily remedy the problems of entrenched groupthink and the inward-looking mindset that have plagued Target for years," Saunders added. In a note, Japanese banking giant Mizuho's US arm praised Fiddelke's "impressive" background at the company.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matt Hutton was living the millennial homeowner dream. He scrimped and saved until he was able to buy his first place in 2019, paying $324,000 for a two-bedroom townhome in a suburb west of Denver. Then home values ballooned, enabling him to sell in August 2024 for a gain of roughly $150,000 in just about five years. Hutton and his wife parlayed those earnings into their own slice of the American dream: a bigger, newly built single-family house on a premium lot. But Hutton's gilded path soon morphed into a cautionary tale. The house itself was nice, with fresh appliances, ample light, and clear views of a lake just beyond the property. The couple started to notice some drawbacks, though. Simple trips demanded at least half an hour behind the wheel. By January, only a few months after they'd closed on the house, Hutton and his wife were already starting to talk about moving. Buying and selling so quickly is usually a recipe for financial loss — real estate agents pretty much always recommend staying put for at least a few years to make up for all the transaction costs. Plus, the Denver-area market softened considerably over the past two years, with more homes sitting for sale as buyers started biding their time. But there was one big issue that put Hutton in an especially bad spot. The incentive is supposed to allow buyers to stretch their budgets and soften the blow of higher mortgage rates. Some takers are betting that they'll be able to refinance for better loan terms before their mortgage snaps back to the full rate. Homeowners who got temporary buydowns in 2022 or 2023 have seen their gamble on rates fail spectacularly. The typical mortgage rate still hovers above 6.5% — roughly around the levels that many buyers back then were hoping to dodge. Hutton's predicament is an example of the pain that could be in store for others who made a similar tradeoff, agreeing to a higher sticker price in exchange for lower interest payments. Sellers had to get real about the fact that they might not get the flood of attention, let alone offers, that listings enjoyed in 2021. And builders found themselves in a tricky spot. The answer, in many cases, was a buydown. "Without something along those lines, the market would've been almost completely frozen in that price range," Lydia Creasey, Hutton's real estate agent, tells me. On their websites, builders touted borrowing rates well below the prevailing levels, keeping sales moving by enticing buyers with cheaper monthly payments. Regular sellers don't typically offer this maneuver to buyers. But for builders who could afford to eat the cost — while conveniently steering buyers to their in-house lenders — buydowns represented "a silver bullet," John Burns analysts wrote in late 2023. "It really saved their business," Palacios tells me. In a normal housing downturn, he says, builders would have started cutting prices on their homes. Let's say someone takes out a $400,000 loan at a time when the typical rate is around 6.5% (pretty close to today's prevailing rates). Homebuilders and their mortgage companies are cool with this deal because they've often locked up cheap money that they can use for the loans, and because they don't want to get stuck with a bunch of homes on their books. Plus, they really don't want to cut prices, since doing so would tank the values of all the other homes nearby. Again, let's say the prevailing rate is around 6.5%. If they took out a $400,000 loan, they'd be saving more than $500 every month that first year and more than $250 a month in the second year. In theory, this would allow a buyer to stretch their budget a little further to get the place they want, while also giving them some flexibility to refinance down the line if rates drop. And if that allows you to do it today, instead of a year from now or two years from now, well, that's a huge pro." The popularity of these deals soared alongside mortgage rates. In April 2021, just 17% of mortgage borrowers got a permanent buydown of one percentage point or more, data from ICE Mortgage Technology, a real estate software firm, shows. By the same point in 2023, that share had surged to nearly 45%. Temporary buydowns are more niche — they accounted for almost 5% of mortgage originations in late 2023, but have mostly hovered in the low single digits over the past few years. Both permanent and temporary buydowns come with potential pitfalls, but people who agreed to time-limited incentives are starting to face a particularly harsh reality. But being technically able to pay that extra money and actually shelling it out each month are two different things. There are still plenty of ways for buydown takers to end up in hot water. With temporary buydowns, some agents and analysts warn that fresh homeowners may be counting on rates dropping in the near future, allowing them to refinance to a new, cheaper loan before their payments bump up to the normal level. For buyers who got into the market two or three years ago, those dreams are fading fast. There's also the issue of lifestyle creep — if someone is used to saving a few hundred bucks on their loan each month, the jump to the full amount could be a bitter pill to swallow. Last summer, though, Palacios began warning of a more dire scenario. His concern was aimed at buyers who got a buydown — permanent or temporary — a few years ago and are now looking to sell for one reason or another, like a new job, new kid, marriage, or divorce. The typical mortgage rate has yet to slide in a meaningful way. Home prices are up less than 2% nationwide from a year ago, data from the real estate firm Redfin shows, and major metros like Houston, Austin, and Jacksonville recently posted year-over-year price declines. While buyers in 2022 or 2023 might have been willing to accept higher prices in exchange for savings on their monthly payments, they usually can't pass along those benefits to the next owner of the house. An executive at KB Home, one of the nation's largest builders, recently said in an earnings call that many customers are "overpaying" for homes that offer these incentives, suggesting they could have a harder time clearing a profit in the future. The mantra got plenty of airtime when mortgage rates spiked in 2022 — the prevailing sentiment among agents, lenders, and real estate execs was that the jump in rates would soon blow over. Don't stress too much, the logic went, because you can always refinance when rates drop back down. Better to just find a good place while you can. That mindset has so far turned out to be wishful thinking. And while there haven't yet been signs of widespread strain in the market, homeowners who got a buydown just a few years ago may be facing a significant jump in their monthly payments or the prospect of selling for far less than they'd hoped. "I'm hearing more and more stories of buyer's remorse," says Jess Uphoff, a mortgage lender who previously worked for a homebuilder. Not long ago, a temporary buydown seemed like a win-win: Builders could keep list prices higher while still passing along savings to buyers in the form of lower monthly payments. But if one of those buyers is trying to sell now, they'll likely be competing against the same builder who sold them their home — "only the builder has been steadily lowering prices or layering on new incentives." "That means homeowners often can't resell for what they originally paid." At the end of May, for example, the homebuilding giant Lennar said its average incentive per home had stretched to nearly $60,000, up from $44,000 a year prior. Rate buydowns aren't always a trap for buyers. People who got a permanent buydown a few years ago may feel pretty good about that decision, given that rates haven't yet dropped significantly. But Lauryn Dempsey, a real estate agent in the Denver area, says she counsels buyers to make sure they'll be staying in the home for at least five to seven years if they get one of these deals. "Where I'm running into challenges right now is with the people who bought a couple of years ago that want to sell," Dempsey tells me. He and his wife paid nearly $800,000 for their new house in 2024, while the builder bought down the mortgage rate by about one percentage point. That may not sound like a lot, but that meant they were paying hundreds of dollars less in interest every month. The Huttons won't be sticking around to enjoy those benefits, though. When I talked to Hutton in mid-August, he and his wife had just closed on the sale of their home, his second in roughly a year. They managed to sell the house for $800,000 — almost exactly what they paid for it, but down from their original asking price of $850,000, which factored in some of the additional upgrades they'd made to the place. Hutton says he worried that if they wavered on a sale much longer, they'd only have more new homes in the neighborhood to compete with, each of them offering a bevy of incentives. "The interest rates were killing us, because no one was buying with that," Hutton tells me. Roughly a year later, after the latest transaction, all that money is gone. "It was the right thing to do in this situation," Creasey tells me. Hutton and his wife are now living in an apartment, biding their time until they're ready to take another stab at finding their dream home. "I won't jump the gun," Hutton says.
