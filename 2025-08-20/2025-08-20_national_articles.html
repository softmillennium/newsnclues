'The Big Weekend Show' discusses an ISIS suicide bomber reportedly killing churchgoers in Damascus, Syria. The U.S. military carried out a raid in northern Syria on Tuesday, killing a senior ISIS figure who had been poised to become the group's next leader in the country, a U.S. official told Fox News. A key ISIS financial official was also killed in the operation, the official said, noting that both men had been actively planning attacks in Syria and Iraq. On the background of a U.S. official to Fox News, the raid was described as a "successful operation" targeting a senior ISIS member assessed to be a strong candidate to assume the role of ISIS Syria Emir, a position that would have posed a direct threat to U.S. and Coalition forces as well as the new Syrian government. A masked Islamic State terrorist holds an ISIS flag. A rising leader and financier of the terrorist group was killed Tuesday in Syria by the U.S. miliary, officials say. No civilians were injured or killed, and there were no injuries to U.S. or Coalition forces. The operation is part of continued U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the region following ISIS's territorial defeat in Syria and Iraq in 2019.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A board outlining the case against Ghislaine Maxwell is seen during a news conference to announce charges against Maxwell for her alleged role in the sexual exploitation and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein, July 2, 2020, in New York. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge who presided over the sex trafficking case against financier Jeffrey Epstein has joined two other judges in rejecting the government's request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the decades-long sexual abuse suffered by girls and young women who fell into his orbit. Barring reversal on appeal, Berman's decision forecloses the possibility of grand jury testimony being released now that three judges have reached the same conclusion. President Donald Trump had called for the release of transcripts amid rumors and criticism about his long-ago involvement with Epstein. During last year's presidential campaign, Trump promised to release files related to Epstein, but he was met with criticism — including from many of his own supporters — when the small number of records released by his Justice Department lacked new revelations. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on Wednesday. He wrote that the government's 100,000 pages of Epstein files and materials “dwarf the 70 odd pages of Epstein grand jury materials.” The grand jury testimony is merely a hearsay snippet of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged conduct.” The agent testified over two days, on June 18, 2019, and July 2, 2019. Both of those will also remain sealed, Berman ruled. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence after her conviction on sex trafficking charges for helping Epstein sexually abuse girls and young women. Maxwell's case has been the subject of heightened public focus since an outcry over the Justice Department's statement last month saying that it would not be releasing any additional documents from the Epstein sex trafficking investigation. The decision infuriated online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and elements of Trump's base who had hoped to see proof of a government cover-up. Since then, officials in Trump's Republican administration have tried to cast themselves as promoting transparency in the case, including by requesting from courts the unsealing of grand jury transcripts. Meanwhile, Maxwell was interviewed at a Florida courthouse weeks ago by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and the House Oversight Committee had also said that it wanted to speak with Maxwell. Her lawyers said they would be open to an interview but only if the panel were to ensure immunity from prosecution. That appeal is expected to be resolved in late September. Comer wrote that while Maxwell's testimony was “vital” to the Republican-led investigation into Epstein, the committee would not provide immunity or any questions in advance of her testimony, as was requested by her team. Associated Press writer Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report.</p>

Vice President JD Vance greeted National Guard and police at Union Station in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday as protesters could be heard shouting in the background. A throng of protesters chanted slogans as Vice President JD Vance thanked National Guard and police at Union Station in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday. Vance praised law enforcement and said that violent crime had dropped by 35% in the nine days since President Donald Trump ordered the crackdown. The vice president appeared alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, each of whom remarked on the shouting protesters. Over the past several years, Vance described Union Station as having vagrants, drug addicts, "chronically homeless" people and the mentally ill threatening violence and attacking families in the public transportation hub. "I think you hear these guys outside here screaming at us. But I'll tell you, a couple of years ago, when I brought my kids here, they were screamed at by violent vagrants. And it scared the hell out of my kids," Vance said. "I know that we've traded now, some violent, crazy people who are screaming at kids with a few crazy liberals who are screaming at the vice president. You should feel free to come and visit here." Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth visit the National Guard troops at Union Station in Washington, D.C. on Aug. 20, 2025. Vance also clashed with a reporter who asked if he had evidence of Washington's crime problem. "You just have to look around – obviously D.C. has a terrible crime problem," he said, pointing to how Department of Justice and FBI statistics "back it up." "It is kind of bizarre we have a bunch of old, primarily White people who are out there protesting the policies that keep people safe when they have never felt danger in their entire lives," the vice president added. Miller was even more blunt, describing many of the protesters as "elderly" and "over 90 years old." "We're not going to let communists destroy a great American city, let alone the nation's capital," Miller said, deriding the protesters as "stupid White hippies." Vice President JD Vance eats a Shake Shack hamburger with members of the National Guard at Union Station in Washington, D.C. on Aug. 20, 2025. "And the voices that you hear out there, these crazy communists, they have no connection to the city. They weren't raised in this city. They have no jobs in this city. They have no connections to this community at all. The Trump administration's crackdown on violent crime in D.C. has already netted hundreds of arrests. The show of force has swept up gang members, robbery suspects and immigration violators. National Guard troops stand at Union Station amid protesters, days after President Trump ordered a crackdown on crime in the city. Federal teams have also cleared dozens of homeless encampments, and officials said those removals were carried out without confrontations or arrests. Safe and Beautiful" task force created by Trump in March through an executive order. He escalated it on Aug. 11 by temporarily seizing federal control of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) under emergency powers in the Home Rule Act, the first such move in U.S. history.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bringing prominent White House support to the streets of Washington, Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday visited with National Guard troops at the city's main train station as protesters chanted “free D.C.” — the latest tense interlude from President Donald Trump's crackdown in the nation's capital. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — Bringing prominent White House support to the streets of Washington, Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday visited with National Guard troops at the city's main train station as protesters chanted “free D.C.” — the latest tense interlude from President Donald Trump's crackdown in the nation's capital. “We brought some law and order back,” the vice president asserted. “We appreciate everything you're doing,” Vance said as he presented burgers to the troops. Besides Union Station, they've mostly been spotted around downtown areas, including the National Mall and metro stops. The intersection of life in the city and a military presence produced another striking scene early Wednesday when an armored vehicle collided with a civilian car less than a mile from the U.S. Capitol. One person was trapped inside the car after the accident and had to be extricated by emergency responders, according to D.C. fire department spokesman Vito Maggiolo. The person was transported to a hospital with minor injuries. It was not immediately clear what caused the crash. Attorney General Pam Bondi said more than 550 people have been arrested so far, and the U.S. Marshals are offering $500 rewards for information leading to additional arrests. “Together, we will make DC safe again!” Bondi wrote on social media.

Bowser said she would worry about the politics and told school employees that “your job is to love on the kids, teach them and make sure that they are prepared and to trust that I'm going to do the right thing for all of us.” Despite the militarized backdrop, Bowser said it's important that children “have joy when they approach this school year.” Public schools around Washington reconvene Monday for the fall semester. The skewer-everyone cartoon TV show “ South Park,” which has leaned into near-real-time satire in recent years, this week made the federal crackdown fodder for a new episode. A 20-second promo released by Comedy Central depicts the character “Towelie” — a walking towel — riding in a bus past the U.S. Supreme Court building and White House, where armed troops are patrolling. A tank rolls by in front of the White House. “South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone recently signed a reported $1.5 billion, five-year deal with Paramount for new episodes and streaming rights to their series, which began its 27th season this summer. The season premiere mocked the president's body in a raunchy manner and depicted him sharing a bed with Satan.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem discusses President Donald Trump's immigration policy on ‘America Reports.' Harjinder Singh's deadly wreck on Florida's Turnpike exposes not just the illegal immigration crisis but systemic negligence — or worse — in transportation-related areas, Florida Rep. Brian Mast told Fox News Digital in a Wednesday interview. Mast lives only 10 minutes from where Singh allegedly made anunlawful U-turn on Florida's Turnpike and killed three people whose vehicle became wedged under his rig – after he illegally used a median crossover meant for emergency vehicles. Mast said Singh's case undercuts Democrats' claims that the Trump administration targeted only "violent criminals" rather than immigrants working regular jobs and paying taxes. Harjinder Singh, 28, was arrested after allegedly making an unauthorized U-turn in Florida last week that resulted in a crash that left three people dead, officials said. "This is just one example of saying this is why it matters if you're here illegally you're going back to your country of origin — whether you're driving a truck or anything else," Mast said. As a member of the House Transportation Committee, Mast said he has heard complaints from municipal officials who run the local DMVs who tell him the problem of illegal immigrants getting CDLs in large numbers is "systemic." Illegal immigrants who, at times, may be English-illiterate, have been coached to recite specific sentences and identify specific letters on ophthalmologic to essentially get by in their new jobs. Somehow, the school passes them," he said. Singh, who illegally immigrated in 2018 from India, obtained a CDL in California and was initially rejected by the first Trump administration for a work authorization. Singh's alleged actions also show the difference between state policies of Florida and California, he said. "He kills three people – and what is his first decision? "And as a result, he ‘deported' himself to California," Mast said. Another weakness in the transportation and immigration infrastructure was also exposed by Singh's deadly crash, Mast said. He ruminated on how many state weigh stations Singh had to drive through on his way from California to Florida. In that regard, he asked how much focus is put on the individual driver versus the typical criteria of load tonnage and vehicular roadworthiness. With an adjustment to also focus on the competency of the drivers, weigh stations could play a bigger role in keeping dangerous people like illiterate illegal immigrants off highways, he said. "It's the perfect example as to why we need to be dealing with all illegals, whether they're in the trades or whether they are historic violent offenders. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images) Florida transportation officials were equally outraged at the situation. "The actions taken by the defendant while operating a commercial tractor-trailer are both shocking and criminal," Florida Department of Highway Safety & Motor Vehicles Executive Director Dave Kerner said in a statement. "Three people lost their lives as a result of [Singh's] recklessness, and countless friends and family members will experience the pain of their loss forever. Harjinder Singh is in custody on state vehicular homicide charges and immigration violations. Kerner said FHP remains committed to enforcing both state and federal laws against those posing a danger to the public. Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday called on Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to resign after a member of his administration accused Cook of committing mortgage fraud, the latest example of the Trump administration's efforts to gain control over the central bank. Bill Pulte, director of the agency that oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, urged the Justice Department to investigate Cook, who was appointed to the Fed's governing board by former president Joe Biden in 2022. Pulte, in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, alleged that Cook claimed two homes as her principal residences in 2021 to fraudulently obtain better mortgage lending terms. On June 18 of that year she purchased a home in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and then two weeks later bought a condo in Atlanta, Georgia, the letter said. Before joining the Fed, Cook taught at Michigan State University. Federal Reserve Board of Governors member Lisa Cook, right, talks with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell before an open meeting of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve, June 25, 2025, in Washington. Pulte also charged that Cook has listed her condo in Atlanta, Georgia, for rent. Mortgages for homes used as principal residences typically carry lower interest rates than properties that are purchased to rent, the letter said. A Justice Department spokesperson also declined to comment. If Cook were to step down, then the White House could nominate a replacement. He backed off his threats to fire Powell after receiving a tour of the project. Pulte also suggested that Cook's alleged actions could constitute a fireable offense. Fed officials are protected by law from being removed by a president, except “for cause,” which is generally seen as some kind of malfeasance or dereliction of duty. Yet 12 members of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee have a vote on whether to raise or lower interest rates, so even replacing the Chair doesn't guarantee that Fed policy will shift the way Trump wants. All seven members of the Fed's governing board are able to vote on rate decisions. Trump appointed two members of the Fed's board in his first term, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. Another Fed governor, Adriana Kugler, stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1, and Trump has nominated one of his economic advisers, Stephen Miran, to fill out the remainder of her term until January. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, and Board of Governors member Lisa Cook, right, listen during an open meeting of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve, June 25, 2025, in Washington. If Trump is able to replace Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's board, as well as Kugler, that would give him a clear majority on the board of governors. If Powell leaves the board when his term as chair ends next May, then Trump will be able to fill a fifth spot. However, Powell could stay on the board until early 2028 after finishing his term as chair. Trump has for months demanded that the Federal Reserve reduce the short-term interest rate it controls, which currently stands at about 4.3%. He has also repeatedly insulted Powell, who has said that the Fed would like to see more evidence of how the economy evolves in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs before making any moves. Powell has also said the duties threaten to raise inflation and slow growth. Trump says that a lower rate would reduce the government's borrowing costs on $37 trillion in debt and boost the housing market by reducing mortgage rates. The Trump administration has made similar claims of mortgage fraud against Democrats that Trump has attacked, including California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration is turning its attention to immigrants who falsely claim to be citizens so that they can seize on key American benefits such as voting, Social Security checks, and even passports. The update comes a day after USCIS changed other guidance in its policy manual to bar immigration benefits, such as work documents and citizenship, to those pushing anti-American sentiments. The agency is also requiring those it vets to have high “moral character.” The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that millions of illegal immigrants have engaged in identity theft and document fraud to claim citizenship benefits. Aliens who use false information or deceitful practices to unfairly obtain immigration advantages will face serious consequences,” he added. The policy manual is used by immigration adjudicators in determining a migrant's status. The administration's goal in making the update is to provide clear guidance that if a migrant has lied about his citizenship status in the past or engaged in identity fraud then they can be barred from receiving citizenship benefits. What's more, said an official, they could face punishments ranging from fines to deportation and even a lifetime ban from entering the United States. A big part of today's action is cracking down on voter fraud. During the Biden administration, millions of migrants entered the country legally and illegally and some critics have claimed that many have tried to vote. Age and mental capacity will now be included in the decision factors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Multiple members of California Common Cause's advisory board have resigned as the nonpartisan group, historically critical of partisan gerrymandering, tackles its conflicting response to the national redistricting battle. Last week, the national chapter of the group reversed its long-held position and backed California's push to redraw its congressional districts. While the total number of departures on California's advisory board is not known, Common Cause President and CEO Virginia Kase Solomón told Politico's Playbook that members resigned “after expressing disagreement with the fairness criteria” the organization's national board created as guardrails around the kinds of mid-decade redistricting California is pursuing. Two weeks ago, the organization had pop-up fundraising appeals on its website that slammed Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) for “attempting to copy the GOP's playbook to boost his profile.” A July 24 newsletter from the group also called the actions of Texas Republicans and Newsom “wrong” and said “all of it is anti-democratic.” “In the current mid-decade redistricting battle, we recognize that President Trump and Republican leaders are pursuing a calculated, asymmetric strategy to redraw districts mid-decade in states like Texas, to lock in unaccountable power and silence voters,” the group posted on its website last Tuesday. “This is not an isolated political tactic; it is part of a broader march toward authoritarianism, dismantling people-powered democracy, and stripping away the people's ability to have a political voice and say in how they are governed.” The group said while it would not endorse partisan gerrymandering “even when its motive is to offset more extreme gerrymandering by a different party,” it added that a “blanket condemnation in this moment would amount to a call for unilateral political disarmament in the face of authoritarian efforts to undermine fair representation and people-powered democracy.” They include proportionality, public participation, racial equity, federal reform, endorsement of independent redistricting, and time limits, meaning any new maps must expire after the 2030 census and be replaced through a regular decennial redistricting process. Common Cause California did not return a request by the Washington Examiner for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>International recognition of a Palestinian state isn't just symbolic. Listen to more stories on the  Noa app. France, Britain, Canada, Australia, and Malta all say they are preparing to recognize a state of Palestine at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in September. They would join another 147 UN countries that already do so. No Israeli-Palestinian “peace process” is currently under way, the countries pledging recognition noted in their statements. The struggle for Palestinian statehood has been long and arduous. The PLO and PA, to be sure, have sometimes gotten in their own way. And the PLO has squandered several potential opportunities to pursue statehood, especially an overture in 2008 by then–Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. But both groups have maintained a commitment to negotiation over violence, and have honored the 1993 recognition of Israel by Yasser Arafat, the PLO's former leader. From the December 2024 issue: My hope for Palestine International recognition will do as much to rebuke Hamas's maximalist demands as it will those of the Israeli right, dealing a blow to expansionist aspirations in the West Bank, the only territory that has any realistic chance of becoming a Palestinian state. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has long been characterized by a basic asymmetry: The international recognition of Jewish national rights in Palestine has never been matched by a demand for Palestinian national rights. Palestinians may have had an opportunity in 1947 to create their state through a UN partition resolution. Two decades later—after multiple wars—Israel declared itself a state that would come to control the entire territory, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, all of which have populations that are majority Palestinian Arab. In 1968, Palestinians resurrected an independence movement that wrested decision making away from Egypt and other Arab countries that had been humiliated in the Six-Day War. ​​The First Intifada, or uprising, against Israeli rule in the occupied territories, which began in 1987, gave the PLO an opportunity to greatly expand its presence there, but it also seeded a new group of rivals, the Muslim fundamentalists of Hamas. In 1993, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat wrote to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin affirming that, on behalf of the Palestinian people, the PLO recognized Israel and its right to exist free from attacks and threats. Rabin responded with a letter to Arafat recognizing the PLO as a legitimate interlocutor and undertaking to negotiate with it. But he didn't recognize a state of Palestine, and the 1993 Oslo Accords with Israel did not specify the goal of Palestinian statehood or acknowledge the Palestinians' right to a state. In the summer of 2000, U.S. President Bill Clinton convened a summit at Camp David. Accounts vary on what Israel, then led by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, offered. But the Palestinians who attended came away convinced that they were being asked to accept an archipelago of quasi-independent Bantustans within a greater Israel. Because of an internal leadership crisis, among other failings, the Palestinians presented no detailed counteroffer. In late December, Clinton unveiled what is still the most reasonable framework yet proposed for an agreement that would end the conflict. But Israel suspended the negotiations pending elections early in 2001. In subsequent years, some hopeful signs for Palestinian statehood persisted. In 2002, President George W. Bush endorsed establishing a Palestinian state, and his administration voted for UN Security Council Resolution 1397, which, for the first time, explicitly called for two states “side by side within secure and recognized borders.” Palestinian divisions intensified, however, after the 2005–06 elections resulted in the acrimonious pairing of a Fatah/PLO leader, Mahmoud Abbas, with a Hamas-dominated Parliament. In 2007, Hamas violently seized control of Gaza, precipitating a split with the West Bank that continues to this day. The Palestinians had one more potential chance at statehood through negotiations. Moreover, the Palestinian negotiators could not get anything in writing. The deal also included Palestinian concessions on issues such as refugees, and Abbas ran the political risk of being seen to accept concessions while ultimately being left with nothing if Israel didn't follow through. Since that time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dominated the Israeli political scene and dedicated himself to preventing any movement toward Palestinian statehood. He exploited the rift between Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, seeking to keep both in power and at each other's throats, and thereby unable to advance their respective visions of independence. But it also hardened the position of the Israeli right that to live next to any Palestinian state would be an intolerable security risk. Just last month, he ruled out the prospect of Palestinian statehood, saying that it would only serve as a platform for the elimination of Israel. The Israelis claim that recognition would reward Hamas and terrorism. Pretty much the only thing Hamas and Fatah agree on is that they are all Palestinians. Other than that, the disagreements are almost total: The PLO is a secular national movement that still seeks a negotiated peace with Israel through diplomacy, and to establish a small Palestinian state in the occupied territories. Hamas is an Islamist party and militia that wants a theocratic Muslim government in not just the occupied territories but also what is now Israel. Already, the PLO has benefited from an apparently minor change in its status at the UN in 2012, from “observer” to “non-member observer state.” This gave it standing at the International Criminal Court and suggests what international recognition—something Israel cannot take away—can accomplish: the potential protection of key multilateral instruments and institutions, and thus the potential frustration of Israeli ambitions for further annexation. While the world's eyes have been fixed on the horrors of war in Gaza, far-right Israeli officials, led by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, have effectively taken charge of West Bank, where they are stoking conflict by encouraging right-wing settlers to confront Palestinian villagers. International recognition of Palestinian statehood could seriously complicate Israel's designs on the West Bank. Britain has said that it will recognize Palestine if the Gaza war continues into September, but France and Canada appear focused on discouraging Israeli annexation in the West Bank. Each is sending a clear message to Israel: End the war in Gaza, and more important, do not expand formalized control of the West Bank, the only territory that could become a true state for Palestinians. Pushing back against Israeli annexation efforts is crucial to reviving the possibility of a two-state solution. Canada, Australia, Britain, France, and Malta are not asking or expecting Israel to withdraw from the West Bank tomorrow. Smotrich has his eyes firmly on annexation, having recently announced new settlements surrounding Jerusalem that he says will “bury” any potential for a Palestinian state. The world must act as if a two-state solution is not merely necessary, but possible. Shrugging, walking away, and accepting this outcome cannot be an option.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has called upon Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to resign after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte asked the Justice Department to consider prosecuting her for mortgage fraud. Pulte, who in his role at FHFA oversees the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, sent the criminal referral to Attorney General Pam Bondi last Friday. Pulte posted a copy of the letter to X on Wednesday morning. In response, Trump called on Cook to step aside. Pulte has increasingly emerged as the biggest attack dog in Trump's orbit and has harshly criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and others while serving as the government's top housing regulator. In the letter to Bondi, Pulte said it appears Cook “falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud under the criminal statute.” “This has included falsifying residence statuses for an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based residence and an Atlanta, Georgia-based property in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms,” Pulte wrote. Cook was nominated to the board by former President Joe Biden and worked in the Obama administration, in addition to being an academic economist. “Donald Trump is making up blatant lies in an effort to oust the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board, so he can replace her with another unqualified loyalist who will do his bidding,” committee Democrats said in a statement. Two members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted to lower interest rates at the last meeting: Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. Another Fed governor who voted to hold interest rates steady, Adriana Kugler, recently and unexpectedly resigned, handing Trump an opening on the board. If Cook stepped aside, Trump would have another opportunity to nominate a replacement. “For the benefit of our great Country, I'm hopeful we can get a two for one special and Jay Powell can join her in packing it up.” Pulte has made a name for himself in the administration by using his massive social media following to attack Powell and others. The FHFA director has also targeted some other high-profile Trump critics, most notably Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Last week, two young liberals asked for help finding a job in the ideas industry. And I didn't have a great answer. It made sense that they were asking: We were at a conference for liberals, dedicated to building a version of the doctrine that works in the 21st century. They were interested in studying ideas professionally, and I was there to moderate a panel about political philosophy. Yet I found myself struggling to give good advice. Sure, they could try for an internship at a liberal publication or think tank, but those are fiercely competitive and don't pay much. They could apply for a PhD program, but teaching jobs were scarce even before President Donald Trump took a hammer to American academia. What's really missing are programs of a specific kind — ones that help college students and recent grads engage with Big Ideas and connect with Important People. If my young acquaintances were right-wing, I might have told them to apply for National Review's Buckley and Rhodes journalism fellowships — multiyear paid opportunities to write for a national audience straight out of college. For a lesser commitment, they could have tried for the Claremont Institute's Publius Fellowship — a three-week program where you receive $1,500, a $700 travel stipend, free housing, paid meals, and an opportunity to study with some of the most influential (and radical) figures of the Trump era. Those are two examples of numerous well-funded programs explicitly designed to usher as many bright young people into the institutional conservative world as possible. If you're an ambitious young college grad, and anywhere on the spectrum from libertarian to hardcore Trumpist, you've got tons of options to get into the ideas game. Where there should be a talent pipeline from universities to liberal public intellectualism, there is a giant sucking sound instead. It is true, as conservatives have long alleged, that America's intellectual institutions are pretty left-leaning places. They often overstate the case — professors are more likely to be Elizabeth Warren Dems than “globalize the intifada” socialist revolutionaries — but data confirms that liberals outnumber conservatives in academia and the media by pretty significant margins. This is, of course, not at all new. Buckley founded National Review as an antidote to what he saw as the liberal tilt of the mainstream American press. A young person nowadays could attend college at right-wing Hillsdale, build their law school life around membership in the Federalist Society, and then get a job writing right-wing papers for the Heritage Foundation — all while getting their news from Fox News and Mark Levin's radio show. As part of these pipeline programs, older right-wingers get to know young up-and-comers as people, and thus develop a personal stake in their success. These work, in large part, by being intellectually exciting. It's not just that you get to go on all-expenses-paid trips with nice meals; it's that you are put in an environment where you're reading and debating classic works of political thought and literature with other people who share those interests. If you're the kind of nerd who wants to debate the finer points of Locke and Hamilton during undergrad summers, you're the kind of nerd who might one day be someone who matters in US politics — and the right's fellowships are there to help make sure you're mattering on their side. In a 2021 episode of the Know Your Enemy podcast, Nate Hochman — a radical young conservative writer who later staffed both Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Eric Schmitt — talks at length about “the masterful things the conservative movement institutionally has done in terms of mentorship.” Hochman, who was raised in a liberal household and moved to the right in college, describes how the movement's fellowship programs brought him in direct and meaningful contact with conservatism's leading lights. “All of a sudden, you're at dinner with people you've looked up to for years, staying up until 1 am drinking wine with them and asking them questions and getting to talk to them. As part of these pipeline programs, older right-wingers get to know young up-and-comers as people, and thus develop a personal stake in their success. When they come looking for help getting a job writing about conservative ideas, you'll work that much harder to place them in one. And the right has built its institutions to ensure that such positions are available. Right-wing publications and think tanks are much more open to debating big-picture questions — say, what kind of a nation is America? — than their left-wing peers (more on that in a second). Claremont, for example, was founded by students of conservative political philosopher Harry Jaffa, and it shows in the kind of work they put out (even when it strikes me as substantively ridiculous). There wasn't much of a need for liberal donors to create programs to cultivate liberal thought, as people interested could simply go get a PhD or an entry-level reporting job. However, these institutions were not avowedly liberal in character. They styled themselves as politically neutral, focused more on quality research and reporting, than as contributing to a particular ideological cause. This means that while liberals in such fields were in left-leaning environments, many were trained to see themselves primarily as professionals working a craft. So while there are plenty of internships available to young liberals, they're mostly focused on professional training (or coffee-fetching) rather than staying up late swapping ideas with big names. More broadly, the liberal professional approach also produced a kind of intellectual siloing. If you're interested in policy, odds are that you ended up studying a set of applied skills (like law or economics) that prepared you for very specific policy discussions in your area of expertise. It trains young people in the big-picture ideas, like conservative visions of political morality and religion, and teaches them to connect those things to everyday policy discussions. You aren't learning about abstract ideas or concrete policy, but rather learning a comprehensive worldview that treats policy issues as downstream of specific values. Liberalism has plenty of brilliant theorists who work at a largely abstract level, and policy wonks who work on the most applied issues. The right's longtime insistence that tax cuts can reduce deficits, or addiction to proposing military solutions to foreign policy problems, are two examples of curdled ideology. But we're at a moment where liberalism is in a particular kind of crisis: under threat from new ideologies that challenge not specific liberal policy ideas, but the basic premises of a liberal political system. Liberals need a new and compelling vision: one that explains why our ideas are not merely a defense of an unpopular status quo, but a broader politics that can be used to address cardinal problems of the 21st century. Bronze Age Pervert is an influential voice on the extreme right. Now he's trying to change the administration's economic approach. Lawrence Dennis predicted America would fall to fascism in the 1930s. His errors have much to teach us today.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Air conditioners have been working overtime this hot summer, from those tiny window units to the massive AC towers that serve the tightly packed apartment buildings in major cities. And while they bring the relief of cool air, these contraptions also create the conditions for dangerous bacteria to multiply and spread. One particularly nasty bacteria-borne illness is currently spreading in New York City using those enormous cooling units as its vector: Legionnaire's disease. The bacterial pneumonia, which usually recurs each summer in the US's largest city, has sickened more than 100 people and killed five in a growing outbreak. If you don't live in New York City or the Northeast, you may never have heard of Legionnaire's, but this niche public health threat may not be niche for much longer. Recently, Legionella bacteria was discovered in a nursing home's water system in Dearborn, Michigan — one of the states, along with Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Wisconsin, that have seen more activity in the past few years. Anyone can contract Legionnaire's disease by inhaling tiny drops containing the bacteria, and the symptoms — fever, headache, shortness of breath — appear within days. Around 5,000 people die every year in the United States from Legionnaire's disease, many of them living in low-income housing with outdated cooling equipment where the bacteria can more readily grow and spread. Legionnaire's disease is a microcosm of climate change's impact on low-income communities. Soon, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists confirmed the cause of the mysterious illness: a previously unknown bacteria that was accordingly named Legionella. Legionella, unfortunately, is everywhere — in streams, lakes, and water pipes across the country. But usually, it occurs in such low concentrations and is so remote that it doesn't pose a threat to humans. Now, city health officials have found the bacteria in the large cooling tanks that serve massive apartment buildings across New York City, particularly in Harlem. Cooling tanks are ideal for Legionnaire's to grow and spread. They're filled with stagnant, warm water that is more hospitable to bacterial growth. Like an evaporative cooler, the systems convert warm stagnant water into cool air for apartment dwellers. For starters, the quality of natural water is degrading — creating more favorable conditions for Legionella, which loves acidic water and low oxygen levels, to multiply — as the planet warms. A decade ago, researchers warned that “climate change might increase the incidence of legionellosis through increased reliance on air conditioning systems,” especially the large units serving city housing buildings. The European Climate and Health Observatory advised in 2022 that higher temperatures and the increased rainfall associated with climate change could soon make Legionnaire's disease a more widespread issue. And those who live in a low-income area are more likely to be at risk from this increased prevalence of Legionnaire's disease. As the New York Times reported recently, poorly maintained cooling systems are more likely to see Legionella flourish and pump the bacteria into their neighborhoods — and low-income housing is more likely to be poorly maintained. Though NYC attempted to require more inspections for defective cooling systems after a 2015 outbreak of Legionnaire's, inspections have fallen off in recent years, according to reporting from The Gothamist. Legionnaire's is a particularly disconcerting health threat: It rains down from the sky in tiny invisible droplets, packed with bacteria so potent it can kill one in 10 people whom it manages to infect through its telltale aggressive pneumonia. I asked some experts what people can do about Legionnaire's disease. The most important advice was to be vigilant about any public health warnings if you reside in an area where Legionella has historically lived or has recently been detected, especially if you have certain preexisting conditions like diabetes, chronic lung disease, or autoimmune disorders, or if you're over the age of 50. Follow the news and make sure you're registered for alerts from your local public health officials. People could consider investing in a high-quality water filter during an outbreak, the CDC says. But the issue here is ultimately not your small humidifier. You can't suddenly stop drinking water or breathing air, of course, even if there is a local outbreak. The CDC itself notes that point-of-use water filters only provide limited protection. So, whenever you know Legionnaire's disease is spreading nearby, you should be paying attention to your body, said Janet Stout, president and director of the Special Pathogens Laboratory, who has studied the disease for 30 years. See your doctor immediately if you're experiencing fever, shortness of breath, or a cough. You could have a special test done for Legionnaire's disease and potentially receive antibiotics, such as Levofloxacin or Azithromycin, that have proven effective against the bacteria. Most cases can be cured if they are caught early enough. But this is a truly public health challenge; when bacteria are multiplying in community water systems and then spewing into the open air, anyone can be exposed. There is only so much that any one person's own, individual effort can do to stop infections. The main way to prevent Legionnaire's disease, however, or at least significantly reduce its risk is by staying on top of maintenance to make sure community water sources are kept clean, preventing the bacteria from proliferating. But that kind of maintenance requires vigilance and perhaps even public pressure. In New York City, for example, only 1,200 cooling towers were inspected in the first six months of 2025, a steep drop-off from 2017 when the city had checked more than 5,000 over the same period. Landlords and public health authorities must take Legionnaire's disease seriously. It probably has nothing to do with saving animals. Herds in North America will likely be hit the hardest. Rising temperatures are rewriting the earliest stages of life. America's wildfire strategy is falling apart when it's needed most.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EDITOR'S NOTE:  This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. For decades, Orlando has reigned as the global capital of theme parks — a place where Disney, Universal, SeaWorld and countless other attractions have drawn millions of visitors. In a destination once known more for oil wealth and camel racing than roller coasters, Abu Dhabi is building an adrenaline-charged playground that could give Orlando a run for its money. There was “no question,” says Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney Experiences. The UAE capital, already home to Ferrari World, with the world's fastest roller coaster; Warner Bros. World (built under license by CNN's parent company, Warner Brothers Discovery); Yas Waterworld, an epic network of slides and pools; and more recently, SeaWorld Yas Island Abu Dhabi. It will be the first Disney resort set on an accessible shoreline, located just 20 minutes from downtown Abu Dhabi. What began as a shared passion between two friends has grown into the "Abu Dhabi House Movement" — a fast-growing community redefining the city's music scene. Co-founder Tom Worton takes us inside this grassroots world, where music lovers, DJs, and cultural spaces collide. House beats and hidden venues: A new sound is emerging in Abu Dhabi Miral's CEO, Mohamed Abdalla Al Zaabi, says demand already exists: 2024 saw a 20% rise in theme park attendance on Yas Island. And expansion is already in the works — a Harry Potter–themed land at Warner Bros. World, more record-breaking rides at Ferrari World, new themed hotels, and even two beaches along Yas Bay Waterfront. Abu Dhabi's location, a medium-haul flight away from both Europe and Asia, and relatively short hop away from India, means millions of potential visitors are within relatively easy reach. “This isn't about building another theme park,” Saleh Mohamed Al Geziry, Abu Dhabi's director general of tourism, told CNN. “It's about defining Abu Dhabi as a global destination where culture, entertainment and luxury intersect.” Abu Dhabi's rise comes as Orlando and US tourism more broadly face headwinds. International travel to the US has slowed recently, with lengthy visa processes, unpredictable immigration checks, and heightened security scrutiny all blamed for deterring visitors. Abu Dhabi currently offers a smoother alternative to the US. Many nationalities can enter the UAE visa-free or with an e-visa, and the capital's airport — currently being expanded — has a reputation for fast border processing and easy connections. Despite wider regional tensions, Abu Dhabi continues to position itself as a safe, reliable tourism hub. “In times of uncertainty, people look for destinations they can trust,” Al Geziry added. Once on Yas Island, visitors experience indoor, climate-controlled attractions, shorter lines, and a level of sophistication not typically associated with theme parks. “For families used to theme parks in the US or Europe, Abu Dhabi is a revelation,” says Steven Hopkinson, a British expatriate living in Abu Dhabi. “You don't spend hours waiting in the heat, and everything feels more refined, more accessible, which is such a luxury when you're with small children.” Orlando may have Florida sunshine, but in summer it also has humidity and crowds. Temperatures still soar in Abu Dhabi, but its climate-controlled indoor parks keep the experience consistent no matter what's happening outside. A 15-minute drive from Yas Island, Saadiyat Island is home to the Louvre Abu Dhabi, a franchised outpost of the famous Paris art museum, which welcomed 1.4 million visitors last year, 84% from abroad. The Guggenheim Abu Dhabi and Zayed National Museum are both under construction, adding to a cultural district that will be one of the region's most concentrated hubs of art and heritage. “Abu Dhabi's unique appeal lies in the diversity of our tourism offering,” Al Geziry added. “For thrill-seekers, we have record-breaking roller coasters and dune bashing in the desert. “Where else can you start your day under the Louvre's iconic rain-of-light dome and end it in the immersive, story-driven worlds of Warner Bros. World or Ferrari World?” “Several of them struggled for profitability in their first decade.” The infrastructure, safety, and existing leisure developments create an ideal entry point,” he told CNN earlier this year. Under its Tourism Strategy 2030, Abu Dhabi aims to grow annual visitors from 24 million in 2023 to more than 39 million by the end of the decade. With Disneyland as a centerpiece, those targets may well be surpassed. Its combination of frictionless travel, year-round comfort, cutting-edge attractions, and a cultural scene that adds depth to the experience gives Abu Dhabi its own unique selling point, potentially offering a model for the next generation of theme park capital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The novel published 70 years ago that still explains America. When Lolita first appeared 70 years ago, in 1955, it was so controversial that no American publisher was willing to touch it. Yet Lolita also comes with a sense that it is still, perhaps, too controversial to touch. In a development that seems almost too on the nose, it was recently reported that Jeffrey Epstein kept a prized first edition of the novel in his home, under glass. Then: “Am I still allowed to love that book?” In pop culture, Lolita became synonymous with a teenaged seductress who deserves whatever she gets. Vladimir Nabokov's novel is so multifaceted that it reflects the priorities of its readers back at us, showing us what we value and fear most at any given moment in time. We're still arguing over Lolita today, and our debates mirror the contours of our current culture war: a horror at an abuser's attempt to cover up their abuse; a terror that all that is pleasurable will be moralized into oblivion. What kind of book could plausibly be experienced both as an erotic comic romp in the 1950s and a searing dismantling of rape culture on its 70th birthday? Initially, Nabokov planned to publish the novel anonymously, with the only clue to his authorship the presence of a minor nonspeaking character whose name, Vivian Darkbloom, anagrammed to Vladimir Nabokov. Four American publishers, likely fearing expensive obscenity lawsuits, turned down Lolita. In 1958, when it finally came out in the US, it shot to the top of the bestseller lists and transformed Nabokov from an obscure Russian-born writer of tricky novels into a wealthy household name. Lolita is narrated by one Humbert Humbert, a smooth-talking charmer who confesses to us early on that he is sexually obsessed with little girls between the ages of 8 and 14: “nymphets,” he calls them. His landlady's 12-year-old daughter Dolores Haze — nicknamed Lolita by Humbert — is just one such nymphet, and Humbert is so obsessed with her that he decides to marry her mother in order to have more access to Dolores. After Mrs. Haze dies, Humbert seizes the moment to kidnap Dolores, taking her off on a demented road trip back and forth across America, going from one motel to the next, debauching her all the way. Critics were puzzled by why Nabokov lavished some of his richest, most pleasurable prose on such an appalling story. Humbert is such a strange, unstable figure that the term “unreliable narrator” was coined in part to describe him. He plays constantly for our sympathy: at one moment calling himself a monster, the next swearing he loves Lolita with a deep and undying passion, the next informing us with an air of triumph that it was she who seduced him. Early critics by and large agreed that Lolita was a masterpiece (with some notable exceptions). But they were puzzled by why Nabokov lavished some of his richest, most pleasurable prose on such an appalling story. One of the most influential early readers who laid the blueprint for how Lolita would be received was legendary literary critic Lionel Trilling. He was part of a generation of young, au courant critics who carefully prized such pleasure, who took it as a point of pride that they were not dreary old Victorian killjoys who feared every book might corrupt the morals of the young. It didn't mean that you condoned child sex abuse. Trilling eventually concluded that Lolita was, in a generic sense, a story about love: following in the literary tradition of courtly love, it was about a forbidden romance so scandalous that it could never end in marriage, like the love between Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, married to another man, and Vronsky. Readers were no longer shocked when novelists broke the taboo of adultery, Trilling reasoned, and so Nabokov had to be extreme with Lolita. Trilling's argument lived on, in an ever-more-flattened form, for the next 50 years or so. As Lolita entered into popular culture, it was largely understood through the lens of forbidden romance and adolescent lust. “Lolita” and “nymphet” both entered the dictionaries to mean a sexually precocious girl. In 1997, Adrien Lyne's adaptation played out the story in front of a vaseline-smeared lens, misty and nostalgic and lovely. Lana Del Rey would play repeatedly with Lolita imagery in her early career, singing about how romantic it was when she played Lolita to her older boyfriend's Humbert Humbert. In 1995, literary scholar Elizabeth Patnoe describes finding her classmates angrily, belligerently resistant to the idea that it might be possible to despise Humbert Humbert as an unrepentant child sex offender. The men in the classroom, she says, found Humbert relatable and worthy of compassion, and were shocked when she said she hated him because of what he did to Dolores. One accused her of having “cheated the text.” It was to deny oneself the pleasure of Nabokov's language for no particular reason. Twenty years later, however, Patnoe's interpretation has picked up steam. It has become, for many readers, the dominant way to read Lolita: by understanding it as a book about the rape of a child, and Humbert as the monster who is trying to fool you. In this reading, the pleasure is a trap. There's plenty of evidence within Lolita to suggest that we are meant to be looking beneath Humbert's playful sentences for the pain of Dolores Haze. Dolores does seem to have a crush on Humbert when she first meets him, but it vanishes as soon as she is faced with the reality of what exactly he means to do to her. Under a reading that focuses on Dolores and her pain, even the novel's title and Humbert's repeated invocations of “my Lolita” are an attempt from Humbert to control Dolores as brutally and totally as possible: He has taken even her name from her, and he has made us, his readers, complicit in it. There is also some evidence that Nabokov endorsed this reading of his book. Speaking to the Paris Review for a 1967 issue, Nabokov appeared appalled when his interviewer suggested that Humbert Humbert had a “touching” quality. “I would put it differently: Humbert Humbert is a vain and cruel wretch who manages to appear ‘touching,'” Nabokov replied. “That epithet, in its true, tear-iridized sense, can only apply to my poor little girl” — that is to say, Dolores, whose name means sorrow. In the same interview, however, Nabokov vigorously disavowed any moral or didactic reading of his novels. It's hard to know for sure what he made of Humbert's fans as they multiplied across the decades. It wasn't until the mid-2010s that a Dolores-centric reading of Lolita finally began to gain more traction. “The publication, reception, and cultural re-fashioning of Lolita over the past 60 years is the story of how a twelve-year-old rape victim named Dolores became a dominant archetype for seductive female sexuality in contemporary America,” wrote Wells: “It is the story of how a girl became a noun.” Probably the most high-profile of these essays came from the feminist critic Rebecca Solnit, in her 2015 LitHub essay “Men Explain Lolita to Me.” “A nice liberal man came along and explained to me this book was actually an allegory as though I hadn't thought of that yet,” Solnit wrote. The new Lolita takes were becoming mainstream just around the time of the so-called Great Awokening, those days in the late Obama era when it felt urgent and necessary to explore how misogynistic ideologies were encoded into works of art and popular culture. Then in 2017, Me Too exploded into popular consciousness, and Lolita became, abruptly, very urgent indeed. In novels and memoirs of that time, changing the way you read Lolita became a metaphor for changing the way you think about consent. When Me Too went mainstream, America began to reconsider old love stories and jokes, wondering if they were really so funny and romantic after all. Almost immediately, commenters on the right began to declare that the left had, just like those killjoy Victorians, gone too far, become too moralistic: that they were destroying art and eroticism alike out of a desire to keep the world sanitized and safe and — using a word that had become a pejorative rather suddenly — woke. Lolita became a chief exhibit in that argument. Me Too, these commenters declared, was going to come for Lolita, and the book would never have seen the light of day in contemporary publishing. “What's different today is #MeToo and social media — you can organize outrage at the drop of a hat. If Lolita was offered to me today, I'd never be able to get it past the acquisition team,” publisher Dan Franklin was quoted saying in The Spectator, “a committee of 30-year-olds, who'd say, ‘If you publish this book we will all resign.”” When I look back on meditations on Lolita around this time, however, what I find are a few declarations that Lolita is a misogynistic novel;  but a great deal more pieces by readers who went back to Lolita expecting to find it appalling, and instead found it holds up remarkably well. If you go digging for the voices of the sexual assault victim in, say, Sixteen Candles, you find nothing. “No one will ever pick up that novel and issue a shocked report about its true contents; no feminist academic will make her reputation by revealing its oppressive nature. What becomes much more difficult, in such a reading, is enjoying the music of Nabokov's prose without shame. What is the correct way to like Lolita? In her 2021 essay collection The Devil's Treasure, Mary Gaitskill wrote defensively that she thought Lolita was about love, and that she was sure saying so would lead censorious readers to hurl her book across the room. Probably the majority of Americans who know of that book would say: ‘Yes, in real life Humbert should go to jail, but he's obviously a fictional character and I'm interested to read about him,'” Gaitskill said to The Guardian. “That seems simple, but for more intellectual people, or people who are loud on Twitter, I think it's become contentious.” In 2020, writer and comedian Jamie Loftus released her Lolita Podcast, an extensive deep dive into the cultural legacy of Lolita. A central part of Loftus's argument was that our culture had gotten Lolita fundamentally wrong by reading it as the story of the temptress Lolita instead of the victim Dolores. “I'm now far more aggravated with how [Lolita] was presented to me than by the work itself,” Loftus said. “For me, a close read of this work reveals that Nabokov is not glorifying the predator. Versions of this argument over how to read Lolita continue to play out on social media, where Redditors vigorously debate whether people who read the book as a love story are illiterate edgelords stuck in the past, or if people who read the book as a horror story are virtue-signaling social justice obsessives. The person who might be most helpful to us here is, of all people, Lionel Trilling. “For me one of the attractions of Lolita is its ambiguity of tone … and its ambiguity of intention, its ability to arouse uneasiness, to throw the reader off balance, to require him to change his stance and shift his position and move on,” Trilling wrote, in the same 1958 essay in which he declared that Lolita is about love. “Lolita gives us no chance to settle and sink roots. Perhaps it is the curious moral mobility it urges on us that accounts for its remarkable ability to represent certain aspects of American life.” Lolita was written by a Russian, but it is about America, the whole vast beautiful seedy map of it, which Humbert and Dolores criss-cross again and again over their horrible year together. But could corporate fear of Trump retaliation also play a role? This quietly subversive book has been captivating kids for generations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The same is true for so many other public servants who have been fired or pushed out in recent months: the remarkable intelligence officers I was proud to lead as CIA director, the senior military officers I worked with every day, the development specialists I served alongside overseas, and too many others with whom we've served at home and abroad. And under the guise of reform, you all got caught in the crossfire of a retribution campaign—of a war on public service and expertise. Those of us who have served in public institutions understand that serious reforms are overdue. Of course we should remove bureaucratic hurdles that prevent agencies like the State Department from operating efficiently. If today's process were truly about sensible reform, career officers—who typically rotate roles every few years—wouldn't have been fired simply because their positions have fallen out of political favor. If this process were truly about sensible reform, crucial experts in technology or China policy in whom our country has invested so much wouldn't have been pushed out. If this process were truly about reform, it would have addressed not only the manifestations of bloat and in­efficiencies but also their causes—including congressionally mandated budget items. And if this process were truly about sensible reform, you and your families wouldn't have been treated with gleeful indignity. One of your colleagues, a career diplomat, was given just six hours to clear out his office. “When I was expelled from Russia,” he said, “at least Putin gave me six days to leave.” It is about paralyzing public servants—making them apprehensive about what they say, how it might be interpreted, and who might report on them. It was my duty to faithfully implement their decisions, even when I didn't agree with them. Career public servants have a profound obligation to execute the decisions of elected leaders, whether we voted for them or not; that discipline is essential to any democratic system. Many of your fellow officers purged at the State Department were doing just that—faithfully executing decisions that ran contrary to their professional advice and preferences. Tensions between elected political leaders and career public servants are hardly new. Although individual officers could be remarkably resourceful, the State Department as an institution was rarely accused of being too agile or too full of initiative. There is a difference, however, between fixing bureaucratic malaise and hammering professional public servants into politicized robots. Good on Paper: Maybe we do need DOGE They cow public servants into submission—and in doing so, they create a closed system that is free of opposing views and inconvenient concerns. Vladimir Putin's foolish decision to invade Ukraine in February 2022 offers a powerful example. He relied on a handful of long-serving advisers who either shared his flawed assumptions about Ukraine's ability to resist and the West's willingness to support it, or had learned a long time ago that it was not career-enhancing to question Putin's judgment. Just as it is the duty of public servants to carry out orders we don't agree with, it is also our duty to be honest about our concerns within appropriate channels—­or to resign if we can't in good conscience follow those orders. Sound decision making suffers if experts feel like they cannot offer their candid or contrary insights. When I led secret talks with the Iranians more than a decade ago, I needed the unvarnished advice of diplomats and intelligence officers to help me navigate the complex world of nuclear programs and Iranian decision making. I needed colleagues to question my judgment sometimes, and offer creative, hard-nosed solutions. Like some of you, I'm old enough to have lived through other efforts at reform and streamlining. Years later, when I was serving as the American ambassador in Moscow, we reduced staff by about 15 percent over three years. None of those was a perfect process, but they were conducted in a thoughtful way, respectful of public servants and their expertise. A generation of China specialists was falsely accused of being Communist sympathizers and driven from the State Department, kneecapping American diplomacy toward Beijing for years. Today's “reform” process—­at State and elsewhere across the federal government—­bears much more resemblance to Mc­Carthy's costly excesses than to any other era in which I've served. I believe the United States still has a better hand to play than any of our rivals, unless we squander the moment and throw away some of our best cards. That's exactly what the current administration is doing. We cannot afford to further erode the sources of our power at home and abroad. We've even gutted the research funding that powers our economy. If intelligence analysts at the CIA saw our rivals engage in this kind of great-power suicide, we would break out the bourbon. Of course we should put our own national interests first. But winning in an intensely competitive world means thinking beyond narrowly defined self-interest and building coalitions that counterbalance our adversaries; it requires working together on “problems without passports” such as climate change and global health challenges, which no single country can solve on its own. At our best, over the years I served in government, we were guided by enlightened self-interest, a balance of hard power and soft power. We weren't always at our best, or always especially enlightened, as we stumbled into protracted and draining conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, or when we didn't press allies hard enough to contribute their fair share. From the December 2022 issue: George Packer on a new theory of American power The threat we face is not from an imaginary “deep state” bent on undermining an elected president, but from a weak state of hollowed-out institutions and battered and be­littled public servants, no longer able to uphold the guardrails of our democracy or help the United States compete in an un­forgiving world. We won't beat hostile autocrats by imitating them. Many years ago, when I was finishing graduate school and trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my professional life, my father sent me a note. He was a career Army officer, a remarkably decent man, and the best model of public service I have ever known. “Nothing can make you prouder,” my dad wrote, “than to serve your country with honor.” I've spent the past 40 years learning the truth in his advice. I am deeply proud to have served alongside so many of you. Your expertise and your often quietly heroic public service have made an immeasurable contribution to the best interests of our country. You've fulfilled your oath, just as those still serving in government are trying their best to fulfill theirs. All of us have a profound stake in shaping their inheritance. I worry about how much damage we will do in the meantime. There is still a chance that the next generation will serve in a world where we curb the worst of our current excesses—stop betraying the ideals of public service, stop firing experts just because their statistics are unwelcome, and stop blowing up institutions that matter to our future. There is still a chance that the next generation could be present at the creation of a new era for America in the world, in which we're mindful of our many strengths but more careful about overreach. There is, sadly, room for doubt about those chances. At this pivotal moment, there's a growing possibility that we will inflict so much damage on ourselves and our place in the world that those future public servants will instead find themselves present at the destruction—a self-inflicted, generational setback to American leadership and national security. But what I do not doubt is the abiding importance of public service, and the value of what you have done with yours. And I know that you will continue to serve in different ways, helping to stand watch over our great experiment, even as too many of our elected leaders seem to be turning their backs on it.</p>

Not long ago, American conservative orthodoxy held that when it comes to doing business, the government that governs least governs best. Groups that claimed the mantle of individual liberties would decry new legislation. Talk radio and podcasts would mock unnamed bureaucrats for ham-fisted overreach. And powerful business lobbies were quick to denounce — in press releases and even lawsuits — regulations or taxes they saw as government overreach. But when faced with President Donald Trump's efforts to seize control of private enterprise — such as his recent arrangement to have the US pocket a portion of Nvidia's sales to China, his social media outbursts at individual executives, his moves to take a stake in Intel, and his use of executive powers to cajole banks and law firms he perceives as insufficiently loyal — those same groups have gone quiet. Similarly, the Business Roundtable, another DC-based lobbying group that represents hundreds of chief executives, has rarely been shy about denouncing what it sees as presidential overreach in the form of taxes and environmental regulations. Both groups have criticized Trump's trade war, warning that tariffs hurt American businesses. But neither has spoken out about the president's more direct assault on free enterprise. The president, a self-styled dealmaker, has thrown out the standard free-market playbook in ways that have alarmed lawmakers, investors and legal experts. And suddenly, the legal protections businesses have long counted on appear shaky, said Philip M. Nichols, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. They wait for the other wildebeest to jump in, and then follow.” Trump is tightening his grip on the economy, taking a page from China Several trade groups have privately drafted plans to push back against the Trump administration in defense of their business interests, people familiar with the matter told CNN. But those plans were shelved at the request of members that are worried about drawing White House ire. “But there's also a recognition that this is an administration that is transactional if they believe you're on board with their agenda.” Last month, the president took credit for Coca-Cola's decision to roll out a cane-sugar-sweetened product that aligns with his allies' “Make America Healthy Again” philosophy. He regularly criticizes CEOs in public for perceived slights, demanded that Intel's boss resign over unspecified conflicts, and urged Goldman Sachs to fire its top economist after the bank said tariffs would raise consumer prices (a fact virtually all economists agree to be true, and which we are now seeing borne out in reality). While much of that bluster is run-of-the-mill Trump rhetoric, the president shocked trade experts when he announced an unorthodox (and potentially illegal) arrangement with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD earlier this month. In exchange for export licenses that allow them to sell their products in China, the companies agreed to funnel 15% of their China sales to the US government — a setup that some analysts called a “shakedown” of private enterprise. The White House's push into private businesses took another turn Tuesday when officials confirmed the administration was considering using taxpayer money to acquire a stake in struggling chipmaker Intel. The primary reason for such a move, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said, was the president's desire to reduce US dependence on Taiwan for chip production. But he also said Trump believes the government should have “equity” in tech giants. The silence from Corporate America to Trump's incursion into private businesses isn't entirely unexpected. Businesses have lost their appetite for the kind of socially progressive rhetoric many adopted in response to the 2020 murder of George Floyd. “Corporate citizens are harmed just like flesh and blood citizens are harmed when you have a leader who… actively seeks to monetize public office and actively seeks to use the power of the presidency to harm perceived enemies or anyone who doesn't appropriately capitulate,” Donald Sherman, executive director of the Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CNN. “In some ways, this is the natural and predictable result of failing to appropriately stand up to President Trump's anti-democratic and authoritarian tendencies during his first term.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House launched a TikTok account on Tuesday amid uncertainty about the app's future, as another deadline approaches for its parent company, Bytedance, to sell to a US buyer or be banned in the United States. President Donald Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline of a sale-or-ban law passed under former President Joe Biden's administration, with the new deadline less than a month away on September 17. The latest delay in June kept the app accessible for its 170 million American users, despite the legislation that passed last year with bipartisan support over concerns that TikTok's Chinese ownership poses a US national security risk. And it came as both the United States and China sought leverage in tense trade talks. The first post on the official White House TikTok account features video of Trump as he says, “Every day, I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation. I am your voice.” The post's caption reads, “America we are BACK! As of 8 p.m. on Tuesday, shortly after launching, the account had garnered more than 20,000 followers. This is the administration's first official TikTok account. TikTok doesn't operate in China, but the Chinese government enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction. The US government has said it's worried China could use its national security laws to access the significant amount of personal information that TikTok, like most social media applications, collects from its US users. The TikTok sale-or-ban law went into effect on January 19 after Biden signed it last year. TikTok briefly took itself offline, sparking outcry from creators, but quickly came back after Trump signed an order delaying the ban's enforcement by 75 days in one of the first acts of his second term.</p>
