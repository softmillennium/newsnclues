The agency also announced that it will be vetting some people who request benefits for “un-American activities.”

New guidance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may make pro-Palestine activism a disqualifying factor for non-citizens applying for certain benefits in the United States. 

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced on Tuesday that, effective immediately, when reviewing applications, the agency will consider “any involvement in anti-American or terrorist organizations, as well as the use of discretion in adjudication of certain benefit requests where evidence of antisemitic activity is present.” The applicant “bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted,” the announcement states. 

For months after Israel began its genocide in Gaza in October 2023, the Biden administration repeatedly lobbed baseless accusations of antisemitism and support for terrorism at pro-Palestine, anti-genocide activists. Soon after taking office, the Trump administration escalated attacks on these activists by abducting and imprisoning many of them, particularly those who were foreign-born. The new guidance appears to formalize and significantly expand the crackdown on the movement, potentially barring those who criticize Israel from even entering the United States by equating such criticism with antisemitism.

“The ability to speak one's mind is a core constitutional right and an indispensable American value,” Vera Eidelman, senior staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said in a statement to Truthout.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration abducted and attempted to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder, based on his pro-Palestine activism at Columbia University. He was jailed in Louisiana, hundreds of miles away from his home in New York City, for more than three months. During that time, his wife gave birth to their first son. Immigration officials denied his request to attend the birth. 

Government officials falsely accused Khalil of antisemitism to justify deporting him. In a letter to the immigration court, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote that Khalil's “public actions and continued presence in the United States” undermine “U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.” The letter was first published by The Associated Press. 

In another case, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers abducted Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk for co-authoring an opinion piece for the student paper that called on the university to break ties with Israel. The Department of Homeland Security falsely claimed that she had “engaged in activities supportive of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans.”   

The agency also announced that it had “expanded the types of benefit requests that receive social media vetting, and reviews for anti-American activity will be added to that vetting. Anti-American activity will be an overwhelmingly negative factor in any discretionary analysis.”

“Anti-American” ideologies and activities have previously been detailed in a 1952 statute which prohibits the naturalization of any person who favors “totalitarian” forms of government, is a member of the Communist party, or advocates for the violent overthrow of the United States government. The law was adopted at the height of the government's crusade against communists, known as the Red Scare.

“America's benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies,” USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser said of the new policy guidelines. “U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is committed to implementing policies and procedures that root out anti-Americanism and supporting the enforcement of rigorous screening and vetting measures to the fullest extent possible.”

Denying immigrants benefits based on their speech is “a violation of the First Amendment,” Eidelman said in response to the guidelines.

Where can we escape, when every corner is pervaded by death?

My family and I look into each other's eyes. We don't say a word, but our anguished faces are all asking the same question: Do we flee to the south, where bombardment and killing never cease — where death only comes slower? Or do we remain in Gaza City Governorate, just before the Netzarim checkpoint, which has also become home to everyone from Gaza's north — more than 1 million people — only to be erased quickly, because the occupation has already decided to wipe it out completely?

The choice seems to be between how quickly we may die.

The occupation has devastated Gaza's northern area — Jabalia, Beit Hanoun, and Beit Lahia — and its eastern frontiers in Zeitoun and Shuja'iyya, by land and air, leaving behind a trail of blood, destruction, and unimaginable suffering. Today, these areas lie 90 percent destroyed, flattened to the ground, utterly uninhabitable — no buildings standing, no shelter, no life. Entire neighborhoods were erased as if they had never existed. This total destruction is precisely what Israel today threatens in Gaza City Governorate— to turn it into a mirror image of the north and east, despite the destruction already present, leaving it as lifeless as those areas have become.

Between 2023 and 2024, Israel launched three brutal ground invasions into Gaza City Governorate, with tanks rolling through the streets, crushing everything in their path. Tel al-Hawa, Al-Rimal, and Al-Sabra bore the heaviest blows, with nearly 70 percent of homes destroyed and countless lives torn apart. Entire streets were reduced to rubble, and the air was thick with smoke, dust, and the stench of death.

The most merciless of these attacks came in March 2024, during the sacred month of Ramadan. Al-Rimal was placed under a suffocating siege for nearly 20 days. During that period, we could not even drink safe water. We could not contemplate moving or even looking out from our windows. My family and I endured a real famine, facing death by starvation during those 20 grueling days. Al-Shifa Hospital was completely destroyed, leaving behind total ruin, while surrounding neighborhoods were shattered, and residents trapped under relentless bombardment from tanks and airstrikes. Everything that moved in the streets — whether human or animal — was targeted.

I lived through those cursed days. I witnessed the full reality of an Israeli ground invasion: tanks patrolling day and night without pause, their engines roaring like beasts, the streets trembling under their weight. Yet the cruelty did not end with their withdrawal from any area. Once Israeli forces moved a safe distance away from a neighborhood, they obliterated it entirely from the air, erasing every home, every life — which is what happened to Palestine Square in Al-Rimal. Nothing was left behind.

This month — on August 10, 2025 — the occupation began demanding that the residents of Gaza City Governorate prepare for displacement — including from Al-Rimal neighborhood, where I reside. This governorate is one of the largest in Gaza, home to more than 1 million people. Is the plan, after seizing this vast governorate, to take control of the south, gather all of us in Rafah, and forcibly displace us from Gaza entirely?

Days after the occupation's announcement, my father began reaching out to people in the south, searching desperately for any place where we could seek refuge. The southern Gaza Strip holds nearly a million people, yet everyone told us there is no place capable of sheltering us. Many southern areas are already in ruins, like Khan Younis, the largest governorate in the south. There was nowhere for us to go.

But even if we could leave, I could never forget what we endured at the start of the war. In the first week, the occupation ordered us to move south, claiming it was safe. Our actual displacement occurred on October 13, 2023. Just three hours after arriving in Khan Younis, in the south of the Gaza Strip — an area the where the occupation ordered us to go, claiming it was safe — a neighboring house was targeted in an airstrike, severely injuring my brother Mohammed in the head. By God's grace, he survived, but the experience traumatized my family.

Ten days later, on October 23, 2023, we returned to northern Gaza, where the nightmare intensified. There was no place for safety or rest. The destruction was immense, the bombing relentless, and famine had already begun to take hold with a brutal grip.

Now, as the occupation presses us once again to flee south, we face a terrifying dilemma: How can we trust that the south is safe, after nearly losing my brother Mohammed there? We know that any misstep could revive the same nightmare, and that our lives, and the lives of our loved ones, could hang by a thread.

How could my family, which endured more than a year and a half of unimaginable suffering in northern Gaza, surviving the deadliest horrors — ground invasions, manufactured famine, relentless airstrikes, all from Israel — ever leave our city now? Starvation began ravaging northern Gaza in the third month of the war, yet no one knew the extent of our suffering because communications and the internet were cut off, leaving us invisible for three long months.

Now I can understand the pain of the people of northern Gaza who returned home during the 60-day truce. For them, going back north was like a dream realized after unbearable hardship. How could they even consider leaving it all again for the south?

“What do you think about going south? Everyone is advising us to,” my father asked his colleague, Abu Moayad Al-Ramlawi. Just days earlier, the Al-Tuffah neighborhood had received a warning to flee — and then was completely wiped out. My brother-in-law's wife lost her brothers simply because they refused to flee.

Abu Moayad replied, “All I have is a tent. Nothing else. I will carry this tent anywhere in the south. Death will find me there too, but I'd rather die among people than alone here.”

My father then asked my uncle about leaving. He replied firmly: “I will stay in my home. If death wants me, it will find me — north or south.”

Desperate, my father reached out to his cousin's daughter in the south, seeking a place to stay. She apologized: “There is nothing here but a tent, if you want it.”

And so, my family is torn, trapped in uncertainty. The coming winter looms — should we shiver in a tent, exposed to bitter cold? This war drags on endlessly, and no one else besides Palestinians seems to care how long it will last. Stay in the north and suffer, or flee south and suffer all the same. Either way, north or south, our torment is inevitable.

Tensions have escalated sharply over the past few days. The occupation has begun besieging the residents of Sabra, located near the borders of Gaza City Governorate. Anxiety and fear hang heavy over the population. On August 16, tanks drew dangerously close to the Al-Rimal neighborhood, signaling an imminent threat.

Two days later, the situation appeared to shift slightly. Reports indicate that Israel and Hamas have resumed negotiations. Analysts warn that a full occupation of Gaza City Governorate, due to its vast size, could take the entirety of 2026 to complete.

We fear that these negotiations may prove futile, leaving us displaced and forced out of Gaza — reliving the tragedy Palestinians endured during the Nakba of 1948. Many never returned to their homes, even to this day.

And yet, we ask ourselves: if we die while staying in these homes, who then will be left behind?

            A federal judge said he would not unseal grand jury transcripts and exhibits from the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein – rejecting the Justice Department's request to make them public.
    


            Judge Richard Berman said the Justice Department did not overcome long-standing precedent to keep grand jury materials sealed and noted that the information contained in the sealed materials is small relative to the entire investigation file already in DOJ's hands.
    


            “The information contained in the Epstein grand jury transcripts pales in comparison to the Epstein investigation information and materials in the hand of the Department of Justice,” the judge wrote.
    


            The Justice Department declined to comment on Berman's ruling. This is the third federal judge to decline to release Epstein-related transcripts and evidence from a grand jury.
    


Federal judge rejects Trump DOJ's bid to unseal grand jury materials in Ghislaine Maxwell case



            The ruling comes as the Trump administration has faced mounting pressure to release more information around the Epstein files, especially after senior officials promised to do so.
    


            “The Government is a logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein files. By comparison, the instant grand jury motion appears to be a ‘diversion' from the breath and scope of the Epstein files in the Government's possession,” Berman wrote Wednesday.
    


            The judge added another compelling reason to keep the records sealed are “possible threats to victims' safety and privacy.”
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi released binders to right-wing social media influencers at the White House in February, but many of the influencers shared that the binders did not reveal any new information regarding the Epstein files.
    


            The Justice Department started revoking their promises to release more information in Epstein's case in May and downplaying the situation. Bondi alerted Trump in May that his name appeared in the files.
    


            On July 7, the DOJ released an unsigned memo saying they would not be releasing any more documents regarding the Epstein files. The lack of transparency in the memo only angered Democrats, the public and even members of Trump's political base.
    


            The Justice Department has explored several avenues to have more information released, including by asking two federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury materials in Epstein's case and Ghislaine Maxwell's case. Maxwell is Epstein's long-time partner who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for carrying out a years-long scheme with Epstein to groom and sexually abuse underage girls.
    


            New York federal Judge Paul Engelmayer denied the Justice Department's request for grand jury materials in Maxwell's case on August 11 in a scathing opinion, saying that the premise of DOJ's argument was false and that the request was not a matter of public interest.
    


            The Justice Department also requested the unsealing of grand jury materials from a federal court in Florida, and a judge swiftly denied the request.
    


            Additionally, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche conducted a two-day interview with Maxwell on July 24 and 25 at the US Attorney's Office in Tallahassee, Florida. The Justice Department is working on transcribing a 10-hour audio tape from the interview.

Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov dismisses European diplomacy as ‘clumsy effort to sway Trump'

Moscow has said it must be part of any international talks on Ukraine's security, as Russia continues to stall on Donald Trump's push for a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Wednesday that Moscow must be included in any talks on Ukraine's security guarantees, dismissing European diplomacy as “aggressive escalation” and a “clumsy effort to sway Trump”.

“To discuss security guarantees seriously without Russia is a road to nowhere,” Lavrov said during a working visit to Jordan.

Lavrov also said that China, Russia's ally in the war, should be among Ukraine's security guarantors – reviving a proposal first put forward by Russian negotiators during talks in Turkey in spring 2022.

European leaders have begun exploring post-conflict security guarantees for Ukraine, following Trump's pledge to help protect the country under any deal to end Russia's war.

Russian officials have repeatedly said Moscow would not accept the deployment of European forces to Ukraine, one of the key security guarantees under discussion.

Kyiv is likely to view with scepticism any prospect of China, a supporter of Russia during the war, acting as a security guarantor.

Lavrov, meanwhile, avoided any direct reference to a possible Putin-Zelenskyy summit, highlighting the Kremlin's apparent plans to delay any concrete planning of a meeting.

Trump announced this week he had “begun the arrangements” for the first meeting between the two leaders since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion.

Trump later claimed he had set up a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, explaining: “I thought I'd first let them meet.”

Opening direct talks with Zelenskyy would cut against the storyline Putin has cultivated since the 2022 invasion – portraying Ukraine's president as an illegitimate figure and a mere puppet of the west.

Putin, who almost never refers to Zelenskyy by name and instead speaks of the “Kyiv regime”, has repeatedly cast doubt on whether his Ukrainian counterpart even holds the authority to sign a peace agreement. “You can negotiate with anyone, but because of his illegitimacy, he [Zelenskyy] has no right to sign anything,” Putin told Russian officials earlier this year.

But Trump's promise of a meeting puts Putin in a difficult spot: rejecting it risks tension with the US president, while agreeing to one would elevate Zelenskyy to equal status and confront Putin with a media-savvy rival ready to meet almost without preconditions.

Moscow has shown scant sign of preparing for such an encounter.

Lavrov cautioned on Wednesday that any contact between the two leaders would need to be arranged “with the utmost care”, while other Russian officials dismissed Zelenskyy as a lightweight unworthy of serious attention.

But, as often is the case, Moscow has avoided closing the door entirely, hinting that the Putin–Zelenskyy encounter could take place, while giving no sign that it is actually on the horizon.

Several countries have offered to host a possible Putin-Zelenskyy meeting, including the Vatican, Switzerland and Hungary.

The Russian leader reportedly suggested to Trump that his counterpart travel to Moscow for talks – an idea Russia knew Kyiv would reject because of the obvious risks to Zelenskyy's safety.

Analysts suggested that the Russian leader would probably only meet Zelenskyy to accept Russia's maximalist conditions, which would equal Ukraine's capitulation.

“Putin will not meet Zelenskyy under the current circumstances,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “He has repeatedly stated that such a meeting would only be possible if there were well-prepared grounds, which in practice means Zelenskyy's acceptance of Russia's terms for ending the war.”

Figures close to the Kremlin have emphasised that Putin sees no need to rush into a meeting with Zelenskyy.

“Simply put, Putin only sees value in a meeting with Zelenskyy if it ends with a capitulation,” wrote the nationalist commentator Alexei Mukhin. “If Zelenskyy is unwilling to sign one, the Kremlin will keep ‘working on' the idea of a meeting until he is,” Mukhin added.

Putin now faces a situation reminiscent of earlier moments when Trump pressed him to agree to a ceasefire. At the time, he managed to manoeuvre around the pressure, and analysts believe he is likely to take a similar approach now – downplaying the prospect of talks without rejecting them outright.

The key question is whether Trump will seek to put pressure on Kyiv to accept some of Russia's demands to clear the way for a meeting between the two leaders.

Russia's leadership on Wednesday showed no sign of compromise. Lavrov said the US was beginning to gain a clearer understanding of the “root causes” of the war – a phrase Putin has used to describe demands ranging from Ukraine's formal renunciation of Nato membership to its “demilitarisation” and “denazification”, a vague formula that in practice would mean removing Zelenskyy.

The Russian foreign minister also pointed to the April 2022 talks in Turkey between Russia and Ukraine as a model. Those failed negotiations centred on Moscow's demands for Ukraine's disarmament, political neutrality and the abandonment of its ambition to join Nato.

Meanwhile, Russian officials told Reuters that Moscow was preparing to raise taxes and cut spending to sustain high defence outlays and keep the war effort going.

Polish officials said on Aug. 20 that a Russian drone crashed overnight in a rural area of eastern Poland, describing the incident as a deliberate provocation amid international talks about ending the war in Ukraine.

This is not the first time a Russian drone has crashed on the territory of a NATO member. 

Poland's Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz confirmed that the object, which fell into a cornfield near the village of Osiny, was a Russian unmanned aerial vehicle. Osiny is located in Lublin Voivodeship, a province that borders Ukraine and Belarus.

"Once again, we are dealing with a provocation by the Russian Federation using a Russian drone," Kosiniak-Kamysz told reporters at a press conference in Warsaw, according to Rzeczpospolita.

"Russia once again provokes NATO countries — after drone incidents that took place in Romania, Lithuania, and Latvia, as well as after airspace violations that occurred in almost all NATO countries," Kosiniak-Kamysz added. 

Kosiniak-Kamysz said that Poland's Defense Ministry had briefed top military commanders, as well as security and foreign affairs officials, and that Poland's allies had been informed.

Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said the incident was a fresh violation of Polish airspace "from the east" and announced that Warsaw would issue a diplomatic protest. 

"There will be a protest from the Foreign Ministry against the perpetrator," Sikorski wrote on X.

A Polish military spokesman said the drone appeared to have flown very low to avoid radar detection and likely carried only a small amount of explosives. 

General Dariusz Malinowski, a senior Polish commander, told reporters that initial analysis indicated the device was a decoy, powered by a commercially available Chinese-made engine. 

According to Malinowski, such drones are typically used to confuse air defenses and then self-destruct. A special investigation team has been appointed to examine the wreckage.

Poland, a NATO member on the alliance's eastern border, has repeatedly accused Moscow of testing its defenses and attempting to destabilize the region through drone flights and airspace violations. 

The incident in Poland comes as Western leaders accelerate talks on possible peace arrangements for Ukraine, with Kyiv pressing for binding international security guarantees. President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders met with U.S. President Donald Trump on Aug. 18 to discuss potential peace talks.

            The Trump administration escalated its fight against the International Criminal Court by imposing sanctions on four more court officials involved in work related to alleged Israeli and US war crimes.
    


            In a statement Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department was designating Kimberly Prost of Canada, Nicolas Guillou of France, Nazhat Shameem Khan of Fiji and Mame Mandiaye Niang of Senegal for their work in the ICC “to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute nationals of the United States or Israel, without the consent of either nation.”
    


            The sanctions were imposed under an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in February that authorizes punitive measures like sanctions and possible entrance bans on ICC personnel because of its “illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.” The executive order was already used to sanction ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan and four ICC judges.
    


            According to a State Department fact sheet, Prost, an ICC judge “is being designated for ruling to authorize the ICC's investigation into U.S. personnel in Afghanistan.”
    


            Guillou, another judge, “is being designated for ruling to authorize the ICC's issuance of arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant,” the fact sheet said.
    


            “Deputy Prosecutors Shameem Khan and Niang are being designated for continuing to support illegitimate ICC actions against Israel, including upholding the ICC's arrest warrants targeting Prime Minister Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Gallant since they assumed leadership for the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor,” it said.
    


            The ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Gallant in November 2024 for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.
    


            Trump also signed an executive order authorizing sanctions and visa restrictions for members of the court during his first term in 2020, months after the ICC authorized a probe into alleged war crimes committed in Afghanistan by US and Afghan forces as well as alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Taliban.

Residents cite pollution, loss of fishing and diminished tax revenue as liquefied natural gas production for export accelerates

This story was originally published by Floodlight, a non-profit newsroom that investigates the powers stalling climate action

For more than a decade, Rebekah Hinojosa has fought the build-out of liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals near the Texas border with Mexico. She wants to save the pristine land fronting the Gulf of Mexico from massive terminals and the hulking ships that would carry billions of cubic feet of gas all over the world.

Using what they call a “death by a thousand cuts” strategy of opposition, Hinojosa, a founder of the environmental non-profit South Texas Environmental Justice Network, and her fellow advocates have traveled the world. They've pleaded with banks, politicians, insurers and companies to drop their support for the LNG terminals in the overwhelmingly Hispanic community near Brownsville on the edge of the Laguna Atascosa national wildlife refuge.

They have notched some David-versus-Goliath victories. Some insurers and investors have severed ties with Rio Grande LNG. One of the three proposed LNG projects there was canceled in 2021.

The most significant legal win came a year ago, when the US court of appeals for the DC Circuit vacated Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval of Rio Grande and Texas LNG, citing the agency's failure to fully consider the terminals' environmental justice impacts, among others things.

But then Donald Trump was elected for a second time.

The day he was inaugurated, Trump declared an energy emergency and rolled back rules on environmental justice and protections that had helped groups in Texas and Louisiana fight back. Eight months into his second term, at least six projects that had been awaiting crucial federal approvals – including those that Hinojosa has fought – are moving forward again.

And residents along the Texas and Louisiana coasts, from which the vast majority of the nation's LNG flows, are facing a different kind of emergency.

Fisher Tad Theriot has seen his yearly income from shrimping in the water near the LNG facilities drop from $325,000 in 2021 to $87,000 last year. This year he estimates the income from his catch will be less than half of that.

“If … you don't get away from Cameron, you're not catching shrimp,” Theriot said of the small Louisiana community that already hosts three LNG terminals and where at least two others are planned to be built.

The United States has been the world's largest LNG exporter since 2023. Along the Gulf coast in Texas and Louisiana, six terminals are operating, six are under construction and another six are proposed. The amount of LNG exported – last year it was 11.9bn cubic feet a day – is expected to double by 2028.

The growth is fueled by the nation's vast reserves of natural gas that can be forced out of the ground by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Fracked gas is sent by pipeline to an LNG terminal where it is superchilled until it's a liquid and then shipped around the world.

While a million British thermal units (MMBTU) of natural gas can be purchased in the United States for about $4, after it's superchilled and transported across oceans, countries such as Japan and Germany pay $12 to $15 per MMBTU for that gas.

Even after the cost of producing and shipping the LNG, companies that export LNG stand to make billions of dollars in profits. Billions more are made by the middlemen who buy and sell the fuel.

A US Department of Energy study finalized in May said LNG creates jobs, expands the US gross domestic product and helps close the trade gap.

“President Trump was given a mandate to unleash American energy dominance, and that includes US LNG exports,” the US energy secretary, Chris Wright, said in the report. “The facts are clear: expanding America's LNG exports is good for Americans and good for the world.”

Developers promise jobs and economic benefits to the areas that host the plants – although studies show those promises aren't always kept. In exchange, LNG facilities in Louisiana receive billions of dollars of local property tax breaks. Louisiana's Cameron parish alone would forfeit nearly $15bn between 2012 and 2040 if all proposed terminals were built.

Several companies that produce LNG along the Gulf coast did not respond to requests for comments for this story.

Local residents, such as James Hiatt, founder of the regional environmental and community advocacy group For a Better Bayou, say the communities do not benefit. Pointing to houses abandoned in Lake Charles after Hurricane Laura five years ago, Hiatt said: “If they have so much money, why don't they actually pour that money into the communities where they operate? They give little peanuts. [It's] nothing to the amount of money that they have been given by the government and the people here.”

They do get one thing, activist Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project, an environmental justice organization, says: pollution. While families struggle to pay for their own energy, Ozane said all the local community gets from the methane build-out is “more health problems”. The production and transportation of LNG also generates significant greenhouse gas emissions, including methane and carbon dioxide.

John Allaire, a retired oil and gas engineer, owns land adjacent to the Commonwealth LNG site in Cameron parish, one of the terminals that has received conditional approval from the federal government. And across the Calcasieu ship channel from his property, he can see Venture Global's Calcasieu Pass 1 LNG, and the site of its expansion, called CP2.

He has watched 90 meters of his shoreline disappear in the past 27 years because of rising sea levels and subsidence caused by the climate crisis. Burning more fossil fuels, including LNG, will speed the rise of the waters around the terminals – and around the globe.

While the terminals themselves will be protected by 26ft-high seawalls, Allaire's land – and that of others around the terminals – will not.

“These are the estuaries that supply the seafood that Cameron parish and Louisiana's so famous for,” Allaire said, pointing to wetlands near his home where crabs and shrimp lay their eggs. “But that'll all be backfilled [with] concrete and sheet pilings and tanks … It'll change this environment forever.”

LNG is sometimes promoted as a “bridge fuel” because it burns cleaner than coal. But Cornell scientist Robert Howarth warns that its full lifecycle emissions – including methane leaks during drilling, liquefaction, shipping and regasification – is 33% worse for the climate than coal. That claim is disputed by the industry, which has produced its own study claiming LNG is more environmentally friendly than coal.

The International Energy Agency has warned that any new fossil infrastructure jeopardizes global climate goals.

The LNG industry says its fuel is helping by replacing coal in countries such as India. But a recent analysis from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found that India is turning toward renewables, not LNG, to replace coal.

Others are questioning whether demand for the fuel will support the boom in the production of LNG. Export terminals require gas prices of around $8 per MMBTU to break even – far more than the $3 to $5 per MMBTU equivalent of energy that countries like India can afford.

Despite these analyses, developers are touting a booming market. Trump has extracted promises from Asian countries, including Japan and Vietnam, to purchase more LNG, but not all of the deals are binding – or even new.

Allaire has seen such promises fail in the past. Golden Pass LNG in Texas, Allaire notes, was originally built as an import facility, but is now being refashioned as an export terminal after a pause caused by the bankruptcy of the construction firm building the project.

“They spent billions of dollars, took out hundreds of acres of wetlands, and they imported seven loads of LNG,” Allaire said, predicting that “these places will go out of business, and they will be stranded resources”.

In the meantime, new numbers from the Energy Information Administration, the Department of Energy's statistical agency, indicate the rapid increase in LNG production is increasing the cost of natural gas – the country's main fuel source to generate electricity. “The high demand for gas exports is … pushing up the price of the gas that supplies 40% of US electricity – a cost that will be passed on to consumers,” predicted the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Despite Trump's aggressive promotion of LNG, Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program for Public Citizen, said there are still grounds to fight the build-out, even if the environmental and justice arguments have been removed by his administration.

“These additional exports are going to expose Americans to higher gas prices,” he said. “You can't declare an energy emergency where you claim domestic shortages of energy at the same time you're going to greenlight a bunch of export terminals.”

For residents such as Roishetta Ozane, adding more LNG facilities is not an abstract energy debate. It's a lived experience of cumulative harm, environmental erasure and political abandonment caused by the petrochemical industries around Lake Charles, 30 miles (50km) north of the epicenter of the LNG development.

“Our community is already surrounded by pollution,” she said. “It makes absolutely no sense to approve two or three new LNG facilities here in south-west Louisiana when we already have as much industry as we do.

“It's just like a death sentence.”

Still, both Ozane and Rebekah Hinojosa refuse to give up. In late July and early August, Ozane was among roughly 70 Gulf coast advocates who protested outside the headquarters of companies in New York City that are financing and insuring the LNG boom.

“We will still keep fighting and speaking up to do everything we can to stop these projects, because our community doesn't want these projects,” Hinojosa said. “I mean, for us, it's about continuing to exist here.”

The choice to stop reporting violates a 2021 mandate and comes as the administration rolls back trans care requirements.

Immigration officials no longer report the number of transgender people in their custody, as advocates warn that the decision hampers efforts to ensure queer people's safety in the nation's rapidly escalating immigration detention regime.

The Vera Institute for Justice recently reported that starting in February, shortly after President Donald Trump took office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) stopped reporting these numbers as part of a biweekly statistical report, despite a 2021 requirement that the agency disclose the numbers. 

The decision to stop reporting also comes as ICE has rolled back trans care requirements in contracts with detention centers and removed a 2015 memo governing how the agency treats trans migrants (ironically authored by Trump's current border czar Thomas Homan) from its website. Trump's executive order requiring federal facilities such as prisons and jails to house people based on sex assigned at birth also extends to federal immigration facilities.

Experts, including Noelle Smart, the principal research associate at the Vera Institute, say that the missing data echoes how ICE has disappeared everyday people — regardless of their legal right to stay in the U.S. — and obstructs advocates' efforts to assist the trans people those numbers represent. 

“The harms of anti-immigrant and anti-trans policies and the harms of detention that are worsening under this administration are just all being compounded, and at a time where we have even less access to just the most basic statistics,” Smart said.

The Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to Prism's requests for comment. 

Some say the disappeared data also signals the Trump administration's efforts to evade accountability as mass detention escalates, aided by a massive budget increase and for-profit prison companies vying for lucrative contracts.

Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that serves LGBTQIA+ and HIV-positive migrants and asylum-seekers, released a report last year that laid bare the abuse queer people face in federal immigration detention. According to the report, subjects typically faced sexual and physical abuse due to their identities, as well as solitary confinement and inadequate medical care, including denied HIV treatment.

Bridget Crawford, director of law and policy at Immigration Equality, said the abuse is especially harmful to a population that routinely flees to the U.S. to escape anti-LGBTQIA+ persecution and state violence across the globe. 

“The vast majority of our cases are for LGBTQ+ or HIV-positive people, and the types that you just see across the board from so many places are incredibly high levels of torture, sexual abuse, sexual violence from families and communities,” Crawford said. “Also, sometimes people have been incarcerated in their country of origin because of their LGBTQ status. So it's particularly traumatizing to then be put into another carceral setting where they're harassed or mistreated or abused.”

But experts warn that Trump's anti-immigrant actions are also putting people at risk outside of the U.S.

The Trump administration's executive order pausing refugee resettlement in the U.S. has left queer people fleeing violence across the globe in life-threatening precarity, as Immigration Equality detailed in a recent report. The report recounts the experiences of a lesbian couple from Afghanistan fleeing the Taliban, a gay Ugandan man trapped in Kenya, and a stateless trans woman trapped in Saudi Arabia. 

The report also discusses a Somali trans woman who spent six years being beaten and raped at a conversion camp in Kenya and was murdered shortly after resettlement was paused in January. The woman, named Camilla, was preparing for an interview to be resettled in the U.S., according to the report. Crawford told Prism that a second person was also murdered in Uganda.

In a blow to the U.S.'s one-time reputation as a welcoming home for refugees, many queer migrants don't want to resettle in the U.S. in light of escalating discrimination, according to Senna Seniuk of Rainbow Railroad, an international nonprofit that helps at-risk LGBTQIA+ people settle safely across the globe. 

“For folks who have some level of choice about where they may be able to safely get to, I would say that the U.S. is a lower priority,” Seniuk said in an interview. “We'll also still see folks arriving here who have no other options. So it is still seen as a place where folks can find some safety, and their situations have to be so dire in order to really make that decision to come to the U.S.”

Mainstream news coverage of the plight of LGBTQIA+ migrants began to grow in 2018, after a trans Honduran woman died in ICE custody. Roxana Hernández, who was 33 years old when she died at a New Mexico hospital, passed through the San Ysidro Port of Entry just two weeks beforehand. 

According to an official autopsy and other records provided to NBC in 2019, Hernández died of AIDS-related complications due to “untreated HIV” after she was not given necessary antiretroviral drugs.

“Paired with the abuse we know transgender people regularly suffer in ICE detention, the death of Ms. Hernández sends the message that transgender people are disposable and do not deserve dignity, safety, or even life,” Isa Noyola, deputy director of the Transgender Law Center, said after Hernández's death in a joint statement with Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement and Organización de Latina Trans en Texas. 

And now, as the Trump administration ratchets up its attacks on immigrants and LGBTQIA+ people, among other marginalized groups, reports by queer people of mistreatment in detention continue to make headlines. 

Earlier this year, a trans woman held at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba said she was forced to shower and use the bathroom in front of men and was denied any contact with family or legal counsel. In January, a trans woman filed a federal lawsuit against Orange County, New York, after she said immigration officials refused to treat her for a fractured nose, placed her in solitary confinement, and later, in a cell with cisgender men who sexually harassed her at a detention facility in upstate New York. She also sued the federal government over this treatment in a separate case in May. 

In what is arguably the most high-profile case, Andry Hernández, a gay Venezuelan asylum-seeker was held in the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador for months after being falsely labeled as a gang member by the Trump administration. After more than 120 days in the notoriously deadly prison, Hernández was finally released in July in a prisoner swap.

But now, Hernandez has returned to Venezuela, the place he fled homophobic violence in the first place.

Toronto entrepreneur David Ossip transformed one of America's oldest technology companies, Ceridian Corp., from an underperforming, debt-laden equity-owned enterprise based in Minneapolis into a leading enterprise software vendor that was largely managed from Canada.

That human resources software company, now known as Dayforce Inc. DAY-T, appears to be headed back into the private realm after confirming Wednesday it was in advanced discussions to be acquired by private equity giant Thoma Bravo for US$70 per share, valuing the company at more than US$11-billion.

The offer represents a premium of 32.4 per cent based on the stock's closing price on Aug. 15, before the talks were first reported, and is the latest consolidation move in the human resources software market, after the acquisition by Paychex of rival Paycor for US$4.1-billion earlier this year, and Automatic Data Processing's 2024 acquisition of WorkForce Software for about US$1.2-billion.

Dayforce stock, which had already soared earlier this week on reports of an impending deal, was trading Wednesday morning at $67.06 on the New York Stock Exchange, up 2.4 per cent.

If the Thoma-Dayforce deal happens, it would mark the latest in a sweep of takeovers by private equity firms of software firms that saw their valuations crash in late 2021 as the specter, later realized, of rising interest rates hit the technology sector. 

This privatization wave is different from the buyout craze of the 2000s that consumed Ceridian and nearly culminated in a takeover of Canadian telecom giant BCE Inc. That wave was fuelled by cheap money and loose lending terms alongside the subprime mortgage bubble, which led to the credit crisis and deep recession in 2008-09.

This time, private equity firms, including Thoma Bravo, have been largely focused on sturdy, growing subscription software firms that have fallen out of favour with public market investors. The new era has seen more than half of the 20 Canadian technology companies that went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange during the pandemic-fuelled initial public offering boom in 2020 and 2021 go private through buyouts or delisting.

That includes Magnet Forensics, one of the standout performers of that class of TSX IPOs, which Thoma took private for $1.8-billion in 2023. Other prominent publicly traded Canadian software companies have recently looked into privatizing, including Lightspeed Commerce Inc. – which abandoned a sale process early this year – as well as Altus Group Ltd. and Dye & Durham Ltd.

Mr. Ossip, a veteran, South African-born Canadian software entrepreneur, was already one of Canada's most high-profile software entrepreneurs when he launched Dayforce in the late 2000s: His previous startup, time-and-attendance management software provider Workbrain Corp., was bought by Infor Global Solutions for $227-million in 2007. Many employees went on to build their own startups.

When Ceridian bought Dayforce in 2012, it looked like a familiar story: Promising Canadian startup sells out too soon to a big U.S. buyer. But it was an intentional move that “wasn't a random series of events,” Mr. Ossip told The Globe and Mail in 2017. “It was designed.” 

At the time, the buyer, a payroll processing stalwart, was a faded technology has-been that started life as an IBM unit in 1932 and was purchased by U.S. private-equity giant Thomas H. Lee Partners in 2007. Part of the deal was that Mr. Ossip would become CEO of Ceridian and lead its transformation into a 21st century subscription software powerhouse. He is also chairman of the company.

Mr. Ossip, now 58, subsequently built Ceridian's effective headquarters and executive team in Toronto, where much of the development work happens, while maintaining its U.S. domicile and Minneapolis headquarters. Mr. Ossip shifted Ceridian's focus to expanding Dayforce, which offers payroll and other human-resources services, including benefits and workforce and talent management administration, on a single platform.

Dayforce had nearly 7,000 customers on its subscription software platform as of June 30, up 4.9 per cent year-over-year. One of its biggest is the government of Canada, which is deploying Dayforce to replace its failed Phoenix payroll system. If the original Dayforce startup had remained a stand-alone Canadian company, it would be one of this country's largest homegrown software vendors. Dayforce eventually consumed the old Ceridian, which formally changed its name early last year.

After going public on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges in 2018 at US$22-a share (as Ceridian HCM Holdings Inc.), the stock soared through 2021, topping US$130 that November as the pandemic pushed consumers and companies alike to increasingly adopt online software. 

But like other software companies, Dayforce's stock fell after soaring inflation raised concerns that central banks would counteract with interest rate hikes. Those started in spring 2022. By that June, the company's stock had lost nearly two-thirds of its peak value, and was only trading in the low $50s range before news broke about a possible buyout last weekend.

Rising rates also weighed on the enterprise software sales market. Dayforce's recurring revenue growth from its subscription software platform slowed from the 30 per cent-plus range two years ago, gaining 13.6 per cent in the second quarter to reach US$315.5-million. That outpaced total revenue growth, weighted down by Ceridian's legacy payroll management business, of 9.8 per cent. 

The results, reported last week, included a US$21.3-million net profit for the quarter, beating Wall Street expectations. The company raised its annual revenue forecast last week, as more enterprises increase use of AI and cloud-based platforms to run day-to-day operations. 

Mr. Ossip briefly shared the CEO title with Leagh Turner from early 2022 through November, 2023. 

Ms. Turner, who had joined as president and chief operating officer in 2018 after serving as global chief operating officer with SAP AG, left Dayforce to lead Coupa Software, a Silicon Valley spend management software vendor.

First Black woman to sit on central bank's board accused by ally of president of mortgage fraud

US politics live – latest updates

Donald Trump has called on a Federal Reserve governor to immediately resign, renewing his extraordinary attack on the central bank's independence as officials mull next steps on interest rates.

A close Trump ally accused Lisa Cook, an appointee of Joe Biden, of “potentially committing mortgage fraud” and urged the US Department of Justice to investigate. The claims have not been confirmed.

The US president has repeatedly broken with precedent in recent months to demand the Fed cut rates and urge its chair, Jerome Powell, to quit after disregarding such calls.

On Wednesday, Trump leaped on the allegations about Cook. The governor “must resign, now!!!”, he wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform.

Cook and the Fed did not respond to requests for comment.

Cook, whose current term on the Fed's board extends until 2038, previously served on the council of economic advisers under Barack Obama. When she took office in May 2022, she became the first Black woman to sit on the central bank's board.

On Wednesday morning, Bill Pulte, head of the US Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has become – beyond the president himself – one of the Trump administration's most vocal critics of Powell and the Fed, published allegations against Cook.

In June 2021, Cook entered into a 15-year mortgage agreement on a property in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and declared her intention to use it as her principal residence, according to Pulte. In July 2021, Cook bought a property in Atlanta, Georgia, and also committed to use that property as her primary residence when taking out a 30-year mortgage, according to Pulte.

Pulte referred Cook to the justice department for a criminal investigation, and promptly called on her to resign.

“How can this woman be in charge of interest rates if she is allegedly lying to help her own interest rates?” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

Cook, who has not commented on the allegations, is the latest figure to be targeted by Trump officials over claims of mortgage fraud. Pulte has made similar allegations about the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and the California senator Adam Schiff, both Democrats. The justice department is reportedly investigating. James has dismissed the claims as “baseless”.

Schiff has vehemently denied the allegations, and accused the administration of weaponizing the US justice system.

As Trump and his officials continue to pressure the Fed to cut rates, minutes from the central bank's latest meeting underlined how most policymakers plan to scrutinize data over the coming weeks to gauge the economic impact of the administration's policies.

While Fed policymakers again opted to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in July, two of its governors opposed the decision – the first time multiple governors have voted against the majority since 1993.

Fed officials “assessed that the effects of higher tariffs had become more apparent in the prices of some goods but that their overall effects on economic activity and inflation remained to be seen,” the minutes said. “They also noted that it would take time to have more clarity on the magnitude and persistence of higher tariffs' effects on inflation.”

After the meeting, official employment data showed that jobs growth stalled this summer – prompting Trump to fire the federal government official in charge of labor statistics – as inflation continued to rise.

The two governors who called for rate cuts, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, were each appointed by Trump during his first term. Both have been floated as potential replacements for Powell, whose term as chair will end next May.

Powell is due to deliver a highly-anticipated speech at the annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium in Wyoming on Friday, which will be closely scrutinized for signs of where the Fed plans to take rates over the coming months.

A Washington state restaurant that resumed indoor dining in violation of a 2020 state COVID-19 pandemic order must pay a fine of more than $900,000, an appeals court has ruled.

State officials fined the owners of Stuffy's II Restaurant $936,000 in total—$18,000 for each day its dining room was open while the state's emergency order banning indoor dining was in place.

Donald Trump could use a 10 per cent levy on weapons sales to Europe to fund US security guarantees for Ukraine, his treasury secretary has said.

Scott Bessent revealed that the president had increased the price of US military hardware being bought by European countries for Ukraine by 10 per cent.

“We are selling arms to Europeans, who are then selling them on to the Ukrainians, and President Trump is taking 10 per cent mark-up on the arms,” Mr Bessent told Fox News. “So maybe that 10 per cent will cover the cost of the air cover.”

Earlier this week, Mr Trump said he would be willing to use US air power to support a European security force in Ukraine as part of any settlement to end the war with Russia.

European nations have already pledged to buy at least $10bn in American-made military equipment for Kyiv in recent weeks.

Ukraine has also tabled a proposal that would see the country promise to buy a further $90bn worth of hardware after its war with Russia comes to an end.

Mr Trump has insisted for some time that he will no longer spend US taxpayers' money on supporting Ukraine, the defence of which he believes is a problem for European nations.

Planning for a multinational force to be sent to Ukraine has been accelerated after the US president signalled he would be willing to contribute during talks with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, and European leaders.

Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the British chief of defence staff, was in Washington on Wednesday for talks with his US counterpart, General Dan Caine, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff.

They joined a virtual meeting of Nato's military leaders “as diplomatic efforts to secure peace in Ukraine progress”, Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, an Italian admiral who heads the alliance's military committee, said.

The plans being discussed would see a European force train and develop Ukraine's armed forces, while securing its skies and seas. Around 10 nations have shown a willingness to join the deployment, including Britain, France and Germany.

Mr Trump has signalled he could join bolstered plans for “Article Five-like” assurances for Kyiv – a reference to Nato's mutual defence clause that states an attack on one member is an attack on them all. But he has ruled out putting American boots on the ground as part of assistance.

Meanwhile, the suggestion of a European peacekeeping force stationed in Ukraine has been met with veiled rejections from Moscow.

Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, warned that discussion of security guarantees without the Kremlin's involvement was a “road to nowhere”.

Russia's top diplomat suggested that any guarantees should be on the basis of Russian demands from initial peace talks in the spring of 2022, which gave Moscow a veto over any military aid for Kyiv.

“We cannot agree with the fact that now it is proposed to resolve questions of security, collective security, without the Russian Federation. This will not work,” said Mr Lavrov on Wednesday.

“I am sure that in the West, and above all in the United States, they understand perfectly well that seriously discussing security issues without the Russian Federation is a utopia – it's a road to nowhere.”

This week, Moscow also issued a categorical rejection of “any scenarios involving the deployment of Nato troops in Ukraine”.

In a sign that a peace deal is not within reach, Mr Lavrov accused the European leaders who met Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky of carrying out “a fairly aggressive escalation of the situation, rather clumsy and, in general, unethical attempts to change the position of the Trump administration and the president of the United States personally”.

Elon Musk has dismissed a Wall Street Journal report claiming that he is quietly backing away from plans to launch his America Party. The newspaper said Musk had told allies he will focus on his businesses and not risk splitting Republican voters with a third-party bid.

Musk supported US President Donald Trump in the 2024 election and temporarily served as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) before a public falling-out over the president's “Big Beautiful Bill” spending package. 

After resigning, he announced he would start his own political faction to challenge the two-party system and field candidates in the 2026 midterms.

On Tuesday, however, the WSJ reported that Musk had allegedly told allies he would instead concentrate on his companies and avoid alienating Republicans by siphoning away GOP votes. 

Commenting on the report, Musk wrote on X that “nothing WSJ says should ever be thought of as true.” He did not address the outlet's claims.

The WSJ also stated that the billionaire has been maintaining ties with Vice President J.D. Vance, viewed as a potential heir to Trump, and has considered using his resources to back Vance's 2028 presidential bid. It noted that Musk has not formally ruled out forming a party and could change his mind as the midterm elections near.

Musk had previously also accused the paper of publishing “deliberately false” stories, calling it a “discredit to journalism” and “the worst newspaper in the world.” 

“I wouldn't use that to line my cage for parrot droppings,” the billionaire said of the WSJ earlier this year.

Last month, Musk outlined a plan for the America Party to concentrate on Congress ahead of the 2026 midterms, writing that while “backing a candidate for president is not out of the question,” the party's “focus for the next 12 months is on the House and the Senate.”

Trump, meanwhile, has called Musk a “train wreck” and argued that third parties “have never succeeded in the US,” predicting that the billionaire's initiative would only create “disruption and chaos.”

Intergenerational child care is not an option for everyone, which is why some parents need help from government.Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press

Rosel Kim is a lawyer living in Toronto. 

Last summer, I found myself in a position that's become all too common in Canada: Despite signing up for daycare options early in my pregnancy, my maternity leave was winding down, and I still didn't have child care lined up for my 11-month-old daughter. 

Luckily, my partner and I were provided with a solution: my parents generously offered to take care of her. But I had my hesitations.

Growing up, my parents – especially my mom – fit the stereotype of the strict Asian immigrant parent that still endures today. My memories of my early years in Canada include arguments with them about sleepovers (not allowed) and my grades (rarely high enough). I worried that they'd be too strict or too cold with my daughter.

In the end, we took my parents up on their offer. But what surprised me was how they embraced taking care of my daughter: that is, with real tenderness.

Boomer knows best? Not so fast, say millennial parents

My daughter quickly formed a deep bond with them. Some of her first words were “halmi” and “halbi” – her version of halmoni and halabuhji, or grandmother and grandfather in Korean. My parents were attuned to – and even accommodated – her big toddler feelings, like when she got upset about dropping rice on the floor because she wanted to use the spoon all by herself. In effect, my mom and dad adopted “gentle parenting” – a style in which parents calmly meet children and their emotions where they are, and which I'm inundated by every time I open Instagram.

Meanwhile, I found myself struggling to be gentle with my daughter – and with myself. Every day felt like a new challenge as I had to adjust to her constant changes and tackle endless meals and appointments. I simply did not have time to learn all the things social media told me I had to know to be a “good parent” – and somehow, on top of that, I had to add work to the mix. Feeling out of control, I started projecting my stress in unhealthy ways – including by occasionally being short with my daughter. I had started off worried that my parents would be too harsh, and then found myself feeling like I was becoming them.

Rosel Kim

This was particularly disappointing to me because I was so familiar with the issues faced by working parents. One of the first cases I managed at a gender-equality organization was about the impact of caregiving on women workers. I knew how workplaces systematically devalued “female pattern employment” – that is, the way that many women have to work part-time because of their caregiving responsibilities. In many workplaces, the ideal worker was “unencumbered” – meaning, most often, a man who did not have such responsibilities and could therefore work full-time. And while many of today's parents make more money than their parents did, the rapidly increasing cost of living and education means that many feel that they can't ever provide adequately for their children.

Opinion: The art of letting go as our kids venture into adulthood

I understood all that before I became a parent. Yet here I was, struggling with the unhealthy expectations I had placed on myself to excel both at work and at home, and feeling disappointed when I fell short. Even I couldn't understand just how crushing the caregiving burden was, until I had to do it myself.

This is where parents need help from government. The Canada-Wide Early Learning Childcare (CWELCC) program has significantly eased the economic burden for parents – daycare rates for infants in Toronto went from about $100 per day to about $22 – but the uncertain future of CWELCC beyond 2026, combined with the soaring cost of living, is leaving many families stressed and stretched. Further, a promise to add 250,000 child care spots across the country by next year appears to be far from achieving its goal. 

I am fortunate that my parents could give us the gift of intergenerational child care – and that their gift has brought us closer together, too. The intimacy that grows from sharing meals and updates about my daughter every day has also led us to share more openly about ourselves. I now have a new appreciation for the struggles my mother went through as a working mom in South Korea – a very unusual thing to be, in the 1980s – and as a new immigrant parent who didn't have familial help. Watching my mom and dad become loving, generous grandparents has been an important reminder to me that we are all capable of evolving; they've inspired me by showing what is possible when you're allowed to be your full self while raising a child.

But intergenerational child care is not an option for everyone. And of course, it's different for retirees without professional commitments. And they're no longer facing the hardships of being new immigrants. They have the freedom to pursue caregiving with eagerness and an abundance mindset. 

Today's parents are expected to be everything, everywhere, all at once, a burden that fails to account for systemic shortcomings. We need to find a way to structurally support more women and gender-diverse workers to be their full selves – because right now, it remains too difficult to be a gentle parent in a society that does not treat parents gently.

FDA officials detected Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope, in shipping containers and a sample of shrimp from Indonesia

Walmart has recalled frozen, raw shrimp sold in 13 states because federal health officials say it could have potential radioactive contamination.

The US Food and Drug Administration asked Walmart to pull three lots of Great Value brand frozen shrimp from stores after federal officials detected Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope, in shipping containers and a sample of breaded shrimp imported from Indonesia.

The products could pose a “potential health concern” for people exposed to low levels of Cesium-137 over time, FDA officials said.

“If you have recently purchased raw frozen shrimp from Walmart that matches this description, throw it away,” FDA officials said in a statement.

The risk from the recalled shrimp is “quite low”, said Donald Schaffner, a food safety expert at Rutgers University.

Cesium-137 is a byproduct of nuclear reactions, including nuclear bombs, testing, reactor operations and accidents. It's widespread around the world, with trace amounts found in the environment, including soil, food and air.

The level detected in the frozen breaded shrimp was far lower than FDA intervention levels. However, the agency said that avoiding potentially contaminated products could reduce exposure to low-level radiation that could lead to health problems over time.

The FDA is investigating reports of Cesium-137 contamination in shipping containers and products processed by PT Bahari Makmur Sejati, doing business as BMS Foods of Indonesia. US Customs and Border Protection officials alerted FDA that they found Cesium-137 in shipping containers sent to US ports in Los Angeles, Houston, Miami and Savannah, Georgia.

FDA officials collected several product samples and detected contamination in one sample of frozen breaded shrimp. The shipping containers and products were denied entry into the US

However, the FDA then learned that Walmart had received potentially affected products imported after the first detection, from shipments that did not trigger contamination alerts.

Walmart immediately recalled the products, a company spokesperson said. They include Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp with lot codes 8005540-1, 8005538-1 and 8005539-1, all with best-by dates of 15 March 2027. The shrimp was sold in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia. Consumers should discard the products or return them to any Walmart store for refund.

THE HAGUE, August 20. /TASS/. Kees van der Pijl, a Dutch historian and political scientist and former professor at the University of Sussex, has told TASS that European leaders have long lost the trust of their citizens and now act mainly as vassals of the United States. Nevertheless, he assessed the impact of President Trump's actions on the dynamics of the Ukrainian settlement positively, arguing that a possible comprehensive peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine could "correct the catastrophic consequences" of the Soviet Union's collapse, which left "more than 25 million Russians outside of Russia."

On August 18, Trump hosted in Washington a meeting with Vladimir Zelensky and the leaders of several European states. Zelensky was accompanied to the White House by French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Trump stressed the day before that the White House would be hosting such a large number of European leaders for the first time in its history. The Trump-Zelensky one-on-one conversation lasted about an hour, after which the American president met with Zelensky and the European leaders together. Trump also spoke by telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin; according to Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov, the call lasted about 40 minutes.

India's state-owned refiners have resumed purchases of Russian oil after a brief pause triggered by U.S. tariffs, Bloomberg reported on Aug. 20.

The suspension followed a 25% tariff imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on Aug. 6 over India's continued imports of Russian oil. The tariff is expected to come into effect on Aug. 27 and follows Trump's decision to impose a separate 25% tariff on all imports from India that took effect on Aug. 1.

Despite the pressure, Indian Oil Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. bought several shipments of Russian Urals crude in recent days, with deliveries expected in September and October, according to Bloomberg. Earlier this month, the companies had suspended purchases for those months under U.S. pressure.

Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, India has emerged as one of Moscow's largest oil buyers. Imports of Russian crude have risen more than 20-fold to over 2 million barrels per day. 

The United States has accused India of exploiting the situation. 

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Aug. 19 called the practice "unacceptable." Washington has warned that continued purchases could lead to tariffs of up to 100% on Indian exports to the U.S.

China has also expanded its role as a leading buyer of Russian oil. 

Bloomberg reported on Aug. 19 that Beijing has ramped up purchases amid Trump's threats of tariffs, with imports of Urals crude from the Baltic and Black Sea doubling in August to nearly 75,000 barrels per day.

Trump had threatened penalties if Moscow did not agree to a ceasefire, giving Russia 10 days on July 29 to halt its war or face secondary tariffs. The deadline has since passed, but Washington has not yet imposed any additional measures.

U.S. officials have warned that countries like China could face tariffs of up to 100% on their exports to the U.S. if they continue buying Russian oil. 

Oil revenues account for roughly one-third of Russia's federal budget, making energy exports a vital source of funding for its war against Ukraine. 



News Editor

Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Based in Warsaw, he is pursuing studies in International Relations, focusing on European Studies. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor.

Poland's Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz confirmed that the object, which fell into a cornfield near the village of Osiny, was a Russian unmanned aerial vehicle. 

The Kyiv Independent spent a day with the 20th Separate UAV Regiment, also known as K-2, which specializes in ground robots, in northern Donetsk Oblast. We also spoke with the regiment's commander, Kyrylo Veres, about how these machines could shape the next phase of warfare in Ukraine, helping to reduce the risk to soldiers amid a growing manpower shortage.



European leaders have accelerated negotiations on security guarantees for Ukraine in recent weeks, responding to President Volodymyr Zelensky's request for binding assurances that Russia will not attack again if a ceasefire is reached. 

Ukrposhta, Ukraine's state-owned postal service, is closing its offices in the front-line city of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast due to the deteriorating security situation, company CEO Ihor Smelyansky announced on Aug. 20.



"Valerii Zaluzhnyi has stated his position more than once, and as far as I know, it has not changed: while the war continues, we need to work to preserve the country, not think about elections," Zaluzhnyi's aide  Oksana Torop said. 

"Not everyone may remember this, but in 1994, Ukraine already got assurances of territorial integrity from the U.S., Russia, and the U.K. In Budapest," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin "noted with satisfaction Turkey's assistance in hosting talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives in Istanbul," the Kremlin reported.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that "seriously discussing security issues without Russia is a road to nowhere."

Indian Oil Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. bought several shipments of Russian Urals crude in recent days, with deliveries expected in September and October.

"The call addressed the latest developments concerning the peace process between Ukraine and Russia," Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office reported.

After the attack, a family with three injured children — aged 5 months, 4 years, and 6 years — sought medical assistance, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. 

According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russian forces launched 93 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones, along with two Iskander-M ballistic missiles, overnight. 

"We expect that Ukraine will not launch new attacks on the pipeline, which is critical to our country's energy supply," Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said.

Julio Cesar Chavez Jr, the former middleweight boxing champion and son of one of Mexico's most revered fighters, has been deported from the United States over his alleged ties to the powerful Sinaloa cartel.

Chavez Jr, 39, has been imprisoned in Hermosillo in the northern state of Sonora, Mexico, and is facing charges of arms and drugs trafficking.

Prosecutors believe Chavez Jr acted as a henchman for the Sinaloa cartel – one of the world's most powerful crime syndicates that was designated a foreign terrorist organisation earlier this year.

An arrest warrant was issued in 2023 following a four-year-long investigation.

Chavez Jr was arrested last month by Immigration Customs Enforcement officers in Studio City, California, 10 miles north of Los Angeles, days after being beaten by Jake Paul, a social media influencer turned professional boxer, in an exhibition bout.

Ronald Johnson, the US ambassador to Mexico and former CIA officer, shared a photograph on social media of Chavez Jr being led away by armed officers from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Mr Johnson said Chavez Jr, a Mexican national, would “face charges under his country's justice system”.

“This action reflects the strong cooperation between our governments, showing that collaboration delivers results and advances the security of both nations,” he wrote in an accompanying statement to the photo.

Mexico's national arrest registry showed that the boxer was arrested at a checkpoint in the Mexican border city of Nogales at 11.53am local time and transferred to a federal institution in Sonora's capital of Hermosillo.

Chavez Jr was wearing a black hoodie and red trainers, it said.

Claudia Sheinbaum, the president of Mexico, confirmed news of his detainment at a press conference on Tuesday, commenting: “I understand he was deported. I don't know if it was yesterday or this morning, but we were informed that he was arriving in Mexico.”

The DHS has said that the warrant for Chavez Jr details his alleged involvement in “organised crime and trafficking firearms, ammunition and explosives”.

He was also said to have made “multiple fraudulent statements” on an application filed last year for lawful permanent resident status that was based on his marriage to a US citizen alleged to have family connections with the Sinaloa cartel.

In January last year, Chavez Jr was arrested in the Los Angeles area and charged with illegal possession of an assault rifle.

Chavez Jr has denied all the allegations.

He held the WBC middleweight title from 2011 to 2012 and is the son of Julio Cesar Chavez, the Hall of Fame fighter.

His career has been overshadowed by controversies, including a suspension after testing positive for a banned substance in 2009.

In 2012, he was convicted in a Los Angeles court of driving under the influence and sentenced to 13 days in jail.

Later that year, Chavez Jr tested positive for marijuana after fighting Sergio Martínez, the Argentinian two-weight division world champion, and received a nine-month suspension. He was also fined about £666,000 by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.

Russian oil supplies via the Druzhba pipeline to Hungary and Slovakia have resumed after being halted for a day following a Ukrainian drone strike, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Aug. 19.

"After last night's Ukrainian attack, oil supplies to Hungary via the Druzhba pipeline have been resumed in the last few minutes," Szijjarto wrote on Facebook. "We expect that Ukraine will not launch new attacks on the pipeline, which is critical to our country's energy supply."

Russian crude flows to Hungary and Slovakia through the Soviet-era pipeline were suspended on Aug. 18. Later in the day, Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces confirmed that drones had struck the Nikolskoye oil pumping station in Russia's Tambov Oblast, disrupting operations. 

The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world's largest, carries Russian oil through two main branches: the northern line toward northern Europe and the southern line to Central Europe.

Hungary and Slovakia are the only EU countries still buying Russian crude through the system. In July, they imported $232 million and $196 million worth of oil, respectively.

The pipeline also shut down flows in March after a Ukrainian attack on a different metering station. According to Reuters, Russia supplied 95,000 barrels of oil daily to Hungary via this route last year. 

Budapest, which imports most of its oil through Druzhba, has opposed EU attempts to fully halt Russian energy imports. 

Meanwhile, Ukraine has stepped up strikes on Russian oil infrastructure, targeting one of Moscow's most lucrative revenue streams for financing its war.

News Editor

Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Based in Warsaw, he is pursuing studies in International Relations, focusing on European Studies. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor.

Poland's Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz confirmed that the object, which fell into a cornfield near the village of Osiny, was a Russian unmanned aerial vehicle. 

The Kyiv Independent spent a day with the 20th Separate UAV Regiment, also known as K-2, which specializes in ground robots, in northern Donetsk Oblast. We also spoke with the regiment's commander, Kyrylo Veres, about how these machines could shape the next phase of warfare in Ukraine, helping to reduce the risk to soldiers amid a growing manpower shortage.



European leaders have accelerated negotiations on security guarantees for Ukraine in recent weeks, responding to President Volodymyr Zelensky's request for binding assurances that Russia will not attack again if a ceasefire is reached. 

Ukrposhta, Ukraine's state-owned postal service, is closing its offices in the front-line city of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast due to the deteriorating security situation, company CEO Ihor Smelyansky announced on Aug. 20.



"Valerii Zaluzhnyi has stated his position more than once, and as far as I know, it has not changed: while the war continues, we need to work to preserve the country, not think about elections," Zaluzhnyi's aide  Oksana Torop said. 

"Not everyone may remember this, but in 1994, Ukraine already got assurances of territorial integrity from the U.S., Russia, and the U.K. In Budapest," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin "noted with satisfaction Turkey's assistance in hosting talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives in Istanbul," the Kremlin reported.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that "seriously discussing security issues without Russia is a road to nowhere."

Indian Oil Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. bought several shipments of Russian Urals crude in recent days, with deliveries expected in September and October.

"The call addressed the latest developments concerning the peace process between Ukraine and Russia," Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office reported.

After the attack, a family with three injured children — aged 5 months, 4 years, and 6 years — sought medical assistance, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. 

According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russian forces launched 93 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones, along with two Iskander-M ballistic missiles, overnight. 

"We expect that Ukraine will not launch new attacks on the pipeline, which is critical to our country's energy supply," Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Aug. 19 that President Donald Trump has requested that the entire wall along the U.S.–Mexico border be painted black in order to deter illegal crossings.

Speaking to reporters in New Mexico, Noem said the border wall is being built tall and extended deep underground to prevent any breaches and that the metal would be painted black to make it even more difficult to climb.

The airline and flight attendants' union announced a tentative agreement early Tuesday as Air Canada is gradually returning to normal service.Christinne Muschi/The Canadian Press

Sergio Roldan and his family are planning to head home to Ottawa on an Air Canada AC-T flight Sunday after a trip to visit relatives in Europe left them facing cancellations, hefty bills and uncertain schedules.

With the Air Canada strike over and the airline gradually resuming operations, Mr. Roldan, his wife and two children – aged 4 and 6 – are in a period of what he describes as “controlled uncertainty” in Edinburgh.

While Mr. Roldan is encouraged that planes are returning to service, he said he still considers his flight scheduled for the weekend a gamble.

“Do we trust Air Canada? Do we take a leap of faith and book things ourselves? And that's going to be quite a prohibitive cost for us,” he said.

The 38-year-old and his family are among hundreds of thousands of passengers in Canada and around the world whose travel plans have been cancelled, delayed or clouded in uncertainty since flight attendants walked off the job on Saturday. The airline and the Canadian Union of Public Employees announced a tentative agreement early Tuesday and Air Canada is gradually returning to normal service.

The carrier said it could take more than a week to reboot its operations, including ushering its fleet out of storage largely in Toronto and Vancouver, and finding ways to staff its flights under the existing collective agreement. 

Mr. Roldan and his family have also been bounced back-and-forth between cancelled Air Canada and United Airlines flights. When Air Canada cancelled his flight, he said he was sent a link to book an alternative flight with United Airlines free of charge, though when he did that, he said he was billed $4,600. That United flight was subsequently cancelled, sending him back to Air Canada and his flight on Sunday, while wondering whether he's also on the hook for the cost of the United flight.

Air Canada troubles highlight competition, passenger protection issues, experts say

As Mr. Roldan waits, others within Canada have been able to board flights home. 

About two dozen campers who were part of a larger group that had been tenting at a campground in Squamish, B.C., flew out from Vancouver on Tuesday afternoon. But most of the group, about 126 Ukrainian scouts and their chaperones, remained behind.

The president of Plast Ukrainian Youth Association of Canada had penned a letter to Air Canada president and CEO Michael Rousseau on Saturday urging the airline to prioritize flights for the campers and their volunteers. 

That was accompanied by a “tireless” e-mail campaign from parents, said Lada Darewych, executive director of Plast's Toronto branch.

Ms. Darewych said that all of the children who have urgent reasons to return home, including one attending a funeral for a family member who died while the camper was away, were on two flights heading to Toronto. 

“But, I'm not breathing until we've got everybody in a seat and on their way home,” Ms. Darewych said. She's hopeful the remaining campers can leave Wednesday. 

Other Canadians have chosen to fly with other airlines.

Kelly Boileau, 35, is finally heading back to Vancouver with her husband and two sons, aged 2 and 6, after what was intended to be a week-long trip in Toronto turned into days of chaos.

They were originally scheduled to fly back on Saturday, the first day of the strike. But Ms. Boileau realized by Wednesday last week that their plans would be disrupted. She decided that if cutting their vacation short meant they could get back home safely, then so be it. But when she called Air Canada to catch an earlier plane, she was told that wasn't an option. None of the flights were cancelled then.

Come late Friday, however, the air carrier had changed its tune. “Now, they wanted to give us a refund, even though every other flight was at an astronomically higher price,” Ms. Boileau said. “And any option they were giving us for alternative flights were just these wild ideas of 42 hours of travelling with U.S. cities in between. I was definitely not going to make my little kids physically sick by going on that type of journey.” 

As the family stayed longer than expected with friends in Toronto, trying to find a flight for four, Ms. Boileau borrowed a computer to work remotely. Her husband, a restaurant manager, missed work. 

Eventually, Ms. Boileau connected with an Air Canada agent, who helped them with a direct flight – but with WestJet instead.

Ms. Boileau said she has lost all confidence in Air Canada. “We just don't know how to believe their operations are in order yet,” she said. 

“I wish they had communicated better with us. Going forward, I'll probably be thinking twice before booking with them ever again.”

Janet Naylor, 37, feels the same way. She runs a business with her husband, James Naylor, 45, and books their frequent work-related travel most often with Air Canada. When Mr. Naylor's trip last week from Calgary to Los Angeles was cancelled because of the strike, his wife found a solution with WestJet so he could make it to his meetings. 

“It's good news that the strike is seemingly ending, but unfortunately, it's just too late for us. We were stuck paying for two tickets,” Ms. Naylor said Tuesday.

She said she'd love to consider options beyond Air Canada next time.

“But we just don't have much choice when it comes to airlines in Canada, so what option do we have than booking with them again in the future?”

Air Canada's unionized flight attendants reached an agreement with the country's largest carrier on Tuesday, ending the first strike by its cabin crew in 40 years.

'The Big Weekend Show' discusses an ISIS suicide bomber reportedly killing churchgoers in Damascus, Syria.

The U.S. military carried out a raid in northern Syria on Tuesday, killing a senior ISIS figure who had been poised to become the group's next leader in the country, a U.S. official told Fox News.

A key ISIS financial official was also killed in the operation, the official said, noting that both men had been actively planning attacks in Syria and Iraq. No U.S. forces were injured.

On the background of a U.S. official to Fox News, the raid was described as a "successful operation" targeting a senior ISIS member assessed to be a strong candidate to assume the role of ISIS Syria Emir, a position that would have posed a direct threat to U.S. and Coalition forces as well as the new Syrian government.

No civilians were injured or killed, and there were no injuries to U.S. or Coalition forces.

The operation is part of continued U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the region following ISIS's territorial defeat in Syria and Iraq in 2019.

"We will continue to pursue ISIS terrorists with unwavering determination throughout the region," the official added, stressing that the U.S. and its partners remain committed to ensuring the lasting defeat of ISIS and the protection of the homeland.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge who presided over the sex trafficking case against financier Jeffrey Epstein has joined two other judges in rejecting the government's request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the decades-long sexual abuse suffered by girls and young women who fell into his orbit.

The ruling Wednesday by Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan came after the judge presiding over the case against British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend, also turned down the government's request.

Barring reversal on appeal, Berman's decision forecloses the possibility of grand jury testimony being released now that three judges have reached the same conclusion. A federal judge in Florida declined to release grand jury documents from an investigation there in 2005 and 2007.

The rulings are a collective repudiation of the Justice Department's effort to divert attention away from its stated refusal to release a massive trove of records in its possession and make clear that the still-sealed court documents contain none of the answers likely to satisfy the immense public interest in the case.

President Donald Trump had called for the release of transcripts amid rumors and criticism about his long-ago involvement with Epstein. During last year's presidential campaign, Trump promised to release files related to Epstein, but he was met with criticism — including from many of his own supporters — when the small number of records released by his Justice Department lacked new revelations.

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on Wednesday.

Berman said a “significant and compelling reason” to reject the government's request was that the information contained in the Epstein grand jury transcripts “pales in comparison to the Epstein investigative information and materials in the hands of the Department of Justice.”




He wrote that the government's 100,000 pages of Epstein files and materials “dwarf the 70 odd pages of Epstein grand jury materials.”

“The Government is the logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein Files,” Berman wrote in an apparent reference to the Justice Department's refusal to release additional records on its own while simultaneously moving to unseal grand jury transcripts.

“By comparison,” Berman added, “the instant grand jury motion appears to be a ‘diversion' from the breadth and scope of the Epstein files in the Government's possession. The grand jury testimony is merely a hearsay snippet of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged conduct.”

The Justice Department had informed Berman that the only witness to testify before the Epstein grand jury was an FBI agent who, the judge noted, “had no direct knowledge of the facts of the case and whose testimony was mostly hearsay.” 

The agent testified over two days, on June 18, 2019, and July 2, 2019. The rest of the grand jury presentation consisted of a PowerPoint slideshow shown during the June 18 session and a call log shown during the July 2 session, which ended with grand jurors voting to indict Epstein. Both of those will also remain sealed, Berman ruled.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence after her conviction on sex trafficking charges for helping Epstein sexually abuse girls and young women. She was recently transferred from a prison in Florida to a prison camp in Texas. Epstein died in jail awaiting trial.

Maxwell's case has been the subject of heightened public focus since an outcry over the Justice Department's statement last month saying that it would not be releasing any additional documents from the Epstein sex trafficking investigation. The decision infuriated online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and elements of Trump's base who had hoped to see proof of a government cover-up.

Since then, officials in Trump's Republican administration have tried to cast themselves as promoting transparency in the case, including by requesting from courts the unsealing of grand jury transcripts.

Meanwhile, Maxwell was interviewed at a Florida courthouse weeks ago by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and the House Oversight Committee had also said that it wanted to speak with Maxwell. Her lawyers said they would be open to an interview but only if the panel were to ensure immunity from prosecution.

In a letter to Maxwell's lawyers, Rep. James Comer, the committee chair, wrote that the committee was willing to delay the deposition until after the resolution of Maxwell's appeal to the Supreme Court. That appeal is expected to be resolved in late September.

Comer wrote that while Maxwell's testimony was “vital” to the Republican-led investigation into Epstein, the committee would not provide immunity or any questions in advance of her testimony, as was requested by her team.

Vice President JD Vance greeted National Guard and police at Union Station in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday as protesters could be heard shouting in the background.

A throng of protesters chanted slogans as Vice President JD Vance thanked National Guard and police at Union Station in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday.

Vance praised law enforcement and said that violent crime had dropped by 35% in the nine days since President Donald Trump ordered the crackdown. The vice president appeared alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, each of whom remarked on the shouting protesters.

Over the past several years, Vance described Union Station as having vagrants, drug addicts, "chronically homeless" people and the mentally ill threatening violence and attacking families in the public transportation hub. 

"I think you hear these guys outside here screaming at us. Of course, these are a bunch of crazy protesters. But I'll tell you, a couple of years ago, when I brought my kids here, they were screamed at by violent vagrants. And it scared the hell out of my kids," Vance said. 

"I know that we've traded now, some violent, crazy people who are screaming at kids with a few crazy liberals who are screaming at the vice president. But I think that's a very worthwhile trade to make, because we want our people to be able to enjoy our beautiful cities," Vance continued. "This is your city. You should feel free to come and visit here." 

EXPERT FLIPS SCRIPT ON DEMS PUSHING 'CHERRY-PICKED' CRIME STATS TO RESIST TRUMP'S DC CRACKDOWN

Vance also clashed with a reporter who asked if he had evidence of Washington's crime problem. 

"You just have to look around – obviously D.C. has a terrible crime problem," he said, pointing to how Department of Justice and FBI statistics "back it up." 

"Just talk to a resident of this city, this beautiful, great American city," Vance said. "We hear these people outside screaming ‘Free D.C.' Let's free D.C. from lawlessness."

"It is kind of bizarre we have a bunch of old, primarily White people who are out there protesting the policies that keep people safe when they have never felt danger in their entire lives," the vice president added. 

Miller was even more blunt, describing many of the protesters as "elderly" and "over 90 years old."

"We're not going to let communists destroy a great American city, let alone the nation's capital," Miller said, deriding the protesters as "stupid White hippies."

"For too long, 99% of this city has been terrorized by 1% of this city," Miller said. "And the voices that you hear out there, these crazy communists, they have no connection to the city. They have no families. They weren't raised in this city. They have no one that they're sending to school in this city. They have no jobs in this city. They have no connections to this community at all. They're the ones who've been advocating for the 1%. The criminals, the killers, the rapists, the drug dealers."

The Trump administration's crackdown on violent crime in D.C. has already netted hundreds of arrests. The show of force has swept up gang members, robbery suspects and immigration violators. On Friday alone, 52 people were arrested, including 28 illegal immigrants, while three guns were seized.

Federal teams have also cleared dozens of homeless encampments, and officials said those removals were carried out without confrontations or arrests.

The operation began quietly on Aug. 7 with the launch of the "Making D.C. Safe and Beautiful" task force created by Trump in March through an executive order.

He escalated it on Aug. 11 by temporarily seizing federal control of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) under emergency powers in the Home Rule Act, the first such move in U.S. history.

Bringing prominent White House support to the streets of Washington, Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday visited with National Guard troops at the city's main train station as protesters chanted “free D.C.” — the latest tense interlude from President Donald Trump's crackdown in the nation's capital.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Bringing prominent White House support to the streets of Washington, Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday visited with National Guard troops at the city's main train station as protesters chanted “free D.C.” — the latest tense interlude from President Donald Trump's crackdown in the nation's capital. “We brought some law and order back,” the vice president asserted.

“We appreciate everything you're doing,” Vance said as he presented burgers to the troops. Citing the protesters whose shouts echoed through the station, Vance said “they appear to hate the idea that Americans can enjoy their communities.”

The appearance, which also included White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, was a striking scene that illustrated the Republican administration's intense focus on the situation in Washington and its willingness to promote an initiative that has polarized the Democratic-led city. 

An estimated 1,900 troops are being deployed in D.C. More than half are coming from Republican-led states. Besides Union Station, they've mostly been spotted around downtown areas, including the National Mall and metro stops.

The intersection of life in the city and a military presence produced another striking scene early Wednesday when an armored vehicle collided with a civilian car less than a mile from the U.S. Capitol. One person was trapped inside the car after the accident and had to be extricated by emergency responders, according to D.C. fire department spokesman Vito Maggiolo. The person was transported to a hospital with minor injuries. 

It was not immediately clear what caused the crash. A video posted online showed the aftermath of the collision, with a tan-colored armored vehicle twice the height of the civilian car with a crushed side. 

“You come to our city and this is what you do? Seriously?” a woman yelled at the troops in the video. 

Attorney General Pam Bondi said more than 550 people have been arrested so far, and the U.S. Marshals are offering $500 rewards for information leading to additional arrests. “Together, we will make DC safe again!” Bondi wrote on social media.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, trying to balance the constituency that elected her and the reality in front of her, acknowledged the changing situation in the city as she attended a back-to-school event with teachers and staff. 

“This is not the same time, is it, that we experienced in opening school last year,” she said. Bowser said she would worry about the politics and told school employees that “your job is to love on the kids, teach them and make sure that they are prepared and to trust that I'm going to do the right thing for all of us.”

Despite the militarized backdrop, Bowser said it's important that children “have joy when they approach this school year.” Public schools around Washington reconvene Monday for the fall semester. 

The skewer-everyone cartoon TV show “ South Park,” which has leaned into near-real-time satire in recent years, this week made the federal crackdown fodder for a new episode. A 20-second promo released by Comedy Central depicts the character “Towelie” — a walking towel — riding in a bus past the U.S. Supreme Court building and White House, where armed troops are patrolling. A tank rolls by in front of the White House.

“This seems like a perfect place for a towel,” the character says upon disembarking the bus.

“South Park” creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone recently signed a reported $1.5 billion, five-year deal with Paramount for new episodes and streaming rights to their series, which began its 27th season this summer.

The season premiere mocked the president's body in a raunchy manner and depicted him sharing a bed with Satan.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem discusses President Donald Trump's immigration policy on ‘America Reports.'

Harjinder Singh's deadly wreck on Florida's Turnpike exposes not just the illegal immigration crisis but systemic negligence — or worse — in transportation-related areas, Florida Rep. Brian Mast told Fox News Digital in a Wednesday interview.

Mast lives only 10 minutes from where Singh allegedly made anunlawful U-turn on Florida's Turnpike and killed three people whose vehicle became wedged under his rig – after he illegally used a median crossover meant for emergency vehicles.

The interview was held as Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins and other officials were in-flight to California to extradite Singh, an illegal immigrant, to face charges for the incident in Mast's St. Lucie County district.

Mast said Singh's case undercuts Democrats' claims that the Trump administration targeted only "violent criminals" rather than immigrants working regular jobs and paying taxes.

"This is just one example of saying this is why it matters if you're here illegally you're going back to your country of origin — whether you're driving a truck or anything else," Mast said.

As a member of the House Transportation Committee, Mast said he has heard complaints from municipal officials who run the local DMVs who tell him the problem of illegal immigrants getting CDLs in large numbers is "systemic."

Illegal immigrants who, at times, may be English-illiterate, have been coached to recite specific sentences and identify specific letters on ophthalmologic to essentially get by in their new jobs.

"Now it's coming out, you know, [Singh] maybe knew, you know, one or two things in English that he was supposed to know and didn't know the rest. They clearly don't know [what they need to]. Somehow, the school passes them," he said.

TRUMP ADMIN SLAMS ACLU FOR COMPARING ICE CENTER TO JAPANESE INTERNMENT CAMP: ‘DERANGED AND LAZY'

Singh, who illegally immigrated in 2018 from India, obtained a CDL in California and was initially rejected by the first Trump administration for a work authorization.

The case shows the need for an all-of-the-above approach to enforcing immigration law, said Mast, who previously likened the deluge of illegal immigrants crossing out of Mexico during the Biden administration to the proportion of Allies storming Normandy on D-Day.

Singh's alleged actions also show the difference between state policies of Florida and California, he said.

"He kills three people – and what is his first decision? To go back to California – this individual, knowing that there's some serious s— about to roll downhill his way, says ‘I'm going to be safer and more protected … in California than I am in Florida.

"And as a result, he ‘deported' himself to California," Mast said.

UNION BOSS COMPARES ICE TO AL PACINO MOBSTER AS MORE DEMS PILE ON IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

Another weakness in the transportation and immigration infrastructure was also exposed by Singh's deadly crash, Mast said.

He ruminated on how many state weigh stations Singh had to drive through on his way from California to Florida. In that regard, he asked how much focus is put on the individual driver versus the typical criteria of load tonnage and vehicular roadworthiness.

With an adjustment to also focus on the competency of the drivers, weigh stations could play a bigger role in keeping dangerous people like illiterate illegal immigrants off highways, he said.

"It's the perfect example as to why we need to be dealing with all illegals, whether they're in the trades or whether they are historic violent offenders. We need to look at; are our highway weigh stations putting as much focus on the individual driving the truck as they are the load on the truck?"

Florida transportation officials were equally outraged at the situation.

"The actions taken by the defendant while operating a commercial tractor-trailer are both shocking and criminal," Florida Department of Highway Safety & Motor Vehicles Executive Director Dave Kerner said in a statement.

"Three people lost their lives as a result of [Singh's] recklessness, and countless friends and family members will experience the pain of their loss forever. Harjinder Singh is in custody on state vehicular homicide charges and immigration violations. He will no longer be able to damage and destroy the lives of Floridians and visitors."

Kerner said FHP remains committed to enforcing both state and federal laws against those posing a danger to the public.

Vice President JD Vance spoke to National Guard troops in Washington who have been dispatched to address crime in the nation's capital.

Vice President JD Vance touted the progress National Guard troops have made tackling crime in Washington the past nine days — and suggested that their mission may extend past 30 days. 

President Donald Trump unveiled plans Aug. 11 to deploy troops from the D.C. National Guard and to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department to tackle crime in Washington. And, so far, those efforts are paying off, according to Vance. 

"We are seeing really substantial effects because these guys are busting their a--," Vance said while meeting with National Guard troops at Washington's Union Station Wednesday.

"Right here in Union Station, you have vagrants, you have drug addicts, you have the chronically homeless, you have the mentally ill who harass, who threatened violence, who attacked families," Vance said. "And they've done it for far too long. This should be a monument to American greatness." 

The 1973 Home Rule Act permits a temporary federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department for emergency situations up to 30 days. However, after that time frame, Congress must intervene and sign off on any extensions. No such limitations exist for D.C. National Guard troops, however, in the Home Rule Act. 

On Aug. 13, Trump said that the administration's goal was to ramp down crime quickly, but signaled that "we're going to want extensions." 

When asked if extensions were on the table, Vance said that Trump would reevaluate, depending on how much progress occurs in the next several weeks.

"We'll ultimately let the president of the United States determine where we are after 30 days of this, of this emergency order. I think that we're going to make a lot of progress over the next 20 days," Vance said. "I think we're nine days into this thing. But if the president of the United States thinks that he has to extend his order to ensure that people have access to public safety, then that's exactly what he'll do. If he thinks he doesn't have to do that, obviously we'll make that determination." 

Meanwhile, Washington officials filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to federalize local police Friday.

"By illegally declaring a takeover of MPD, the Administration is abusing its temporary, limited authority under the law," Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb wrote in a Friday X post. "This is the gravest threat to Home Rule DC has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it."

In addition to the DC National Guard, National Guard troops from Ohio, West Virginia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee are participating in the Trump administration's crackdown in Washington, and approximately 1,300 have already arrived in the nation's capital.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday called on Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to resign after a member of his administration accused Cook of committing mortgage fraud, the latest example of the Trump administration's efforts to gain control over the central bank.

Bill Pulte, director of the agency that oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, urged the Justice Department to investigate Cook, who was appointed to the Fed's governing board by former president Joe Biden in 2022. She was reappointed the following year to a term that lasts until 2038, the longest remaining term among the seven governors. 




Pulte, in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, alleged that Cook claimed two homes as her principal residences in 2021 to fraudulently obtain better mortgage lending terms. On June 18 of that year she purchased a home in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and then two weeks later bought a condo in Atlanta, Georgia, the letter said. Before joining the Fed, Cook taught at Michigan State University.

Pulte also charged that Cook has listed her condo in Atlanta, Georgia, for rent. Mortgages for homes used as principal residences typically carry lower interest rates than properties that are purchased to rent, the letter said. 

The Federal Reserve declined to comment on the accusation. A Justice Department spokesperson also declined to comment. 




The allegation represents another front in the Trump administration's attack on the Fed, which has yet to cut its key interest rate as Trump has demanded. If Cook were to step down, then the White House could nominate a replacement. And Trump has said he would only appoint people who would support lower rates.

Just last month, Trump blasted Powell for the ballooning cost of the renovation of two of the Fed's headquarters buildings, even suggesting that the run-up in costs could constitute a firing offense. He backed off his threats to fire Powell after receiving a tour of the project.

Pulte also suggested that Cook's alleged actions could constitute a fireable offense. Fed officials are protected by law from being removed by a president, except “for cause,” which is generally seen as some kind of malfeasance or dereliction of duty. 

Trump will be able to replace Chair Jerome Powell in May 2026, when Powell's term expires. Yet 12 members of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee have a vote on whether to raise or lower interest rates, so even replacing the Chair doesn't guarantee that Fed policy will shift the way Trump wants. 

But the more members of the Fed's governing board that Trump can appoint, the more control he will be able to assert over the Fed, which has long been considered independent from day-to-day politics. 

All seven members of the Fed's governing board are able to vote on rate decisions. The other five voters include the president of the Fed's New York branch and a rotating group of four of the presidents of the Fed's other 11 regional branches. 

Trump appointed two members of the Fed's board in his first term, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. Both dissented July 30 from the central bank's decision to keep its rate unchanged, in favor of a rate cut. 

Another Fed governor, Adriana Kugler, stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1, and Trump has nominated one of his economic advisers, Stephen Miran, to fill out the remainder of her term until January.

If Trump is able to replace Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's board, as well as Kugler, that would give him a clear majority on the board of governors. If Powell leaves the board when his term as chair ends next May, then Trump will be able to fill a fifth spot. However, Powell could stay on the board until early 2028 after finishing his term as chair. 

The presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks are selected by the boards of directors of those banks, but are subject to the approval of the Fed's board of governors. The terms of all 12 of the regional Fed presidents end next February. 

Trump has for months demanded that the Federal Reserve reduce the short-term interest rate it controls, which currently stands at about 4.3%. He has also repeatedly insulted Powell, who has said that the Fed would like to see more evidence of how the economy evolves in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs before making any moves. Powell has also said the duties threaten to raise inflation and slow growth. 

Trump says that a lower rate would reduce the government's borrowing costs on $37 trillion in debt and boost the housing market by reducing mortgage rates. Yet mortgage borrowing costs and other interest rates, including many of the ones the government pays, do not always follow the Fed's rate decisions. 

The Trump administration has made similar claims of mortgage fraud against Democrats that Trump has attacked, including California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives on Wednesday kicked off a heated debate over a new congressional map creating five new potential GOP seats that is expected to pass the chamber later in the day as part of a growing national redistricting battle.

The plan is the result of prodding by President Donald Trump, eager to stave off a midterm defeat that would deprive his party of control of the House of Representatives. Texas Democratic lawmakers delayed a vote for 15 days by leaving the state in protest, depriving the House of enough members to do business.

State Rep. Todd Hunter, who wrote the legislation formally creating the new map, noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed politicians to redraw districts for nakedly partisan purposes. “The underlying goal of this plan is straight forward: improve Republican political performance,” Hunter, a Republican, said as debate began.

Democrats responded that that was counter to the country's values. “In a democracy, people choose their representatives,” said State Rep. Chris Turner, a Democrat. “This bill flips that on its head and lets politicians in Washington DC choose their voters.”

The Texas State Senate, also controlled by Republicans, needs to also pass the map and GOP Gov. Greg Abbott must sign them before they become official. The House debate was expected to be the lengthiest and greatest obstacle to the Republican push, but both parties expected the legislation to ultimately pass given the GOP's significant majority in the chamber.

Democrats said they're preparing to challenge the new map in court. 




Some House Democrats returned from their flight on Monday, only to be assigned round-the-clock police escorts to ensure their attendance at Wednesday's session. Seven who refused were confined to the House floor, where they protested on a livestream Tuesday night, led by Rep. Nicole Collier, who represents a minority-majority district in Fort Worth. Her staff removed a pillow, blanket and bag of personal effects early Wednesday.

As lawmakers trickled into the chamber, several Democrats gave Collier a hug, said “Thank you,” and took photos with her. In a social media post Tuesday night, Collier put a call from 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris on her cellphone's speaker. Harris told Collier that, “We are all in that room with you.”

House Speaker Dustin Burrows announced as debate started that doors to the chamber were locked and any member leaving was required to have a permission slip before exting.

Furious national Democrats have vowed payback for the Texas map, with California's Legislature poised to approve new maps adding more Democratic-friendly seats later this week. The map would still need to be approved by that state's voters in November.

Normally, states redraw maps once a decade with new census figures. But Trump is lobbying other conservative-controlled states like Indiana and Missouri to also try to squeeze new GOP-friendly seats out of their maps as his party prepares for a difficult midterm election next year.

As House session was about to begin, about two dozen demonstrators supporting Democrats sang “Fighting for Democracy, we shall not be moved” outside the chamber. GOP House Speaker Dustin Burrows announced that the public gallery will be cleared if there are disruptions. The public gallery was mostly empty as the session was gaveled in.

But the 100 members required to do business were present. About 200 people have gathered in the Capitol's rotunda for a rally supporting Democrats, holding signs saying “End Gerrymandering — Save Democracy,” “Defend the Constitution” and “Fascism is here.”

Texas Democrats spent the day before the vote continuing to draw attention to the extraordinary lengths the Republicans who run the Legislature were going to ensure it takes place. 

Collier started it when she refused to sign what Democrats called the “permission slip” required by Burrows to leave the House chamber, a half-page form allowing Department of Public Safety troopers to follow them. Collier spent Monday night and Tuesday on the House floor, where she set up a livestream while her Democratic colleagues outside had plainclothes officers following them to their offices and homes.

Dallas-area Rep. Linda Garcia said she drove three hours home from Austin with an officer following her. When she went grocery shopping, he went down every aisle with her, pretending to shop, she said. As she spoke to The Associated Press by phone, two unmarked cars with officers inside were parked outside her home.

“It's a weird feeling,” she said. “The only way to explain the entire process is: It's like I'm in a movie.”

Dallas-area Rep. Cassandra Garcia Hernandez joined the protest inside the House chamber and called it a “slumber party for democracy,” and she said Democrats were holding strategy sessions on the floor.

“We are not criminals,” Houston Rep. Penny Morales Shaw said before joining Collier, too. 

Collier said having officers shadow her was an attack on her dignity and an attempt to control her movements.

Burrows brushed off Collier's protest, saying he was focused on important issues, such as providing property tax relief and responding to last month's deadly floods. His statement Tuesday morning did not mention redistricting, and his office did not immediately respond to other Democrats joining Collier.

“Rep. Collier's choice to stay and not sign the permission slip is well within her rights under the House Rules,” Burrows said. 

Under those rules, until Wednesday's vote, the chamber's doors were locked, and no member could leave “without the written permission of the speaker.” 

Republicans issued civil arrest warrants to bring the Democrats back after they left the state Aug. 3, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott asked the state Supreme Court to oust Wu and several other Democrats from office. The lawmakers also face a fine of $500 for every day they were absent. 

Democrats outside the Capitol reported different levels of monitoring and some said the officers watching them were friendly. But Austin Rep. Sheryl Cole said in a social media post that when she went on her morning walk Tuesday, the officer following her lost her on the trail, got angry and threatened to arrest her.

Garcia said the officer who tailed her home also came in the grocery store when she went shopping with her 9-year-old son.

“I would imagine that this is the way it feels when you're potentially shoplifting and someone is assessing whether you're going to steal,” she said.

Passengers on a flight from St. Louis to Seattle got an unexpected pick-me-up when jazz saxophonist Dave Koz and bandmates held an impromptu jam session in the aisle while the plane was stuck on the tarmac hundreds of miles from their final destination.

It happened Aug. 11, when Koz and fellow musicians on the Dave Koz & Friends Summer Horns Tour were headed to Seattle for two days of shows. What was supposed to be a direct flight was beset by delays, including having to divert to Boise, Idaho, after flight crew members timed out and needed to be relieved and the plane encountered a mechanical issue, Koz said Tuesday.

This wasn't the first delay the band experienced since its tour started around mid-July, and it even had to cancel two shows because of travel-related issues, Koz said. But the delay last week was particularly deflating not just for the musicians but for everyone on the plane.

“You could just feel the energy. Everybody was so frustrated,” Koz said.

AP correspondent Ed Donahue reports on a musical diversion for passengers on a delayed flight.

A flight attendant who saw the musicians bring their instruments on board asked if they'd be willing to play a song while they were stuck in Boise.

A video of them performing Stevie Wonder's “You Haven't Done Nothin'” — the closer to their show — went viral on social media. It shows Koz and fellow saxophone player Marcus Anderson grooving in the aisle with other horn players behind them and Jeff Bradshaw on trombone getting creative to play the large instrument between seats.

Passengers are seen smiling and swaying in their seats, with some recording the performance on their phones.




Anderson said it felt good to lift spirits, though Koz admitted being nervous that some passengers might not like “horns playing in people's ears.”

Anderson likened the feeling afterward to that of a great workout at the gym. The musicians never thought about the possibility of going viral, he said. “It was just doing something good for the people.”

They performed just the one song, but they knew that was enough.

“It just was right, and it brought everybody together in a way that was very special,” Koz said. “I'll remember that moment for the rest of my life.”

The Trump administration is turning its attention to immigrants who falsely claim to be citizens so that they can seize on key American benefits such as voting, Social Security checks, and even passports.

In its latest policy update, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is aligning its vetting process with a 2019 court decision that led to the deportation of a Chinese man who fraudulently bought a proof of citizenship document so he could get a U.S. passport.

The update comes a day after USCIS changed other guidance in its policy manual to bar immigration benefits, such as work documents and citizenship, to those pushing anti-American sentiments. The agency is also requiring those it vets to have high “moral character.”

While the main focus of the changes being announced on Wednesday is on immigrants hopeful of upgrading their citizenship status, such as students and tourists, the update could have far-reaching implications. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that millions of illegal immigrants have engaged in identity theft and document fraud to claim citizenship benefits.

“USCIS is restoring robust screening and vetting processes to detect aliens seeking to defraud or abuse the immigration system, including aliens who make false claims to U.S. citizenship,” said spokesman Matthew Tragesser in previewing the change to Washington Secrets.

“USCIS is actively increasing public awareness among aliens and the public about the consequences of committing immigration fraud. Aliens who use false information or deceitful practices to unfairly obtain immigration advantages will face serious consequences,” he added.

The policy manual is used by immigration adjudicators in determining a migrant's status. The administration's goal in making the update is to provide clear guidance that if a migrant has lied about his citizenship status in the past or engaged in identity fraud then they can be barred from receiving citizenship benefits.

What's more, said an official, they could face punishments ranging from fines to deportation and even a lifetime ban from entering the United States.

A big part of today's action is cracking down on voter fraud. During the Biden administration, millions of migrants entered the country legally and illegally and some critics have claimed that many have tried to vote.

“This policy manual update change addresses aliens posing as U.S. citizens and attempting to obtain benefits like the right to vote or employment eligibility. There are a whole host of benefits granted to our citizens that definitely shouldn't be granted to those pretending to be them,” said an official.

The policy update does provide adjudicators with the flexibility to use some discretion in determining if a migrant meant to fraudulently claim citizenship to gain benefits. Age and mental capacity will now be included in the decision factors.

Multiple members of California Common Cause's advisory board have resigned as the nonpartisan group, historically critical of partisan gerrymandering, tackles its conflicting response to the national redistricting battle.

Last week, the national chapter of the group reversed its long-held position and backed California's push to redraw its congressional districts. The group described it as a “counterbalance measure” to President Donald Trump's public call for Texas and other red states to redraw maps to secure additional House seats before the 2026 midterm elections.

While the total number of departures on California's advisory board is not known, Common Cause President and CEO Virginia Kase Solomón told Politico's Playbook that members resigned “after expressing disagreement with the fairness criteria” the organization's national board created as guardrails around the kinds of mid-decade redistricting California is pursuing.

“Their perspectives have been valuable, and we are grateful for their service,” Solomón said.

Two weeks ago, the organization had pop-up fundraising appeals on its website that slammed Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) for “attempting to copy the GOP's playbook to boost his profile.” A July 24 newsletter from the group also called the actions of Texas Republicans and Newsom “wrong” and said “all of it is anti-democratic.”

That position changed last week when the group posted on its website that it would not oppose Newsom's efforts.

“In the current mid-decade redistricting battle, we recognize that President Trump and Republican leaders are pursuing a calculated, asymmetric strategy to redraw districts mid-decade in states like Texas, to lock in unaccountable power and silence voters,” the group posted on its website last Tuesday. “This is not an isolated political tactic; it is part of a broader march toward authoritarianism, dismantling people-powered democracy, and stripping away the people's ability to have a political voice and say in how they are governed.”

The group said while it would not endorse partisan gerrymandering “even when its motive is to offset more extreme gerrymandering by a different party,” it added that a “blanket condemnation in this moment would amount to a call for unilateral political disarmament in the face of authoritarian efforts to undermine fair representation and people-powered democracy.”

COMMON CAUSE CHANGES TUNE ON CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING FIGHT

Common Cause said it was establishing six-point fairness criteria by which it would assess states' maps. They include proportionality, public participation, racial equity, federal reform, endorsement of independent redistricting, and time limits, meaning any new maps must expire after the 2030 census and be replaced through a regular decennial redistricting process.

Common Cause California did not return a request by the Washington Examiner for comment.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday called on Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to resign after a member of his administration accused Cook of committing mortgage fraud, the latest example of the Trump administration's efforts to gain control over the central bank.

Bill Pulte, director of the agency that oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, urged the Justice Department to investigate Cook, who was appointed to the Fed's governing board by former president Joe Biden in 2022. She was reappointed the following year to a term that lasts until 2038, the longest remaining term among the seven governors. 

Pulte, in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, alleged that Cook claimed two homes as her principal residences in 2021 to fraudulently obtain better mortgage lending terms. On June 18 of that year she purchased a home in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and then two weeks later bought a condo in Atlanta, Georgia, the letter said. 

Pulte also charged that Cook has listed her condo in Atlanta, Georgia, for rent. Mortgages for homes used as principal residences typically carry lower interest rates than properties that are purchased to rent, the letter said. 

The Federal Reserve declined to comment on the accusation. A Justice Department spokesperson also declined to comment. 

The allegation represents another front in the Trump administration's attack on the Fed, which has yet to cut its key interest rate as Trump has demanded. If Cook were to step down, then the White House could nominate a replacement. And Trump has said he would only appoint people who would support lower rates.




The more members of the Fed's governing board that Trump can appoint, the more control he will be able to assert over the Fed, which has long been considered independent from day-to-day politics. 

Trump will be able to replace Chair Jerome Powell in May 2026, when Powell's term expires. Yet 12 members of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee have a vote on whether to raise or lower interest rates, so even replacing the Chair doesn't guarantee that Fed policy will shift the way Trump wants. 

Yet appointing more board members would give Trump more power over the institution. All seven members of the Fed's governing board are able to vote on rate decisions. The other five voters include the president of the Fed's New York branch and a rotating group of four of the presidents of the Fed's other 11 regional branches. 

Trump appointed two members of the Fed's board in his first term, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. Both dissented July 30 from the central bank's decision to keep its rate unchanged, in favor of a rate cut. 

Another Fed governor, Adriana Kugler, stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1, and Trump has appointed one of his economic advisers, Stephen Miran, to fill out the remainder of her term until January. 

If Trump is able to replace Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's board, as well as Kugler, that would give him a clear majority on the board of governors. If Powell leaves the board when his term as chair ends next May, then Trump will be able to fill a fifth spot. However, Powell could stay on the board until early 2028 after finishing his term as chair. 

The presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks are selected by the boards of directors of those banks, but are subject to the approval of the Fed's board of governors. The terms of all 12 of the regional Fed presidents end next February. 

Trump has for months demanded that the Federal Reserve reduce the short-term interest rate it controls, which currently stands at about 4.3%. He has also repeatedly insulted Powell, who has said that the Fed would like to see more evidence of how the economy evolves in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs before making any moves. Powell has also said the duties threaten to raise inflation and slow growth. 

Trump says that a lower rate would reduce the government's borrowing costs on $37 trillion in debt and boost the housing market by reducing mortgage rates. Yet mortgage borrowing costs do not always follow the Fed's rate decisions. 

The Trump administration has made similar claims of mortgage fraud against Democrats that Trump has attacked, including California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.

A Yosemite National Park ranger was fired after hanging a pride flag from El Capitan while some park visitors could face prosecution under protest restrictions that have been tightened under President Donald Trump.

Shannon “SJ” Joslin, a ranger and biologist who studies bats, said they hung a 66-foot wide transgender pride flag on the famous climbing wall that looms over the California park's main thoroughfare for about two hours on May 20 before taking it down voluntarily. A termination letter they received last week accused Joslin of “failing to demonstrate acceptable conduct” in their capacity as a biologist and cited the May incident.

“I was really hurting because there were a lot of policies coming from the current administration that target trans people, and I'm nonbinary,” Joslin, 35, told The Associated Press, adding that hanging the flag was their way of saying, “We're all safe in national parks.”

Joslin said their firing sends the opposite message: “If you're a federal worker and you have any kind of identity that doesn't agree with this current administration, then you must be silent, or you will be eliminated.”

Park officials on Tuesday said they were working with the U.S. Justice Department to pursue visitors and workers who violated restrictions on demonstrations at the park that had more than 4 million visitors last year.

The agencies “are pursuing administrative action against several Yosemite National Park employees and possible criminal charges against several park visitors who are alleged to have violated federal laws and regulations related to demonstrations,” National Park Service spokesperson Rachel Pawlitz said.




Joslin said a group of seven climbers including two other park rangers hung the flag. The other rangers are on administrative leave pending an investigation, Joslin said.

Flags have long been flown from El Capitan without consequences, said Joanna Citron Day, a former federal attorney who is now with the advocacy group Public Employees For Environmental Responsibility. She said the group is representing Joslin, but there is no pending legal case.

On May 21, a day after the flag display, Acting Superintendent Ray McPadden signed a rule prohibiting people from hanging banners, flags or signs larger than 15 square feet in park areas designated as “wilderness” or “potential wilderness.” That covers 94% of the park, according to Yosemite's website.

Park officials said the new restriction was needed to preserve Yosemite's wilderness and protect climbers.

“We take the protection of the park's resources and the experience of our visitors very seriously, and will not tolerate violations of laws and regulations that impact those resources and experiences,” Pawlitz said.

It followed a widely publicized instance in February of demonstrators hanging an upside down American flag on El Capitan to protest the firing of National Park Service employees by the Trump administration.

Among the climbers who helped hang the transgender flag was Pattie Gonia, an environmentalist and drag queen who uses the performance art to raise awareness of conservation issues. For the past five years, Gonia has helped throw a Pride event in Yosemite for park employees. 

She said they hung the transgender flag on the iconic granite monolith to express that being transgender is natural.

This year, Trump signed an executive order changing the federal definition of sex to exclude the concept of gender identity. He also banned trans women from competing in women's sports, removed trans people from the military and limited access to gender-affirming care.

Gonia called the firing unjust. Joslin said they hung the flag in their free time, as a private citizen.

“SJ is a respected pillar within the Yosemite community, a tireless volunteer who consistently goes above and beyond,” Gonia said.

Jayson O'Neill with the advocacy group Save Our Parks said Joslin's firing appears aimed at deterring park employees from expressing their views as the Trump administration pursues broad cuts to the federal workforce.

Since Trump took office, the National Park Service has lost approximately 2,500 employees from a workforce that had about 10,000 people, said Bill Wade, executive director of the Association of National Park Rangers. The Republican president is proposing a $900 million cut to the agency's budget next year.

Pawlitz said numerous visitors complained about unauthorized demonstrations on El Capitan earlier in the year. 

Many parks have designated “First Amendment areas” where groups 25 or fewer people can protest without permits. Yosemite has several of those areas, including one in Yosemite Valley, where El Capitan is located.

Park service rules on demonstrations have existed for decades and withstood several court challenges, Wade said. He was not aware of any changes in how those rules are enforced under Trump.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A National Guard vehicle collided with a civilian car less than a mile from the U.S. Capitol on Thursday morning as troops continued to take up positions around the city during President Donald Trump's crackdown. 

One person was trapped inside the car after the accident and had to be extricated by emergency responders, according to D.C. fire department spokesman Vito Maggiolo. The person was transported to a hospital with minor injuries. 

It was not immediately clear what caused the crash. A video posted online showed a tan-colored armored vehicle and a silver SUV with a crushed side. The military vehicle was twice the height of the civilian car.

“You come to our city and this is what you do? Seriously?” a woman yelled at the troops in the video. 

The driver was conscious and breathing, and the injuries were not considered life threatening, police said. 

An estimated 1,900 troops are being deployed in D.C. More than half are coming from Republican-led states that are responding to requests from Trump administration officials. 

Attorney General Pam Bondi said more than 550 people have been arrested so far, and the U.S. Marshals are offering $500 rewards for information leading to additional arrests.

“Together, we will make DC safe again!” Bondi wrote on social media.

Fox News senior correspondent Jonathan Serrie reports on the migrant driver accused of causing a Florida crash that killed three after failing key licensing tests.

The illegal immigrant truck driver who is accused of causing a crash in Fort Pierce, Florida, that killed three people failed English and road sign tests, officials investigating the wreck said.

Harjinder Singh, who crossed into the United States illegally in 2018 via the southern border, obtained a commercial driver's license in California. He attempted to obtain work authorization, but it was rejected by the first Trump administration on Sept. 14, 2020, according to Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs.

"During [Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's] interview with the driver, investigators administered an English Language Proficiency (ELP) assessment in accordance with FMCSA guidance," the Department of Transportation said in a statement. "The driver failed the assessment, providing correct responses to just 2 of 12 verbal questions and only accurately identifying 1 of 4 highway traffic signs."

FLORIDA TRAGEDY SHOWS WHY TRUMP'S TRUCKING LICENSE CRACKDOWN IS NEEDED

The DOT indicated that the investigation began on Aug. 14, two days after the crash.

Singh has been charged with three counts of vehicular homicide. He was arrested in Stockton, California, on Saturday. 

According to the DOT, Singh was issued a regular full-term commercial driver's license in the state of Washington in July 2023, but illegal immigrants are not allowed to obtain this type of license. 

A year later, Singh was issued a limited-term/non-domiciled commercial driver's license in California. The DOT is investigating further whether the issuance of that license followed federal regulations. 

On July 3, the New Mexico State Police pulled Singh over and conducted a roadside inspection of him. He was given a speeding ticket, but not subjected to an English language proficiency test, which was required by law beginning on June 25. 

Singh allegedly made a U-turn in an unauthorized area on the Florida Turnpike, causing his truck to jackknife and collide with a minivan. The three occupants of the minivan died in the crash.

The crash sparked a bitter spat between the office of California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and McLaughlin, as Newsom's office tried to wriggle its way out of responsibility for Singh's work permit.

"Hey, genius: the federal government (TRUMP ADMIN) already confirmed that this guy meets federal and state immigration requirements – YOU issued him a work permit (EAD). As usual, the Trump Administration is either lying or clueless," Newsom's office said in a post on X when criticized by McLaughlin. 

"False. Harjinder Singh is in the United States illegally and his work authorization was rejected under the Trump Administration on September 14, 2020," McLaughlin replied. "It was later approved under the Biden Administration June 9, 2021. The state of California issues Commercial Drivers Licenses. There is no national CDL."

A spokesperson for Newsom told Fox News Digital that Singh was reissued a work permit on April 9, and once again blamed Trump.

"Why don't you ask Trump about the driver's federally issued work permit and when he entered this country?" the spokesperson said in a statement. "Spoiler alert: it was in 2018 under Trump – whoops. He would have been eligible in any state. California followed federal law, something the President knows nothing about."

"In fact, the driver in this case was reissued an Employment Authorization (work permit) on 4/9/2025 and, if my math is correct, that falls within the current presidential term," the statement continued.

International recognition of a Palestinian state isn't just symbolic.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

France, Britain, Canada, Australia, and Malta all say they are preparing to recognize a state of Palestine at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in September. They would join another 147 UN countries that already do so. In some senses, the move is symbolic: It will not change the realities on the ground in the Middle East, at least not in the short term. But it is a major step nonetheless.

No Israeli-Palestinian “peace process” is currently under way, the countries pledging recognition noted in their statements. This is because Israel refuses to speak with the diplomatic representative of the Palestinian people, the Palestine Liberation Organization. In effect, Israel has held the PLO and its subsidiaries—the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and the Fatah political party—responsible for the actions of all Palestinians, including the PLO's extremist archrival, Hamas. (The United States, for its part, has never had a bilateral relationship with the Palestinians.)

The struggle for Palestinian statehood has been long and arduous. The PLO and PA, to be sure, have sometimes gotten in their own way. In the West Bank, the PA has overseen a corrupt system that leaves little space for civil society. And the PLO has squandered several potential opportunities to pursue statehood, especially an overture in 2008 by then–Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. But both groups have maintained a commitment to negotiation over violence, and have honored the 1993 recognition of Israel by Yasser Arafat, the PLO's former leader. The Western nations' formal acknowledgment of a Palestinian state under the leadership of the PLO will boost the idea that this kind of diplomacy, rather than the armed struggle of Hamas, is the path that can actually result in Palestinian independence and citizenship for the stateless millions in the occupied territories.

From the December 2024 issue: My hope for Palestine

International recognition will do as much to rebuke Hamas's maximalist demands as it will those of the Israeli right, dealing a blow to expansionist aspirations in the West Bank, the only territory that has any realistic chance of becoming a Palestinian state.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has long been characterized by a basic asymmetry: The international recognition of Jewish national rights in Palestine has never been matched by a demand for Palestinian national rights. This was the case as far back as the British government's 1917 Balfour Declaration and the British mandate for Palestine, which took effect several years later.

Palestinians may have had an opportunity in 1947 to create their state through a UN partition resolution. In retrospect, they should have accepted the proposal, but their rejection at the time is understandable. Jews made up about 33 percent of the population and owned a mere 6 percent of privately held land in Mandatory Palestine; the UN partition resolution would have allotted the proposed Jewish state more than 56 percent of the territory. Two decades later—after multiple wars—Israel declared itself a state that would come to control the entire territory, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, all of which have populations that are majority Palestinian Arab. Roughly 800,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled in 1947 and 1948, followed by another 300,000 in 1967. Almost none have been allowed to return.

In 1968, Palestinians resurrected an independence movement that wrested decision making away from Egypt and other Arab countries that had been humiliated in the Six-Day War. Their crushing defeat gave Palestinians a measure of self-determination through the establishment of a renewed autonomous PLO. In the '80s, the PLO evolved into the vehicle of a drastically reduced Palestinian aspiration: the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, all territories Israel had occupied since 1967. ​​The First Intifada, or uprising, against Israeli rule in the occupied territories, which began in 1987, gave the PLO an opportunity to greatly expand its presence there, but it also seeded a new group of rivals, the Muslim fundamentalists of Hamas.

A breakthrough seemed possible in the aftermath of the Cold War. In 1993, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat wrote to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin affirming that, on behalf of the Palestinian people, the PLO recognized Israel and its right to exist free from attacks and threats. Rabin responded with a letter to Arafat recognizing the PLO as a legitimate interlocutor and undertaking to negotiate with it. But he didn't recognize a state of Palestine, and the 1993 Oslo Accords with Israel did not specify the goal of Palestinian statehood or acknowledge the Palestinians' right to a state. In the summer of 2000, U.S. President Bill Clinton convened a summit at Camp David. Accounts vary on what Israel, then led by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, offered. But the Palestinians who attended came away convinced that they were being asked to accept an archipelago of quasi-independent Bantustans within a greater Israel. Because of an internal leadership crisis, among other failings, the Palestinians presented no detailed counteroffer. And Clinton entirely backed Israel.

The violent Second Intifada against Israeli rule in the occupied territories began on September 28, 2000. Nonetheless, negotiations resumed that fall. In late December, Clinton unveiled what is still the most reasonable framework yet proposed for an agreement that would end the conflict. But Israel suspended the negotiations pending elections early in 2001. The right-wing former General Ariel Sharon became prime minister, and the talks were not resumed.

In subsequent years, some hopeful signs for Palestinian statehood persisted. In 2002, President George W. Bush endorsed establishing a Palestinian state, and his administration voted for UN Security Council Resolution 1397, which, for the first time, explicitly called for two states “side by side within secure and recognized borders.” Palestinian divisions intensified, however, after the 2005–06 elections resulted in the acrimonious pairing of a Fatah/PLO leader, Mahmoud Abbas, with a Hamas-dominated Parliament. In 2007, Hamas violently seized control of Gaza, precipitating a split with the West Bank that continues to this day.

Jeffrey Goldberg: Sinwar's march of folly

The Palestinians had one more potential chance at statehood through negotiations. In 2008, Olmert, the Israeli prime minister, offered an agreement that the PLO, led by Abbas, considered broadly reasonable. However, Abbas doubted that Olmert was speaking on behalf of Israel, or even his own government, given that most members of his cabinet reportedly opposed his proposal. Moreover, the Palestinian negotiators could not get anything in writing. The deal also included Palestinian concessions on issues such as refugees, and Abbas ran the political risk of being seen to accept concessions while ultimately being left with nothing if Israel didn't follow through. Neither Olmert nor Abbas was willing to take the issue directly to the Israeli public, and the negotiations fizzled.

Since that time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dominated the Israeli political scene and dedicated himself to preventing any movement toward Palestinian statehood. He exploited the rift between Fatah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, seeking to keep both in power and at each other's throats, and thereby unable to advance their respective visions of independence. The Hamas attack of October 7, 2023, betrayed the folly of this policy. But it also hardened the position of the Israeli right that to live next to any Palestinian state would be an intolerable security risk. In the nearly two years that war has raged in Gaza, Netanyahu has become ever more explicit in his refusal of a two-state solution. Just last month, he ruled out the prospect of Palestinian statehood, saying that it would only serve as a platform for the elimination of Israel.

The Israelis claim that recognition would reward Hamas and terrorism. But the opposite is true. Pretty much the only thing Hamas and Fatah agree on is that they are all Palestinians. Other than that, the disagreements are almost total: The PLO is a secular national movement that still seeks a negotiated peace with Israel through diplomacy, and to establish a small Palestinian state in the occupied territories. Hamas is an Islamist party and militia that wants a theocratic Muslim government in not just the occupied territories but also what is now Israel. In Palestinian politics, the binary is so stark that virtually anything that strengthens one group weakens the other.

Recognizing a Palestinian state under the authority of the PLO harms Hamas and rewards the patient diplomacy and commitment to peace of its rivals in Fatah. Already, the PLO has benefited from an apparently minor change in its status at the UN in 2012, from “observer” to “non-member observer state.” This gave it standing at the International Criminal Court and suggests what international recognition—something Israel cannot take away—can accomplish: the potential protection of key multilateral instruments and institutions, and thus the potential frustration of Israeli ambitions for further annexation.

While the world's eyes have been fixed on the horrors of war in Gaza, far-right Israeli officials, led by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, have effectively taken charge of West Bank, where they are stoking conflict by encouraging right-wing settlers to confront Palestinian villagers. When Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency last year, Smotrich celebrated, saying that the opportunity had come to annex the West Bank. The Israeli military has displaced 40,000 Palestinians in the territory, according to the United Nations, and extremist settlers have continued to harass and attack villagers.

International recognition of Palestinian statehood could seriously complicate Israel's designs on the West Bank. Britain has said that it will recognize Palestine if the Gaza war continues into September, but France and Canada appear focused on discouraging Israeli annexation in the West Bank. Each is sending a clear message to Israel: End the war in Gaza, and more important, do not expand formalized control of the West Bank, the only territory that could become a true state for Palestinians.

Pushing back against Israeli annexation efforts is crucial to reviving the possibility of a two-state solution. Canada, Australia, Britain, France, and Malta are not asking or expecting Israel to withdraw from the West Bank tomorrow. But they clearly understand the danger that further settlement there poses to the Palestinian independence movement. Netanyahu and his allies know this too. Smotrich has his eyes firmly on annexation, having recently announced new settlements surrounding Jerusalem that he says will “bury” any potential for a Palestinian state.

The world must act as if a two-state solution is not merely necessary, but possible. International recognition of a Palestinian state is a key start. Without such a state alongside Israel, these two beleaguered peoples, the whole region, and the entire world will be sentenced to further decades, and possibly centuries, of bloodshed and oppression. Shrugging, walking away, and accepting this outcome cannot be an option.

Former acting ICE director Jonathan Fahey weighs in on hundreds of criminal immigrants being arrested in Massachusetts on 'The Story.'

FIRST ON FOX: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Boston said it arrested 65 illegal aliens during a four-day operation in Connecticut dubbed "Operation Broken Trust," part of the agency's ongoing crackdown on states with sanctuary policies.

The operation was launched as Connecticut in May expanded its sanctuary state law known as the "Trust Act," which bans local law enforcement from sharing information with ICE unless required by law or in cases involving serious crimes.

The agency said that the sting targeted transnational organized crime, gangs and egregious offenders. Among the 65 arrested, 29 had been convicted or charged in the U.S. with serious crimes, including kidnapping, assault, drug offenses, weapons violations and sex crimes. Others were identified as members of transnational gangs or had criminal histories in their home countries.

"Sanctuary legislation like Connecticut's Trust Act only endangers the communities it claims to protect. Such laws only force law enforcement professionals to release criminal alien offenders back into the very communities they have already victimized," said ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston acting Field Office Director Patricia H. Hyde. "The state of Connecticut is a safer place thanks to the hard work and determination of the men and women of ICE and our federal partners. Working together, we were able to arrest 65 illegal aliens in just four days throughout Connecticut, many of whom had significant criminality in the United States."

Throughout the duration of Operation Broken Trust, ICE and its federal law enforcement partners targeted egregious criminal alien offenders, operating in the state of Connecticut. ICE said that under the state's Trust Act, state and local law enforcement will refuse to "honor ICE detainers with a few rare exceptions."

"Make no mistake: Every person that we arrested are criminals and breaking federal law, but many of these individuals also victimized innocent people and traumatized communities — rapists, drug traffickers, child sex predators and members of violent transnational criminal gangs," Hyde said. "They all made the mistake of attempting to subvert justice by hiding out in Connecticut."

ICE noted that the sanctuary state's refusal to honor immigration detainer requests to turn over criminal migrants forced officers and agents to make "at-large arrests in Connecticut communities."  

The operation, named Operation Broken Trust, saw officers from ICE Boston's Hartford field office collaborate with the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to apprehend illegal alien offenders across the state of Connecticut.

 ‘The Five' cohosts discuss how President Donald Trump responded to Elon Musk's idea for a new political party.

Less than three months after its launch, Elon Musk's "America Party" appears to have been shelved.

Musk allegedly told associates that he wants to focus on his companies and avoid starting a party that could siphon voters from the GOP, the The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with his plans.

Musk has also allegedly worked to maintain ties with Vice President JD Vance, considered the heir apparent to the MAGA movement, according to WSJ. The outlet added that the tech billionaire reportedly told associates he was concerned that forming a new political party would damage his relationship with the vice president.

WHAT MUSK'S FRACTURE WITH TRUMP MEANS FOR GOP'S FUTURE: ‘BEATING HEART OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'

While the plan is paused at the moment, Musk's allies told WSJ that he has not formally ruled out launching the America Party and could revisit the idea as the 2026 midterms approach.

After spending months working with the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk's time at the Trump White House came to an end on May 30. Though they appeared on good terms, President Donald Trump and the tech billionaire began trading barbs almost immediately.

A few days after leaving the administration, Musk posted on X — the social media platform he owns — criticizing legislation the Trump White House was promoting.

"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it," Musk wrote.

His criticism continued, including memes and jabs aimed at the administration. Musk stayed firm in his opposition to the bill, citing the amount of spending as his reason for objecting to it.

TRUMP DISMISSES MUSK'S POLITICAL AMBITIONS AS 'RIDICULOUS' IN SHARP REBUKE

On June 5, Musk posed a question — and a poll — to his followers: Should there be a new political party? The next day, he announced that "the people have spoken. A new political party is needed in America to represent the 80% in the middle!"

Musk asked a similar question nearly a month later, on July 4, the day Trump signed the "big, beautiful bill."

"Independence Day is the perfect time to ask if you want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system! Should we create the America Party?" Musk included another poll with his post. In the end, 65.4% of respondents voted "yes," while 34.6% voted "no," showing a drastic change from his June poll in which 80.4% voted "yes."

Musk announced the next day that "the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom."

"I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,' essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks," Trump wrote on Truth Social on July 6. "He even wants to start a third political party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States – The system seems not designed for them."

However, the feud between the two appears to have cooled. The social media spats have stopped, and in late July Trump appeared to wish Musk well, writing on Truth Social that he wanted to see the tech billionaire's businesses "thrive like never before."

"Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon's companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large-scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. government. This is not so! I want Elon, and all businesses within our country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before! The better they do, the better the USA does, and that's good for all of us," Trump wrote.

A spokesperson for Musk did not respond to a request for comment.

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that there will be $500 awards doled out for tips that lead to an arrest in Washington, D.C.

"We have now made over 550 arrests in Washington, DC and have taken 76 illegal firearms off the streets—saving lives. You can help— [US Marshals Service] is offering a reward for any information leading to an arrest. Together, we will make DC safe again!" Bondi posted to X on Wednesday morning with a QR code.

The crackdown on crime in the nation's capital continues in coordination with local and federal agencies after President Donald Trump announced a takeover of the city's police force earlier this month.

With Immigration and Customs Enforcement out, many of the arrests have been immigration-related, but roughly half of the over 200 non-immigration arrests have been in the high-crime Wards 7 and 8, a White House analysis explained, according to Axios.

"In other news, on the home front, President Trump's efforts to make DC safe again are working. There have been a total of 465 arrests since the start of this operation. On Thursday, August 7th. Last night, there were a total of 52 arrests, including the arrest of an illegal alien MS-13 gang member with convictions for DWI and drug possession," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday. 

"Thanks to President Trump's leadership and the outstanding work of both federal and local law enforcement, dangerous gang members like the one picked up last night will not be allowed on the streets of our nation's capital," she continued.

On immigration, Bondi issued an order last week giving local police the ability to comply with federal immigration authorities, despite the city having its own sanctuary laws.

The DC Police Union, who's backing the move from the Trump administration, said on Monday that there's been a 46% decrease in robberies, an 83% decrease in carjackings, a 21% decrease in car theft, and a 22% decrease in violent crime.

"While federal assistance gives us a boost, we must repeal the misguided Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Act in order to make these changes permanent," the union posted on Monday.

There's been opposition from Democrats on the takeover, with some criticizing the level of law enforcement presence, including the National Guard, on city streets.

"American soldiers and airmen policing American citizens on American soil is #UnAmerican," Mayor Muriel Bowser tweeted from her personal account last week.

"Let us be clear: armed soldiers should not be policing American citizens on American soil. Instead of making DC more secure, it undermines public safety and endangers our democracy. It's DC today, but the same dangerous strategy can be deployed to occupy any American community," he tweeted on Tuesday.

President Donald Trump has called upon Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to resign after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte asked the Justice Department to consider prosecuting her for mortgage fraud.

Pulte, who in his role at FHFA oversees the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, sent the criminal referral to Attorney General Pam Bondi last Friday. Pulte posted a copy of the letter to X on Wednesday morning. In response, Trump called on Cook to step aside.

“Cook must resign, now!!!” Trump said on social media.

The letter is yet another escalation by Pulte against Trump's perceived enemies at the central bank. Pulte has increasingly emerged as the biggest attack dog in Trump's orbit and has harshly criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and others while serving as the government's top housing regulator.

In the letter to Bondi, Pulte said it appears Cook “falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud under the criminal statute.”

“This has included falsifying residence statuses for an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based residence and an Atlanta, Georgia-based property in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms,” Pulte wrote.

While Pulte has gone after other officials over similar accusations, Cook is of interest because she is a voting member of the Fed board and one of the 12 people who control the direction of interest rates in the United States. Cook was nominated to the board by former President Joe Biden and worked in the Obama administration, in addition to being an academic economist.

Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee accused the Trump administration of lying about Cook and characterized the move as part of an effort to wrest control of the Fed.

“Donald Trump is making up blatant lies in an effort to oust the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board, so he can replace her with another unqualified loyalist who will do his bidding,” committee Democrats said in a statement. “This is another attack on the Fed's independence. We can't let this happen.”

Trump and Pulte have repeatedly criticized Powell and the Fed for refusing to cut interest rates this year. Two members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted to lower interest rates at the last meeting: Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.

Another Fed governor who voted to hold interest rates steady, Adriana Kugler, recently and unexpectedly resigned, handing Trump an opening on the board. If Cook stepped aside, Trump would have another opportunity to nominate a replacement.

In addition to Trump, Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) called upon Cook to resign. Moreno hinted at the dynamic of the Fed board in a Monday post on X.

“Lisa Cook is cooked and should immediately resign her position at the Federal Reserve,” the senator said. “For the benefit of our great Country, I'm hopeful we can get a two for one special and Jay Powell can join her in packing it up.”

THE FED OFFICIAL WHO CORRECTLY PREDICTED INFLATION COULD FALL WITHOUT A RECESSION

Pulte has made a name for himself in the administration by using his massive social media following to attack Powell and others. The FHFA director has also targeted some other high-profile Trump critics, most notably Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and New York Attorney General Letitia James.

The Washington Examiner reached out to the Federal Reserve Board, which declined to comment.

Liberalism has a serious pipeline problem.

Last week, two young liberals asked for help finding a job in the ideas industry. And I didn't have a great answer.

It made sense that they were asking: We were at a conference for liberals, dedicated to building a version of the doctrine that works in the 21st century. They were interested in studying ideas professionally, and I was there to moderate a panel about political philosophy.

Yet I found myself struggling to give good advice. Sure, they could try for an internship at a liberal publication or think tank, but those are fiercely competitive and don't pay much. They could apply for a PhD program, but teaching jobs were scarce even before President Donald Trump took a hammer to American academia.

What's really missing are programs of a specific kind — ones that help college students and recent grads engage with Big Ideas and connect with Important People.

If my young acquaintances were right-wing, I might have told them to apply for National Review's Buckley and Rhodes journalism fellowships — multiyear paid opportunities to write for a national audience straight out of college. For a lesser commitment, they could have tried for the Claremont Institute's Publius Fellowship — a three-week program where you receive $1,500, a $700 travel stipend, free housing, paid meals, and an opportunity to study with some of the most influential (and radical) figures of the Trump era.

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

Those are two examples of numerous well-funded programs explicitly designed to usher as many bright young people into the institutional conservative world as possible. If you're an ambitious young college grad, and anywhere on the spectrum from libertarian to hardcore Trumpist, you've got tons of options to get into the ideas game.

My young acquaintances really wanted a liberal version of such a thing. But as far as I can tell, it doesn't seem to exist. Where there should be a talent pipeline from universities to liberal public intellectualism, there is a giant sucking sound instead.

And, increasingly, it's giving the right a leg up in winning the future.

It is true, as conservatives have long alleged, that America's intellectual institutions are pretty left-leaning places. They often overstate the case — professors are more likely to be Elizabeth Warren Dems than “globalize the intifada” socialist revolutionaries — but data confirms that liberals outnumber conservatives in academia and the media by pretty significant margins.

This is, of course, not at all new. One of the founding texts of the postwar conservative movement, William F. Buckley's God and Man at Yale, is all about how academia is full of socialists who are chipping away at the eternal truths of capitalism and Christianity. Buckley founded National Review as an antidote to what he saw as the liberal tilt of the mainstream American press.

The legacy of Buckley-style thinking is the rise of a conservative ideas industry. A young person nowadays could attend college at right-wing Hillsdale, build their law school life around membership in the Federalist Society, and then get a job writing right-wing papers for the Heritage Foundation — all while getting their news from Fox News and Mark Levin's radio show.

As part of these pipeline programs, older right-wingers get to know young up-and-comers as people, and thus develop a personal stake in their success.

At the same time, the right also invested in the kinds of “pipeline” programs our young liberals are desperate for. These aren't designed to replace traditional education or media institutions, but rather to identify young people interested in ideas and expose them to the right-wing alternatives.

These work, in large part, by being intellectually exciting. It's not just that you get to go on all-expenses-paid trips with nice meals; it's that you are put in an environment where you're reading and debating classic works of political thought and literature with other people who share those interests. If you're the kind of nerd who wants to debate the finer points of Locke and Hamilton during undergrad summers, you're the kind of nerd who might one day be someone who matters in US politics — and the right's fellowships are there to help make sure you're mattering on their side.

The people these young people are meeting are important and famous (well, DC famous).

In a 2021 episode of the Know Your Enemy podcast, Nate Hochman — a radical young conservative writer who later staffed both Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Eric Schmitt — talks at length about “the masterful things the conservative movement institutionally has done in terms of mentorship.” Hochman, who was raised in a liberal household and moved to the right in college, describes how the movement's fellowship programs brought him in direct and meaningful contact with conservatism's leading lights.

“All of a sudden, you're at dinner with people you've looked up to for years, staying up until 1 am drinking wine with them and asking them questions and getting to talk to them. And they're taking you seriously,” Hochman says.

As part of these pipeline programs, older right-wingers get to know young up-and-comers as people, and thus develop a personal stake in their success. When you stay up late drinking with someone, talking about shared ideas, you come to care about them in a way you don't if they sent you a cold email. When they come looking for help getting a job writing about conservative ideas, you'll work that much harder to place them in one.

And the right has built its institutions to ensure that such positions are available. Right-wing publications and think tanks are much more open to debating big-picture questions — say, what kind of a nation is America? — than their left-wing peers (more on that in a second). Claremont, for example, was founded by students of conservative political philosopher Harry Jaffa, and it shows in the kind of work they put out (even when it strikes me as substantively ridiculous).

There is no parallel culture in American liberalism — a function, in part, of liberalism's longtime intellectual dominance. There wasn't much of a need for liberal donors to create programs to cultivate liberal thought, as people interested could simply go get a PhD or an entry-level reporting job.

However, these institutions were not avowedly liberal in character. They styled themselves as politically neutral, focused more on quality research and reporting, than as contributing to a particular ideological cause. This means that while liberals in such fields were in left-leaning environments, many were trained to see themselves primarily as professionals working a craft. So while there are plenty of internships available to young liberals, they're mostly focused on professional training (or coffee-fetching) rather than staying up late swapping ideas with big names.

More broadly, the liberal professional approach also produced a kind of intellectual siloing. If you were a young liberal interested in political philosophy, odds are that you end up going to a PhD program and pursuing a career in academia. If you're interested in policy, odds are that you ended up studying a set of applied skills (like law or economics) that prepared you for very specific policy discussions in your area of expertise.

But the conservative intellectual model bridges the philosophy-policy gap. It trains young people in the big-picture ideas, like conservative visions of political morality and religion, and teaches them to connect those things to everyday policy discussions. You aren't learning about abstract ideas or concrete policy, but rather learning a comprehensive worldview that treats policy issues as downstream of specific values.

You are, in short, learning an ideology.

Liberalism has plenty of brilliant theorists who work at a largely abstract level, and policy wonks who work on the most applied issues. But in the middle area of ideology, one bridging the gap between principle and policy, they've basically ceded the field to conservatism. The pipeline problem for young people is a symptom of the movement's blind spot: liberals, as a collective, don't care to cultivate a youth ideological cadre.

This might not have been a problem in the past — and maybe even a benefit. Ideological thinking tends to produce rigidity, an unwillingness to adjust one's policy thinking based on new evidence. The right's longtime insistence that tax cuts can reduce deficits, or addiction to proposing military solutions to foreign policy problems, are two examples of curdled ideology.

But we're at a moment where liberalism is in a particular kind of crisis: under threat from new ideologies that challenge not specific liberal policy ideas, but the basic premises of a liberal political system. Liberals need a new and compelling vision: one that explains why our ideas are not merely a defense of an unpopular status quo, but a broader politics that can be used to address cardinal problems of the 21st century.

At this moment, liberals lack the personnel to articulate such a vision — while the right's radical thinkers, at places like Claremont, seize the field.

Republicans are betting the specter of a third House impeachment will motivate President Donald Trump's most loyal voters to show up at the polls next year.

Trump is the only president to have been impeached twice, both times by a Democrat-led House, with the first in 2019 and the second in 2021. With Republicans in control of Washington, congressional leaders are making the case to voters that he would face more investigations, up to and including an impeachment inquiry, should they retake the House in 2026.

“Democrats would vote to impeach [Trump] on their first day,” Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) told the Shreveport Times earlier this month, a message echoed by House Republicans in campaign advertising.

Last week, the National Republican Congressional Committee released a video claiming one plank of Democrats‘ “Project 2026” agenda is to “impeach President Trump.” 

“Make no mistake: if Democrats were to take back the House, their first order of business would be another sham impeachment of President Trump instead of helping working families,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella told the Washington Examiner. “They have no other message except for their rabid Trump Derangement Syndrome to distract from their radical policies.”

Trump was acquitted in both impeachment trials, with Democrats lacking the two-thirds votes needed to convict in the Senate, and a similar outcome is likely if they pursue what is perceived as political articles against the president.

But the issue has been kept alive by repeated efforts by the Democrats' left flank to impeach Trump while in the minority this year.

The House voted 344 to 79, with 128 Democrats joining all Republicans who voted, to table an impeachment effort by Rep. Al Green (D-TX) in June. Green had alleged an abuse of power after Trump approved the bombing of three nuclear sites in Iran.

Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-MI) also planned for an impeachment vote but pulled his articles following pressure from House Democratic leadership.

The GOP messaging comes as Republicans try to figure out how to boost turnout in an election cycle in which many of their voters are expected to stay home. Congressional candidates lagged Trump's performance in 2024, with his name on the ballot giving them coattails but not the same voting margins.

The additional challenge in 2026 will be motivating those same voters in a year when Democrats, buoyed by historical headwinds as the party out of power, are banking on an energized base.

Dennis Lennox, a Michigan-based Republican strategist, pointed to GOP candidate Mike Rogers as he makes a second run for Senate. Rogers lost Michigan in 2024 by three-tenths of a point despite Trump carrying the state.

“Getting the 120,000 Trump voters who didn't vote for you in 2024 to show up for you when Trump is not on the ballot, let alone the voters who voted for both you and Trump when he's not on the ballot, is going to require a Herculean effort for Mike Rogers,” Lennox said.

There is political utility in impeachment for Democrats, at least for the firebrands in their party hoping to tap into the anger of rank-and-file voters. However, Democratic House leaders have shied away from new articles against Trump as they try to build a coalition that can win in swing districts nationwide.

“It would be idiocy in its highest form,” Sammy Kanter, the CEO of the Girl and the Gov podcast, told the Washington Examiner of using impeachment as a message for the midterm elections.

Despite the favorable political environment, Democrats face a difficult House map, with 40 seats rated competitive compared to the 29 marked competitive for the GOP. They need to net just three seats to seize control of the chamber and have instead relied on messaging portraying the GOP's recently passed tax law as a giveaway to the rich.

“While impeachment is not an argument that will win a majority, the I-word, as well as resisting Trump for anything and everything, helps Democrats fundraise as it's what their ActBlue base wants to hear,” Lennox said.

“For Democrats, it's a winning fundraising strategy,” he added.

KATHERINE CLARK, NO. 2 HOUSE DEMOCRAT, TAKES BACK GAZA ‘GENOCIDE' COMMENT

In the Senate, Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA), a prolific fundraiser, is the rare Democrat to call openly for Trump's impeachment over alleged corruption. He is running in a purple state but appears poised to rely on a base-driving strategy to secure another term next year.

Due to a favorable map, Republicans are predicted to retain the Senate in 2026, though Democrats have successfully recruited top candidates in the battlegrounds of Ohio and North Carolina.

Extreme heat is increasing the prevalence of a disease that hits low-income people the hardest.

Air conditioners have been working overtime this hot summer, from those tiny window units to the massive AC towers that serve the tightly packed apartment buildings in major cities. And while they bring the relief of cool air, these contraptions also create the conditions for dangerous bacteria to multiply and spread.

One particularly nasty bacteria-borne illness is currently spreading in New York City using those enormous cooling units as its vector: Legionnaire's disease. The bacterial pneumonia, which usually recurs each summer in the US's largest city, has sickened more than 100 people and killed five in a growing outbreak.

If you don't live in New York City or the Northeast, you may never have heard of Legionnaire's, but this niche public health threat may not be niche for much longer.

Climate change is helping to make Legionnaire's disease both more plentiful in the places where it already exists and creating the potential for it to move to new places where the population may not be accustomed to it. Cities in the Northeast and Midwest, where hotter weather meets older infrastructure, have reported more cases in recent years. Recently, Legionella bacteria was discovered in a nursing home's water system in Dearborn, Michigan — one of the states, along with Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Wisconsin, that have seen more activity in the past few years.

Anyone can contract Legionnaire's disease by inhaling tiny drops containing the bacteria, and the symptoms — fever, headache, shortness of breath — appear within days. It can cause a severe lung infection, with a death rate of around 10 percent.

While healthier people often experience few symptoms, the more vulnerable — young children, the elderly, pregnant people, and those with compromised immune systems — face serious danger from the illness. Around 5,000 people die every year in the United States from Legionnaire's disease, many of them living in low-income housing with outdated cooling equipment where the bacteria can more readily grow and spread.

Legionnaire's disease is a microcosm of climate change's impact on low-income communities. As warmer temperatures facilitate the spread of disease, the most socially vulnerable populations are going to pay the steepest price.

Legionnaire's disease was first documented after an unusually aggressive pneumonia outbreak during an American Legion conference in Philadelphia in 1976. Soon, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists confirmed the cause of the mysterious illness: a previously unknown bacteria that was accordingly named Legionella. Legionella, unfortunately, is everywhere — in streams, lakes, and water pipes across the country.

But usually, it occurs in such low concentrations and is so remote that it doesn't pose a threat to humans. Usually. 

Now, city health officials have found the bacteria in the large cooling tanks that serve massive apartment buildings across New York City, particularly in Harlem. Cooling tanks are ideal for Legionnaire's to grow and spread. They're filled with stagnant, warm water that is more hospitable to bacterial growth. Like an evaporative cooler, the systems convert warm stagnant water into cool air for apartment dwellers. They can spray mists laden with the bacteria into the open air, dispersing it across the surrounding air, where it can enter a person's lungs when they inhale. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 80 percent of Legionnaire's cases are linked to potable water systems.

Summers have always been prime time for the spread of Legionnaire's, and climate change only exacerbates all of these problems. For starters, the quality of natural water is degrading — creating more favorable conditions for Legionella, which loves acidic water and low oxygen levels, to multiply — as the planet warms. In the summer, the higher the temperatures and the more humid the air, the easier it is for the bacteria to reproduce in these cooling systems.

A decade ago, researchers warned that “climate change might increase the incidence of legionellosis through increased reliance on air conditioning systems,” especially the large units serving city housing buildings. The European Climate and Health Observatory advised in 2022 that higher temperatures and the increased rainfall associated with climate change could soon make Legionnaire's disease a more widespread issue.

The EPA also expects the bacteria's range to expand as global temperatures rise. Each heat wave and heavy rainstorm creates the hot and wet conditions that allow Legionella to thrive. Flooding can allow Legionella-tainted water to more easily penetrate a community's water system, too.

And those who live in a low-income area are more likely to be at risk from this increased prevalence of Legionnaire's disease. As the New York Times reported recently, poorly maintained cooling systems are more likely to see Legionella flourish and pump the bacteria into their neighborhoods — and low-income housing is more likely to be poorly maintained. Though NYC attempted to require more inspections for defective cooling systems after a 2015 outbreak of Legionnaire's, inspections have fallen off in recent years, according to reporting from The Gothamist.

This dynamic isn't unique to Legionnaire's disease. As the EPA has observed, low-income people are more likely to face health consequences from climate change because they are more likely to live in places exposed to extreme weather, they are more likely to have health conditions that make them more vulnerable to infectious diseases and natural disasters — and they are more likely to live with the kind of aging infrastructure that allows Legionnaire's to flourish.

Legionnaire's is a particularly disconcerting health threat: It rains down from the sky in tiny invisible droplets, packed with bacteria so potent it can kill one in 10 people whom it manages to infect through its telltale aggressive pneumonia. It is as deadly as tuberculosis, though Legionnaire's disease usually kills much faster.

I asked some experts what people can do about Legionnaire's disease. The most important advice was to be vigilant about any public health warnings if you reside in an area where Legionella has historically lived or has recently been detected, especially if you have certain preexisting conditions like diabetes, chronic lung disease, or autoimmune disorders, or if you're over the age of 50. Follow the news and make sure you're registered for alerts from your local public health officials.

People could consider investing in a high-quality water filter during an outbreak, the CDC says. If you use an evaporative cooler or your home is equipped with a swamp cooler, you can make sure you're keeping them clean and using filtered water, if possible.

But the issue here is ultimately not your small humidifier. The problem resides much further up the water supply chain, in the massive community water systems where Legionella flourish. You can't suddenly stop drinking water or breathing air, of course, even if there is a local outbreak. The CDC itself notes that point-of-use water filters only provide limited protection.

So, whenever you know Legionnaire's disease is spreading nearby, you should be paying attention to your body, said Janet Stout, president and director of the Special Pathogens Laboratory, who has studied the disease for 30 years. See your doctor immediately if you're experiencing fever, shortness of breath, or a cough. You could have a special test done for Legionnaire's disease and potentially receive antibiotics, such as Levofloxacin or Azithromycin, that have proven effective against the bacteria. Most cases can be cured if they are caught early enough.

But this is a truly public health challenge; when bacteria are multiplying in community water systems and then spewing into the open air, anyone can be exposed. There is only so much that any one person's own, individual effort can do to stop infections.

The main way to prevent Legionnaire's disease, however, or at least significantly reduce its risk is by staying on top of maintenance to make sure community water sources are kept clean, preventing the bacteria from proliferating. But that kind of maintenance requires vigilance and perhaps even public pressure. In New York City, for example, only 1,200 cooling towers were inspected in the first six months of 2025, a steep drop-off from 2017 when the city had checked more than 5,000 over the same period.

Landlords and public health authorities must take Legionnaire's disease seriously. We are going to see more and more outbreaks as climate change continues to heat the planet.

            For decades, Orlando has reigned as the global capital of theme parks — a place where Disney, Universal, SeaWorld and countless other attractions have drawn millions of visitors.
    


            But a challenger for the crown has emerged from an unlikely place: the deserts of the Arabian Gulf. In a destination once known more for oil wealth and camel racing than roller coasters, Abu Dhabi is building an adrenaline-charged playground that could give Orlando a run for its money.
    


            And it just landed the ultimate weapon: Disney.



            In May 2025, when Disney announced its first new theme park in 15 years, it chose Abu Dhabi over other key theme park destinations in California, Japan and even Orlando.
    


            There was “no question,” says Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney Experiences. The UAE capital, already home to Ferrari World, with the world's fastest roller coaster; Warner Bros. World (built under license by CNN's parent company, Warner Brothers Discovery); Yas Waterworld, an epic network of slides and pools; and more recently, SeaWorld Yas Island Abu Dhabi. It's clear the emirate is emerging as the most serious challenger Orlando has ever faced.
    


            Disneyland Abu Dhabi, expected to open on Yas Island in the early 2030s, will be the company's most technologically advanced park ever. Renderings show a shimmering, futuristic tower at its center — more closely resembling Abu Dhabi's gleaming skyline than a traditional European castle. It will be the first Disney resort set on an accessible shoreline, located just 20 minutes from downtown Abu Dhabi.
    

What began as a shared passion between two friends has grown into the "Abu Dhabi House Movement" — a fast-growing community redefining the city's music scene. Co-founder Tom Worton takes us inside this grassroots world, where music lovers, DJs, and cultural spaces collide. 


House beats and hidden venues: A new sound is emerging in Abu Dhabi



            The theme park will be developed, built and operated by Miral, the Abu Dhabi company behind Yas Island's roster of other attractions. Disney Imagineers will handle creative design and operational oversight, making sure the new park is in keeping with Disney's brand.
    


            Miral's CEO, Mohamed Abdalla Al Zaabi, says demand already exists: 2024 saw a 20% rise in theme park attendance on Yas Island. And expansion is already in the works — a Harry Potter–themed land at Warner Bros. World, more record-breaking rides at Ferrari World, new themed hotels, and even two beaches along Yas Bay Waterfront.
    


            Abu Dhabi's location, a medium-haul flight away from both Europe and Asia, and relatively short hop away from India, means millions of potential visitors are within relatively easy reach.
    


            “This isn't about building another theme park,” Saleh Mohamed Al Geziry, Abu Dhabi's director general of tourism, told CNN. “It's about defining Abu Dhabi as a global destination where culture, entertainment and luxury intersect.”
    


            Abu Dhabi's rise comes as Orlando and US tourism more broadly face headwinds. International travel to the US has slowed recently, with lengthy visa processes, unpredictable immigration checks, and heightened security scrutiny all blamed for deterring visitors.
    


            Abu Dhabi currently offers a smoother alternative to the US. Many nationalities can enter the UAE visa-free or with an e-visa, and the capital's airport — currently being expanded — has a reputation for fast border processing and easy connections.
    


            Despite wider regional tensions, Abu Dhabi continues to position itself as a safe, reliable tourism hub. The UAE ranked highly on the 2024 Global Peace Index. “In times of uncertainty, people look for destinations they can trust,” Al Geziry added.
    


            Once on Yas Island, visitors experience indoor, climate-controlled attractions, shorter lines, and a level of sophistication not typically associated with theme parks.
    


            “For families used to theme parks in the US or Europe, Abu Dhabi is a revelation,” says Steven Hopkinson, a British expatriate living in Abu Dhabi. “You don't spend hours waiting in the heat, and everything feels more refined, more accessible, which is such a luxury when you're with small children.”
    


            Orlando may have Florida sunshine, but in summer it also has humidity and crowds. Temperatures still soar in Abu Dhabi, but its climate-controlled indoor parks keep the experience consistent no matter what's happening outside.
    


            Warner Bros. World and Ferrari World are entirely enclosed, with air-conditioned walkways and restaurants, and even SeaWorld's aquariums and animal experiences are under cover.
    


            “Compared to places like Florida, it's a different level of comfort,” said Ahmed El Khoury, a Palestinian expatriate and father of three.
    


            Despite the comparisons, Abu Dhabi isn't positioning itself as a direct rival to Orlando  — it's aiming to be something more. The emirate sees its theme parks as part of a bigger portfolio of attractions, alongside cultural landmarks, luxury hotels, pristine beaches, and desert adventures.
    


            A 15-minute drive from Yas Island, Saadiyat Island is home to the Louvre Abu Dhabi, a franchised outpost of the famous Paris art museum, which welcomed 1.4 million visitors last year, 84% from abroad. The Guggenheim Abu Dhabi and Zayed National Museum are both under construction, adding to a cultural district that will be one of the region's most concentrated hubs of art and heritage.
    


            “Abu Dhabi's unique appeal lies in the diversity of our tourism offering,” Al Geziry added. “For thrill-seekers, we have record-breaking roller coasters and dune bashing in the desert. For culture lovers, historic sites like Al Ain Oasis and institutions like the Saadiyat museums. And for luxury travelers, world-class dining, private island resorts, and high-end shopping.
    


            “Where else can you start your day under the Louvre's iconic rain-of-light dome and end it in the immersive, story-driven worlds of Warner Bros. World or Ferrari World?”
    


            Still, not everyone is convinced that Disney's expansion into the Middle East is a sure bet.
    


            “The region has seen its share of false starts,” says Dennis Speigel, founder of the International Theme Park Services consultancy, comparing it to neighboring Dubai's patchy record with theme park expansion ambitions in the mid-2010s. “Several of them struggled for profitability in their first decade.”

            Spiegel believes Abu Dhabi is different. “Disney made a smart choice. The infrastructure, safety, and existing leisure developments create an ideal entry point,” he told CNN earlier this year. “It's a much more controlled and calculated move.”
    


            Under its Tourism Strategy 2030, Abu Dhabi aims to grow annual visitors from 24 million in 2023 to more than 39 million by the end of the decade. With Disneyland as a centerpiece, those targets may well be surpassed. The city's population has already grown from 2.7 million in 2014 to more than 4.1 million today, a reflection of its rising profile as a regional hub.
    


            Yas Island alone has been transformed in the space of a decade from a largely undeveloped stretch of sand to a self-contained resort destination, complete with golf courses, marinas, a mall, more than 160 restaurants, and a cluster of high-end hotels.



            Orlando's head start remains formidable — it still offers multiple Disney and Universal parks, has decades of brand loyalty, and an infrastructure built to handle tens of millions of tourists annually.
    


            But Abu Dhabi is catching up fast. Its combination of frictionless travel, year-round comfort, cutting-edge attractions, and a cultural scene that adds depth to the experience gives Abu Dhabi its own unique selling point, potentially offering a model for the next generation of theme park capital.

The novel published 70 years ago that still explains America.

When Lolita first appeared 70 years ago, in 1955, it was so controversial that no American publisher was willing to touch it. Today, Lolita is hailed as a classic, a masterpiece, one of the great novels of the English language.

Yet Lolita also comes with a sense that it is still, perhaps, too controversial to touch. A book about a man who kidnaps and repeatedly rapes his 12-year-old stepdaughter, all told in ravishing rainbow-streaked prose? “They'd never let you publish that now,” writer after writer has declared. In a development that seems almost too on the nose, it was recently reported that Jeffrey Epstein kept a prized first edition of the novel in his home, under glass.

“I love that book,” someone told me recently when he saw me rereading it. Then: “Am I still allowed to love that book?”

Book recommendations — both old and new — that are worth your time, from senior correspondent and critic Constance Grady.

We certainly read Lolita very differently than we used to. For decades after its publication, readers both nodded to the horror at the center of the novel but also believed it was a little unsophisticated to dwell only on the assault. In pop culture, Lolita became synonymous with a teenaged seductress who deserves whatever she gets. Today, however, the received wisdom is that Lolita is not a romance but a horror story.

In the 70 years since its publication, Lolita — lovely, sensual Lolita; obscene, monstrous Lolita; bleak, tragic Lolita — has become a barometer of sorts for cultural change. Vladimir Nabokov's novel is so multifaceted that it reflects the priorities of its readers back at us, showing us what we value and fear most at any given moment in time. We're still arguing over Lolita today, and our debates mirror the contours of our current culture war: a horror at an abuser's attempt to cover up their abuse; a terror that all that is pleasurable will be moralized into oblivion.

What kind of book could plausibly be experienced both as an erotic comic romp in the 1950s and a searing dismantling of rape culture on its 70th birthday? Only ever Lolita.

Lolita was born a scandal.

Initially, Nabokov planned to publish the novel anonymously, with the only clue to his authorship the presence of a minor nonspeaking character whose name, Vivian Darkbloom, anagrammed to Vladimir Nabokov. But Lolita was so characteristic of Nabokov, with its dense wordplay, its butterfly motifs, its musical language, that Nabokov's friends convinced him that everyone would know he wrote it anyway.

Four American publishers, likely fearing expensive obscenity lawsuits, turned down Lolita. Nabokov sent the manuscript went off to Paris's Olympia Press, which knew how to publish obscene novels, and there it became an underground cult object: the book too scandalous to be published in the US, the literary novel from the pornographic publisher.

In 1958, when it finally came out in the US, it shot to the top of the bestseller lists and transformed Nabokov from an obscure Russian-born writer of tricky novels into a wealthy household name.

Not to say that Lolita is not a tricky novel. Lolita is narrated by one Humbert Humbert, a smooth-talking charmer who confesses to us early on that he is sexually obsessed with little girls between the ages of 8 and 14: “nymphets,” he calls them. His landlady's 12-year-old daughter Dolores Haze — nicknamed Lolita by Humbert — is just one such nymphet, and Humbert is so obsessed with her that he decides to marry her mother in order to have more access to Dolores. After Mrs. Haze dies, Humbert seizes the moment to kidnap Dolores, taking her off on a demented road trip back and forth across America, going from one motel to the next, debauching her all the way.

Critics were puzzled by why Nabokov lavished some of his richest, most pleasurable prose on such an appalling story.

Humbert is such a strange, unstable figure that the term “unreliable narrator” was coined in part to describe him. He narrates his depravities in luxuriant, beautiful sentences full of wordplay and neologisms, funny and mordant. He plays constantly for our sympathy: at one moment calling himself a monster, the next swearing he loves Lolita with a deep and undying passion, the next informing us with an air of triumph that it was she who seduced him. You can tell, reading Lolita, that Humbert wants you to like him. It's harder to tell if Nabokov wants you to like Humbert, too.

Early critics by and large agreed that Lolita was a masterpiece (with some notable exceptions). But they were puzzled by why Nabokov lavished some of his richest, most pleasurable prose on such an appalling story. How was anyone supposed to read it?

One of the most influential early readers who laid the blueprint for how Lolita would be received was legendary literary critic Lionel Trilling.

For Trilling, the pleasure of the novel was the point. He was part of a generation of young, au courant critics who carefully prized such pleasure, who took it as a point of pride that they were not dreary old Victorian killjoys who feared every book might corrupt the morals of the young. If it was pleasurable to read Humbert's words, to fall into his point of view and learn to see the world as he did — well then, that was the correct way to read the novel. It didn't mean that you condoned child sex abuse. It meant that you understood allegory.

Trilling eventually concluded that Lolita was, in a generic sense, a story about love: following in the literary tradition of courtly love, it was about a forbidden romance so scandalous that it could never end in marriage, like the love between Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, married to another man, and Vronsky. Readers were no longer shocked when novelists broke the taboo of adultery, Trilling reasoned, and so Nabokov had to be extreme with Lolita.

“The breaking of the taboo about the sexual unavailability of very young girls has for us something of the force that a wife's infidelity had for Shakespeare,” Trilling wrote. “H.H.'s relation with Lolita defies society as scandalously as did Tristan's relation with Iseult, or Vronsky's with Anna. It puts the lovers, as lovers in literature must be put, beyond the pale of society.”

Trilling's argument lived on, in an ever-more-flattened form, for the next 50 years or so.

It was, in fact, the idea that Lolita was about not love but horror, that the pleasure of Humbert Humbert's prose was not to be trusted, that was the dissenting view. 

As Lolita entered into popular culture, it was largely understood through the lens of forbidden romance and adolescent lust. “Lolita” and “nymphet” both entered the dictionaries to mean a sexually precocious girl. Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film adaptation made iconic the image of Dolores Haze licking a lollipop, sending the camera a piercing, erotically charged gaze over the rim of her heart-shaped sunglasses. The reading would persist unchanged for decades. In 1997, Adrien Lyne's adaptation played out the story in front of a vaseline-smeared lens, misty and nostalgic and lovely. Lana Del Rey would play repeatedly with Lolita imagery in her early career, singing about how romantic it was when she played Lolita to her older boyfriend's Humbert Humbert.

It was, in fact, the idea that Lolita was about not love but horror, that the pleasure of Humbert Humbert's prose was not to be trusted, that was the dissenting view.

In 1995, literary scholar Elizabeth Patnoe describes finding her classmates angrily, belligerently resistant to the idea that it might be possible to despise Humbert Humbert as an unrepentant child sex offender. The men in the classroom, she says, found Humbert relatable and worthy of compassion, and were shocked when she said she hated him because of what he did to Dolores. One accused her of having “cheated the text.”

At the time, to take a moral reading of Lolita was to be embarrassingly Victorian. It was to deny oneself the pleasure of Nabokov's language for no particular reason.

Twenty years later, however, Patnoe's interpretation has picked up steam. It has become, for many readers, the dominant way to read Lolita: by understanding it as a book about the rape of a child, and Humbert as the monster who is trying to fool you. In this reading, the pleasure is a trap.

There's plenty of evidence within Lolita to suggest that we are meant to be looking beneath Humbert's playful sentences for the pain of Dolores Haze.

Even as Humbert insists that it was Dolores who seduced him, he also tells us that Dolores finds her sexual encounters with Humphrey painful, that she cries every night when she thinks that he is asleep, that she hoards her allowance so that she can run away from him. (He steals it back from her, but she runs away from him regardless.) Dolores does seem to have a crush on Humbert when she first meets him, but it vanishes as soon as she is faced with the reality of what exactly he means to do to her.

Under a reading that focuses on Dolores and her pain, even the novel's title and Humbert's repeated invocations of “my Lolita” are an attempt from Humbert to control Dolores as brutally and totally as possible: He has taken even her name from her, and he has made us, his readers, complicit in it.

There is also some evidence that Nabokov endorsed this reading of his book. Speaking to the Paris Review for a 1967 issue, Nabokov appeared appalled when his interviewer suggested that Humbert Humbert had a “touching” quality.

“I would put it differently: Humbert Humbert is a vain and cruel wretch who manages to appear ‘touching,'” Nabokov replied. “That epithet, in its true, tear-iridized sense, can only apply to my poor little girl” — that is to say, Dolores, whose name means sorrow.

In the same interview, however, Nabokov vigorously disavowed any moral or didactic reading of his novels. It's hard to know for sure what he made of Humbert's fans as they multiplied across the decades.

It wasn't until the mid-2010s that a Dolores-centric reading of Lolita finally began to gain more traction.

In the New Republic in 2015, Ira Wells tracked the public's eagerness to read Lolita as the story of a sexually appealing young girl against the language that suggested Dolores's tragedy. “The publication, reception, and cultural re-fashioning of Lolita over the past 60 years is the story of how a twelve-year-old rape victim named Dolores became a dominant archetype for seductive female sexuality in contemporary America,” wrote Wells: “It is the story of how a girl became a noun.”

Probably the most high-profile of these essays came from the feminist critic Rebecca Solnit, in her 2015 LitHub essay “Men Explain Lolita to Me.”

“A nice liberal man came along and explained to me this book was actually an allegory as though I hadn't thought of that yet,” Solnit wrote. “It is, and it's also a novel about a big old guy violating a spindly child over and over and over. Then she weeps.”

The new Lolita takes were becoming mainstream just around the time of the so-called Great Awokening, those days in the late Obama era when it felt urgent and necessary to explore how misogynistic ideologies were encoded into works of art and popular culture. Gamergate and the Fappening ricocheted around the internet.

Then in 2017, Me Too exploded into popular consciousness, and Lolita became, abruptly, very urgent indeed. In novels and memoirs of that time, changing the way you read Lolita became a metaphor for changing the way you think about consent.

When Me Too went mainstream, America began to reconsider old love stories and jokes, wondering if they were really so funny and romantic after all. (Listen, me too.) Almost immediately, commenters on the right began to declare that the left had, just like those killjoy Victorians, gone too far, become too moralistic: that they were destroying art and eroticism alike out of a desire to keep the world sanitized and safe and — using a word that had become a pejorative rather suddenly — woke.

Lolita became a chief exhibit in that argument. Me Too, these commenters declared, was going to come for Lolita, and the book would never have seen the light of day in contemporary publishing. “What's different today is #MeToo and social media — you can organize outrage at the drop of a hat. If Lolita was offered to me today, I'd never be able to get it past the acquisition team,” publisher Dan Franklin was quoted saying in The Spectator, “a committee of 30-year-olds, who'd say, ‘If you publish this book we will all resign.””

You can find Dolores's voice in its pages quite easily, once you start listening for her. 

When I look back on meditations on Lolita around this time, however, what I find are a few declarations that Lolita is a misogynistic novel;  but a great deal more pieces by readers who went back to Lolita expecting to find it appalling, and instead found it holds up remarkably well.

Many of the works of art that were allegedly “canceled” by the excesses of the woke mob in the wake of Me Too are works whose essence changes entirely when you look at them as stories of sexual assault. If you go digging for the voices of the sexual assault victim in, say, Sixteen Candles, you find nothing. Lolita, however, rewards such a read. You can find Dolores's voice in its pages quite easily, once you start listening for her.

“Perhaps—and at Vegas odds—only Lolita can survive the new cultural revolution,” Caitlin Flanagan wrote in The Atlantic in 2018. “No one will ever pick up that novel and issue a shocked report about its true contents; no feminist academic will make her reputation by revealing its oppressive nature. Its explicit subject is as abhorrent today as it was upon the book's publication 60-plus years ago.”

What becomes much more difficult, in such a reading, is enjoying the music of Nabokov's prose without shame.

Since 2018, as the Me Too backlash has mounted, the culture war over Lolita has shifted once again. The question is not, now, over whether someone is trying to cancel Lolita. Instead, it's the same as the old one: How do you handle the pleasure of the novel, and how do you handle the horror? What is the correct way to like Lolita?

In her 2021 essay collection The Devil's Treasure, Mary Gaitskill wrote defensively that she thought Lolita was about love, and that she was sure saying so would lead censorious readers to hurl her book across the room. “I don't think it's ideal love, it's twisted love, but that doesn't mean it isn't love. Probably the majority of Americans who know of that book would say: ‘Yes, in real life Humbert should go to jail, but he's obviously a fictional character and I'm interested to read about him,'” Gaitskill said to The Guardian. “That seems simple, but for more intellectual people, or people who are loud on Twitter, I think it's become contentious.”

In 2020, writer and comedian Jamie Loftus released her Lolita Podcast, an extensive deep dive into the cultural legacy of Lolita. A central part of Loftus's argument was that our culture had gotten Lolita fundamentally wrong by reading it as the story of the temptress Lolita instead of the victim Dolores. “I'm now far more aggravated with how [Lolita] was presented to me than by the work itself,” Loftus said. “For me, a close read of this work reveals that Nabokov is not glorifying the predator. I believe it's our culture that has.”

Now, instead of fighting over who's Victorian and who's modern like they did in the 1950s, we seem to be fighting over who is alternately righteous and refreshingly perceptive.

Versions of this argument over how to read Lolita continue to play out on social media, where Redditors vigorously debate whether people who read the book as a love story are illiterate edgelords stuck in the past, or if people who read the book as a horror story are virtue-signaling social justice obsessives.

The culture wars have a way of making everything they touch look the same. Now, instead of fighting over who's Victorian and who's modern like they did in the 1950s, we seem to be fighting over who is alternately righteous and refreshingly perceptive, who is shrill and moralizing and who is unafraid of petty boundaries.

The person who might be most helpful to us here is, of all people, Lionel Trilling.

“For me one of the attractions of Lolita is its ambiguity of tone … and its ambiguity of intention, its ability to arouse uneasiness, to throw the reader off balance, to require him to change his stance and shift his position and move on,” Trilling wrote, in the same 1958 essay in which he declared that Lolita is about love. “Lolita gives us no chance to settle and sink roots. Perhaps it is the curious moral mobility it urges on us that accounts for its remarkable ability to represent certain aspects of American life.”

Lolita was written by a Russian, but it is about America, the whole vast beautiful seedy map of it, which Humbert and Dolores criss-cross again and again over their horrible year together. It is Lolita's ability to change shape before our eyes, to shift, to mutate, to show us who we are in every era, that makes it such a purely American novel. The more we read Lolita, the more it has to show us about who we are.

You all deserved better.

Dear Colleagues,

For three and a half decades as a career diplomat, I walked across the lobby of the State Department countless times—inspired by the Stars and Stripes and humbled by the names of patriots etched into our memorial wall. It was heartbreaking to see so many of you crossing that same lobby in tears following the reduction in force in July, carrying cardboard boxes with family photos and the everyday remains of proud careers in public service. After years of hard jobs in hard places—defusing crises, tending alliances, opening markets, and helping Americans in distress—­you deserved better.

The same is true for so many other public servants who have been fired or pushed out in recent months: the remarkable intelligence officers I was proud to lead as CIA director, the senior military officers I worked with every day, the development specialists I served alongside overseas, and too many others with whom we've served at home and abroad.

The work you all did was unknown to many Americans, rarely well understood or well appreciated. And under the guise of reform, you all got caught in the crossfire of a retribution campaign—of a war on public service and expertise.

Those of us who have served in public institutions understand that serious reforms are overdue. Of course we should remove bureaucratic hurdles that prevent agencies like the State Department from operating efficiently. But there is a smart way and a dumb way to tackle reform, a humane way and an intentionally traumatizing way.

If today's process were truly about sensible reform, career officers—who typically rotate roles every few years—wouldn't have been fired simply because their positions have fallen out of political favor.

If this process were truly about sensible reform, crucial experts in technology or China policy in whom our country has invested so much wouldn't have been pushed out.

If this process were truly about reform, it would have addressed not only the manifestations of bloat and in­efficiencies but also their causes—including congressionally mandated budget items.

And if this process were truly about sensible reform, you and your families wouldn't have been treated with gleeful indignity. One of your colleagues, a career diplomat, was given just six hours to clear out his office. “When I was expelled from Russia,” he said, “at least Putin gave me six days to leave.”

No, this is not about reform. It is about retribution. It is about breaking people and breaking institutions by sowing fear and mistrust throughout our government. It is about paralyzing public servants—making them apprehensive about what they say, how it might be interpreted, and who might report on them. It is about deterring anyone from daring to speak truth to power.

I served six presidents: three Republicans and three Democrats. It was my duty to faithfully implement their decisions, even when I didn't agree with them. Career public servants have a profound obligation to execute the decisions of elected leaders, whether we voted for them or not; that discipline is essential to any democratic system.

Many of your fellow officers purged at the State Department were doing just that—faithfully executing decisions that ran contrary to their professional advice and preferences. They may not have supported the cancellation of Fulbright scholarships, the resettlement of Afrikaners, the expulsion of the Afghan partners who fought and bled with us for two decades, but they implemented those policies anyway. Still, those officers were fired.

Tensions between elected political leaders and career public servants are hardly new. Each of the presidents I served harbored periodic concerns about the reliability and sluggishness of government bureaucracy. Although individual officers could be remarkably resourceful, the State Department as an institution was rarely accused of being too agile or too full of initiative. There is a difference, however, between fixing bureaucratic malaise and hammering professional public servants into politicized robots.

Good on Paper: Maybe we do need DOGE

That's what autocrats do. They cow public servants into submission—and in doing so, they create a closed system that is free of opposing views and inconvenient concerns. Their policy making, their ability to realize their aims, suffers as a result.

Vladimir Putin's foolish decision to invade Ukraine in February 2022 offers a powerful example. Putin operated within a tight circle in the run-up to the war. He relied on a handful of long-serving advisers who either shared his flawed assumptions about Ukraine's ability to resist and the West's willingness to support it, or had learned a long time ago that it was not career-enhancing to question Putin's judgment. The results, especially in the first year of the war, were catastrophic for Russia.

For all its flaws and im­per­fections, our system still allows disciplined dissent—and it's better for it. Just as it is the duty of public servants to carry out orders we don't agree with, it is also our duty to be honest about our concerns within appropriate channels—­or to resign if we can't in good conscience follow those orders. Sound decision making suffers if experts feel like they cannot offer their candid or contrary insights.

I could not have done my job as an ambassador, as a deputy secretary of state, or as the CIA director unless my colleagues were straightforward about their views. When I led secret talks with the Iranians more than a decade ago, I needed the unvarnished advice of diplomats and intelligence officers to help me navigate the complex world of nuclear programs and Iranian decision making. I needed colleagues to question my judgment sometimes, and offer creative, hard-nosed solutions.

There is a real danger in punishing dissent—not only to our profession, but to our country. Once you start, policy can become an extension of court politics, with little airing of alternative views or consideration of second- and third-order consequences.

Like some of you, I'm old enough to have lived through other efforts at reform and streamlining. After the end of the Cold War, budgets were cut significantly, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the U.S. Information Agency were absorbed into the State Department. Years later, when I was serving as the American ambassador in Moscow, we reduced staff by about 15 percent over three years. None of those was a perfect process, but they were conducted in a thoughtful way, respectful of public servants and their expertise.

Long before any of us served in government, amid the escalation of the Cold War, in the 1950s, McCarthyism provided a vivid example of an alternative approach, full of deliberate trauma and casual cruelty. A generation of China specialists was falsely accused of being Communist sympathizers and driven from the State Department, kneecapping American diplomacy toward Beijing for years. Today's “reform” process—­at State and elsewhere across the federal government—­bears much more resemblance to Mc­Carthy's costly excesses than to any other era in which I've served. And it's much more damaging.

We live in a new era—one that is marked by major-power competition and a revolution in technology, and one that is more confusing, complicated, and combustible than any time before. I believe the United States still has a better hand to play than any of our rivals, unless we squander the moment and throw away some of our best cards. That's exactly what the current administration is doing.

We cannot afford to further erode the sources of our power at home and abroad. The demolition of institutions—­the dismantling of USAID and Voice of America, the planned 50 percent reduction in the State Department's budget—is part of a bigger strategic self-­immolation. We've put at risk the network of alliances and partnerships that is the envy of our rivals. We've even gutted the research funding that powers our economy.

If intelligence analysts at the CIA saw our rivals engage in this kind of great-power suicide, we would break out the bourbon. Instead, the sound we hear is of champagne glasses clinking in the Kremlin and Zhongnanhai.

Of course we should put our own national interests first. But winning in an intensely competitive world means thinking beyond narrowly defined self-interest and building coalitions that counterbalance our adversaries; it requires working together on “problems without passports” such as climate change and global health challenges, which no single country can solve on its own.

At our best, over the years I served in government, we were guided by enlightened self-interest, a balance of hard power and soft power. That's what produced victory in the Cold War, the reunification of Germany, the coalition success in Operation Desert Storm, peace in the Balkans, nuclear-arms-control treaties, and the defense of Ukraine against Putin's aggression. The bi­partisan PEPFAR program is a shining example of America at its best—saving tens of millions of people from the deadly threat of HIV/AIDS while also fostering some measure of stability in sub-Saharan Africa, establishing wider trust in American leadership, and keeping Americans safe.

We weren't always at our best, or always especially enlightened, as we stumbled into protracted and draining conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, or when we didn't press allies hard enough to contribute their fair share. Criticism of the current administration should not obscure any of that, or suggest a misplaced nostalgia for an im­perfect past.

From the December 2022 issue: George Packer on a new theory of American power

The growing danger today, however, is that we're focused exclusively on the “self” part of enlightened self-interest—at the expense of the “enlightened” part. The threat we face is not from an imaginary “deep state” bent on undermining an elected president, but from a weak state of hollowed-out institutions and battered and be­littled public servants, no longer able to uphold the guardrails of our democracy or help the United States compete in an un­forgiving world. We won't beat hostile autocrats by imitating them.

Many years ago, when I was finishing graduate school and trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my professional life, my father sent me a note. He was a career Army officer, a remarkably decent man, and the best model of public service I have ever known. “Nothing can make you prouder,” my dad wrote, “than to serve your country with honor.” I've spent the past 40 years learning the truth in his advice.

I am deeply proud to have served alongside so many of you. Your expertise and your often quietly heroic public service have made an immeasurable contribution to the best interests of our country. You swore an oath—not to a party or a president, but to the Constitution. To the people of the United States.

To protect us. To defend us. To keep us safe.

You've fulfilled your oath, just as those still serving in government are trying their best to fulfill theirs. So will the next generation of public servants.

All of us have a profound stake in shaping their inheritance. I worry about how much damage we will do in the meantime. There is still a chance that the next generation will serve in a world where we curb the worst of our current excesses—stop betraying the ideals of public service, stop firing experts just because their statistics are unwelcome, and stop blowing up institutions that matter to our future. There is still a chance that the next generation could be present at the creation of a new era for America in the world, in which we're mindful of our many strengths but more careful about overreach.

There is, sadly, room for doubt about those chances. At this pivotal moment, there's a growing possibility that we will inflict so much damage on ourselves and our place in the world that those future public servants will instead find themselves present at the destruction—a self-inflicted, generational setback to American leadership and national security.

But what I do not doubt is the abiding importance of public service, and the value of what you have done with yours. And I know that you will continue to serve in different ways, helping to stand watch over our great experiment, even as too many of our elected leaders seem to be turning their backs on it.

With appreciation to you and your families,

            Not long ago, American conservative orthodoxy held that when it comes to doing business, the government that governs least governs best.
    


            The orthodoxy manifested itself in familiar ways. Groups that claimed the mantle of individual liberties would decry new legislation. Talk radio and podcasts would mock unnamed bureaucrats for ham-fisted overreach. And powerful business lobbies were quick to denounce — in press releases and even lawsuits — regulations or taxes they saw as government overreach.
    


            But when faced with President Donald Trump's efforts to seize control of private enterprise — such as his recent arrangement to have the US pocket a portion of Nvidia's sales to China, his social media outbursts at individual executives, his moves to take a stake in Intel, and his use of executive powers to cajole banks and law firms he perceives as insufficiently loyal — those same groups have gone quiet.
    


            Take the US Chamber of Commerce, the largest business advocacy group in the country.
    


            Last year, the Chamber sued a federal consumer watchdog group for attempting to cap credit card late fees at $8 a month, claiming the agency “exceeded its statutory authority.” In 2023, it sued the Biden administration over provisions for Medicare price negotiations in the Inflation Reduction Act, claiming the move would consolidate “unfettered and unchecked power” to the department of Health and Human Services.
    


            But under Trump's second term, the Chamber has had little to say publicly about Trump's aggressive meddling in the private sector.
    


            Similarly, the Business Roundtable, another DC-based lobbying group that represents hundreds of chief executives, has rarely been shy about denouncing what it sees as presidential overreach in the form of taxes and environmental regulations. This year, though, the group has been largely MIA on the MAGA shift toward a style of capitalism that more closely resembles the autocratic regimes of Russia and China.
    


            Both groups have criticized Trump's trade war, warning that tariffs hurt American businesses. But neither has spoken out about the president's more direct assault on free enterprise.
    


            Neither the Chamber of Commerce nor the Business Roundtable responded to multiple requests for comment.
    


            The president, a self-styled dealmaker, has thrown out the standard free-market playbook in ways that have alarmed lawmakers, investors and legal experts. And suddenly, the legal protections businesses have long counted on appear shaky, said Philip M. Nichols, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
    


            “Any business that sticks its head up, or any business person that sticks their head up, is taking a risk that can't be calculated,” Nichols said in an interview. “What's the smart thing to do — what do the wildebeest do when they get to the crocodile-infected river? They wait for the other wildebeest to jump in, and then follow.”
    


Trump is tightening his grip on the economy, taking a page from China



            Several trade groups have privately drafted plans to push back against the Trump administration in defense of their business interests, people familiar with the matter told CNN. But those plans were shelved at the request of members that are worried about drawing White House ire.
    


            “There's an ‘Eye of Sauron' element here that everyone is very aware of,” one manufacturing CEO told CNN, referring to the “Lord of the Rings” character that brought all subjects to heel. “But there's also a recognition that this is an administration that is transactional if they believe you're on board with their agenda.”
    


            When it comes to exerting his influence over Corporate America, no matter appears too small or too large for Trump's input.
    


            Last month, the president took credit for Coca-Cola's decision to roll out a cane-sugar-sweetened product that aligns with his allies' “Make America Healthy Again” philosophy. He regularly criticizes CEOs in public for perceived slights, demanded that Intel's boss resign over unspecified conflicts, and urged Goldman Sachs to fire its top economist after the bank said tariffs would raise consumer prices (a fact virtually all economists agree to be true, and which we are now seeing borne out in reality).
    


            While much of that bluster is run-of-the-mill Trump rhetoric, the president shocked trade experts when he announced an unorthodox (and potentially illegal) arrangement with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD earlier this month. In exchange for export licenses that allow them to sell their products in China, the companies agreed to funnel 15% of their China sales to the US government — a setup that some analysts called a “shakedown” of private enterprise.
    


            The White House's push into private businesses took another turn Tuesday when officials confirmed the administration was considering using taxpayer money to acquire a stake in struggling chipmaker Intel. The primary reason for such a move, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said, was the president's desire to reduce US dependence on Taiwan for chip production. But he also said Trump believes the government should have “equity” in tech giants.
    


            The silence from Corporate America to Trump's incursion into private businesses isn't entirely unexpected. Businesses have lost their appetite for the kind of socially progressive rhetoric many adopted in response to the 2020 murder of George Floyd. At the same time, Trump's return to the White House came with a cost-benefit analysis for any business leaders thinking of speaking out: Make yourself a target, or fall in line and wait for the massive tax cuts the president has promised.
    


            “Corporate citizens are harmed just like flesh and blood citizens are harmed when you have a leader who… actively seeks to monetize public office and actively seeks to use the power of the presidency to harm perceived enemies or anyone who doesn't appropriately capitulate,” Donald Sherman, executive director of the Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CNN. “In some ways, this is the natural and predictable result of failing to appropriately stand up to President Trump's anti-democratic and authoritarian tendencies during his first term.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revealed on Tuesday that the “entire” border wall will be painted black at the behest of President Donald Trump to deter illegal immigrants from climbing the barrier along the southern border.

Noem said “technology, cameras, sensors” will be added to the border wall in addition to the new paint job.

“Today, we are also going to be painting it black. That is specifically at the request of the president, who understands that in the hot temperatures down here, when something is painted black, it gets even warmer, and it will make it even harder for people to climb,” the secretary said at a press conference in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, where she was joined by Customs and Border Protection officials.

The border wall is not only tall but deeply entrenched in the ground, factors that the Department of Homeland Security chief noted make it difficult for illegal immigrants to bypass the structure.

The announcement came one month after Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which allocated $46.5 billion out of the total $165 billion that the DHS received for the construction of the border wall.

“We had an incredible amount of resources allocated to us in the big beautiful bill, because that's going to allow us to continue construction,” Noem said.

“Construction right now is at the pace of a little bit less than a half a mile a day,” she added, “and the border wall will look very different based on the topography and the geography of where it is built.”

It remains unclear how long it would take to paint the whole border wall black and how much it would cost.

TEXAS STOPS FUNDING US-MEXICO BORDER WALL AFTER FINISHING JUST A FRACTION OF STATE WALL

The first Trump administration built a 452-mile stretch of the border wall. After Trump left office in 2021, then-President Joe Biden halted construction before later taking up the project. However, after losing a lawsuit last year, the Biden administration voluntarily filled in certain portions of the wall, becoming legally obligated to continue construction with previously appropriated funds.

During his first term, Trump considered painting the border wall black to make it harder for illegal immigrants to climb during the summer. At the time, CBP officials tested the black coating on certain sections of the wall using coal tar epoxy. Trump is now reviving the strategy.

            The White House launched a TikTok account on Tuesday amid uncertainty about the app's future, as another deadline approaches for its parent company, Bytedance, to sell to a US buyer or be banned in the United States.
    


            President Donald Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline of a sale-or-ban law passed under former President Joe Biden's administration, with the new deadline less than a month away on September 17.
    


            The latest delay in June kept the app accessible for its 170 million American users, despite the legislation that passed last year with bipartisan support over concerns that TikTok's Chinese ownership poses a US national security risk. And it came as both the United States and China sought leverage in tense trade talks.
    


            TikTok's ultimate fate in the US remains unclear, but the official White House account is a signal the app could be here to stay.
    


            The first post on the official White House TikTok account features video of Trump as he says, “Every day, I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation. I am your voice.” The post's caption reads, “America we are BACK! What's up TikTok?”
    


            As of 8 p.m. on Tuesday, shortly after launching, the account had garnered more than 20,000 followers.
    


            This is the administration's first official TikTok account. Both Trump and Biden launched accounts during the 2024 presidential campaign, drawing scrutiny as the leaders had previously raised national security concerns with the app.
    


            TikTok doesn't operate in China, but the Chinese government enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction.
    


            The US government has said it's worried China could use its national security laws to access the significant amount of personal information that TikTok, like most social media applications, collects from its US users.
    


            The TikTok sale-or-ban law went into effect on January 19 after Biden signed it last year. TikTok briefly took itself offline, sparking outcry from creators, but quickly came back after Trump signed an order delaying the ban's enforcement by 75 days in one of the first acts of his second term. The president's June delay marked his third extension of the ban.

Federal Reserve officials worried at their July meeting about the state of the labor market and inflation, though most agreed that it was too soon to lower interest rates, minutes released Wednesday showed. The meeting summary depicted a divergence of opinion among the central bankers, whose vote to hold their key rate steady came despite objections from two Fed governors who argued in favor of cutting.

Policymakers noted rising threats to the economy that would warrant monitoring, though they largely agreed that their current stance was the appropriate way to go.

"Participants generally pointed to risks to both sides of the Committee's dual mandate, emphasizing upside risk to inflation and downside risk to employment," the minutes noted. While "a majority of participants judged the upside risk to inflation as the greater of these two risks" a couple saw "downside risk to employment the more salient risk."

Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman voted against the decision to hold rates steady, preferring instead that the Federal Open Market Committee start lowering its key rate. The fed funds rate, which sets what banks charge each other for overnight lending but is used as a benchmark for other consumer rates, has been targeted between 4.25%-4.5% since December.

This was the first time that multiple governors voted against a rate decision in more than 30 years.

President Donald Trump's tariffs were a central part of the discussion.

"Regarding upside risks to inflation, participants pointed to the uncertain effects of tariffs and the possibility of inflation expectations becoming unanchored," the minutes said. The document also noted "considerable uncertainty remained about the timing, magnitude, and persistence of the effects of this year's increase in tariffs."

Coming against an increasingly heated political backdrop, the meeting saw officials express varying opinions on where they see the economy and policy headed. A staff assessment saw economic growth as "tepid" in the first half of the year though unemployment remained low.

Various participants expressed uncertainty over the impact that tariffs would have on inflation while others worried that the jobs picture was starting to show cracks and would need a policy boost to prevent further damage.

"Participants noted that the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if elevated inflation proved to be more persistent while the outlook for the labor market weakened," the summary said. Decisions on rates would depend on "each variable's distance from the Committee's goal and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close."

The meeting came just two days before a Bureau of Labor Statistics release showing that nonfarm payrolls growth had not only remained weak in July but also that June and May had seen much weaker growth than originally reported.

Even without that information in hand, Fed officials noted that "downside risk to employment had meaningfully increased with the slowing of the growth of economic activity and consumer spending, and that some incoming data pointed to a weakening of labor market conditions."

The minutes were released two days ahead of the main event for the Fed this week: Chair Jerome Powell delivers his keynote address Friday morning during the central bank's annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Powell is expected to use the speech to indicate at least a short-term direction for the Fed regarding rates as well as a longer-term view on policy.

Trump has exerted fierce political pressure on the Fed to cut rates. The president has berated Powell as "stupid," "a loser" and other invectives while also criticizing the board.

With the resignation earlier this month of Governor Adriana Kugler, Trump will get to appoint another of his own candidates to the seat. Powell's term as chair expires in May 2026, though he can stay on as governor if he wishes through 2028. In the latest wrinkle, Trump has demanded the resignation of Governor Lisa Cook amid claims that she committed mortgage fraud regarding federal loans she received for properties in Georgia and Michigan.

In the case of the Powell seat, the White House has identified 11 potential candidates, including several current and past Fed officials along with economists and Wall Street strategists.

Correction: This article has been updated to correct the spelling of Adriana Kugler's name.

The U.S. health regulator has allowed a study of Rocket Pharmaceuticals' gene therapy to resume, less than three months after halting it following a patient's death.

The drugmaker's shares soared over 30% in morning trading on Wednesday.

Rocket's mid-stage trial, testing its experimental therapy, RP-A501, for a genetic disorder called Danon disease, was halted in May by the Food and Drug Administration after a patient died from a rare complication.

The company said on Wednesday that the FDA has lifted its clinical hold on the trial, to be resumed with a revised pre-treatment regime and a lower dose of the gene therapy.

Rocket said it will discontinue prophylactic use of drugs that inhibit the C3 protein, which is part of the immune system, as part of the pre-treatment regime.

The patient who died in the May trial was one of two who were administered the C3 inhibitors. The patient had suffered from capillary leak syndrome, which can cause organ failure.

In the new trial, three patients, at least four weeks apart, are expected to receive a lower dose of its therapy. Rocket said the adjusted dose was proposed based on data from an early-stage study, which showed a better safety profile.

Danon disease, which affects males more severely than females, causes heart muscle damage and progressive muscle weakness. Fewer than 1,000 people in the United States are currently known to have the condition, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Intel is in talks with other large investors to receive an equity infusion at a discounted price, people familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber.

Intel stock slid 7% on Wednesday, more than erasing its gains from earlier this week. The stock initially surged as investors responded to Intel's announcement of a $2 billion capital injection from SoftBank and reports that the Trump administration is weighing different ways to get involved with the company.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC on Tuesday that the U.S. government must receive an equity stake in Intel in exchange for CHIPS Act funds.

Sources told Faber that the chipmaker is now looking beyond SoftBank for an equity boost.

"They need money to build whatever it is that the customers may actually, ultimately want," Faber said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." "And having the CHIPS Act money, which is free, so to speak, no strings attached, become equity is not helpful to them because it's dilutive."

Intel is attempting a turnaround after suffering from years of declining sales and shrinking market share.

The company has struggled to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom in advanced semiconductors and has spent heavily to stand up a manufacturing business that's yet to secure a significant customer.

Intel has also overhauled its leadership, bringing in Lip-Bu Tan to be its CEO in March, after his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was ousted in December.

Two weeks ago, President Donald Trump called for Tan to resign, saying he was "highly CONFLICTED."

The president's tone toward Tan and the company cooled after the CEO visited the White House to discuss his background.

The head of President Donald Trump's housing regulatory agency said Wednesday that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook will have to resign, or else be fired for cause, over what he claims is evidence of "mortgage fraud" by the central bank official.

"To be honest, I think she needs to resign quickly," Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said of Cook on CNBC's "Money Movers."

"I think she will have to resign, or I think she will be fired."

The remarks came hours after Trump, reacting to Pulte's letter asking the Department of Justice to criminally investigate Cook, demanded that the governor "must resign, now!!!"

The letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi is the latest example of the Trump administration airing allegations of mortgage-related wrongdoing against the president's opponents. The Justice Department is investigating Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and New York Attorney General Letitia James on similar grounds.

It also shows Trump expanding his efforts for the Fed to slash interest rates, a pressure campaign that so far has mostly focused on central bank chairman Jerome Powell.

Cook, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden in 2022, voted with the majority on the Federal Open Market Committee to keep rates unchanged after the group's latest meeting last month.

The Fed and the DOJ declined CNBC's requests for comment on Pulte's claims and Trump's reaction.

Pulte's central allegation is that Cook claimed two different properties as her primary residence at the same time. 

"You cannot do that in America," he said on CNBC.

The agency chief, who has aggressively backed Trump's frequent attacks on the Fed and Powell, insisted that his actions were apolitical.

"There's no funny business here," he said. "This is straightforward stuff, and if you commit mortgage fraud, especially in black and white, you will be prosecuted."

But he tore into Cook at length on social media earlier Wednesday morning.

"Lisa Cooked is cooked," he wrote in one post.

In another, Pulte wrote that he believes Trump "has cause to fire" the Fed governor.

Central bank governors can only be removed for "cause" under the law, which is generally understood to mean serious misconduct.

Pulte repeated on CNBC that "of course" there was cause to fire Cook — though he appeared to suggest that Powell, not Trump, could be the one to do it. 

"I'll tell you this, Jay Powell, he has a chance to do the right thing by the law. I mean, this is just, you know, this is common sense, what he needs to do here," Pulte said.

But The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 states explicitly that board members can only be removed by the president.

Moreover, the Supreme Court suggested earlier this year that the president does not have the authority to arbitrarily remove Fed governors over policy disagreements.

Pulte's letter, dated Friday, alleged that mortgage documents obtained by FHFA appear to show Cook "falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud."

He accused Cook of "falsifying residence statuses" for a residence in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and a property in Atlanta, Georgia "in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms."

For both properties, Cook "appears to have acquired mortgages that do not meet certain lending requirements and could have received favorable loan terms under fraudulent circumstances," Pulte alleged.

Pulte in his social-media spree Wednesday morning also wielded his claims about Cook against Powell.

"I hear Jay Powell is scrambling this morning. He can scramble all he wants, but he might as well be scrambling eggs, because the party at the Fed is OVER!" he wrote at one point.

He claimed in another post, "Powell must look into it or he is complicit."

Bill Gates-backed Robotics startup Field AI has raised $405 million in two funding rounds, with investments from Nvidia's venture capital arm and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' family office.

The funding comes during an "aha moment," founder and CEO Ali Agha told CNBC, as software and hardware reach an inflection point.

"We are growing," he said. "This funding announcement is to respond to the customer demand."

The latest round values the two-year-old startup at $2 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified to discuss financial information.

Along with NVentures and Bezos Expeditions, the rounds included investments from Khosla Ventures, Temasek, Canaan Partners and Intel Capital. Samsung and Gates Frontier, the Microsoft founder's investment fund, previously invested in the company.

The Irvine, California-based company also said the rounds were oversubscribed. Agha said most investors approached FieldAI about investing.

Field AI's latest round comes during a busy period for robotics startups as companies look to beef up their artificial intelligence offerings and improve on efficiency. Two-time CNBC Disruptor 50 startup Gecko Robotics raised $125 million in June to surpass a $1 billion valuation.

Field AI, which includes former Deepmind, SpaceX, Amazon, Tesla Autopilot and NASA employees, creates models used to control robots worldwide and works across sectors, including construction, energy and logistics.

The "effortless transferability" across environments and limited work on the customer side helps companies scale robots quickly, Agha said.

Agha spent nearly a decade at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and specializes in robotics autonomy and physical AI. Agha said Field AI has added more than 100 positions over the last few months to meet growing customer demands and address labor shortages and safety efficiency needs.

HR software firm Dayforce said on Wednesday it was in advanced discussions to be acquired by Thoma Bravo for $70 per share, as private equity firms look to software as growth drivers in an uncertain economy.

Dayforce's shares rose more than 3% before the bell.

The offer represents a premium of 32.4% based on the stock's closing price on August 15, before the talks were first reported, and a deal value of $11.18 billion, according to Reuters calculations.

If finalized, the deal will mark another private equity buyout of a software firm, with Thoma Bravo betting on the build-out of artificial-intelligence software and the resilience of recurring revenue in an economy pressured by trade tariffs and erratic spending.

The human capital management market has undergone significant consolidation, with big players buying up smaller firms to bolster their products and grab market share amid signs of a deteriorating labor market.

Paychex announced its acquisition of rival Paycor for $4.1 billion at the start of the year, while Automatic Data Processing acquired WorkForce Software last year for around $1.2 billion.

Dayforce said there could be no assurances of whether an agreement for a transaction would be reached.

The company, which provides human capital management and payroll services through its software platform, has seen its stock lose more than 9% of its value so far this year, underperforming peers.

Microsoft and the NFL announced on Wednesday that they're extending their partnership to bring real-time game data and analysis to coaches and players using Microsoft Copilot and Azure artificial intelligence.

The multiyear partnership will upgrade the NFL's sideline viewing system by equipping 32 teams with more than 2,500 custom-built Microsoft Surface Copilot tablets to enhance data collection during game days. Microsoft and the NFL said the deal will also support operations by helping managers track factors such as weather delays or technical equipment issues.

The NFL and Microsoft are not disclosing how long the extension will be or the total cost of the deal.

"Enhancing the league is a responsibility we take seriously, and Microsoft has been a trusted sideline technology partner for over a decade. With Microsoft's AI technologies, including Copilot, we see tremendous opportunities to elevate the gameday experience for our clubs and deliver an even more compelling product to our fans," NFL Chief Information Officer Gary Brantley said in a press release.

The extension builds on a long-standing partnership between Microsoft and the NFL. Since the 2014 season, all NFL teams have had access to league-provided, specially configured Microsoft Surface tablets, according to the NFL. Previously, Microsoft had more than 2,300 Surface sideline viewing system devices installed across the NFL.

NFL Deputy CIO Aaron Amendolia told CNBC in an interview that the existing tablets have already been swapped out for the preseason and the new devices are being used on the field now.

He said that during live games, players have only seconds on the bench between plays to analyze formations and look at different angles and pictures. AI helps players and coaches filter through that tremendous amount of data automatically, Amendolia said.

"This is not AI making decisions. It's not AI informing decisions. What it really is, is AI allowing people to get at information faster with less manual intervention," Amendolia said.

For coaches, Amendolia said game data such as snap counts or personnel counts on the field can be fed into an Excel sheet in real time with Copilot, which frees them from doing such tasks and calculations themselves.

Most recently during the 2025 NFL Combine, coaches and scouts used Microsoft Azure AI to evaluate more than 300 prospective players for selection in the NFL draft.

Microsoft said Wednesday that clubs will soon be able to use AI for drafts outside of the NFL Combine, as well as for productivity across all business functions, including finance, human resources and events.

Football club staff will also soon be able to use AI agents for player scouting and salary cap management, Microsoft said.

The league has already implemented a type of artificial intelligence into its OnePass fan guide app for events, Amendolia said, that can help with fan questions and answers. He said the NFL is trying to train that so-called agentic AI to be more customer service focused.

The tech giant is also separately working to infuse Azure AI video tools during teams' practice sessions to help with coaching, evaluations and player injury assessments.

Amendolia said this video component will involve automatically analyzing metadata so users can quickly find certain players, camera angles or plays in video footage.

Meta just made the biggest reorganization of its artificial intelligence operations to date.

Business Insider obtained the full email sent by 28-year-old Alexandr Wang, the leader of Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL, to all Meta employees who work on AI.

As the AI arms race continues, Meta has been assembling an all-star team of talent, trying to poach researchers from rival AI labs with massive offers as it races to build "personal superintelligence." Tensions have already emerged within the newly formed team between the lavishly compensated new hires and the existing researchers, some of whom have threatened to quit, Business Insider previously reported.

In the recent email sent to employees, Wang wrote that "superintelligence is coming," and to "take it seriously," Meta needs to make major changes.

That includes establishing four distinct teams that focus on research, training, products, and infrastructure.

The email also made one thing clear: most of MSL's new division heads report directly to Wang — including investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June.

It's the latest in a series of AI reorgs for Meta. In less than six months, Meta has already dissolved two major AI teams.

Wang's email warned that organizational changes can be "disruptive," but said it's necessary to increase how fast Meta can achieve superintelligence, which is when AI surpasses humans in virtually any intellectual field.

In response to a New York Times article about the reorg, Meta communications director Andy Stone posted on X on Tuesday, criticizing the media for 'navel-gazing' about MSL's new structure:

#navelgazing #nAIvelgazingMeta: We're bringing in talent to focus on building superintelligence Media: BUT HOW WILL THESE TEAMS BE STRUCTURED?!  Meta: Here's how the superintelligence teams will be structured Media: LOOK, LOOK, ANOTHER SHAKEUP AT META! https://t.co/xPnWDC1R0F

Meta declined to comment further.

Meta is centralizing research across two units: TBD Lab, a small team focused on training large AI models, and FAIR, Meta's long-standing AI research organization, per Wang's email.

MSL's research will be led by its new chief scientist, ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao — the only leader that Wang's memo doesn't mention reporting directly to him.

TBD will also be in charge of exploring "new directions," such as building an "omni" model. Wang's email does not provide further details about "omni." Meta didn't respond when asked by Business Insider what "omni" would entail.

An omnipotent model that could understand everything, not just text, would be in line with the multimodal focus shown by MSL's first hires, which included multiple experts in audio, video, and other mediums.

Separately, Meta had contractors work on "Project Omni" to train its chatbots to be hyper-engaging by messaging users first and remembering chats, Business Insider reported last month.

The email goes on to say that FAIR will be an "innovation engine" for MSL's training runs by feeding its research directly to TBD Lab.

That's a more active role for FAIR than before. FAIR is known for publishing higher-level AI research and giving its employees a level of independence similar to academia.

In the past, there was relatively little transfer between FAIR and Meta's generative AI division, but that seems to be changing now, a FAIR employee who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation told Business Insider.

FAIR will continue to be run by Rob Fergus, and Yann LeCun will continue to be its chief scientist, "with both reporting to me," Wang said in the email.

It confirms Bloomberg reporting that LeCun would report to Wang, amid confusion over the fact that MSL technically has two chief scientists now: LeCun and Zhao.

Friedman, the investor and former GitHub CEO, will lead MSL's efforts to integrate AI into Meta's products, Wang's email said, offering few further details.

For years, Meta has been trying to make things like AI glasses and the Quest virtual reality headset go mainstream. Those products have garnered good reviews, but have yet to make up a meaningful portion of Meta's revenue.

When Meta internally announced the creation of MSL in June, it said that Friedman would partner with Wang to lead MSL, heading its work on AI products and applied research. In the email, Wang made it clear that Friedman reports to him.

"Nat will continue to lead this work reporting to me," Wang wrote.

Training and running powerful AI models requires massive amounts of specialized infrastructure — like clusters of thousands of Nvidia chips in vast data centers.

MSL's infra team will be led by Aparna Ramani, a longtime Meta engineering VP whose LinkedIn profile says she leads all of Meta's AI infrastructure.

Infrastructure has been an early focus at MSL since it announced its first hires, which included Joel Pobar, who previously led infrastructure efforts at Anthropic.

As part of the reorganization, Meta is dissolving the AGI Foundations team, Wang's memo said, which it created back in May.

That's the second time Meta has closed a major AI unit this year. AGI Foundations was born out of the GenAI division, which spearheaded Meta's Llama AI models but was then itself dissolved after Meta's most recent AI model, Llama 4, received a lukewarm reception.

Members of the AGI Foundations team will be spread across product, infrastructure, and FAIR, Wang's email states. Notably, TBD is not mentioned as a destination for ex-AGI Foundation members.

The restructuring raises questions about whether yet another reorg can put Meta back at the cutting edge of AI.

Meta's constant reshuffling contrasts with AI rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, which have faced fewer organizational upheavals.

Meta's reorganization plan was first reported by The Information last week.

Claire's announced Wednesday it is selling most of its North American business to private equity firm Ames Watson, just weeks after the jewelry retailer declared bankruptcy.

The companies did not disclose any financial details of the deal.

Claire's said the move comes as the tween retailer is examining every option to "maximize the value of its business." It also said it will pause the liquidation process at most of its stores as part of the deal, which Claire's said will "significantly benefit" the company.

Claire's said the liquidation process will continue at some of its North American stores.

"As we continue through our restructuring proceedings, our team has worked tirelessly to explore every option for preserving the value of the Claire's business and brand," CEO Chris Cramer said in a statement. "We are glad to reach this definitive agreement to sell a portion of our North America operations to Ames Watson and maximize the value of our company for all our stakeholders."

Ames Watson is a private holding company with more than $2 billion in revenue, focused on purchasing and transforming companies, according to its website. Its portfolio includes Lids, Champion Teamwear and South Moon Under.

"We are committed to investing in its future by preserving a significant retail footprint across North America, working closely with the Claire's team to ensure a seamless transition and creating a renewed path to growth based on our deep experience working with consumer brands," Ames Watson's co-founder Lawrence Berger said in a statement.

The retailer filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month, weighed down by nearly $500 million in debt and an increasingly competitive sales environment. The company is also expected to bear the brunt of tariff impacts on suppliers from countries such as China and Vietnam.

Claire's last filed for bankruptcy protection in 2018, also due to a staggering debt load. At the time, the company underwent a strategic restructuring and raised new capital, which allowed it to eliminate nearly $2 billion in debt and keep stores running.

U.S. President Donald Trump has been on a multimillion-dollar bond-buying spree since taking office in January, investing in debt issued by local authorities, gas districts and major American corporations.

Across 33 pages of filings to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE), dated Aug. 12, the president outlined 690 transactions that have taken place since he took office. The documents were made public on Tuesday.

According to CNBC calculations, the purchases had a total value of at least $100 million, assuming the lower value end listed for each disclosed transaction.

By law, the U.S. president, vice president and other select officials must periodically declare "reportable transactions" to the OGE. The precise value of these dealings does not have to be reported.

The extensive lists filed earlier this month show that, over the course of this year, Trump has bought bonds sold by various entities, including local U.S. governments, as well as gas districts, water supply districts, hospital authorities and school boards.

Trump also bought debt issued by an array of big-name companies. The documents point to purchases of between $500,000 and $1,000,000 worth of bonds issued by T-Mobile U.S., United Health and Home Depot each in early February. Later that month, he procured debt issued by Facebook and Instagram parent Meta, worth between $250,000 and $500,000.

The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

Companies, governments and other groups issue bonds to raise capital to carry out projects, fuel growth, refinance existing debt or to bolster financial stability. Investors who purchase the bonds receive interest payments — either fixed or variable — over an agreed period, along with the return of the full loan amount at the end of that period.

Some of the companies whose debt is now owned by Trump have been directly impacted by his policies or business dealings.

The White House leader has a net worth of $5.5 billion, according to Forbes. In 2020 — the last year of his first presidential term — Trump was worth $2.1 billion, according to the magazine. Forbes has labeled the years between his two terms "the most lucrative post-presidency in American history" thanks to a series of ventures marketed to his supporters.

Trump's political rivals have previously accused him of various conflicts of interest during his tenure as president. Under federal law, the president and vice president are exempt from some regulation relating to conflicts of interest among federal officials — but according to non-profit watchdog CREW, every modern president prior to Trump has opted to divest their business interests before taking office.

President Donald Trump will tap his top economic advisor Kevin Hassett to be the next Federal Reserve chair, according to respondents to a special Jackson Hole Edition of the CNBC Fed Survey. But when asked who the president should pick, Hassett ranked a more distant fourth.

Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, firmly led the pack when asked who the president will choose from among 11 names currently being considered. He was followed by Fed Governor Christopher Waller and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.

But when asked who the president "should" pick, Warsh took the No. 1 spot, closely followed by Waller and former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman was in fifth after Hassett.

"I think that Trump's familiarity with (Hassett) in the job that he did during the pandemic makes him a high candidate for Trump, who appreciates and awards loyalty," said Richard Steinberg, senior global market strategist with Focus Partners Wealth.

While maintaining that Hassett is qualified, Allen Sinai of Decision Economics said he's concerned about Fed independence if he gets the job.

"The politics of low interest rates for political reasons — a very strong view and push by the Trump administration — is a macro risk if it is seen in markets as a takeover by the administration," Sinai said.

In the survey, 41% of respondents think the next Fed chair will conduct monetary policy independently of the president and 37% said it would be in coordination; 22% were unsure.

Trump has campaigned hard for the Fed to cut rates, repeatedly insulting current Chair Jerome Powell, but Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee have so far resisted because of concern over potential inflation from tariffs.

Bowman and Waller both dissented in July in favor of a rate cut.

Survey respondents see two rate reductions this year from the Fed --- in September and December --- but also high inflation.

The forecast for the consumer price index 12-month inflation rate remains at around 3% this year and 2.9% in 2026, suggesting the Fed will have to deal with above-target inflation for a while. Nearly two-thirds of respondents believe "substantial" impacts from tariffs on inflation are yet to come.

"The Fed is caught between a rock and two hard places," said Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors. "Political pressure to cut rates and fiscal stimulus coming vs. the ongoing strength in the leading indicators of employment and inflation."

As a result, Powell may not be as dovish about rate cuts as markets hope in his Jackson Hole, Wyoming, speech. The Fed gathers each August for a symposium at which there are no votes but the chair traditionally delivers a keynote speech that often has indicated what's ahead.

Almost 70% of respondents think the Fed chair will be neutral in his comments with 14% believing he will be dovish. Another 14% think he won't even discuss monetary policy or the economic outlook.

"Powell's comments at Jackson Hole may be more balanced than the market is currently anticipating as he needs to weigh both downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation," said Douglas Gordon, managing director at Russell Investments.

Powell could discuss the Fed's effort to revisit its long-term strategy, with some expectation he addresses the Fed's controversial average inflation targeting.

Respondents are divided over how to fix the central bank or whether it needs fixing at all. Just 11% say the Fed process of making monetary policy needs major reforms with 85% saying it needs either modest or little to no reform.

On specific issues, a 41% plurality say the Fed should get rid of the dot plot where central bank officials anonymously indicate individual forecasts for the funds rate. But 37% say keep it as is, with another 19% saying it should be kept with individual forecasts linked to the rate outlook.

When it comes to the 2% inflation target, 52% want to retain it but 44% want the Fed to adopt a range from about 1.4% to 2.7%.

A 44% plurality want to eliminate the Fed's average inflation targeting, while 37% want to keep it.

In average inflation targeting, the Fed takes into consideration prior misses in hitting its target, and could tolerate higher inflation for a while to account for inflation having run below target in previous years. Some have said this led the Fed to be more tolerant of inflation during the pandemic and slowed its decision to tighten policy.

Amazon is plotting a big change to its Fire tablet lineup following years of escalating gripes from consumers and app developers over the company's homegrown operating system.

As part of a project known internally as Kittyhawk, Amazon plans to release a higher-end tablet as soon as next year, offering the Android operating system software for the first time, according to six people familiar with the matter. Since the Fire tablet's introduction in 2011, Amazon has used what is known as a "forked" version of Android with custom modifications that make it work like a unique operating system.

Amazon has long sought to undercut hardware rivals with inexpensive tablets and other devices that serve as a doorway to the firm's digital content, like e-books, videos and music. The devices have typically sold at or near manufacturing cost. But the focus on simplicity has held back sales, particularly among consumers who seek higher-performing devices.

The multiyear project to switch to Android marks a philosophical change for the online retail giant, which has eschewed third-party operating systems and software in favor of its own. As a result, Amazon has offered its own app store requiring developers to make separate versions of their apps for Fire tablets, limiting the store's variety.

If Kittyhawk is successful, Fire tablets could be more desirable for consumers who crave compatibility with other Android devices, the people said. They cautioned that Kittyhawk could be delayed or cancelled over financial or other concerns.

Amazon declined to comment, saying it does not respond to rumors or speculation.

"Consumers have always expressed a concern about not having access to the latest Android versions, not having access to some of their apps because Amazon used their own store," said Jitesh Ubrani, a researcher at IT advisory firm IDC. "It's meant more work for developers in this day and age of largely free apps or services."

Ubrani noted that Amazon has nonetheless sold many millions of the tablets. Amazon has forfeited profits on the devices themselves in favor of making money on selling their associated services, like streaming movie rentals. But such inexpensive devices typically come with compromises like lower screen quality or battery life compared with pricier options.

Amazon is the world's fourth-largest tablet seller, with 8% of the market, just behind Lenovo's 8.2%, according to second-quarter IDC data. Apple and Samsung were the market leaders with 33.1% and 18.7%, respectively.

The first Amazon Android tablet, slated for next year, will be pricier than current models, the people said. One of them said Amazon had discussed a $400 price tag, nearly double the cost of its current higher-end $230 Fire Max 11 tablet. IPads, by comparison, range from $350 to $1,200. Reuters could not learn additional specifications for the planned Amazon tablet, such as screen size and speaker quality or memory capacity.

Amazon historically has avoided using software or other products from third parties, preferring to develop the services in-house or, barring that, to acquire a competitor. The Fire Phone smartphone championed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and released in 2014 failed to win over buyers in part because of its reliance on Fire OS, as well as its high price tag. Amazon canceled the device and took a $170 million writedown.

But the Seattle retailer has more recently shown a willingness to use rivals' services, particularly through its investment in startup Anthropic, whose Claude artificial intelligence software is the primary underpinning of Amazon's Alexa+ voice assistant and a chatbot used by employees known as Cedric.

The new Fire tablet, the people said, will use the open-source version of Android, meaning it does not require direct coordination with Google and can be customized.

Amazon is planning to roll out some lower-priced tablets with its Linux-based Vega operating system now in some Fire TV devices, some of the people said. The full slate of tablets will eventually be powered by a version of Android, the people said.

The Fire project's internal code name of Kittyhawk seems to derive from the North Carolina town near where the Wright brothers conducted the first powered flight in 1903. But it is also the name of a failed flying car startup backed by Google co-founder Larry Page that burned through hundreds of millions in cash. Amazon declined to discuss the meaning behind its Kittyhawk project name.

Target has announced it will replace longtime CEO Brian Cornell with a company insider who joined as an intern more than 20 years ago.

The discount department store chain said Michael Fiddelke, chief operating officer and former chief finance officer, will take over on February 1 next year. He has been with the company since first joining as an intern in 2003. He has worked across merchandising, finance, operations, and human resources, the company said.

Cornell has been in charge since 2014. In 2022, the retailer threw out its traditional retirement age of 65 to allow him to stay on for three more years. He will become executive chair of the board of directors.

The appointment comes as the retailer has suffered as more customers have shifted to budget alternatives. Target had a tough first quarter with falling sales and a decrease in store traffic after it decided to roll back its DEI initiatives at the start of the year. At Tuesday's close, its stock was down 10.8% year-to-date.

Fiddelke said in a statement he wanted to "refocus our strategy and build on the assets and capabilities that have made Target a beloved destination for incredible products and a one-of-a-kind shopping experience."

"And to be clear, we have work to do to reach our full potential," he added.

Target announced Cornell's departure as it reported its second-quarter earnings results. Sales were $25.2 billion, almost 1% down year-on-year, but above Wall Street expectations of $24.93 billion.

The company's stock was down nearly 10% in premarket trading as of 7.30 a.m. Wednesday.

The Minneapolis-headquartered company maintained its expectation of a low-single-digit decline in sales for 2025.

Analyst Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said the earnings showed "the hallmarks of a retailer not living up to its potential."

He added he had "mixed feelings" about Fiddelke's appointment.

"While we think Fiddelke is talented and has a somewhat different take on things compared to current CEO Brian Cornell, this is an internal appointment that does not necessarily remedy the problems of entrenched groupthink and the inward-looking mindset that have plagued Target for years," Saunders added.

In a note, Japanese banking giant Mizuho's US arm praised Fiddelke's "impressive" background at the company.

But the note added, "As indicated by the pre-market move in shares, we and the investment community preferred an external candidate to bring wholesale change to Target."

Hertz on Wednesday announced it will start selling preowned vehicles on Amazon Autos, a move meant to bolster the car rental company's retail operations as it looks to bring in more profits.

Shares of Hertz soared Wednesday.

Under the partnership, customers can browse from thousands of used Hertz vehicles on Amazon Autos, e-sign the paperwork, complete their purchase online and pick up their vehicle at Hertz locations.

Customers who live within 75 miles of the four initial cities — Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and Seattle — can start browsing on Amazon as soon as Wednesday, and Hertz eventually plans to expand the arrangement to 45 locations nationwide.

The partnership gives Hertz, known for its car rentals, more visibility and a potential profit boost for its auto sales business.

It also marks an expansion for Amazon's nascent autos business, which it launched in December through a partnership with Hyundai. Before that, shoppers could browse digital showrooms and compare prices on Amazon, but not purchase cars directly through the e-commerce giant.

Amazon Autos added used and certified preowned vehicles to its selection of offerings earlier this month starting in Los Angeles, after previously selling exclusively new vehicles. Hertz Car Sales is Amazon Autos' first fleet dealer and will offer used vehicles from brands including Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet and Nissan.

Hertz said it sells hundreds of thousands of vehicles per year, in addition to running its signature car rental business.

"Our goal is to reimagine the car-buying experience and meet customers where they are — whether online or in person — with convenience, confidence and scale," said Jeff Adams, executive vice president of Hertz Car Sales. "Amazon Autos is the ideal partner to help us deliver on this as customers can shop our expansive inventory of high-quality used cars on the same trusted marketplace where millions shop every day."

The partnership with Amazon Autos is aimed at expanding Hertz's digital retail presence and making its used vehicle inventory more accessible to customers. It's part of a larger strategy that Hertz set out earlier this year, led by CEO Gil West, to boost its retail business by increasing its retail footprint, raising awareness of the Hertz Car Sales brand and building strategic partnerships.

After entering bankruptcy during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and dealing with a failed EV strategy shortly after that, Hertz last year introduced its "Back-to-Basics Roadmap" turnaround plan. The focus is on fleet management, revenue optimization and cost efficiency.

Hertz said the first quarter of this year marked its strongest-ever quarter for retail vehicle sales.

During the company's Aug. 7 earnings call, West said Hertz has seen strong momentum in its Rent2Buy program, which allows customers to take a used car home for a three-day rental period before committing to buying it. Hertz announced last week that the program is set to reach more than 100 cities.

Target on Wednesday said that company veteran Michael Fiddelke will become its next CEO at a critical point in its effort to break out of a sales slump and win back Wall Street's favor.

Fiddelke, the company's 49-year-old chief operating officer and former chief financial officer, will succeed Brian Cornell effective Feb. 1. Cornell, who took the helm of the cheap chic retailer in 2014, will transition to the role of executive chair on Target's board of directors.

The Minneapolis-based retailer made the announcement on the same day it reported fiscal second-quarter results. It topped Wall Street's quarterly sales and earnings expectations, but stuck by a full-year outlook that forecasts another annual sales decline.

Fiddelke steps into Target's top role as the big-box retailer tries to find its footing and get back to growth. Target's annual sales have been roughly flat for the past four years after the company's sales soared during the Covid pandemic.

On a call with reporters, Fiddelke said he is "stepping in with urgency to rebuild momentum and return to profitable growth."

He laid out three priorities: Reestablishing Target's reputation as a retailer with stylish and unique items, providing a more consistent customer experience and using technology more effectively to operate an efficient business.

"We've built a solid foundation, and we're proud of the many ways that Target is unique in American retail," he said. "We also have real work in front of us."

Target shares were down about 9% in early trading after the company made the CEO announcement and released results. Before Target announced its choice, Wall Street appeared to favor an outsider for the top job.

"You know, I think I'm a little surprised that there wasn't somebody from the outside coming in to take a leadership role. I think that's part of the stock reaction here," said Stacey Widlitz, president of SW Retail Advisors, on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

Fiddelke is a 20-year Target veteran. During his decades with the company, he has held leadership roles across merchandising, finance, operations and human resources. He became Target's chief financial officer in late 2019 and stepped into the role of chief operating officer in early 2024.

In May, he was tapped to oversee a new effort, the Enterprise Acceleration Office, created to turn around Target's results.

Target cut its full-year outlook in May and reiterated that guidance on Wednesday, saying that it expects a low-single-digit percentage point decline in sales this fiscal year.

Target's performance has shaken Wall Street's confidence. Shares of the company have tumbled about 60% since their all-time high in 2021. Target's stock had dropped 22% in 2025 alone as of Tuesday's close.

Customers, former employees and suppliers told CNBC that the company's best-known traits of eye-catching merchandise, tidy stores and friendly employees have become weaker. The retailer also is facing stiffer competition from rivals including Walmart, contending with cost pressures because of tariffs and dealing with backlash to its reversal of key diversity, equity and inclusion policies.

And last week, Ulta Beauty and Target announced they are ending a deal that opened mini beauty shops in nearly a third of Target's stores. The partnership will end in August 2026.

Wall Street had favored an outsider for the CEO job, according to a June survey of 51 investors by Mizuho Securities, an equity research firm. About 96% of investors polled favored an external hire for Target's next CEO.

Christine Leahy, lead independent director of Target's board of directors, said in a news release that the board chose Fiddelke after "an extensive external search and assessment of many strong candidates" over several years.

"Michael's tenure gives him unmatched enterprise insight and a base of strong team trust," she said. "But what sets him apart is how he combines those strengths with a 'fresh eyes' mindset, challenging the status quo to evolve how the business operates, differentiates and delivers long-term value."

On a call with reporters, Cornell and Fiddelke were asked what they would say to investors who had hoped for Target to hire an outsider who would bring fresh ideas.

Fiddelke answered the question.

"I understand this business," he said. "I understand what makes Target distinctly unique. And I've seen us at our best, and I've seen us when we're not at our best, and that informs my candid assessment today of where we have work to do as well."

"But I'll go back to some of what I started with: My number one goal is to get us back to growth."

Matt Hutton was living the millennial homeowner dream. He scrimped and saved until he was able to buy his first place in 2019, paying $324,000 for a two-bedroom townhome in a suburb west of Denver. When mortgage rates dropped to record lows during the pandemic, he refinanced to slash his interest costs. Then home values ballooned, enabling him to sell in August 2024 for a gain of roughly $150,000 in just about five years. Hutton and his wife parlayed those earnings into their own slice of the American dream: a bigger, newly built single-family house on a premium lot.

But Hutton's gilded path soon morphed into a cautionary tale. The house itself was nice, with fresh appliances, ample light, and clear views of a lake just beyond the property. The couple started to notice some drawbacks, though. For one, Hutton's new commute sucked. "It took forever to get to the highway," the 34-year-old tells me. Simple trips demanded at least half an hour behind the wheel. The neighborhood was still a jumbled mess of construction, with hundreds of homes yet to be delivered. Even little stuff, like the sound of the wind whipping outside, got annoying. By January, only a few months after they'd closed on the house, Hutton and his wife were already starting to talk about moving.

Their dissatisfaction left them in a bind. Buying and selling so quickly is usually a recipe for financial loss — real estate agents pretty much always recommend staying put for at least a few years to make up for all the transaction costs. Plus, the Denver-area market softened considerably over the past two years, with more homes sitting for sale as buyers started biding their time. But there was one big issue that put Hutton in an especially bad spot. In lieu of cutting the actual list price, the builder of his current home had thrown in $30,000 worth of incentives to lure buyers like Hutton. The bulk of the deal sweetener came in the form of a "mortgage rate buydown," a financing maneuver in which the builder fronts some cash to help buyers get a lower borrowing rate from the builder's in-house lender, often for just a few years. The incentive is supposed to allow buyers to stretch their budgets and soften the blow of higher mortgage rates. Some takers are betting that they'll be able to refinance for better loan terms before their mortgage snaps back to the full rate.

Homeowners who got temporary buydowns in 2022 or 2023 have seen their gamble on rates fail spectacularly. The typical mortgage rate still hovers above 6.5% — roughly around the levels that many buyers back then were hoping to dodge. Given the slowing market, industry analysts, and even some executives, warn that these homeowners could see little in the way of equity gains before the full cost of the mortgage hits. If those buyers try to turn around and sell soon, they may end up having to slash the price just to push a deal through. Hutton's predicament is an example of the pain that could be in store for others who made a similar tradeoff, agreeing to a higher sticker price in exchange for lower interest payments.

Rick Palacios Jr., the director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting, has been sounding the alarm about the growing risks for buydown takers since last summer.

"People are going to start putting those homes back into the market," Palacios tells me, "and I think it's going to be a bit of a shock to them, what they have to reprice at."

The steep rise in mortgage rates in 2022 caused all kinds of havoc for the housing market. Buyers retreated to the sidelines or searched for workarounds that would stave off the pain of higher monthly payments. Sellers had to get real about the fact that they might not get the flood of attention, let alone offers, that listings enjoyed in 2021. And builders found themselves in a tricky spot. After seeing all the demand in the early days of the pandemic, they'd started work on a ton of new houses. With the market grinding to a halt, they'd have to figure out some way to unload them once they were completed.

The answer, in many cases, was a buydown. The deals offered an elegant solution for buyers mourning the fact that they'd missed out on the rock-bottom, sub-3% mortgage rates that everyone scored earlier in the pandemic. "Without something along those lines, the market would've been almost completely frozen in that price range," Lydia Creasey, Hutton's real estate agent, tells me. On their websites, builders touted borrowing rates well below the prevailing levels, keeping sales moving by enticing buyers with cheaper monthly payments. By December 2022, three-quarters of builders surveyed by John Burns Research and Consulting said they were offering buydowns. Regular sellers don't typically offer this maneuver to buyers. But for builders who could afford to eat the cost — while conveniently steering buyers to their in-house lenders — buydowns represented "a silver bullet," John Burns analysts wrote in late 2023.

"It really saved their business," Palacios tells me. In a normal housing downturn, he says, builders would have started cutting prices on their homes. The rate buydowns, though, were "like a mouse trap that allowed them to not have to adjust price."

There are a few ways a buydown can work. One option is the permanent buydown: The builder agrees to pay around 5% or 6% of the sale price to lower the mortgage rate for the entire 30-year loan, usually by one or two percentage points. Let's say someone takes out a $400,000 loan at a time when the typical rate is around 6.5% (pretty close to today's prevailing rates). If the builder buys down the rate to 5%, the buyer would be saving almost $400 every month. The initial outlay may be relatively low — in this example, about $24,000 — but over the length of the 30-year loan, the borrower's savings would come out to almost $140,000. Homebuilders and their mortgage companies are cool with this deal because they've often locked up cheap money that they can use for the loans, and because they don't want to get stuck with a bunch of homes on their books. Plus, they really don't want to cut prices, since doing so would tank the values of all the other homes nearby.

The other popular option is a temporary deal, which usually comes in the form of a "2-1 buydown." The builder sets aside cash to lower the buyer's mortgage rate by two percentage points for the first year and one point for the second year, after which it bumps up to the prevailing rate at the time of the home purchase. Again, let's say the prevailing rate is around 6.5%. A buyer with a 2-1 rate buydown would get a rate of 4.5% in the first year, 5.5% in the second, and 6.5% from there on out. If they took out a $400,000 loan, they'd be saving more than $500 every month that first year and more than $250 a month in the second year. That's a total savings of more than $9,000. In theory, this would allow a buyer to stretch their budget a little further to get the place they want, while also giving them some flexibility to refinance down the line if rates drop.

"The thing with residential real estate is that it's not about the investment," Eric Agar, an executive at the California-based brokerage firm Pardee Properties, tells me. "It's about your lifestyle. It's about your family. It's about you being at a home that you love. And if that allows you to do it today, instead of a year from now or two years from now, well, that's a huge pro."

The popularity of these deals soared alongside mortgage rates. In April 2021, just 17% of mortgage borrowers got a permanent buydown of one percentage point or more, data from ICE Mortgage Technology, a real estate software firm, shows. By the same point in 2023, that share had surged to nearly 45%. Temporary buydowns are more niche — they accounted for almost 5% of mortgage originations in late 2023, but have mostly hovered in the low single digits over the past few years. Still, there's no denying the prevalence of buydowns in the world of newly built homes. Last fall, Zillow published the results of a survey showing that 45% of buyers who purchased a home in the past year nabbed a mortgage rate below 5%, despite rates trending significantly higher. More than a third of those buyers said they got a lower rate because the seller or homebuilder offered them a deal on the mortgage.

Both permanent and temporary buydowns come with potential pitfalls, but people who agreed to time-limited incentives are starting to face a particularly harsh reality. To be clear, short-term buydowns aren't the reckless, adjustable-rate mortgages that fueled the housing bubble in the early 2000s — buyers who snag these deals have to prove they'd be able to handle the maximum amount they'll end up paying after the interest rate snaps back. But being technically able to pay that extra money and actually shelling it out each month are two different things.

There are still plenty of ways for buydown takers to end up in hot water. With temporary buydowns, some agents and analysts warn that fresh homeowners may be counting on rates dropping in the near future, allowing them to refinance to a new, cheaper loan before their payments bump up to the normal level. For buyers who got into the market two or three years ago, those dreams are fading fast. There's also the issue of lifestyle creep — if someone is used to saving a few hundred bucks on their loan each month, the jump to the full amount could be a bitter pill to swallow.

Last summer, though, Palacios began warning of a more dire scenario. His concern was aimed at buyers who got a buydown — permanent or temporary — a few years ago and are now looking to sell for one reason or another, like a new job, new kid, marriage, or divorce. These homeowners face a decidedly weaker market. Many areas of the country, particularly construction hotbeds like the Sun Belt, have more homes sitting for sale than at any point since the onset of the pandemic. The typical mortgage rate has yet to slide in a meaningful way. Home prices are up less than 2% nationwide from a year ago, data from the real estate firm Redfin shows, and major metros like Houston, Austin, and Jacksonville recently posted year-over-year price declines. While buyers in 2022 or 2023 might have been willing to accept higher prices in exchange for savings on their monthly payments, they usually can't pass along those benefits to the next owner of the house. If they want to get a deal done, they might have to either cut that once-inflated price or pay tens of thousands of dollars to offer a rate buydown to the next buyer.

An executive at KB Home, one of the nation's largest builders, recently said in an earnings call that many customers are "overpaying" for homes that offer these incentives, suggesting they could have a harder time clearing a profit in the future. "They're tied into this higher price that they're going to be stuck with forever until they sell that home."

If you so much as dipped your toe into the housing market sometime in the past few years, there's a good chance you encountered the phrase, "Marry the house, date the rate." The mantra got plenty of airtime when mortgage rates spiked in 2022 — the prevailing sentiment among agents, lenders, and real estate execs was that the jump in rates would soon blow over. Don't stress too much, the logic went, because you can always refinance when rates drop back down. Better to just find a good place while you can. That mindset has so far turned out to be wishful thinking. And while there haven't yet been signs of widespread strain in the market, homeowners who got a buydown just a few years ago may be facing a significant jump in their monthly payments or the prospect of selling for far less than they'd hoped.

"I'm hearing more and more stories of buyer's remorse," says Jess Uphoff, a mortgage lender who previously worked for a homebuilder. Not long ago, a temporary buydown seemed like a win-win: Builders could keep list prices higher while still passing along savings to buyers in the form of lower monthly payments. But if one of those buyers is trying to sell now, they'll likely be competing against the same builder who sold them their home — "only the builder has been steadily lowering prices or layering on new incentives." Uphoff says. "That means homeowners often can't resell for what they originally paid." At the end of May, for example, the homebuilding giant Lennar said its average incentive per home had stretched to nearly $60,000, up from $44,000 a year prior.

Rate buydowns aren't always a trap for buyers. People who got a permanent buydown a few years ago may feel pretty good about that decision, given that rates haven't yet dropped significantly. But Lauryn Dempsey, a real estate agent in the Denver area, says she counsels buyers to make sure they'll be staying in the home for at least five to seven years if they get one of these deals.

"Where I'm running into challenges right now is with the people who bought a couple of years ago that want to sell," Dempsey tells me. "I'm bringing estimated net proceeds that have negative numbers attached to them, so the seller has to bring cash to the closing. And I know I'm not alone in that right now."

Hutton, the homeowner in the Denver area, fell into this camp. He and his wife paid nearly $800,000 for their new house in 2024, while the builder bought down the mortgage rate by about one percentage point. That may not sound like a lot, but that meant they were paying hundreds of dollars less in interest every month. The Huttons won't be sticking around to enjoy those benefits, though. When I talked to Hutton in mid-August, he and his wife had just closed on the sale of their home, his second in roughly a year. They managed to sell the house for $800,000 — almost exactly what they paid for it, but down from their original asking price of $850,000, which factored in some of the additional upgrades they'd made to the place. The buyer also requested that the Huttons pay $40,000 for a rate buydown to match the terms the builder was offering for other new homes nearby. They agreed to the deal. Hutton says he worried that if they wavered on a sale much longer, they'd only have more new homes in the neighborhood to compete with, each of them offering a bevy of incentives.

"The interest rates were killing us, because no one was buying with that," Hutton tells me. "So the only way for me to get my house sold was to offer an incentive, pretty much."

Hutton walked away from his first sale with six figures in his pocket. Roughly a year later, after the latest transaction, all that money is gone. His agent, Lydia Creasey, even dipped into her commission to cut the buyer a check for $350 at the closing table — a rare scenario, she says, owing to the unusual circumstances of the deal. "It was the right thing to do in this situation," Creasey tells me. Hutton and his wife are now living in an apartment, biding their time until they're ready to take another stab at finding their dream home.

"I won't jump the gun," Hutton says. "I'm going to make sure to do my homework."

Delivering real-time insights and analysis on emerging financial trends and market movements.

- XRP-based mobile mining apps leverage energy-efficient blockchain tech to democratize crypto access, enabling smartphone users to earn passive income via cloud contracts.

- Regulatory clarity post-2025 U.S. court ruling and institutional partnerships (e.g., Ripple-Chainlink) have boosted XRP's legitimacy and price toward $3.60.

- Platforms like MintMiner offer compounding returns (up to 41,000% annually), accelerating adoption in emerging markets with limited traditional banking infrastructure.

- XRP's 3-5 second transaction speed and near-zero energy costs contrast sharply with Bitcoin's 950 kWh per transaction, aligning with global sustainability trends.

- Risks persist: market volatility, potential scams, and regulatory scrutiny require due diligence despite XRP's technological and institutional momentum.

The cryptocurrency landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by the rise of XRP-based mobile mining apps that are redefining how individuals access and generate passive income. These platforms, leveraging cloud infrastructure and XRP's unique blockchain technology, are dismantling traditional barriers to entry—such as high hardware costs, technical complexity, and energy inefficiency—while aligning with global trends toward financial inclusivity and environmental sustainability. For investors, this evolution raises a critical question: Is the surge in XRP mobile mining a fleeting fad or a harbinger of a broader transformation in crypto adoption and retail investor behavior?  

XRP's blockchain technology is the linchpin of this revolution. Unlike Bitcoin's energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Ethereum's transitioning Proof-of-Stake (PoS) models, XRP operates on the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol (RPCA). This mechanism relies on a network of validator nodes to confirm transactions through a social governance model, enabling near-instant confirmations (3–5 seconds) and negligible energy consumption. For context, a single Bitcoin transaction consumes roughly 950 kWh of electricity—enough to power an average household for a month—while XRP transactions cost less than a fraction of a cent in fees.  

This efficiency is critical for mobile mining. Apps like Find Mining and SIX MINING allow users to deploy XRP-based contracts on cloud infrastructure, bypassing the need for local hardware. These platforms utilize renewable energy-powered data centers and advanced cybersecurity protocols (e.g., McAfee® and Cloudflare®) to ensure both scalability and security. The result is a system where users can mine XRP or other cryptocurrencies with a smartphone, earning daily returns ranging from $4 to $210, depending on the contract size.  

The surge in XRP mobile mining is not purely technological—it is also fueled by regulatory and institutional tailwinds. The U.S. court's June 2025 ruling, which affirmed that XRP traded on public exchanges is not a security, has been a game-changer. This legal clarity has spurred institutional adoption, with Ripple's partnerships with Chainlink for price feeds and the launch of XRP-focused ETFs by firms like 3iQ and HashKey Capital. Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act have further solidified XRP's legitimacy, pushing its price toward its all-time high of $3.60.  

Retail investors are capitalizing on this momentum. Platforms like BAY Miner and MintMiner report compounding returns of up to 41,000% annually, with users in emerging markets—where traditional banking infrastructure is limited—leading adoption. For example, a $100 investment on MintMiner generates $5 daily, compounding to over $1,800 in a year. Such models are democratizing access to passive income, particularly in regions where crypto adoption is outpacing traditional finance.  

The rise of XRP mobile mining reflects a deeper shift in how retail investors engage with crypto. Traditional mining, dominated by institutional players and energy-hungry hardware farms, is being replaced by a model that prioritizes accessibility and user experience. This aligns with the broader trend of “democratized finance,” where tools like DeFi and stablecoins are enabling everyday users to participate in global markets.  

Moreover, the environmental angle cannot be ignored. As governments and consumers increasingly prioritize sustainability, XRP's energy efficiency gives it a competitive edge. Platforms like XRP Mining highlight their use of green energy, appealing to a generation of investors who demand both profitability and ethical alignment.  

Despite the optimism, caution is warranted. The crypto market remains volatile, and cloud mining platforms are not immune to scams or regulatory scrutiny. Users must conduct due diligence—verifying platform transparency, contract terms, and security measures. Additionally, while XRP's technology is robust, its long-term success depends on sustained institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates and global payment trends.  

For investors, the rise of XRP mobile mining presents a dual opportunity:1. Direct XRP Exposure: With regulatory hurdles cleared and institutional demand rising, XRP's price trajectory appears bullish. Investors should monitor its performance against Bitcoin and Ethereum () and consider dollar-cost averaging into the asset.2. Platform Participation: High-yield contracts on platforms like Find Mining and BAY Miner offer immediate passive income, though diversification is key to mitigate platform-specific risks.  

In conclusion, the surge in XRP-based mobile mining is more than a technological novelty—it is a symptom of a broader shift toward accessible, sustainable, and user-centric crypto ecosystems. As XRP continues to solidify its role in cross-border payments and DeFi, its mobile mining apps are likely to accelerate the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology, reshaping how individuals earn and invest in the digital age. For investors, the challenge lies in balancing the promise of innovation with the realities of a still-evolving market.

Bitcoin is trading almost $11,000 below its Aug. 14 record, according to CoinDesk data, but FalconX's head of research says the market's internal structure still looks “extremely bullish.”

In a post on X on Wednesday, analyst David Lawant pointed to what happens in bitcoin's order book — the live record of buy and sell offers on exchanges — when the price pulls back slightly from highs. 

He explained that after these small dips, sell orders quickly disappear and buy orders take over, a dynamic he described as the order book “flipping” from the sell side to the bid side.

In plain terms, Lawant is saying that sellers are not sticking around to push the market down after modest declines. Instead, strong demand steps in almost immediately, and buyers crowd out sellers. 

That pattern suggests long-term players with deeper pockets — such as institutions and well-capitalized funds — are using brief downturns as buying opportunities. Rather than signaling weakness, the absence of sustained selling indicates confidence in bitcoin's longer-term trajectory.

The chart Lawant shared reinforces this interpretation. It shows periods where bitcoin slipped slightly from record levels, only for buy orders to quickly surge ahead of sell orders. 

This repeated shift toward the bid side is a hallmark of a bullish market structure, since it demonstrates that demand is waiting in the wings to absorb any supply that comes to market. For traders, the takeaway is that bitcoin's resilience after dips points to strong underlying support.

While bitcoin is still below its Aug. 14 peak of $124,481, the pattern highlighted by Lawant — sellers vanishing quickly and buyers reasserting control — continues to underpin bullish sentiment among analysts who see dips as opportunities rather than warning signs.

Jack Mallers' Twenty One Capital plans to dethrone MicroStrategy and Marathon with $5 billion Bitcoin treasury—but the real innovation might be how they measure success

Jack Mallers, the Bitcoin maximalist behind Strike—a digital payments app that uses the Lightning Network to enable instant, low-cost Bitcoin and dollar transactions—and the driving force that helped El Salvador adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is making his boldest move yet.

His new venture, Twenty One Capital, has accumulated over 43,500 Bitcoin worth more than $5 billion and is positioning itself to become the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder—surpassing current leaders MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and MARA Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA).

Don't Miss:

The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.

Trade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses — no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies.

But what sets Twenty One apart isn't just the size of its Bitcoin war chest. In a recent Bloomberg Television interview, Mallers revealed a fundamentally different approach to measuring corporate performance that could reshape how Bitcoin-native companies think about shareholder value.

While traditional companies obsess over earnings per share, Twenty One has introduced what Mallers calls “Bitcoin per share” as their primary performance metric. The reasoning is both simple and profound: measuring success in dollars is meaningless when fiat currencies are constantly debased.

“Everything goes up in dollar terms,” Mallers told Bloomberg. “The objective is for shareholders to get wealthier in Bitcoin terms by growing the Bitcoin per share.”

This isn't just accounting innovation—it's a philosophical shift that treats Bitcoin as the ultimate unit of account. Twenty One expects to complete its public listing in the third quarter following Securities and Exchange Commission review, with over $5 billion in Bitcoin at launch, giving investors direct exposure to this new performance framework.

Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Mallers' confidence in Bitcoin's trajectory stems from what he calls “definitive scarcity.” Unlike traditional commodities where increased demand can stimulate additional supply, Bitcoin's fixed 21 million coin limit means new buyers must compete for existing holdings.

“If you want more bitcoin, you don't go to the bitcoin factory. You have to go up in price,” Mallers told Bloomberg, predicting Bitcoin could reach $150,000 as institutional and sovereign buyers compete for limited supply.

This supply constraint is already creating upward pressure. MicroStrategy holds the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury, while MARA ranks second with over 46,000 BTC. Twenty One's goal to surpass both reflects Mallers' belief that corporate adoption is still in its infancy.

Twenty One isn't just another Bitcoin treasury play. With backing from heavyweights including Tether and SoftBank on its board, the company plans to build Bitcoin products, technology, and tools—essentially competing with both treasury companies like MicroStrategy and product-focused firms like Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN).

“Why not both?” appears to be Mallers' philosophy. His track record supports this ambition: Strike, his previous company, became a major Bitcoin financial services platform, and his involvement with El Salvador's Bitcoin adoption demonstrated his ability to execute complex, high-stakes initiatives.

Perhaps most telling is Twenty One's unwavering focus on Bitcoin exclusively. Mallers embraces the “Bitcoin maximalist” label, viewing other cryptocurrencies as inferior alternatives to what he calls “pristine money.”

His rationale centers on Bitcoin's role as a store of value in a world where traditional assets are constantly diluted. “I've created value and I want to keep it,” he summarizes as Bitcoin's core use case. “Bitcoin allows you to abstract your effort, time, and energy, and take it with you tomorrow,” he told Bloomberg.

This single-asset focus contrasts sharply with diversified crypto strategies, but it also provides clarity of purpose that resonates with institutional investors seeking pure-play Bitcoin exposure.

Twenty One's approach could accelerate corporate Bitcoin adoption by providing a clearer framework for measuring success. With an unrealized gain of over $1.3 billion already accumulated, the company serves as a real-time case study in Bitcoin treasury management.

For investors, Twenty One represents a new category: Bitcoin-native companies that measure success in Bitcoin terms rather than fiat. This could appeal to those who believe traditional accounting methods undervalue Bitcoin-holding companies.

The broader market implications are significant. As more companies adopt Bitcoin treasuries and measure performance in Bitcoin per share, it could create additional demand pressure on Bitcoin's fixed supply—potentially validating Mallers' bullish price predictions.

Twenty One's public debut will test whether investors are ready for this new paradigm. If successful, it could mark the beginning of a fundamental shift in how we measure corporate value in an increasingly Bitcoin-denominated world.

This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Bitcoin BTC$113,837.06 bulls are attempting to establish an interim low around $113,000, but the effort appears weak in terms of both price and volume. So far, the bounce has been barely notable, with upside capped above $114,000. Additionally, volumes have stayed low relative to what we observed during the early Tuesday drop, as seen on the hourly chart.

The weak bounce is consistent with bearish momentum signals, as the 50-, 100-, and 200-hour simple moving averages (SMAs) are aligned in descending order and trending downward.

On the daily chart, prices have convincingly broken below the rising trendline support, signaling a shift from bullish to bearish momentum. Both the longer-term MACD histogram (50,100,9) and the more commonly used MACD (12,26,0) are showing increasing negative momentum, with deeper bars below the zero line.

Therefore, the odds appear to be stacked in favor of a continued move lower. The first level of support is $11,982, from which the market turned higher on Aug. 3. The 100-day SMA is seen at $11,053. If these levels are taken out, the focus would shift to the 200-day SMA at $100,484.

A convincing move above the 50-day SMA at $116,033 would negate the bearish outlook.

SpacePay's presale gives investors a chance to join a project aiming to shape the future of payments. The platform is building a system that makes using crypto for everyday purchases fast and affordable.

Based in London and backed by global investors, SpacePay works with hundreds of wallets so people can spend crypto as easily as a bank card. 

It keeps costs low for both shoppers and merchants and has already raised over a million dollars in its presale. The goal is to make crypto payments part of daily life everywhere.

Many crypto payment systems are hard to use because they work differently from the payment methods people already know. Customers want quick and easy payments without delays or high fees. 

Merchants need a system that is steady and dependable. These problems have made it hard for crypto to be used in physical stores, even though more people now own it.

SpacePay is designed to fix these issues. It can handle heavy payment traffic without slowing down. It works with more than 325 wallets, including MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, and Ledger, meaning customers can pay directly from the wallets they already use.

The system also connects to existing payment terminals through an APK. Shops do not need to buy new hardware to start accepting crypto payments. On busy days, such as holiday sales, SpacePay is built to process every payment quickly and efficiently.

SpacePay offers instant settlement. When a customer pays, the shop receives the money right away. This could be a better choice compared to most traditional banking systems. It also protects merchants from price changes in crypto. 

If a customer pays in Ethereum, the shop still gets the exact amount in their local currency, regardless of whether the ETH price changes during the payment. This system is made possible through its volatility protection mechanism, which locks the crypto funds as soon as the payments are processed.

The platform supports many cryptocurrencies. Customers can use Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins such as USDT, and more. Merchants only pay a 0.5% fee per transaction, which is lower than most bank card fees.

Let's look at a simple example of how SpacePay can be used: A tourist can check into a hotel and pay instantly in crypto. The hotel receives the exact amount they expected in their local currency, with no waiting and no surprise charges.

The SpacePay presale is happening at a time when the crypto world is looking for real uses beyond trading. SpacePay's focus on speed, low fees, and a simple user experience makes it stand out. 

With instant settlement, protection from price swings, and support for hundreds of wallets, it has the tools to make crypto a normal way to pay. For those who believe crypto should be as easy to spend as cash, joining the SPY presale is a way to be part of that future.

The SPY token powers the SpacePay system. There are 34 billion tokens in total. The supply is divided between the public sale, user rewards, partnerships, development, and marketing.

Holding SPY comes with benefits. Token holders can vote on decisions, gain early access to new features, and receive loyalty rewards. They can also share in part of the platform's revenue.

The presale is more than a way to raise money; it helps build the network by bringing in early supporters. The funds will be used to expand the system, attract more merchants, and add features.

The price of SPY increases at each stage of the presale, meaning early buyers get a better deal. It is a way to join a project focused on making crypto easy to spend anywhere.

To buy SPY in the presale, connect a wallet such as MetaMask to the SpacePay presale page. You can pay with ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, BASE, USDC, USDT, or a bank card.

Once your wallet is connected and has funds, choose how much SPY you want to buy. Confirm the transaction and ensure you have enough left to pay the network fees.

After the swap, your SPY tokens will be sent to your wallet and ready to use when SpacePay launches. Join us on X and Telegram.

The landscape of meme-driven tokens keeps expanding, and investors are watching closely.

Dogecoin has long been a leader in the meme coin space, but new projects are starting to gain traction. One such crypto presale is Pepe Dollar ($PEPD), now in stage 2 of its offering. This new crypto token presale has raised over $1.5 million, sparking curiosity among both retail traders and larger investors.

With its mix of meme culture and decentralized payment solutions, Pepe Dollar adds fresh competition to the top crypto presales list. Investors searching for the best crypto presale to buy right now are starting to compare it directly with Dogecoin's legacy.

Pepe Dollar's stage 2 presale crypto has already secured over $1.5 million in contributions, highlighting strong demand from the community. The token is currently priced at $0.006495 per $PEPD, while its confirmed launch price sits at $0.03695.

This significant difference between presale and launch price is a central talking point. It explains why Pepe Dollar is making its way into the crypto presale list of projects that attract both small and large investors.

The project is not just positioning itself as another meme coin but is building a foundation that ties internet culture with decentralized payment systems.

As a presale cryptocurrency, it offers accessibility to anyone with an Ethereum wallet, making it easier for users to buy presale crypto directly through its official platform. The cap on total supply further reinforces its structure, ensuring that demand isn't diluted by unlimited minting.

These aspects make Pepe Dollar stand out in today's crowded field of token presales, particularly for those comparing crypto coins on presale.



Some long-time Dogecoin investors, often called whales, have reportedly set aside $15,000 allocations to join the Pepe Dollar presale. Their decision isn't based only on hype, it stems from the token's practical features and its growing community presence.

Whales often look for crypto presale projects that combine cultural appeal with long-term development. Pepe Dollar's integration of meme culture with payment infrastructure has caught their attention. Unlike other crypto pre-sales, it carries both symbolism and utility.

This move shows how larger investors often recognize early opportunities in top presale crypto offerings. Their participation highlights how Pepe Dollar has crossed from being just another presale coin to becoming part of conversations alongside Dogecoin itself.

The allocation of funds from whales adds weight to Pepe Dollar's presence among cryptocurrency presales, reinforcing its visibility on today's competitive crypto presales list.

Pepe Dollar ($PEPD) reflects a shift in the way meme tokens are viewed. It blends humor, internet symbolism, and blockchain infrastructure to create an ecosystem that does more than entertain.

As a new token presale, it enters the space with a clear structure—limited supply, defined stages, and audited smart contracts. These qualities distinguish it from many other crypto presales that exist only for short-term speculation.

For Dogecoin investors and newcomers alike, Pepe Dollar represents how meme culture can evolve into usable systems. It joins the best crypto presales to buy right now by showing how a crypto coin presale can carry both cultural significance and structured design.

While comparisons with Dogecoin are inevitable, Pepe Dollar carves its own space in the wider landscape of crypto presale 2025 opportunities. It stands as a reminder that in the fast-moving world of Web3, culture and utility can grow side by side.

Crypto exchange Kraken has acquired the assets and technology of Capitalise.ai, an Israel-based startup that built a natural-language, no-code platform for automating trading strategies across multiple asset classes, the company said in a press release Wednesday.

Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a Stifel company, acted as financial advisor to Capitalise.ai. Financial details of the acquisition were not disclosed.

Founded in 2015, Capitalise.ai developed a system that lets users turn everyday text into executable trading strategies. 

The company's technology supports real-time and historical data analysis spanning equities, crypto, FX, futures and options. Its tools have been used by a range of traditional finance brokers and exchanges.

Kraken said it will begin rolling out Capitalise.ai's features on its Kraken Pro platform later this year. The move is designed to lower the technical barriers to advanced trading, giving users the ability to design, backtest and automate strategies without writing code.

“This acquisition gives Kraken Pro clients a powerful new way to act on ideas in real time—testing, optimizing, and executing bespoke strategies with unprecedented speed and confidence,” said Shannon Kurtas, head of exchange at Kraken, in the release.

Co-founders Amir Shiovich and Shahar Rabin, along with key engineering staff, will join Kraken's Pro business unit as part of the deal.

 China's cabinet will review a roadmap that includes yuan-pegged stablecoins to bolster yuan internationalization, sources told Reuters. 

China, one of the most restrictive global jurisdictions for cryptocurrencies, is reportedly considering allowing Chinese yuan-backed stablecoins in what would be a major policy reversal.

Chinese authorities may authorize yuan-backed stablecoins for the first time to promote global use of its currency, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.

If approved, China's plan for stablecoin use would mark a major shift in its approach to crypto after the country banned crypto trading and mining in September 2021.

The news followed multiple reports suggesting that mainland China had been warming up to stablecoins amid a US stablecoin push in 2025.

According to the sources, China's State Council will review and potentially approve a roadmap later in August to expand global use of the yuan. The plan reportedly includes steps to counter US progress on stablecoins and guidelines for risk prevention.

One use case for a potential yuan-backed stablecoin from mainland China would be the implementation of stablecoins for cross-border trade and payments with some countries.

This issue is expected to be discussed at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit that will be held between Aug. 31 and Sept. 1 in Tianjin.

Hong Kong and Shanghai have been identified as priority hubs for rolling out the policy, according to the sources.

China's potential entry into the stablecoin market would align with its ambitions to globalize the yuan and help it compete with key global reserve currencies such as the US dollar and the euro.

As of June, China's yuan was the sixth most active currency for global payments by value, with a share of around 2.9%, according to Swift's RMB Tracker.

As reported, in June, mainland China had been exploring new ways for foreign institutions to use the yuan amid the US Dollar Index plummeting 9%.

At the time, People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng outlined the plan to “weaken the excessive reliance on a single sovereign currency” and set up a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai.

While the US dollar makes up 47.2% of global payments, its role is far bigger in the stablecoin market, where dollar-backed tokens represent almost 98% of $288 billion in the total stablecoin market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap.

With President Donald Trump pledging to expand the dollar's global reach by promoting stablecoins, many jurisdictions worldwide have raised concerns, including China.

In June, a PBOC official acknowledged the transformative potential of emerging technologies like stablecoins in global payment systems, intensifying calls for regulatory approval of yuan-backed stablecoins.

In July, Conflux, a local blockchain platform, introduced a new stablecoin backed by offshore Chinese yuan.

Neighboring jurisdictions like Hong Kong have also taken steps toward stablecoin approval, launching a dedicated regulatory framework on Aug. 1

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

The ICO, or initial coin offering, era was notorious. A decade ago, crypto founders raised millions and even billions from small-time traders by selling cryptocurrencies tied to new projects. Many raises, like the one for Ethereum in 2014, were in good faith. Others were outright scams. Regulators cracked down on the practice, and ICOs soon became another chapter in crypto history.

Now, the practice appears to be making a comeback, and the crypto startup Legion hopes to create the go-to platform where companies can—responsibly—sell tokens to small-time traders, say cofounders Fabrizio Giabardo and Matt O'Connor. 





“Just think IPO-type rigor, IPO-type access, mixing in with, again, crypto rails,” Giabardo told Fortune.





On Wednesday, the pair announced that Legion had raised $5 million in a seed round led by VanEck and Brevan Howard Digital. The crypto exchange Kraken as well as the venture arms of the crypto exchanges Coinbase and Crypto.com also participated in the raise, among other investors.





Giabardo and O'Connor declined to disclose their startup's valuation. The round was for equity and token warrants, or promised allocations of a yet-to-be-launched cryptocurrency, they said.




Legion's capital injection comes as ICOs are back in vogue in crypto. In June, the stablecoin project Plasma raised $500 million in five minutes through a public token sale. In July, Pump.fun, a memecoin factory that's become one of the most profitable projects in crypto, raised $600 million in 12 minutes. And Cobie, a pseudonymous crypto influencer and investor, has launched his own ICO platform called Sonar.





The return of the ICO follows a regulatory thaw in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump's administration has signaled a friendlier approach to crypto than that of former President Joe Biden. Crypto companies, who once were fleeing the U.S. amid a flurry of lawsuits from the Securities and Exchange Commission, are now returning.





And some feel more emboldened to try out ICOs as a means to raise funds. But Giabardo and O'Connor believe their platform will help prevent the outright scams that were common a decade ago—when founders would raise millions off the back of a jargon-filled white paper and then disappear in so-called “rug pulls.”





Both founders are crypto veterans. Giabardo, who had stints as a geologist and then consultant, started exploring crypto in 2020 and eventually began working with the crypto analytics platform Delphi Digital. O'Connor comes from traditional finance, where he worked at the asset manager Bridgewater Associates before he found his way to working on Stacks in 2022, a blockchain built on top of Bitcoin.





The two eventually crossed paths and decided to work together to bring back ICOs. Their platform is built to comply with recently released regulatory framework in the European Union for early token launches, they said. The statutes require projects to release a “white paper” that requires issuers to detail, for example, risks involved with the offering and update their white papers anytime there are material changes to the projects.




The two cofounders have also met with the SEC to discuss what disclosures the agency should require for public sales, said O'Connor.





“Give people honest, truthful, succinct disclosures that they can fully understand, do some kind of checking that validates that, yes, they do truly understand these things,” he added. “And then, it's up to them to take the risks realistically.”

Fed Vice Chair urges banks to embrace blockchain or risk irrelevance, citing tokenization and fraud prevention as key benefits.

Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman has called for banks to embrace blockchain technology or risk losing relevance.

At the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium on Aug. 19, Bowman emphasized that regulators and banks must adopt a more proactive approach to the crypto industry.

She pointed out that integrating these new innovative technologies would be crucial for maintaining relevance in a rapidly evolving financial landscape.

She said:

“It is essential that banks and regulators are open to engaging in new technologies and departing from an overly cautious mindset. Regulators must understand new products and services and recognize the utility and necessity of embracing technology in the traditional financial sector.”

The Fed executive argued that this shift is not optional but necessary for the continued vitality of the banking system. She added that institutions that fail to evolve could become peripheral players, while forward-looking banks could strengthen their position in the market.

Bowman highlighted tokenization as one of the most immediate applications of blockchain. She explained that tokenized assets can be transferred digitally without intermediaries or the physical movement of securities.

She said the approach eliminates many manual steps and custodial coordination that currently creates delays and increases operational risk.

Moreover, Bowman noted that tokenized systems can streamline these steps, reduce operational friction, and expand market access.

Due to this, the Fed chief noted that regulatory alignment could move tokenization from pilot projects to mainstream adoption that would benefit both major banks and smaller community institutions.

Beyond tokenization's efficiency, Bowman highlighted blockchain's potential to combat fraud.

In the speech, she conceded that financial institutions face risks from identity theft, scams, and related crimes.

However, she argued that if blockchain can measurably reduce fraud, regulators should facilitate its adoption rather than impede it.

According to her:

“If fraud can be addressed using new technology, we should make sure that the regulatory framework does not stand in the way. I see this as an exciting opportunity for collaboration between industry and the Fed.”

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) maximalists typically call their coin "digital gold." But Tom Lee, Fundstrat co-founder and now chairman of Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc (NYSE:BMNR), is maximizing the potential of a different digital asset — Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH).

Lee's company, in just 35 days, has quietly built the largest corporate Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) treasury in the world—$5.26 billion worth of ETH.

Track $ETH price surge here.

Bitmine, once a traditional Bitcoin miner, flipped the script by pausing BTC mining and going all-in on Ethereum. Backed by Peter Thiel, the firm scooped up 833,137 ETH at an average price of $3,492 per coin. It didn't stop there—Lee doubled down during a price crash, adding another $130 million worth of Ethereum.

The haul now totals 1.174 million ETH, making BitMine the third-largest public crypto treasury globally, behind only Strategy Inc (NASDAQ:MSTR) (aka MicroStrategy) and MARA Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) (aka Marathon Digital).

That kind of conviction has caught Wall Street's eye. Ethereum recently traded near $3,679, up 40% over the past month, even while still 24% below its 2021 high. BMNR has rocketed over 725% year-to-date, peaking at $135 in July before settling near $58. For a company once synonymous with Bitcoin mining, the pivot has been nothing short of explosive.

For Lee, who has made a career out of contrarian calls, the message is clear: Ethereum's utility—staking rewards, smart contracts, and scaling—outweighs Bitcoin's static "digital gold" narrative. Institutional investors may be starting to agree. As Lee himself argues, ETH is fast becoming a Wall Street favorite, offering yield and real-world functionality that Bitcoin can't match.

Whether Ethereum can overtake Bitcoin in market dominance remains an open question. Indeed, it has a long way to go. Between Aug. 11–15, Ethereum spot ETFs saw a record $2.85 billion inflow—the largest weekly gain ever.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin spot ETFs drew $548 million.

U.S.-listed ETH ETFs now hold $28.15 billion (5.34% of ETH's market cap), compared with Bitcoin's $151.98 billion (6.54% of BTC's market cap).

Missed the Wiki Cat Pump? Snorter bot users didn't, and smart money are taking notice as SNORT token blasts to $3.5M in skyrocket ICO.

Wiki Cat (WKC) has shocked the market with a 293% move even as crypto extends its losing streak to a sixth day.

The token has been around for years, but it only staged its first major breakout this month, vaulting past a $200 million market cap and showing just how unpredictable meme coin runs can be. But its move is precisely the kind of play Snorter Bot Token (SNORT) is designed to spot.

Snorter is launching as a Solana-focused Telegram trading bot but will expand to other chains as its roadmap unfolds. While Solana remains the top launchpad for meme coins, significant opportunities also emerge on BNB Chain and beyond – and Snorter's tech stack is being built to track them wherever they appear.

Funding for development is ongoing, with the current round pricing SNORT at $0.1019, available for the next two days before the token becomes more expensive in later stages.

The next 100x meme coin is out there, and Snorter Bot Token is being built to find it.

Wiki Cat launched in March 2022 on BNB Smart Chain as a community-driven meme coin tied to the SMC DAO. 

For most of its early life, the token was traded quietly and with limited exposure, despite building a base of tens of thousands of holders. Its model combined massive burns, renounced ownership, and a push to onboard new users into crypto education, particularly across Africa.

It wasn't until June 2025 that WKC began drawing serious attention, with trading volume and price action surging as its valuation spiked to $10 million. 

That rally carried into August, where Wiki Cat's market capitalization crossed $200 million before settling below $150 million as of writing. 

Even during the broader market's six-day losing streak, WKC climbed 293% in the same period, bringing its total gains to 5,455% from June levels.



https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wiki-cat

For early holders, a $1,000 position taken in June would now be worth about $54,550 in under three months. 

Yet, the truth is, spotting these kinds of breakouts is notoriously difficult in a market oversaturated with meme coins. 

But that's exactly why the idea to develop Snorter Bot Token was formalized. Its purpose is to turn the guesswork of finding breakout tokens into an automated process.

Finding the next WKC before a surge like this can be life-changing, and Snorter Bot Token is being built to make that scenario more common among retail traders.

Right now, its Solana-native Fast Sniper tool monitors mempools and DEX contracts for the exact moment a new liquidity pool forms, then routes buys through private RPC endpoints that confirm faster than public gateways. The result is entries before the rest of the market sees the trade.

Most competing bots aren't built for this speed as they typically lean on public endpoints, slow feeds, or Ethereum-first templates that don't translate well to Solana's high-frequency environment. Even Solana-based bots often charge higher fees, react more slowly, or leave users exposed to MEV traps – all of which eat away at gains.

Wiki Cat lives on Binance, and Snorter's first rollout (Phase 2) will remain Solana-focused. But Phase 3 on the roadmap unlocks multichain capability, putting Snorter in a position to track and snipe opportunities across ecosystems, whether they start on Solana, Binance, or elsewhere. 

That's how Snorter ensures the next WKC-style move won't slip through retail's fingers.

Now once launched, traders won't even have to look far for a 100x shot because the SNORT token itself carries that upside. 

Holding SNORT unlocks the lowest execution fees in the Telegram trading bot space at just 0.85% – far below the 1.5% to 2% charged by most competitors. That utility kicks in from day one, making SNORT a true cost-saver every time a trade is placed.

Beyond fees, SNORT doubles as the governance token, giving holders direct influence over the bot's development and roadmap. 

And unlike Banana Gun, which only raised $1.3 million in its presale, Snorter has already cleared that mark by more than $2 million, showing stronger early demand.

That traction has also secured SNORT a place in Best Wallet's Upcoming Tokens feature. Best Wallet (BEST) is widely regarded as one of the best crypto and bitcoin wallets, giving users an edge with early project access and seamless token management. Its recognition of SNORT underscores just how much potential the project holds.

Even popular crypto influencer Crypto June agrees with a 100x projection for SNORT.



While the team hasn't officially confirmed the closing date, Snorter Bot Token's presale has already far outpaced Banana Gun's early raise, which could indicate that it is nearing its final phase.

That means the window to secure SNORT at its lowest entry price may close quickly. Early positioning has always been key to chasing 50x or even 100x gains.

The cheapest way in right now is through the ongoing presale. You can buy SNORT directly on the Snorter Bot Token website with SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or even a credit card. 

Snorter recommends using a WalletConnect-certified noncustodial wallet such as Best Wallet, which can be downloaded on Google Play or the Apple App Store.

Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance.

Amid a banner year for Bitcoin, two crypto firms have held initial public offerings, and more are hoping to do the same. One of those appears to be Blockchain.com, which earlier this year announced the hiring of a chief financial officer and chief operating officer, and on Wednesday announced that it had added Timothy Flynn, who has previously led KPMG and served as a director of JPMorgan, to its board. 

The announcement also included the appointment of the chief legal officer of e-commerce site Klaviyo, Landon Edmond, to the company's board. The moves come amid an unprecedented boom for the crypto industry, which has included a clamor of investor interest in some of the sector's oldest names—including Blockchain.com.





Founded circa 2014, Blockchain.com was an early leader in distributing crypto wallets, and became known in part for its Blockchain Explorer tool, which provides an easy interface for people to search transactions on Bitcoin and other chains. It has also made forays into the exchange business and payment services.





According to president Lane Kasselman, Blockchain.com has three primary lines of business: wallets for retail users, crypto services for hedge funds and other institutions, and asset management. The latter business includes venture capital investments, high-frequency trading, and working with digital asset treasury firms. 





Kasselman described the company's board, which numbers nine with Wednesday's appointments, as “spanning from Wall Street to Web 3.”




In a statement, Flynn described the firm as “a trusted bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy.”





Blockchain.com, which was valued at $7 billion in 2023, declined to comment on whether it is actively pursuing an initial public offering. The longtime crypto exchange Kraken is another familiar industry name that has been the subject of media reports about a potential IPO.





In recent months, stablecoin giant Circle and crypto conglomerate Bullish made their public debuts, four years after Coinbase held the industry's first IPO.

Shineco (NASDAQ: SISI) hat eine wegweisende Partnerschaft mit Plus Me Limited angekündigt, um die weltweit erste blockchain-basierte Plattform zur Tokenisierung von Zellvermögenswerten zu starten. Die Initiative umfasst die Schaffung von "Cell Infusion Redemption Tokens" auf dem Ethereum-Mainnet und ermöglicht digitale Verwahrung und den Handel mit biologischen Zellvermögenswerten.

Das Unternehmen hat zudem eine Mehrheitsbeteiligung von 51% an der Xi'an Dong'ao Health Management Co., Ltd. erworben und damit sein globales Lager- und Infusionsnetzwerk gestärkt. Diese strategische Übernahme zusammen mit den bestehenden Infiniclone-Aktivitäten in Singapur schafft eine umfassende Infrastruktur für Token-Einlösung und Asset-Abwicklung.

Die Plattform wird security tokens nach ERC-1400/ERC-20 nutzen, wobei Smart Contracts Eigentumsrechte und regulatorische Konformität über nicht fungible digitale Identifikatoren (NFDIs) sicherstellen. Das Ökosystem zielt darauf ab, traditionelles Biotech-Marketing zu verändern und Branchenprobleme wie hohe Kosten und illiquide Asset-Pools anzugehen.

Shineco combines blockchain tokenization with stem cell therapy, creating a novel business model through strategic acquisition and partnerships.

Shineco has pioneered a groundbreaking convergence of blockchain technology with biotech by establishing the world's first on-chain tokenization platform for cellular assets. This represents a fundamental transformation of their business model, transitioning from a traditional biotech service provider to an infrastructure layer for a decentralized cell economy.

The partnership with Plus Me Limited introduces several technical innovations with practical applications. The implementation of non-fungible digital identifiers (NFDIs) on Ethereum's mainnet creates immutable proof of cellular asset ownership and provenance, addressing a critical pain point in the industry where authenticity verification has historically been challenging. The ERC-1400/ERC-20 compliant security tokens introduce a novel liquidity mechanism for previously illiquid biological assets.

The strategic acquisition of a 51% controlling stake in Xi'an Dong'ao Health Management demonstrates execution capability beyond conceptual planning. This acquisition, combined with their previously acquired Singapore firm Infiniclone, establishes a critical global network that bridges the gap between digital tokens and physical cellular assets - solving the 'last mile' problem that has plagued many real-world asset (RWA) tokenization projects.

The business model innovation centers on transforming cellular assets into programmable financial instruments while maintaining biological integrity. The token burning mechanism upon redemption creates engineered scarcity that could potentially drive token value appreciation. The open ecosystem approach, where Shineco provides physical infrastructure while Plus Me delivers the tokenization layer, creates network effects that could scale more rapidly than a closed system.

This initiative reflects broader market trends where RWA tokenization is gaining institutional adoption, though regulatory frameworks remain inconsistent across jurisdictions. The inclusion of governance rights through future DAO voting indicates an evolving business structure that may decentralize certain decision-making processes while maintaining corporate control of critical infrastructure.

BEIJING, Aug. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Shineco Inc. ("Shineco" or the "Company"; NASDAQ: SISI), a leading innovator in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, today announced the execution of a "Cellular Asset On-Chaining and Marketing Ecosystem Cooperation Agreement" with blockchain infrastructure provider Plus Me Limited. This partnership enables blockchain-based tokenization of biological cellular assets, facilitating seamless global transfers and auditable standardized custody, creating a novel 'Asset On-Chaining + Application Scenarios' model in cell therapy. The collaboration will redefine the global biological cell industry's commercial architecture.

Under the agreement, Plus Me will deploy full lifecycle digital custody of Shineco's compliant mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the Ethereum mainnet. Smart contracts will immutably secure asset ownership rights, issuing unique non-fungible digital identifiers (NFDIs) for each cellular asset to ensure traceability and compliance. Verifiable uniqueness and regulatory compliance are cryptographically enforced through on-chain hashing.

Plus Me will issue ERC-1400/ERC-20 compliant security tokens, branded as "Cell Infusion Redemption Tokens." These utility tokens can be redeemed at Shineco-affiliated Cell Therapy Centers, with Tokens are programmatically burned upon redemption, enforcing scarcity and aligning long-term value for stakeholders. This RWA (Real-World Asset) tokenization framework addresses critical industry pain points: high user costs, unverifiable product provenance, and illiquid asset pools – converting biological assets into tradable digital instruments.

To bolster the initiative, Shineco has secured a controlling 51% stake in Xi'an Dong'ao Health Management Co., Ltd., a specialist in cryogenic cell storage and clinical applications, provides the off-chain infrastructure critical to token redemption, as of August 18, 2025. This strategic buyout operationalizes the tokenization initiative, providing off-chain infrastructure for token redemption. Combined with previously acquired Singapore firm Infiniclone, Shineco now controls a global storage & infusion network ensuring on-chain<>off-chain asset settlement.

The parties will co-build an open-cell industry ecosystem: Plus Me provides tokenization SaaS to third parties, while Shineco opens its physical custody network. Shineco maintains off-chain biological QA, with Plus Me ensuring on-chain regulatory compliance – creating cross-jurisdictional synergy with entities like Singapore's ACTRIS. This tokenized ecosystem transforms Shineco from a sole service provider into a global infrastructure provider for the cell economy, positioning the ecosystem for rapid revenue scalability.

Shineco's asset tokenization protocol aligns with the industry's shift from clinical trials to commercial scalability. "This marks the birth of a decentralized biotech economy—where every cell becomes a liquid, programmable asset, unlocking unprecedented value for medicine and investors alike," said Jennifer Zhan, CEO of Shineco. "Token holders gain governance rights, including future DAO voting to enhance global ecosystem development in cell therapy—fundamentally transforming traditional marketing paradigms."

Investors face turbulence as Shiba Inu price struggles to hold key levels around $0.00001237. While meme coins remain volatile, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a compelling alternative, with $20 million raised, over 609 million tokens sold, and a Q3 beta wallet launch, highlighting real-world utility and growing adoption momentum.









Shiba Inu price is hovering near $0.00001237 as traders work to maintain crucial support levels. According to the latest Shiba Inu Price Forecast, the area between $0.00001250 and $0.00001230 will be pivotal in determining whether SHIB can stage a recovery or continue its downward move. Market analysts remain cautious, noting that short-term sentiment is tilted toward selling as investors take profits. At the same time, attention is gradually shifting toward utility-focused tokens like Remittix (RTX), which recently surpassed $20 million raised and is gaining traction with growing adoption.

Recent technical patterns show SHIB retreating from $0.00001280, indicating hesitation among buyers. The Shiba Inu Price Forecast emphasizes that holding the $0.00001230–$0.00001250 support is essential. Should this level fail, SHIB could test lower zones near $0.00001200, risking the loss of recent gains. Traders are advised to use stop-losses around $0.00001220 to help protect against further declines.



Many experienced investors are considering positions between $0.00001240 and $0.00001250, aiming for a potential short-term rally toward $0.00001280, $0.00001300, and $0.00001320. Nevertheless, a break below the lower support could strengthen bearish momentum and trigger a broader correction. How the market reacts to these levels will influence the Shiba Inu Price Forecast in the coming sessions, highlighting the token's volatility and the potential for targeted trading opportunities.



While SHIB faces uncertainty, Remittix (RTX) has gained traction as a utility-driven crypto solution. Priced at $0.0969, with over 609 million tokens sold and $20 million raised, RTX is designed to solve real-world problems like cross-border payments and crypto-to-fiat transfers. The project's Q3 beta wallet launch further positions it as a functional platform rather than a speculative token, making it one of the most attractive opportunities for investors right now.

The upcoming wallet launch will enable seamless conversion across 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. Combined with strong fundraising momentum, these developments explain why interest in Remittix continues to grow despite market turbulence.

Shiba Inu price may face up to a 50% drawdown this year if support fails, while Remittix continues to build a product-focused narrative with tangible adoption. For investors looking for exposure to high-growth yet functional crypto assets, RTX represents a strategic alternative. Its cross-border payment capabilities, staking opportunities, and time-sensitive bonuses make it a standout choice in 2025.

The US state of Wyoming has this week announced the ‘mainnet' launch of its own stablecoin – the Frontier Stable Token (FRNT).

FRNT is a groundbreaking digital money programme for the public sector as the first fiat-backed, fully-reserved stablecoin issued by a public entity in the US – an eye-catching development given that traditional stablecoins are issued by private companies.

The project is being led day-to-day by the Wyoming Stable Token Commission, which was established more than two years ago (March 2023) through the Wyoming Stable Token Act. The state government is backing the Wyoming Stable Token Commission with a budget of $5.8m (about £4.3m).

In an announcement from state capital Cheyenne (19 August), the state government described the ‘pioneering state-issued stabletokens' as ‘ushering in a new era of digital finance' in a ‘historic move.'

A mainnet launch is a reference to the official activation of a blockchain network – its transitions from a testing environment (‘testnet') to a live, operational state where real transactions and applications can occur. FRNT is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar.

STABLECOINS: EXPLAINED Stablecoins (also known as stabletokens) are a type of digital asset / cryptocurrency, minted on a blockchain network, that seek to maintain a stable value by having their market value pegged to an external reference, most commonly fiat (traditional currency).

With a population estimated at just under 600,000 people, Wyoming is the US's least populous state despite being the tenth largest by area. But it has been undertaking numerous legislative, policy and marketing initiatives to position itself as a fintech and blockchain-friendly location – as exemplified by FRNT.

FRNT is designed to provide ‘secure, transparent and efficient digital transactions for individuals, businesses, and institutions – worldwide', according to a press notice issued by state governor Mark Gordon's office.

“For years, Wyoming has been the leading state on blockchain, cryptocurrency and digital asset regulation, passing over 45 pieces of legislation since 2016,” said Gordon, who is also chairman of the Wyoming Stable Token Commission, in the release. “The mainnet launch of the Frontier Stable Token will empower our citizens and businesses with a modern, efficient and secure means of transacting in the digital age.”

The Frontier Stable Token will be fully backed by US dollars and interest-bearing US Treasury securities, held in trust.

FRNT ‘fortifies its stability' with a legislatively-mandated remit to achieve 2% overcollateralization,' the press notice states. (Over-collateralization is a financial strategy where a borrower provides collateral worth more than the loan amount).

FRNT makes use of blockchain technology to offer ‘instant transaction settlement, reduced fees and enhanced accessibility for all users,' the press notice states.

This means users can send FRNT instantly and cheaply between any of these networks, while Wyoming maintains complete control over the currency's issuance and compliance.

FRNT is launched as a single, unified digital currency across seven blockchains – Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon and Solana – that were chosen via what the press notice describes as a ‘robust candidacy' process.

Further private-sector suppliers include LayerZero Labs (‘token issuance partner'), Fireblocks (blockchain infrastructure), Franklin Advisers (reserves management), Inca Digital (‘open-source intelligence') and The Network Firm (‘financial audit and monthly attestations').

At time of writing (20 August), the stabletoken's website (https://stabletoken.wyo.gov/) states that FRNT is ‘not currently available for purchase'. But the press notice states that FRNT will be made available for purchase ‘on the Solana blockchain through Wyoming-domiciled digital asset exchange Kraken in the coming days, as well as Rain's Visa-integrated card platform on the Avalanche blockchain.'

The release adds that ‘public availability will be noticed with a distribution [announcement] from this office and the Stable Token Commission.'

FRNT's launch coincides with the ‘Wyoming Blockchain Symposium 2025', which is being held this week in the resort town of Jackson Hole. The event includes a fireside chat today (20 August) during which Gordon will ‘detail the Cowboy State's eight-year history of passing forward-thinking legislation around digital assets and the benefits of the Wyoming Stable Token for consumers, his state and the nation,' according to the pre-event marketing.

Among the key figures driving the programme is Wyoming Stable Token Commission executive director Anthony Apollo, who gave the inside track on the initiative during an online broadcast organised by the Digital Euro Association (DEA) earlier this year (27 January).

Delivering a slideshow-style presentation followed by a Q&A, Apollo described the team he leads as “trying to create essentially a start-up within the context of US state government.”

DEA strategic advisor Conrad Kraft introduced the broadcast – titled ‘The Wyoming Stablecoin –State-Backed Digital Innovation' – by describing stablecoins as “bridging the gap between traditional financial systems and blockchain technology”.

These digital currencies offer, he said, the “promise of secure, efficient and transparent transactions with the potential to transform everything from cross-border payments to public sector operations”. Wyoming, he added, has “positioned itself at the forefront of this movement, creating a blueprint for what state-backed innovation can look like.”

Apollo, who took up his role in September 2023 after working in the private sector, said that (at the time) Wyoming lawmakers have passed about 45 pieces of digital asset-related legislation since 2016. He described the stablecoin as “meant to function as glue between some of these different and disparate initiatives.”

He described the Commission's $5.8m budget as “not very big… but perhaps appropriate” given that it is public funding. This capital is ultimately due back to the state's general fund. The aim is for the Commission to be self-sustaining.

The stablecoin is, Apollo explained, “intended to look a bit like” pre-existing stablecoins that are similarly pegged to the US dollar such as USDC, a stablecoin issued by Massachusetts-headquartered Circle, and PayPal's PYUSD, “with some differentiators.”

Treasury purchases funded by the programme should generate interest income that will be transferred to a ‘Wyoming School Foundation Program' that is run by the state's Department of Education. So, the more people use the stablecoin, the more schools should potentially benefit.

Since he began in the role, his office had received an “extensive amount of inbound interest” from more than 730 individuals across more than 360 organisations, as well aspirant “vendors who want to help build” the Wyoming Stable Token, he said.

“We want to make sure this has all the best practices of existing incumbent stablecoins, and go a little bit further than that,” he said.

Apollo set the state's efforts within the context of stablecoins' growth in popularity worldwide, describing these digital currencies as “really [having] emerged as the ‘killer app' for blockchain.”

Stablecoins' global total market value is about $215 billion (about £173 billion), he said (the market value has grown since).

Wyoming's ambition for the initiative is ultimately global. The intention is for the Wyoming Stable Token to be “certainly a domestic product and then international and also on DeFi platforms,” Apollo said. (‘DeFi' is an abbreviation for ‘decentralised finance'; a ‘defi platform' is a reference to peer-to-peer trading).

“It might take some time for us to get there,” he explained. “There might be some beta testing involved and making sure we have the appropriate compliance framework in place. But we do intend to be used pretty much anywhere that incumbent stabletokens are utilised.”

Wyoming's initiative comes to fruition just weeks after US president Donald Trump signed a law to establish a federal regulatory regime for stablecoins in a move closely watched by public- and private-sector fintech and payments specialists worldwide.

The law was signed after the House of Representatives passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) on 17 July by 308 votes to 122 during what US lawmakers dubbed ‘Crypto Week' in Washington DC.

As Trump signed the act into law (18 July), the White House released a ‘fact-sheet' describing GENIUS as a ‘historic piece of legislation that will pave the way for the United States to lead the global digital currency revolution.'

During the webinar in January, Apollo also sought to explain the rationale for the Wyoming initiative in the context of the trajectory of US national debt and the dollar's global power.

The US government has about $36 trillion (about £29 trillion) of debt “and counting… it's a big number,” he summarised. “We [the US government] need buyers of this debt. We're going to keep selling it or creating USD – printing USD. If you look at fiat-backed stablecoins and aggregate [them], they would represent a top 20 holder of US debt.”

He also highlighted an opinion piece (article) authored by former Speaker Paul Ryan in the Wall Street Journal published on 13 June 2024 (‘Crypto Could Stave Off a US Debt Crisis' and sub-titled ‘Stablecoins backed by dollars provide demand for US public debt and a way to keep up with China').

In respect of the dollar's global power, the currency is on one side of almost 90 per cent of all global foreign exchange (FX) transactions.“However, with the sanctions activities of the prior [president Joe Biden] administration, many nation states have begun selling off dollars that are in their treasury,” Apollo said. “If we need some kind of digitised dollar that will be more liquid [and] can settle anywhere in the world almost instantaneously to help increase the US dollar's hegemony […] stablecoins have certainly been identified as a way to do that – and protect the USD as the world's reserve currency.”

Further challenges ahead range from how to encourage people to understand and actually use the Wyoming Stable Token to technical considerations related to the tokens' security.

As to the public communications challenge, Apollo was of the view that “most people know what stablecoins are and how they work.”

“However, for members of the public who may not be aware of what blockchain is, [and have] heard negative things about crypto, there will be a bit of a hurdle here to explain how stabletokens can benefit both users and retailers or even institutions in that it would be very efficient, lower fees, etc,” he said.

He provided a single sentence that he felt summarises the project: ‘a Wyoming stabletoken released on a public blockchain can be used to settle dollar-denominated transactions of any size anywhere on Earth in seconds, incurring fees less than one cent while minimising counterparty risk.'

In respect of security considerations, Apollo said that the “hope” was to incorporate technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs or homomorphic encryption “to the extent that the State of Wyoming can have visibility into who is using the token but perhaps it's obfuscated on a public blockchain itself”.

A related angle is the possibility of what he described as ‘malicious actors' snapping up Wyoming's stablecoins. “We need to make sure that Wyoming Stable Tokens do not end up with malicious actors,” he said, mentioning groups including North Korea's ‘Lazarus Group'. “We need to make sure that if stabletokens ended up where we don't want them, we have the ability to perform some kind of interdiction.”

ZERO-KNOWLEDGE PROOFS & HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTION: EXPLAINED A zero-knowledge proof is a method of proving the validity of a statement without revealing anything other than the validity of the statement itself ///Homomorphic encryption allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without compromising the encryption

During a Q&A, Apollo was asked whether incentives were planned to encourage the stablecoin's use.

Among the options being considered was for the token to “natively bear yield”, he said. But he cautioned that this was at present a “very high-level concept” and would “require a significant amount of work from a compliance perspective”. This would not, he emphasised, happen “from day one.”

“But states do have some exemptions around securities laws,” he continued. “If you look at the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] and the environment here in the US, a lot of the yield-bearing stabletokens have gone offshore.”

He was also asked what progress he envisaged the initiative making in five years and whether he could envisage other US states “jumping in and competing with” Wyoming.

Answering the second part of the question first, he said that “if we launch this programme and it becomes successful, because everything we do is public, it'll be pretty easy for any other state to kind of copy-and-paste the work that we've done.”

In respect of the five-year horizon, he responded that he hoped that the programme had “really taken off” within that timeframe, including “contributing well into the state's budget”.

Apollo emphasised that the Commission's “one, very specific remit” (at time of the online broadcast) was to issue the Wyoming Stable Token.

“My hope is that, in the future, this Commission can look more like other agencies within the state that have multiple divisions,” he said. “I would hope that someday perhaps this is the ‘Wyoming Digital Asset Authority' and stabletokens is one division thereof. I would hope that we can, in time, have a division for tokenised real-world assets. This state is rich in gold and silver, land and livestock, oil and gas, rare-earth metals that are being used for AI [artificial intelligence] GPUs [graphics processing units], and even uranium. These are things I would like to put on [block]chain.”

In this vein he mentioned the possibility of using blockchain during political elections. “That, to me, will be downstream of robust solutions around digital identity,” he said. “I would hope in the future that a division within this agency can handle on-chain voting tied to some kind of digital ID that would help really shore up elections and make sure there's no fraud.”

“That's my five to maybe seven-year plan,” he concluded. “I'll add an extra two years on it!”.

In a LinkedIn post on 19 August, LayerZero Labs opined that ‘there's no clearer signal of where finance is heading than a US state putting the dollar onchain' (meaning ‘on blockchain').

 Bitcoin retraced to a low of $112,600 as retail panic selling resulted in the most bearish social sentiment since June, but analysts see a buying opportunity ahead. 

Retail crypto traders seemingly flipped bearish after Bitcoin failed to pick itself up from a recent dip below $113,000, clocking a 17-day low.

“Retail traders have done a complete 180 after Bitcoin failed to rally and dipped below $113,000,” said analysts at blockchain analytics firm Santiment on Wednesday.

Santiment also reported that the past 24 hours have marked “the most bearish sentiment seen on social media” since June 22, when fears of war in the Middle East caused a cascade of panic sells.

Santiment said negative social sentiment is a good thing for dip buyers, especially when there is “blood in the streets and fear is maximized.”

Short-term retail traders are also more inclined to panic sell or scalp profits than their diamond-handed counterparts, who view the asset class as a longer-term investment. 

Santiment said that the panic selling was a “good sign of an upcoming dip bounce.”  

Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $112,656 in late trading on Tuesday on Coinbase, according to TradingView, its lowest price since Aug. 3 when it fell toward support levels at around $112,000. 

BTC has now retreated by 8.5% from its all-time high last week of just over $124,000, while the total crypto market capitalization has dropped below $4 trillion to a two-week low.

The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has slipped into “Fear” with a rating of 44 out of 100, its lowest level since late June. 

“Markets move in the opposite direction of the crowd's expectations,” said Santiment. 

Market corrections during a bull cycle are nothing new and are a healthy part of the larger cycle. Similar pullbacks, often called “bear traps,” occurred at the same stage in the cycle in previous years.

In the 2017 bull market year, BTC corrected by 36% in September before surging to a new peak three months later.

A similar scenario played out in September 2021 when BTC corrected 23% before powering to an all-time high later that year. 

If history rhymes and there is a similar correction depth in 2025, BTC could pull back as low as $90,000 next month before recovering to a new all-time high.

The cryptocurrency market has evolved dramatically since the euphoric 2020-2021 bull run, and the latest YouTube analysis from Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen reveals why this cycle is fundamentally reshaping how investors should think about digital assets.

Unlike the previous cycle where “everyone felt like a genius” and nearly every altcoin participated in massive rallies, today's market is delivering harsh lessons about sustainable investing practices. The difference comes down to one critical metric that most investors overlook.

Don't Miss:

The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.

Trade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses — no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies.

Cowen focuses heavily on the Advanced Decline Index for the top 100 cryptocurrencies, a metric that calculates daily advances minus daily declines. During 2020-2021, this indicator trended consistently upward, meaning broad participation across the cryptocurrency ecosystem drove total market cap growth.

Today's cycle paints a starkly different picture. The ADI has been declining since 2021, creating a series of lower highs despite the overall crypto market cap increasing. This means only a handful of assets are responsible for the market's gains while hundreds of altcoins continue bleeding value.

“A lot of cryptocurrencies just continue to bleed back to Bitcoin for many years and now also Ethereum,” Cowen explains, highlighting how liquidity rotates briefly through different altcoin sectors before ultimately flowing back to the market leaders.

Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.

The current cycle is characterized by what Cowen calls “blue-chip dominance” — primarily Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin broke its all-time highs long ago and has maintained strength, while Ethereum, though still technically below previous peaks, has shown renewed momentum recently.

This concentration of gains challenges the prevailing narrative from 2020-2021, when lower interest rates and massive money printing created an environment where riskier altcoins outperformed consistently. The macroeconomic backdrop today is “almost completely opposite,” according to Cowen's analysis.

While certain altcoins have enjoyed their moments in the spotlight — Solana in 2023-2024, XRP's late 2024 surge, and Ethereum's recent strength — these outperformance periods prove fleeting. The pattern shows liquidity rotating from “this altcoin to that altcoin,” but rarely establishing durable outperformance against Bitcoin.

“Sometimes it's not about chasing the next 100x gem,” Cowen notes. “It's about preserving what you have” — specifically, preserving Bitcoin holdings rather than constantly chasing speculative plays.

This cycle is teaching “good investing practices” by demonstrating that speculation often leads to “bleeding Satoshis” — losing value against Bitcoin over time. The 2020-2021 environment encouraged investors to buy “the riskier stuff thinking it's going to outperform Bitcoin,” but current conditions reveal the unsustainability of that approach.

Even when altcoins briefly outperform in future cycles, Cowen warns that “the most likely outcome after that brief window is over is to just continue to see them bleed.” This occurs because over longer timeframes, the Advanced Decline Index generally trends downward, and only a select few altcoins maintain relevance across multiple market cycles.

For investors navigating today's market, the key insight involves shifting from a growth-at-any-cost mentality to a preservation-focused approach. Rather than constantly searching for the next moonshot, successful crypto investing may require accepting Bitcoin's role as the foundational asset and understanding that sustainable wealth building often means resisting the urge to chase speculative altcoin pumps.

This doesn't mean altcoins lack opportunity, but it suggests that timing, discipline, and realistic expectations about mean reversion become crucial for long-term success in an increasingly mature cryptocurrency market.

Researchers are trying to understand how people perceive the world in wildly different ways.

Here's what you'll learn in this story:

Apples seem to have become the internet's symbol for imagination—or at least, mental imagery. Every so often, someone takes to X or Reddit and asks what other users see when they imagine an apple. Responses may range from vivid descriptions of the apple's coloration and shine to a complete absence of visual detail.

But what nobody seems to appreciate is the assumption that all responders are picturing an apple in their “mind's eye.” In fact, about 1 to 3 percent of people experience an extreme form of “imagery vividness.” It could mean conjuring an image so vivid that it seems to have projected an apple into real life—or, on the opposite end of the spectrum, thinking about an apple in totally non-visual terms. Scientists are still seeking to understand the neurological mechanisms behind this wild variation, and how people navigate the world effectively no matter where on the scale their visualization lies.

When it comes to the neuroscience of imagination, “there's a few different hypotheses floating around,” Wilma Bainbridge, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago says, “but the commonly accepted idea is that seeing something in your mind's eye is like the visual system working in reverse.”

The visual system begins with light entering the eye. Millions of nerve fibers that comprise the optic nerve process this information and relay it directly to the brain. The visual cortex resides in the occipital lobe, which is at the very back of the brain. When we see something, our brain starts with the object's basic, concrete aspects, Bainbridge says. It begins with detecting lines and colors before categorizing the object verbally and understanding its relationship to other nearby objects. In that sense, the brain climbs the ladder of abstraction, assembling more basic concepts before reaching more complex levels that involve meaning.

But when you switch from looking at an apple to visualizing one in your mind's eye, this hypothesis says your brain might start with abstract concepts, first calling to mind what it wants to visualize, before moving to concrete characteristics like shape and color. A 2019 paper published in the journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience describes this process as “reverse visual hierarchy.” 

The apple test also introduces a spectrum of visual imagery, which shows two conditions that fall at either end: aphantasia and hyperphantasia. Those with aphantasia don't see anything in their mind's eye, while those with hyperphantasia imagine elaborately detailed objects and scenarios that seem almost lifelike. 

Yet, perception far extends beyond sight, pulling together other types of sensory information, like hearing and smell. So does our imagination, though research tends to favor visual imagery, according to the 2019 paper. Understanding the differences in brains of those with atypical imaginative capabilities, like aphantasia and hyperphantasia, can help provide greater insight into how humans create mental pictures.

In one experiment to investigate the neural mechanisms of aphantasia, Bainbridge examined identical twins, one of whom had the condition. She and her team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure blood flow in the brains of a pair of identical twins as they performed mental imagery tasks. Tracking blood flow in the brain can help indicate which parts are more actively involved in different abilities. The work was described in an April 2025 paper on the preprint server bioRxiv and is awaiting peer review.

From her self-reported scores of mental imagery vividness, the twin with aphantasia had diminished object imagery, but “intact” spatial imagery, which the paper says is typical for those with aphantasia. In other words, while people with aphantasia don't see images in their mind's eye, they can still imagine spatial relationships between objects. Part of the case study involved the twins drawing three scenes, first by sight and then from memory. The aphantasic twin accurately reproduced these scenes in both cases, but with “starkly less detail—including no color” than her sister, according to the paper.

A potential explanation for aphantasia could come from less functional connectivity between the area of the brain that deals with spatial and color processing and the area that deals with memory storage, Bainbridge and her co-authors suggest. However, aphantasic brains do have increased connectivity among non-visual areas, the paper says.

Research has found that people with aphantasia are no less creative or imaginative than those who can picture an apple—just not through vivid imagery. They may recall taste, smell, and sound ahead of sight, or abstractly know an object's shape and color without seeing the object, as one 2021 paper describes. A 2024 paper does stipulate that about 40 percent of people on the aphantasia spectrum report difficulty with recognizing faces, also known as prosopagnosia. This paper also reports that aphantasic people take longer to complete visual processing tasks.

On the other end of the spectrum, people with hyperphantasia have a kind of visually comprehensive, extremely detailed mental picture of objects, similar to looking at the objects in real life. They also have more frequently reported synesthesia, or the condition of experiencing two senses at once—perhaps seeing colors spontaneously along with numbers or letters, for instance. People with hyperphantasia also tend to work in creative fields where object imagery is crucial, while people with aphantasia are more prevalent in mathematical and scientific fields where spatial imagery is necessary. 

Researchers think they know at least one good reason for our powers of imagination, no matter how they manifest for each of us.

Our ability to imagine things could be an extension of the ability to predict what we're going to perceive. Prediction is important to anticipating what stimuli we might experience so we'll know how to respond, says Shimon Edelman, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Cornell University. Other animals need the ability to predict too, in order to know what's out of the ordinary and worth paying attention to. But perhaps they don't have the ability to imagine, at least the way we do, Edelman says.

Yet, all the monsters, places, people, and scenarios we might imagine to be novel are actually simply composites of the vast amount of experiences we've processed during our lives, Bainbridge says. “If I have you visualize a purple elephant and a cup of milk, that all relates to something you've seen before, but you're just combining them in unique ways.”

Honeybees are important crop pollinators, but they increasingly face pollen starvation as a result of agricultural intensification and climate change1. Frequent flowering dearth periods and high-density rearing conditions weaken colonies, which often leads to their demise2. Beekeepers provide colonies with pollen substitutes, but these feeds do not sustain brood production because they lack essential sterols found in pollen3,4. Here we describe a technological advance in honeybee nutrition with wide-reaching impacts on global food security. We first measured the quantity and proportion of sterols present in honeybee tissues. Using this information, we genetically engineered a strain of the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to produce a mixture of essential sterols for bees and incorporated this yeast strain into an otherwise nutritionally complete diet. Colonies exclusively fed with this diet reared brood for significantly longer than those fed diets without suitable sterols. The use of this method to incorporate sterol supplements into pollen substitutes will enable honeybee colonies to produce brood in the absence of floral pollen. Optimized diets created using this yeast strain could also reduce competition between bee species for access to natural floral resources and stem the decline in wild bee populations.

Managed honeybees (Apis mellifera) are fundamental to modern agricultural systems and global food security because of the crucial pollination services they provide to crops. Honeybees consume floral pollen, which provides proteins, fats, carbohydrates and micronutrients5. Increasingly, a combination of changes in climate, land use and agricultural practices is limiting the access of honeybees to sufficient and diverse floral resources1,6,7. Nutritional deficiencies increase the susceptibility of bees to disease and colony collapse and contribute to the growing rate of honeybee colony losses2,8. Loss of pollinators in turn reduces crop yields and raises the costs of food production9,10. In the past 40 years, beekeepers have adopted the practice of feeding artificial pollen substitutes when natural forage is insufficient or when bees are kept at high densities. However, commercially available pollen substitutes composed of protein flour, sugars and oils are not nutritionally complete feeds for honeybees. Such diets are missing essential sterols found in floral pollen that are necessary for colony health and growth4,11.

Sterols are a structurally diverse class of tetracyclic triterpenoids that are ubiquitously important for eukaryotic cell function, including for membrane architecture, hormone biosynthesis and signalling11,12,13. Unlike other animals, insects and marine invertebrates have lost the ability to synthesize endogenous sterols and instead acquire them from the diet12,13. Most insects produce cholesterol (CHOL) by dealkylating dietary sterols13,14. By contrast, honeybees have lost the ability to dealkylate sterols and instead directly use sterols obtained from the diet as membrane inserts and as precursors for ecdysteroid hormones15,16. Most of the pollen sterols used by bees are not available in quantities that could be fed to bee colonies on a commercial scale, which makes it unfeasible to create a nutritionally complete feed that is a substitute for pollen.

Sterols are consumed by nurse-aged worker honeybees from stored pollen (bee bread). The sterols accumulate in their mandibular glands and are transferred to worker, queen and drone larvae through glandular secretions17 (Fig. 1a). Sterol diversity is high in pollen18, but only a few key sterols seem to be taken up by worker bees in the gut and transferred to the brood19 (Fig. 1a,b). To quantify the proportions of sterols found in honeybees, we analysed the sterol composition in pupal tissue from each pupal type. The Δ5-sterol 24-methylenecholesterol (24-MC; Extended Data Fig. 1) constituted 60–70% of sterols in the pupae (Fig. 1b). Five other minor sterols were consistently present: β-sitosterol (SITO), desmosterol (DESMO), isofucosterol (ISOFUC), campesterol (CAMP) and CHOL (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). The relative abundance of each sterol found in pupae varied among pupal types (two-way quasi-binomial generalized linear model (GLM), sterol × pupal type, χ210 = 47.0, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1b). Drone pupae had 11.8% more 24-MC than worker pupae and 2.24-fold more ISOFUC than queen pupae. Worker pupae had at least 1.5-fold more DESMO than queen or drone pupae. CAMP was almost six times more abundant in worker and queen pupae than drone pupae.

a, Adult worker honeybees collect and eat floral pollen, which provides proteins, lipids and micronutrients. Pollen foraged from flowers is packed into cells of the wax comb with honey to form bee bread. Nurse bees consume bee bread and create glandular secretions (jelly), which include sterols required for development, to larvae. Larvae develop into pupae and eventually emerge as female workers, queens or drones (males). b, The relative abundance of each of the six key sterols found in pupae varies among pupal types (two-way quasi-binomial GLM, sterol × pupal type, χ210 = 47.0, P < 0.0001, n = 5 biologically independent samples). Error bars represent the mean ± s.d. c, Total sterol concentration per fresh weight (FW) varies significantly among pupal types (one-way Gaussian GLM, χ22 = 91.9, P < 0.0001, n = 5 biologically independent samples). Error bars represent the mean ± s.d. d, The relative abundance of selected sterols in pollen from bee-pollinated flowers (combined total (%), n = 41 biologically independent samples). Floral pollen varies significantly in the relative abundance of these sterols (one-way quasi-binomial GLM, χ25 = 61.0, P < 0.001). The centre line of the box plots represents the median, the hinges represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, whiskers extend 1.5× the interquartile range (75th to the 25th percentile) from the hinges and data points beyond the whiskers are plotted individually.

Letters (d) and asterisks (b,c) denote significance (post hoc comparisons of estimated marginal means with Tukey adjustment, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).

Source data

The total sterol concentration in pupal tissues varied significantly among pupal types and ranged from 130 to 260 μg g–1 fresh tissue (Gaussian GLM, χ22 = 91.9, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1c). The total sterol concentration in drone pupae was greater than in queen pupae and double that in worker pupae. The concentrations of individual sterols similarly varied among pupal types (Extended Data Fig. 2). Five of these sterols (SITO, CAMP, CHOL, ISOFUC and 24-MC) were among the six most common sterols found in pollen (SITO, CAMP, CHOL, ISOFUC, cycloartenol and 24-MC)18 (Supplementary Data 1). Analyses of previously published data18 showed that floral pollen varied significantly in the relative abundance of these sterols (quasi-binomial GLM, χ25 = 61.0, P < 0.001). SITO had the highest median relative abundance (40.9%), followed by ISOFUC (9.50%) and 24-MC (5.84%), whereas CAMP, CHOL and DESMO were present at low levels (Fig. 1d). The coefficient of variation ranged from 0.830 (SITO) to 2.99 (DESMO; Fig. 1d).

To produce the pollen sterols needed by bees, we used the oleaginous yeast Y. lipolytica as a host for sterol production. This yeast was chosen because of its high capacity for lipid accumulation and abundance of the sterol precursor acetyl-CoA20,21,22. Furthermore, we used a platform strain with improved mevalonate pathway flux towards farnesyl diphosphate to increase the supply of sterol precursors23. The platform strain is derived from the wild-type isolate W29 and it expresses a CRISPR-associated protein (Cas9) to enable genome editing. This strain also overexpresses four genes that encode mevalonate pathway enzymes: HMG1, ERG12, IDI1 and ERG20. Genes involved in acetyl-CoA formation, namely ATP-citrate lyase 1 (ACL1), and acetyl-CoA synthase from Salmonella enterica (ACS) are also included. The platform strain produced almost three times more ergosterol (ERGO, 1.95 mg g–1 dry cell weight (DCW)) than the wild-type strain W29 (0.659 mg g–1 DCW; Extended Data Fig. 3a).

The endogenous ERGO pathway of yeasts can be remodelled to synthesize alternative sterols (Fig. 2). However, previous attempts to produce non-native sterols in Y. lipolytica have struggled to achieve high specific yields or stereoselectivity (Supplementary Table 1). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genes involved in the late stages of the ERGO pathway are nonessential and alternative sterols can be taken up from the environment when ERGO biosynthesis is compromised, such as under anaerobic conditions24,25. However, most non-Saccharomyces yeasts, such as Y. lipolytica, lack sterol uptake transporters and do not exhibit flexible sterol auxotrophy26. For this reason, endogenous ERGO synthesis is essential, which makes deletion of latter ERGO pathway genes such as ERG4 (which encodes Δ24(28)-sterol reductase) challenging in Y. lipolytica27.

a, Schematic of the sterol biosynthesis pathway from mevalonate (MVA) in yeast and plants. The late steps in the pathways and the enzymes that catalyse these reactions are indicated: ERG3 (Enzyme Commission (EC) number EC 1.14.21.6), C-5 desaturation; ERG5 (EC 1.14.19.41), C-22 desaturation; ERG4 (EC 1.3.1.71), Δ24 reduction; SSR2 (EC 1.3.1.72), Δ24(25) reduction; TtSTC1 (EC 4.2.1.123), T. thermophilia squalene-tetrahymanol cyclase; DWF5 (EC 1.3.1.21), Δ7 reduction; DWF1 or SSR1 (EC 1.3.1.72), Δ24(28) reduction; SMT2 (EC 2.1.1.143), C-28 methylation; CYP710A1, C-22 desaturation. A cross indicates a deleted gene, whereas an underline indicates a heterologous gene. b, Gene edits used to create Y. lipolytica strains capable of producing non-native sterols that are tailored for honeybees. CqSMT, SMT from C. quinoa; SlSSR2, SSR2 from S. lycopersicum; StSSR1, SSR1 from S. tuberosum; TspDWF5, DWF5 from Tetraselmis sp.

To overcome this issue, we used a sterol surrogate. The previously characterized STC1 gene from Tetrahymena thermophilia encodes a squalene-tetrahymanol cyclase that converts squalene to the pentacyclic triterpenoid tetrahymanol (TET; Extended Data Fig. 1), which can act as a substitute for ERGO function in yeasts28,29,30. TET is not anticipated to be detrimental to honeybees as pollen also contains diverse sterol intermediates and stanols that do not accumulate in honeybee tissues18. T. thermophilia SCT1 was introduced into the platform yeast strain under the weak PrGPAT promoter31 to drive minimal expression and to limit the diversion of carbon flux away from the sterol pathway. TET accounted for 14% of the sterols produced in the resulting TET strain (Extended Data Fig. 3a). By producing TET in Y. lipolytica, we were able to efficiently manipulate the sterol pathway. The subsequent elimination of ERGO production in our strains may have also helped to remove negative feedback inhibition on sterol biosynthesis.

We first engineered Y. lipolytica to produce the most important honeybee sterol, 24-MC. Redirection of the Y. lipolytica sterol pathway from ERGO to 24-MC required us to sequentially delete the endogenous genes ERG4 and ERG5 (which encode sterol C-22 desaturase) and introduce a heterologous DWF5 or DHCR7 gene (which encode Δ7-sterol reductase; Fig. 2). The erg4Δerg5Δ strain was used to screen heterologous DWF5 and DHCR7 variants identified in the genomes of plants, animals, fungi and bacteria. Ten diverse variants were selected and expressed under the strong PrTEFintron promoter31 (Fig. 3a). The strain that contained DWF5 from Tetraselmis sp. (a green algal phytoplankton) produced the highest content of 24-MC (42.1 mg g–1 DCW) and accumulated less TET and ergosta-5,7,24(28)-trienol intermediates than the next highest producing strain, which expressed DWF5 from Coccomyxa subellipsoidea (a unicellular green alga) (Fig. 3a).

a, 24-MC production by engineered Y. lipolytica strains with different heterologous DWF5 and DHCR7 variants. Genes were selected from plants (DWF5), animals (DHCR7), algae, fungi and bacteria, including Tetraselmis sp. GSL018 (Tsp), Coccomyxa subellipsoidea (Cs) S. tuberosum (St), Ectocarpus siliculosus (Es), Mortierella vertcillata (Mv), Danio rerio (Dr), Legionella drancourtii (Ld), G. soja (Gs), Waddlia chondrophila (Wc) and ‘Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila' (CPa). Strains were compared for the content of 24-MC, TET and the main pathway intermediate ergosta-5,7,24(28)-trienol (n = 3 biologically independent samples). Error bars represent the mean ± s.d. for the total sterol content. b, Sterol composition of Y. lipolytica strains progressively engineered to produce a mixture of additional sterols required by honeybees (n = 3 biologically independent samples).

Source data

The 24-MC-producing strain was subsequently engineered to create a mixed-sterol strain that produced small amounts of all the other sterols we observed in honeybees (Fig. 1b). We first introduced the previously characterized Δ24(28)-sterol reductase (encoded by SSR1) from potato Solanum tuberosum; this enzyme reduces the 24-MC side chain to produce CAMP32 (Fig. 2). By using a heterologous plant variant, we could regulate the expression level with the weak promoter PrDGA1 (ref. 31) and obtain the C-24α R epimer of CAMP found in plants rather than the C-24β S epimer as in ERGO (Extended Data Fig. 1). The resulting ‘two-sterol' strain produced 24-MC (19.9 mg g–1 DCW) and a small amount of CAMP (0.445 mg g–1 DCW, Fig. 3b). We then constructed a strain that was further capable of producing C-24 ethyl sterols by introducing the C-28 sterol methyl transferase (encoded by SMT) from Chenopodium quinoa (quinoa) under the control of the PrGPAT promoter. This ‘four-sterol' strain produced ISOFUC (0.396 mg g–1 DCW), SITO (0.145 mg g–1 DCW), 24-MC (21.6 mg g–1 DCW) and CAMP (0.245 mg g–1 DCW, Fig. 3b).

To enable the production of CHOL and DESMO, the gene encoding Δ24(25)-sterol reductase (SSR2) from tomato Solanum lycopersicum was expressed under the PrGPAT promoter in the four-sterol strain to generate the final mixed-sterol strain (Fig. 3b). Δ24(25)-sterol reductases are typically found in animals and reduce DESMO to CHOL but are also present in Solanaceous plants as part of the glycoalkaloid synthesis pathway32. When expressed in a 24-MC-producing S. cerevisiae strain, both DESMO and CHOL are produced32. This property was similarly observed in our final ‘mixed-sterol' strain, which produced 24-MC (24.6 mg g–1 DCW), CAMP (0.433 mg g–1 DCW), ISOFUC (1.59 mg g–1 DCW), SITO (trace amounts), CHOL (0.396 mg g–1 DCW) and DESMO (0.898 mg g–1 DCW) during small-scale cultivation (Fig. 3b). The total detected sterol content decreased with each round of engineering from 60.2 mg g–1 DCW in the 24-MC strain to 28.0 mg g–1 DCW in the mixed-sterol strain (Extended Data Fig. 3b). The mixed-sterol strain was used for cultivation in bioreactors.

We investigated sterol and biomass production by cultivating the 24-MC strain in fed-batch mode in 250-ml controlled bioreactors. The 24-MC content reached 8.72–12.0 mg g–1 DCW, and the biomass reached 29.0–33.0 g DCW per litre after 150 h of fermentation (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). To produce biomass for testing in honeybee diets, we cultivated the mixed-sterol strain in fed-batch mode in 5-litre bioreactors. After 84 h of fermentation, the sterol content was 8.46–9.76 mg g–1 DCW, and the cell density reached 48.3–49.8 g DCW per litre (Fig. 3c). The relative sterol content increased for the first 24 h and then remained stable. 24-MC constituted approximately 65% of the total sterol content (Fig. 3d). ISOFUC, CAMP, CHOL, DESMO and SITO together constituted 15% of the total sterol content, and TET contributed the remaining 20% (Fig. 3d). We also fermented the W29 strain and the TET strain in 5-litre bioreactors for use as controls in feeding experiments. The sterol content for these two strains reached 0.100–0.118 and 0.099–0.204 mg g–1 DCW, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f).

Previous studies of non-native sterol production in yeast have achieved up to 36 mg g–1 DCW epi-campesterol in Y. lipolytica and 19.3 mg g–1 DCW epi-ergosterol in S. cerevisiae under fermentation conditions (Supplementary Table 1). We initially achieved 42.1 mg g–1 DCW of 24-MC during small-scale cultivation, which is eightfold more sterol per unit biomass than vegetable oils or floral pollen18,33. This result demonstrates the utility of the pre-engineered platform strain and the potential of Y. lipolytica as a host for sterol production. However, the sterol content reduced with each engineering step of the strain and during cultivation scale-up. Reductions in sterol content have been observed in other studies of similar strains during bioreactor cultivation34,35. Nevertheless, pathway optimization, capacity for sterol storage and growth conditions for lipid accumulation can be further improved to increase the sterol content in Y. lipolytica36. Successful strategies in yeast include regulation of cellular sterol homeostasis and enzyme relocalization to lipid droplets37,38.

The resulting yeast biomass from fermentation was dried and ground to create diets that could be tested in semi-field feeding trials with honeybee colonies. Dried yeast biomass was incorporated at 20% w/w into an artificial base-diet formulation that contained additional proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals required by honeybees. The following diets were tested: a mixed-sterol strain diet (MxSt), a TET strain diet (Tet), a W29 strain diet (WT) and a no yeast base diet (base). The latter three were used as control diets. Because the mixed-sterol strain produced only trace amounts of SITO, all yeast-based diets were supplemented with a commercial phytosterol mix, which contained approximately 12.0% w/w SITO (Supplementary Table 7). The base diet was also supplemented with a commercial phytosterol mix to match the total sterol concentration in the MxSt diet (0.340% w/w).

We used a semi-field method with small colonies of honeybees to measure the impact of the different diets on brood production in the absence of incoming pollen. We conducted feeding trials over 3 months and monitored diet consumption, sterol composition, colony size and brood status (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Figs. 4–6). Every 15 days, we counted broods at the egg, larval and pupal (capped cell) stages in each colony to assess the ability of each treatment to support brood production and development. In the first 45 days, an extreme heatwave resulted in a reduction in bees of all ages across all colonies (Extended Data Fig. 7). Hence, we supplemented colonies with extra nurse bees on days 32 and 45. Nurse bees have endogenous sterols that can be used to feed larvae3,16,19 (Fig. 2). For this reason, we analysed the brood data starting from day 45, when we stopped adding nurse bees.

a–c, Number of eggs (a), larvae (b) and capped brood cells (c) counted per colony for each treatment group for the last 2 months of the feeding trials. Eggs, larvae and capped brood cells were counted in each colony at 15-day intervals (n = 6 biologically independent colonies). Colonies were provided with a MxSt diet or one of three control diets: a Tet diet, a WT diet or a base diet. For all panels, the centre line of the box plots represent the median, the hinges represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, whiskers extend 1.5× the interquartile range (25th to the 75th percentile) from the hinges and data points beyond the whiskers are plotted individually. Statistical analysis was performed by fitting two-way negative binomial GLMMs followed by post hoc comparisons of estimated marginal means at each time point with Tukey adjustment (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). The number of eggs varied with time but not diet treatment group (diet + time, time: χ23 = 48.3, P < 0.0001; diet: χ23 = 0.782, P = 0.854). The number of larvae varied with diet treatment group (diet × time, χ29 = 18.4, P = 0.0304). The number of capped brood also varied with diet treatment group (diet × time, χ29 = 30.0, P = 0.0004). Brood counts from the first month of the feeding trials are shown in Extended Data Fig. 4. Note that the scales for months 2 and 3 differ, as brood production waned at the end of summer.

Source data

The number of eggs varied with time but not diet treatment group (two-way negative binomial generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), diet + time, time: χ23 = 48.3, P < 0.0001; diet: χ23 = 0.782, P = 0.854; Fig. 4a). Feeding trials continued until mid-September when egg production in colonies begins to decline going into autumn. As such, there was a threefold reduction in egg laying from day 45 to day 91 and a corresponding decrease in the numbers of larvae, capped brood and adults (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 5). Overall, the number of larvae varied among the diet treatment groups, and the effect of the diet became apparent by day 75 (two-way negative binomial GLMM, diet × time, χ29 = 18.4, P = 0.0304; Fig. 4b). At day 75, there were significantly more larvae in the MxSt diet treatment group than the Tet diet treatment group (post hoc comparison of estimated marginal means with Tukey adjustment, P = 0.0109). The base diet treatment group also had more larvae than the Tet diet treatment group (P = 0.0295). By day 91, larval counts were low in all colonies. The low brood production at this time point in the MxSt treatment was due to a seasonal effect that is also observed when colonies are fed with pollen (Extended Data Fig. 8).

The type of diet significantly affected the brood reared to pupation. As time passed, the impact of the diet on bees increased, such that colonies fed with the MxSt diet were more likely to rear larvae to the viable pupal stage (two-way negative binomial GLMM, diet × time, χ29 = 30.0, P = 0.0004; Fig. 4c). By day 75, there were significantly more pupae in the MxSt diet treatment group than the Tet (P = 0.0333) and WT (P = 0.0230) diet treatment groups. By the end of the experiment (day 91), there were also significantly more pupae in the MxSt diet treatment group than the base (P = 0.0328), Tet (P = 0.020) and WT (P = 0.020) diet treatment groups. There were still 10–40 capped brood cells in all but 1 colony in the MxSt diet treatment group. By contrast, there were 1–3 capped brood cells in 3 colonies in the base diet treatment group and none in the control yeast diet groups. The data for the control diets (which do not have the required sterols) were similar to our observations of colonies starved of pollen, whereby the rate of brood production is a function of the duration of nutrient starvation (Extended Data Fig. 8). Eventually, in all colonies fed with diets that lacked the required sterols (base, Tet and WT diets), the nurse bees did not have sufficient levels of key corporeal sterols necessary for rearing brood.

Although the number of pupae correlated with the diet given, sterol levels in the surviving pupae varied less than in the nurse bees and were not significantly different among the treatment groups (Gaussian GLMM, diet × time, time: χ24 = 14.9, P = 0.005; diet: χ23 = 4.39, P = 0.222; Extended Data Fig. 6). Moreover, sterol levels in the bodies of nurse bees showed less variation than the gut contents (Extended Data Fig. 6). However, neither the sterol content of the pupae nor the number of pupae correlated with the total sterol content in the bodies of nurse bees (Extended Data Fig. 9). In the MxSt and Tet diet treatment groups, TET accumulated in the guts of nurse bees (up to 42.4 μg per bee) but to a lesser extent in the bodies (up to 18.7 μg per bee) and not at all in the pupae (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Pollen contains diverse sterols, including cyclopropyl intermediates and stanols18, but our data indicated that only the Δ5-terminal intermediates of the sterol pathway tended to accumulate in honeybees. In yeast-feeding experiments with our mixed-sterol strain, nurse workers transferred only the key sterols produced by the yeast (24-MC, ISOFUC, DESMO, CAMP, SITO and CHOL) to the brood. Two diets contained the sterol surrogate TET, but this was not found in the brood. This finding indicates that bees have selective mechanisms for enriching larval jelly with the key sterols. Our data validate previous findings11 that honeybees probably require multiple sterols for continued brood production. The most important sterols may be 24-MC and CHOL, as colonies fed sterol-free diets supplemented with 24-MC or CHOL produce more pupae than when supplemented with SITO or CAMP11.

We observed a clear benefit to colonies that were fed the MxSt diet, which contains less than 0.5% w/w sterol. Understanding the full impact on the health and performance of honeybees fed with our MxSt yeast would require a long-term field study with standard size colonies. Yeast biomass is an additional valuable source of proteins, lipids and vitamins22,39. Hence, it may be preferable to favour biomass over sterol yield when optimizing fermentation parameters to produce biomass for feed. We speculate that further engineering of lipid, protein and terpenoid profiles to produce nutrients such as beneficial fatty acids, antioxidants, carotenoids and fragrances40,41,42 could extend the suitability of Y. lipolytica biomass as a honeybee feed. Y. lipolytica biomass is regarded as safe for inclusion in food and feed, and engineered biomass has been established as feed in aquaculture39,43,44. The direct use of inactivated yeast biomass in the diet circumvents the need for sterol extraction, which is expensive and inefficient, and minimizes downstream processing. Such technology could also provide an avenue for the development of feeds for other farmed arthropods.

Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for plasmid construction. E. coli was grown at 37 °C and 300 r.p.m. in lysogeny broth (LB) liquid medium and at 37 °C on plates of LB solid medium supplemented with 20 g l–1 agar. Ampicillin was supplemented at a concentration of 100 mg l–1 for plasmid selection.

The Y. lipolytica W29 strain (MATa, Y-63746 ARS Culture Collection, The National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research) and the W29-derived platform strain ST9100 (MATa ku70∆::PrTEF1-cas9-TTef12::PrGPD-dsdA-TLip2 IntC_2-HMG<-PrGPD-PrTefInt->ERG12 pCfB8823 IntC_3-SeACS<-PrGPD-PrTefInt->YlACL1 IntD_1-IDI1<-PrGPD-PrTefInt->ERG20, a mevalonate-upregulated strain) have been previously described23. The platform strain ST9100 was used to construct the sterol-producing strains. Details for all of the strains used in this study are provided in Supplementary Table 2.

Y. lipolytica was grown at 30 °C on yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium containing 10 g l–1 yeast extract, 20 g l–1 peptone and 20 g l–1 glucose, supplemented with 20 g l–1 agar for preparation of solid medium. For selection, either nourseothricin (250 mg l–1) or hygromycin (400 mg l–1) was added to the medium. Cultivation of strains for sterol production was performed in YPD medium containing 80 g l–1 glucose. Chemicals were obtained, unless indicated otherwise, from Sigma-Aldrich or Merck. Nourseothricin was purchased from Jena BioScience.

The following coding sequences for enzymes were codon-optimized for Y. lipolytica and synthesized as GeneArt Strings DNA fragments by Thermo Fisher Scientific: Δ7-sterol reductase from S. tuberosum (StDWF5, GenBank accession: BAQ55276.1), D. rerio (DrDHCR7, accession: NP_958487.2), L. drancourtii (LdDWF5, accession: FJ197317.1), E. siliculosus (EsDWF5, accession: CBN77313.1), ‘Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila' (CPaDWF5, accession: KIC71363.1), C. subellipsoidea (CsDWF5, accession: XM_005650286.1), M. vertcillata (MvDWF5, accession: KFH65691.1), G. soja (GsDWF5, accession: XP_028244742.1); Tetraselmis sp. GSL018 (TspDWF5, accession: JAC78771.1) and W. chondrophila (WcDHCR7, accession: ADI39181.1); squalene-tetrahymanol cyclase from T. thermophilia (TtSTC1, accession: XP_001026696.2); Δ24(25)-sterol reductase from S. lycopersicum (SlSSR2, accession: BAQ55273.1); C-28 sterol methyl transferase from C. quinoa (CqSMT, accession: XP_021737090.1); and Δ24(28)-sterol reductase from S. tuberosum (StSSR1, accession: AB839749.1). The codon-optimized sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 3.

The plasmids, BioBricks and primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Tables 4–6. BioBricks were amplified by PCR using Phusion U polymerase (Thermo Scientific). BioBricks were assembled into EasyCloneYALI vectors with uracil-specific excision reagent (USER) cloning31. For marker-mediated gene deletion, upstream and downstream homology arms for relevant genes were synthesized as BioBricks by PCR amplification from the genomic DNA of the platform strain ST9100. Knockout constructs were assembled from BioBricks through USER reactions as detailed in Supplementary Table 5. USER reactions were transformed into E. coli, and correct assemblies were verified by Sanger sequencing (Eurofins).

The yeast vectors were integrated into different previously characterized intergenic loci in the Y. lipolytica genome as previously described31. Integration vectors were digested with NotI enzyme (New England BioLabs) before lithium acetate transformation, as previously described31. Correct integration was verified by colony PCR using Taq DNA polymerase master mix RED (Ampliqon) with vector-specific primers and primers complementary to the genomic region adjacent to the integration site31.

For marker-mediated gene deletion, transformants were selected on YPD plates supplemented with antibiotic, and correct transformants were confirmed by colony PCR. Marker removal was performed by transformation of the strains with a Cre-recombinase episomal vector31. Marker removal was confirmed by colony PCR.

Yeast strains were inoculated into 2.5 ml YPD in 24-deep-well plates with air-penetrable lids (EnzyScreen). The plates were incubated at 30 °C with 300 r.p.m. agitation for 24 h. The optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was measured with an Implen P300 NanoPhotometer. The cultures were then diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 in 2.5 ml fresh YPD medium with 80 g l–1 glucose and grown for a further 72 h at 30 °C with 300 r.p.m. agitation. All cultivations were performed in triplicate. DCW was measured at the end of cultivation, whereby 1 ml of culture broth was transferred to a preweighed 2 ml microcentrifuge tube, centrifuged (3,000g, 5 min) and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were then washed twice with deionized water (1 ml). The cell pellet was dried at 60 °C for 7 days before the final weight was measured.

For sterol extraction from yeast, 1 ml of culture broth was transferred to a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube, centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were washed twice with deionized water (1 ml). The cell pellet was resuspended in 10% w/v methanolic potassium hydroxide (500 μl) and transferred to a 1 ml glass vial for saponification. The suspension was incubated at 70 °C for 2 h with vortexing at 15-min intervals. The saponified samples were then vortexed and spiked with 50 μl of internal standard (1 mg ml–1 epicoprostanol in absolute ethanol). Next, 500 μl n-hexane was added to each sample for extraction of the free sterol component. Samples were vortexed and the organic phase transferred to a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube. The extraction step was repeated in a further 500 μl n-hexane. The combined hexane phases were left overnight at room temperature for evaporation of the solvent. Sterol crystals remained in the tube.

For sterol analysis of the diets, each diet was sampled three times into preweighed 20 ml glass vials, and the weight of each sample was recorded. For sterol extraction from honeybee tissues, samples were first dried by freeze drying. Samples were dried at −48 °C under vacuum for 4 days. Dried samples were weighed and stored at −80 °C. For saponification, samples were first broken up with a spatula. For gut samples (in 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes), samples were suspended in 500 μl 10% w/v methanolic potassium hydroxide. For honeybee tissue samples (in 20 ml vials; pupae, nurse carcasses and queens), samples were suspended in 2.5 ml 10% w/v methanolic potassium hydroxide. Diet samples (in 20 ml vials) were suspended in 5 ml 10% w/v methanolic potassium hydroxide. Samples were incubated at 70 °C for 2 h in a water bath, with vortexing at 30–60 min intervals. The saponified samples were then spiked with 50 μl (gut samples) or 100 μl (diet, pupae, nurse carcasses and queen samples) of internal standard (1 mg ml–1 epicoprostanol in absolute ethanol). For extraction of the free sterol component, 500 μl (gut samples), 2.5 ml (pupae, nurse bee carcasses and queen samples) or 5 ml (diet samples) n-hexane was added to each sample. Samples were vortexed and the organic phase transferred to a 2 ml (gut samples) or 7 ml (diet, pupae, nurse bee carcasses and queen samples) glass vial. The extraction step was repeated and the combined hexane phases were left overnight at room temperature for evaporation of the solvent. The resulting extracts were resuspended in 500 μl (gut samples) or 1 ml (diet, pupae, nurse bee carcasses and queen samples) n-hexane and vortexed. From each sample, a subsample of 250 μl was transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and left at room temperature overnight for final drying.

Sterols were resuspended in 500 μl pyridine that contained 20 μl N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (Merck) and incubated for 4 h at 50 °C and then briefly vortexed before direct injection into an Agilent Technologies 8860 gas chromatograph connected to an Agilent Technologies 5977 MSD mass spectrometer (for gas chromatography–mass spectrometry). Samples were eluted over an Agilent HP-5MS column using a splitless injection at 250 °C with a standard gas chromatography program at 170 °C for 1 min, ramped to 280 °C at 20 °C min−1 and monitoring between 50 and 550 AMU.

Sterols were identified by comparing their retention time relative to CHOL and mass spectra data available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology mass spectral library per a previous study18. Sterol identity in the final strain ST12178 was confirmed through comparison with authentic standards. Sterols were quantified by calculating the ratio of the peak area of the targeted sterol to that of the internal standard. The mass of each sterol in the sample was obtained by multiplying the ratio with the mass of the internal standard. Compound identification (using target ions) and quantification were carried out using ChemStation Enhanced Data Analysis (v.E.01.00).

The Ambr 250 system (Sartorius Stedim Biotech) was used to carry out 250 ml fed-batch fermentation in duplicate. The 24-MC strain ST11064 was re-streaked from glycerol stocks stored at −80 °C onto a YPD agar plate and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. The preculture was prepared by inoculating strain ST11064 biomass from the plate into 50 ml YPD medium in a 250 ml shake flask and incubating at 30 °C for 24 h with 250 r.p.m. agitation. Next, 5 ml of preculture was used to inoculate 115 ml of batch medium to a starting OD600 of 0.25. For Ambr 250 cultivation, the batch medium comprised mineral medium supplemented with yeast extract (10 g l–1) and citric acid (20 g l–1). The mineral medium was prepared with 0.5 g l–1 MgSO4⋅7H2O, 14.4 g l–1 KH2PO4, 0.1% (v/v) vitamin solution and 0.2% (v/v) trace metal solution as previously described45, but with 3.4 g l–1 NH4Cl and glycerol as the carbon source (40 g l–1).

The temperature was held constant at 30 °C. Dissolved oxygen was maintained above 20% by using a cascade of stirring speed ranging from 600 to 3,000 r.p.m. and aeration up to 1 volume air per volume growth medium per minute. The pH was maintained at 5.5 through the automatic addition of 1 M NaOH and 2.6 M H3PO4. Antifoam 204 (Sigma) was added automatically. Online measurements of acid and base addition, carbon dioxide evolution rate, dissolved oxygen and stirring speed were recorded for each reactor. The feed medium comprised 250 g l–1 glycerol. Feeding was automatically initiated once the carbon dioxide evolution rate dropped below 50% at the end of the batch phase. Feeding was set to a constant rate of 0.9 ml h–1. Samples were taken from each reactor every 6 h for the first 24 h and then every 12 h and immediately frozen until preparation for analyses. DCW and sterol content were determined from 1 ml samples as described above for small-scale cultivation.

For larger scale fermentation, strains were cultivated by fed-batch fermentation in a 5-litre bioreactor (BIOSTAT B-DCU, Sartorius). All fermentations were carried out in duplicate. For each of the strains W29, the TET strain ST11005 and the mixed-sterol strain ST12178, the strain was re-streaked from glycerol stocks onto a YPD agar plate and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. The preculture was prepared by inoculating strain biomass from the plate into 50 ml YPD medium in a 250 ml shake flask and incubating at 30 °C for 24 h with 250 r.p.m. agitation. The volume of preculture required to inoculate a 2-litre batch medium to a starting OD600 of 2.5 was centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000g and concentrated to 10 ml volume. This cell suspension was used to inoculate the bioreactors. The bioreactors were equipped with pH, pO2 and temperature probes. The temperature was held constant at 30 °C. Dissolved oxygen was maintained above 20% by adjusting stirring between 600 and 1,200 r.p.m. and aeration (using a horseshoe sparger) between 0.5 and 3 standard-litre per min. The pH was kept at 5.5 through the automatic addition of 5 M NaOH. Antifoam A (Sigma) was added as required.

The batch medium comprised mineral medium supplemented with yeast extract (20 g l–1) and peptone (40 g l–1). The mineral medium was prepared with 0.5 g l–1 MgSO4⋅7H2O, 14.4 g l–1 KH2PO4, 0.1% (v/v) vitamin solution and 0.2% (v/v) trace metal solution as previously described45, 40 g l–1 glucose and 1 ml l–1 antifoam A (Sigma). The feed contained 5 g l–1 MgSO4⋅7H2O, 30 g l–1 KH2PO4, 1% (v/v) vitamin solution and 2% (v/v) trace metal solution as previously described46, with 300 g l–1 glucose. An exponential feeding profile was programmed, and feeding was initiated 24 h after inoculation. The feed rate, F (ml h–1), followed the profile F = 10 × e(0.05 × t), where t is the time (h) from the start of feeding. After 36 h of exponential feeding, the feed was switched to a constant rate of 75 ml h–1 until the end of fermentation.

Duplicate samples from each reactor were taken every 8 h for the first 24 h and then every 12 h to measure DCW, sterol content, OD600 and glucose concentration. DCW and sterol content were determined from 1-ml samples as described above for small-scale cultivation. During fermentation, 1 ml of culture broth was centrifuged, and the supernatant was used to measure the glucose concentration using a glucose HK assay kit (Sigma). The supernatant was then filtered and frozen until further analyses. Glucose was later quantified using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system equipped with a RI-101 refractive index detector (Dionex). An Aminex HPX-87H column (7.8 × 300 mm, Bio-Rad) with a Micro-Guard Cation H+ guard column (4.6 × 30 mm) heated to 30 °C was injected with a 10-µl sample. The mobile phase consisted of 5 mM H2SO4 with an isocratic flow rate of 0.6 ml min–1, which was held for 15 min. HPLC data were processed using Chromeleon software (v.7.2.9, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Glucose was identified and quantified using authentic standards. Glucose concentrations were calculated from the peak area by extrapolation from a six-point calibration curve regression.

The yeast strains W29, the TET strain ST11005 and the mixed-sterol strain ST12178 were cultivated using 5-litre fed-batch fermentation as described above. At the end of fermentation, the yeast biomass was recovered from the culture by centrifugation (4,000g, 20 min) and washed with deionized water. The biomass was heat-inactivated and dried (60 °C for a minimum of 24 h). The dried material was ground to a fine powder and stored at −20 °C until further use.

The yeast biomass cannot be subject to inactivation by autoclave or chemical treatment, as this will degrade the sterols present in the yeast. Incubation at 60 °C is commonly deemed sufficient to irreversibly inactivate yeast, and heat-inactivation of genetically modified yeast followed by feeding the inactivated yeast to live animals is a method that has been previously used in the United Kingdom47. Irreversible inactivation of the yeast was confirmed using a standard colony-forming unit assay. The heat-inactivated dried yeast was dissolved at 10 mg ml–1 in water. The suspension was plated in serial dilution (100 μl plated of 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 mg ml–1 suspensions) on YPD agar and the plates were incubated at 30 °C for at least 7 days. No growth of Y. lipolytica colonies was observed. The detection limit is one organism per mg material or 106 viable organisms per kg of material.

The yeast biomass was then incorporated into a meridic artificial diet at 20% w/w. Four diet types were prepared: a mixed-sterol yeast diet that contained the mixed-sterol strain ST12178; a wild-type yeast diet that contained strain W29; a platform yeast diet that contained the TET strain ST11005; and a base diet control without yeast supplementation. The base diet control was formulated to maintain total protein, sugar, sterol and fat content at the same level as in the yeast-supplemented diets. The content of this diet was a modified version of a previously described diet48. Specifically, the base diet contained 17% soy protein isolate (Soysol, MyVegan), 69.4% sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose and maltodextrin), 6% lipids, 6.50% deionized water, 0.100% vitamin and mineral supplement (Latshaw Apiaries), 0.6% commercial phytosterol mix (BulkSupplements; Supplementary Table 7) and 0.400% carrageenan kappa. The diets were divided into 50 g patties and stored at −20 °C until use. The yeast-supplemented diets had the same proportion of protein (17%), carbohydrates (70%) and fats (6%) adjusted from the reagents of the base diet to accommodate nutrients present in the yeast. Specifically, the yeast-supplemented diets contained the following components: 20.0% dried yeast powder, 7.80% soy protein isolate (Soysol, MyVegan), 63.4% sugars, 0.1% commercial phytosterol mix (BulkSupplements, approximately 55% purity containing a mixture of sterols and stanols; Supplementary Table 7), 4% lipids, 4.20% deionized water, 0.100% vitamin and mineral supplement (Latshaw Apiaries) and 0.400% carrageenan kappa (Special Ingredients).

For the sterol analysis of honeybee brood, which is used as a proxy for the natural sterol profile of honeybee pupae, we sampled worker, drone and queen pupae from naturally fed colonies in our apiary (Buckfast queens, John Krebs Field Station, Oxford). Worker pupae were directly collected from capped brood frames. Drone pupae were collected from capped drone comb (larger cell size). Queen pupae were reared by grafting young larvae (2–3 days after hatching) into Nicot Queen Rearing Cups (Paynes Bee Farms). These were placed in queenless colonies in repurposed Styrofoam mini-nucleus hives (APIDEA) for up to 8 days until development to the capped brood stage. Tissues (3 pupae per replicate, n = 5) were sampled into preweighed 20 ml glass vials and the fresh weight was recorded before storing at −80 °C until further analysis.

Feeding trials were conducted using honeybee colonies maintained in repurposed Styrofoam mini-nucleus hives made up of one brood box with five frames and a top feeder with a hole for patty delivery. Hives were maintained in a closed glasshouse environment designed to prevent bee escape during the period between July and October 2022. Hives were distributed across two glasshouse rooms with varying entrance orientation. Feeders with 30% w/v sugar solution and water were distributed inside the glasshouse and replenished as required. The in-hive and ambient temperature and humidity were recorded every 30 min using autonomous in-hive sensors (Supplementary Data 3). A misting system was installed to cool the temperatures in the glasshouse.

Initially, each hive contained 900–1,200 adult bees, 2–3 frames of brood, larvae and eggs and 1–2 frames of honey stores, but no bee bread. Newly mated queens were introduced in cages with beekeeping candy (Candito, PIDA), for slow release, 3 days before the start of the experiment.

Feeding trials were conducted over 3 months from June to September 2022 at the John Krebs Field Station, Oxford. Six hives were randomly assigned to each treatment group (n = 6). At the start of the experiment, diet patties were added through the top feeder and replaced throughout the experiment as required. Hive weight (after removal of the diet patty) and patty weight were measured. The number of bee seams (one seam defined as a continuous line of bees between adjacent frames, observed after initial hive opening) and frames filled with honey (sugar stores) were estimated by visual inspection. The presence of the mated queen, sugar stores, eggs, larvae and capped brood were checked, and brood frames were photographed for subsequent counting. Eggs, larvae and capped brood were counted using the Adobe Photoshop count tool. Full assessments of the hives were conducted every 15 days.

Six days after each full assessment, hives were partially assessed with minimal disruption to the colony. Hive weight and patty weight were measured, and bee seams and sugar stores were estimated by visual inspection. The presence of the mated queen, eggs, larvae and capped brood were briefly checked. On days 21 and 45, hives with low populations (fewer than four bee seams) were topped up with orphanized nurse bees from mixed, naturally fed colonies.

At every assessment, nurse bee and pupae samples were taken from three hives from each treatment group. Six nurse bees and six pupae were collected from each of the sampled hives. Samples were collected into preweighed 20 ml glass scintillation vials. The fresh weights of the samples were measured, and the vials were stored at −80 °C. Nurse bees were dissected to separate the guts and gut contents from the rest of the tissues. This was done by partially thawing the samples on ice and pulling the guts from the abdomen by the stinger. The gut contents were transferred to a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube and the remaining tissues were returned to the 20 ml vial. Dissected samples were stored at −80 °C until further analysis.

A semi-field pollen starvation trial was conducted from August to October 2023 at the John Krebs Field Station, Oxford. Colonies were housed in mini-nucleus hives set up in an identical manner to the yeast-feeding trial and were maintained in one room of a mesh polytunnel purpose-built to prevent bee escape. One week before the start of the treatment, colonies were topped up with nurse bees from mixed, naturally fed colonies so that each box contained at least five bee seams and re-queened where necessary. We used a mix of pre-existing colonies and newly established colonies, but all were fed pollen for at least 1 month before the start of the experiment and were producing brood.

Buckets of water and feeders with 30% w/v sugar solution were distributed inside the polytunnel. Colonies were supplied with pollen or candy patties. Pollen patties consisted of 80% multifloral pollen and 20% high-concentrated sugar syrup (around 70% w/v). Candy patties consisted of about 80% beekeeping candy and around 20% maltodextrin, which was added to slow consumption and reduce melting of the patty in the hive. After 1 month of a feeding period, colonies in treatment groups 1, 2 and 3 were deprived of pollen for the corresponding number of weeks and fed with candy only. The control group (0) was fed pollen throughout. Treatment groups were balanced across hive entrance orientations, colony strengths (bee seams) and position in the polytunnel.

We performed a partial assessment every week to measure patty weight and hive weight and estimate bee seams. Every 2 weeks, a full assessment recorded the presence of the mated queen, eggs, larvae and capped cells, and the amount of sugar and pollen stores, and every frame was photographed. The photographs were used to count the number of cells with eggs, larvae and pupae in each hive using ImageJ49.

All graph plotting and statistical analyses were performed in R50 (except Extended Data Fig. 8, which was created in GraphPad Prism and analysed using SPSS). Data were tested for normality when appropriate. GLMs and GLMMs were fitted using stats50 and glmmTMB51 packages. Models with nonsignificant interaction terms were re-run without the interaction term. Post hoc analysis was performed using the car52 and emmeans53 packages with Tukey adjustments for family-wise error rates.

The mean relative abundance of each of the major sterols in naturally fed honeybee pupae was calculated as a percentage of the total sterol content. We compared sterol relative abundance across pupal types using a GLM with quasi-binomial distribution (relative abundance modeled as a function of (~) sterol type × pupal type). Sterol concentrations in pupae were calculated from the fresh weights of the pupal tissue. We compared sterol concentrations in pupal tissue across types using GLMs with Gaussian distributions (sterol concentration ~ sterol type × pupal type). We compared the relative abundance of sterols in pollen using a GLM with quasi-binomial distribution (relative abundance ~ sterol type). The coefficient of variation for each sterol was calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean relative abundance values of each sterol.

Counts for each brood type were compared across diet treatment groups using GLMMs, fitted to counts from day 45 onwards, with hive identifier (ID) as a random effect and negative binomial distributions (brood count ~ diet × time + (1|hive ID)). For egg counts, the interaction term was excluded (egg count ~ diet + time + (1|hive ID)).

Both the total diet provided to each colony and the total diet consumption by each colony were compared across diet treatment groups by fitting GLMs with Gaussian distribution (diet weight ~ diet). Because the hive weight correlated significantly with bee seams and the consumption rate correlated significantly with the hive weight for all treatment groups (Extended Data Fig. 8), the daily consumption rates in each interval were normalized by hive weight as a proxy for colony size. The normalized consumption rates were compared across diet treatment groups using a GLMM, with hive ID as a random effect and Gaussian distributions (normalized consumption rate ~ diet + time + (1|hive ID)).

The weight of each hive was compared across diet treatment groups using a GLMM, with hive ID as a random effect and Gaussian distributions (hive weight ~ diet + time + (1|hive ID)). The number of bee seams in each hive and the number of frames filled with honey were doubled to give integer values and compared across diet treatment groups using GLMMs, with hive ID as a random effect and Poisson distributions (2 × bee seams ~ diet + time + (1|hive ID); 2 × sugar stores ~ diet + time + (1|hive ID)).

For the sterol contents in the bodies and guts of nurse bees and of pupae (μg per individual), GLMMs were fitted for each sample type in each sterol, with Gaussian distributions and hive ID as a random effect (sterol content ~ diet × time + (1|hive ID)). Interaction terms were not significant in some models (total sterol in pupae, 24-MC in pupae, CAMP in the bodies and guts of nurse bees, ISOFUC in pupae, DESMO in pupae and guts of nurse bees) and were removed as appropriate.

We examined the relationships between variables measured during feeding trials by fitting GLMs (response variable ~ predictor variable × diet). All models used Gaussian distributions, apart from when comparing capped brood counts to the total sterol content of bodies of nurse bees from the same colony. In this case, a negative binomial distribution was used. When no significant interaction was found between diet treatment group and the predictor variable, the interaction term was excluded from the models (response variable ~ predictor variable + diet). For each diet treatment group, linear regressions were fitted between the predictor and response variables of interest.

All experiments in the study were performed once. Apart from bioreactor cultivations, a minimum of three biologically independent replicates were collected for all experiments. For bioreactor cultivations, two biological replicates with two technical replicates each were performed for measurement of all parameters. Replicates gave similar results for all experiments.

The basic sterol structure with numbering of the carbon atoms, as well as the structures, common names, systematic names, and chemical formulae of the main sterols referred to in this study.

a, Mean concentration of each of the major sterols per fresh weight of pupal tissue (n = 5 biologically independent samples). There was a significant interaction between sterol and pupal type (two-way Gaussian GLM, χ2(10) = 255, P < 0.0001). For each sterol, pairwise comparisons of estimated marginal means were carried out with Tukey P-value adjustment (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). 24-MC was more concentrated in drone than queen and worker pupal tissue. Isofucosterol (ISOFUC) was also more concentrated in drone than queen and worker pupal tissue. Sitosterol (SITO) was more concentrated in drone than worker pupae. Error bars represent ± s.d. from the mean. b, Mean relative abundance of each of the major sterols in nurses from day 0, and orphanised top-up nurses from day 32 and day 45, given as a percentage of the total sterol (six pupae per sample, t0 nurses, n = 24 biologically independent samples); t32 orphanised nurses, n = 10; t45 orphanised nurses, n = 4) Error bars represent ± s.d. from the mean.

Source data

a, Number of eggs, larvae and capped brood cells counted per hive for each treatment group for the first month of the feeding trials. Eggs, larvae, and capped brood cells were counted in each colony at 15-day intervals (n = 6 biologically independent colonies). The centre line of the boxplots represent the median, the hinges represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, whiskers extend 1.5 x the interquartile range (75th – 25th percentile) from the hinges, whilst data points beyond the whiskers are plotted individually. b, The total consumption (one-way Gaussian GLM, χ2(3) = 3.15, P = 0.370) and total diet provided (one-way Gaussian GLM, χ2(3) = 5.74, P = 0.1252) to each colony over the course of the feeding trials did not vary significantly between treatment groups (n = 6 biologically independent colonies). The centre line of the boxplots represent the median, the hinges represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, whiskers extend 1.5 x the interquartile range (75th – 25th percentile) from the hinges, whilst data points beyond the whiskers are plotted individually. c, Time course of diet consumption rate normalised by hive weight (n = 6 biologically independent colonies). The normalised consumption rate varied with time (two-way Gaussian GLMM, χ2(12) = 526, P < 0.0001) and diet treatment group (χ2(3) = 15.8, P = 0.0012). Post hoc pairwise comparison of estimated marginal means revealed that consumption rate was higher for colonies provided with the MxSt diet than those provided with the Tet (P = 0.0087) or Base (P < 0.0001) diets at t51. At t66, consumption rate for colonies provided with the MxSt diet was significantly greater than those provided with the Tet (P = 0.0388) or WT (P = 0.0385) diets. Error ribbons represent ± s.d. from the mean.

Lines represent the daily mean recordings. Ribbons depict the average maximum and minimum daily values. Note: extreme high temperatures occurred during days 26–29 and during days 49–55 which impacted colony brood production.

a, Brood production (count of capped cells/colony) was equal across all four treatments (0, 1, 2, 3, x-axis) at the start of the experiment (one-way ANOVA, F3, 26 = 0.594, P = 0.625). Colonies starved for 1, 2 or 3 weeks (x-axis) succumbed to seasonal reduction in brood production at a rate faster than the control (two-way ANOVA, time*treatment, F6,77 = 5.06, P < 0.001). The control (not starved, 0), like the other groups, exhibited a decline in brood production at the end of the season in October (Sidak, START vs +6wks for the control group, P = 0.003). The x-axis indicates the treatment (i.e. the number of weeks that the colonies were starved of pollen, 0, 1, 2, 3) over the three periods of the experiment (Start, Starvation period where no pollen was provided, and Recovery period of 4 weeks of pollen feeding or 6 weeks of pollen feeding. These data indicate that even when starved colonies are provided with pollen, it is not sufficient for them to recover from previous nutrient deprivation. * indicates a significant post-hoc comparison within time point of treatment vs control (P < 0.01). n = 8 biologically independent colonies for the 1 and 3 week starvation treatments, n = 7 biologically independent colonies for the pollen and 2 week starvation treatments.

Small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs) contain near-universal loss-of-function mutations in RB1 and TP53, compromising the G1–S checkpoint and leading to dysregulated E2F activity1. Other cancers similarly disrupt the G1–S checkpoint through loss of CDKN2A or amplification of cyclin D or cyclin E, also resulting in excessive E2F activity2,3. Although E2F activation is essential for cell cycle progression, hyperactivation promotes apoptosis4,5,6,7,8,9, presenting a therapeutic vulnerability. Cyclin proteins use a conserved hydrophobic patch to bind to substrates bearing short linear RxL motifs10,11,12,13. Cyclin A represses E2F through an RxL-dependent interaction10,14, which, when disrupted, hyperactivates E2F15. However, this substrate interface has remained difficult to target. Here we developed cell-permeable, orally bioavailable macrocyclic peptides that inhibit RxL-mediated interactions of cyclins with their substrates. Dual inhibitors of cyclin A and cyclin B RxL motifs (cyclin A/Bi) selectively kill SCLC cells and other cancer cells with high E2F activity. Genetic screens revealed that cyclin A/Bi induces apoptosis through cyclin B- and CDK2-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint activation. Mechanistically, cyclin A/Bi hyperactivates E2F and cyclin B by blocking cyclin A–E2F and cyclin B–MYT1 RxL interactions. Notably, cyclin A/Bi promoted the formation of neomorphic cyclin B–CDK2 complexes, which drive spindle assembly checkpoint activation and mitotic cell death. Finally, orally administered cyclin A/Bi showed robust anti-tumour activity in chemotherapy-resistant SCLC patient-derived xenografts. These findings reveal gain-of-function mechanisms through which cyclin A/Bi triggers apoptosis and support their development for E2F-driven cancers.

SCLC is an aggressive lung cancer subtype lacking effective targeted therapies16. It is genomically defined by near-universal loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in RB1 and TP53, without recurrent druggable oncogenic drivers1, making new therapeutic strategies particularly challenging. One approach is to identify synthetic lethal vulnerabilities associated with RB1 and/or TP53 LOF.

In G1, unphosphorylated pRB represses activating E2Fs (E2F1–E2F3)17,18. Phosphorylation by CDK4 and CDK6 (CDK4/6)–cyclin D and CDK2–cyclin A/E inhibits this repression, allowing E2F-driven S-phase entry18. Various cancers deregulate the G1–S checkpoint through genomic alterations of different components of the pRB–E2F pathway including inactivation of RB1 or CDKN2A, or amplifications of cyclin D or cyclin E2,3. Although activating E2Fs are necessary for cellular proliferation, too much E2F activity paradoxically induces apoptosis4,5,6,7,8,9, suggesting a Goldilocks phenomenon. E2F1 is further negatively regulated by phosphorylation during S phase through cyclin A–CDK2, which limits its DNA binding14,19,20,21.

Studies from budding yeast to mammalian cells demonstrated that cyclin substrate specificity is determined by a hydrophobic patchon cyclins recognizing short linear motifs on cyclin target proteins10,11,12,13. The most well-studied linear motif is the RxL motif10,11,12,13, but additional motifs include the LxF, NLxxxL and PxF motifs22,23,24. The hydrophobic patch of cyclin A recognizes and binds to an RxL motif on E2F1 to initiate cyclin A–CDK2-mediated E2F phosphorylation10,14. Disrupting this interaction using tool peptides induces apoptosis selectively in cells with deregulated pRB and increased E2F activity15.

Despite efforts, small-molecule inhibitors of cyclin A–RxL interactions have not progressed beyond early stages25, reflecting the challenges of targeting intracellular protein–protein interactions. Macrocyclic peptides can overcome these challenges26,27,28,29 but often lack drug-like properties30. Here we report the development of orally bioavailable macrocyclic peptide inhibitors of cyclin A/B–RxL interactions, elucidate their mechanism of inducing apoptosis in SCLCs with high E2F activity and demonstrate their efficacy in SCLC models.

To design passively permeable macrocyclic inhibitors targeting RxL-motif interactions with the hydrophobic patch of cyclins (Fig. 1a), we built a structural model using macrocycle-bound (Protein Data Bank (PDB): 1URC) and p27Kip1-bound (PDB: 1JSU) cyclin A2–CDK2 complexes (Extended Data Fig. 1a). A composite molecule combining the lariat macrocycle (magenta) and the RxL motif of p27Kip1 (yellow) occupying the larger hydrophobic patch and the smaller adjacent hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1b) was used as the starting scaffold.

Structure-based design and synthesis focused on optimizing cyclin binding affinity, engineering differential selectivity across cyclins A, B and E (guided by PDB: 1JSU, 2B9R and 1W98), and improving cell permeability for oral bioavailability. Scaffold optimization used peptidic and peptidomimetic features, with permeability-enhancing modifications guided by Circle Pharma's synthetic and computational platforms (Methods). This iterative approach yielded a series of passively permeable macrocycles with high affinity and diverse cyclin selectivity profiles (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1c,e and Supplementary Methods). CIRc-004 bound to both the hydrophobic patch and smaller adjacent hydrophobic pockets on cyclin A2–CDK2, as shown by space-filling and stick representations (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1d); additional compound properties are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1e,f. The medicinal chemistry effort to identify passively permeable cyclin RxL inhibitors has been described elsewhere31.

Given previous work15 and the near-universal loss of RB1 and E2F dysregulation in SCLC1,32 (Extended Data Fig. 1g), we first tested these compounds for anti-proliferative activity in a limited panel of SCLC cell lines. Although we initially hypothesized that cyclin A RxL inhibition alone would be sufficient, cytotoxicity unexpectedly required inhibition of both cyclin A and B RxL interactions. Dual inhibitors, including CIRc-004, showed the strongest anti-proliferative activity, whereas a cyclin-A-selective RxL inhibitor had little effect (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1h). The inactive enantiomer CIRc-005 lacked activity. Non-transformed WI-38 fibroblasts were insensitive to cyclin A/B inhibition.

We next screened 46 SCLC cell lines with the dual cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor CIRc-004 in anti-proliferation assays (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 1). Nearly all lines were highly sensitive to CIRc-004 at low nanomolar concentrations. Gene set enrichment (GSEA) and variation (GSVA) analyses33 using MSigDb Hallmark gene sets34 showed strong correlation between CIRc-004 sensitivity and expression of E2F targets and G2/M checkpoint pathway genes, independent of the SCLC subtype (Fig. 1d,e).

To determine broader applicability and ensure that cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors were not generally toxic, we screened the Horizon OncoSignature panel of 302 cancer cell lines using CIRc-001, a broader cyclin A/B/E RxL inhibitor (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1h). Approximately 180 cell lines, including lung, breast and ovarian models, showed selective sensitivity to CIRc-001 (half-maximum effective concentration (EC50) < 1 µM) (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). E2F target gene signatures were enriched in sensitive lines across cancer types, whereas epithelial–mesenchymal transition -associated signatures were enriched in resistant lines (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Thus, low E2F activity and high expression of genes associated with epithelial–mesenchymal transition may predict resistance to cyclin A/B RxL inhibition, regardless of the tumour type.

We further compared responses to CIRc-004 in CIRc-004-sensitive SCLC (NCI-H1048, H446 and H69) and CIRc-004-resistant NSCLC (A549, HCC4006 and H1299) lines (Fig. 1f). CIRc-004 sensitivity was not due to differences in proliferation rates (Extended Data Fig. 2c) and all lines were resistant to the inactive enantiomer CIRc-005 even at high micromolar concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 2d). In sensitive SCLCs, CIRc-004 induced apoptosis (Fig. 1g,h) and mitotic arrest (Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 2e). These effects required inhibition of both cyclin A and B, as selective inhibitors CIRc-018 (cyclin A) and CIRc-019 (cyclin B) lacked activity in proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle assays (Extended Data Fig. 2f–h).

Normal cells, including RPE1 and CD34+ haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, were insensitive to CIRc-004, showing no mitotic arrest or apoptosis, even at high doses, consistent with a potentially large therapeutic window (Fig. 1f,h,i and Extended Data Fig. 2i,j). Instead, CIRc-004 induced p53 expression and G1 arrest at micromolar levels (Extended Data Fig. 2k–m). Lastly, NCI-H82, an SCLC line with lower E2F signatures, was also resistant to CIRc-004, with an EC50 comparable to resistant NSCLCs and RPE1 cells (Fig. 1f,h,i).

To elucidate the downstream mechanisms by which cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors induce apoptosis, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 resistance screen in the highly sensitive NCI-H1048 SCLC cell line. Cells were transduced with the Brunello sgRNA library and, on day 10 (early timepoint, ETP), were pooled into four treatment arms: (1) dual cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor (CIRc-004); (2) broader cyclin A/B/E RxL inhibitor (CIRc-001); (3) selective orthosteric CDK2 inhibitor (CDK2i; PF-07104091); and (4) the inactive enantiomer CIRc-005 as a control (Fig. 2a). Compounds were dosed at EC90 concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). The CDK2i was included to identify similarities and differences between CDK2i and cyclin A/B RxL inhibition. After 16 days of drug exposure (day 26, late timepoint, LTP), resistant populations emerged and were collected for deep sequencing. sgRNA enrichment analysis across replicates showed consistent enrichment of specific sgRNAs (Extended Data Fig. 3d–g). Comparing the LTP drug arms to the inactive enantiomer control and the ETP identified highly enriched hits of which the loss conferred resistance. Notably, hits from CIRc-004 and CIRc-001 were largely distinct from those enriched under CDK2i, suggesting a distinct mechanism of action (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 3h–l). Among the top enriched hits for CIRc-004 was cyclin B itself (encoded by CCNB1), providing evidence for cyclin B as a likely target of CIRc-004, but also indicating that cyclin B is required for cell death, and may therefore act through a gain-of-function mechanism. CDK2 was the only shared hit across all three treatments, supporting its central role but again suggesting that cell killing may involve a gain of CDK2 function.

Source Data

Notably, many hits enriched under CIRc-004 and CIRc-001 mapped to the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), including KNTC1, ESPL1, ZWINT, ZWILCH, ZW10 and MAD1L1 (Fig. 2b,c, Extended Data Fig. 3h,j,k and Supplementary Table 3), indicating that SAC integrity is required for cell killing by cyclin A/B RxL inhibition. By contrast, these were not enriched under CDK2i (Extended Data Fig. 3i,l). Conversely, depleted hits—whose inactivation sensitized cells—included E2F7 and E2F8, repressive E2Fs that oppose E2F1 activity35 and STMN136, a mitotic phosphoprotein (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 3h,j–k and Supplementary Table 3). In contrast to the cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor screen, CCNB1 was depleted in the CDK2i screen, consistent with cyclin B suppression enhancing CDK2i-induced death.

To validate the CRISPR screen, we performed knockouts of CCNB1, CDK2, KNTC1, LIN54, MAD1L1 and ZWINT in NCI-H1048 cells, all of which conferred robust resistance to CIRc-004 (Fig. 2d–g and Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). Similar resistance was confirmed in NCI-H446 SCLC cells for a subset of hits (Extended Data Fig. 4c–f). Furthermore, CCNB1 inactivation increased sensitivity to the CDK2i, while CDK2 inactivation conferred partial resistance (Extended Data Fig. 4g,h), validating the mechanistic divergence. Lastly, knockout of CCNB1, KNTC1, MAD1L1 or ZWINT rescued mitotic arrest and apoptosis induced by CIRc-004 (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 4i–l).

To orthogonally validate these findings, we used a forward genetic screen in iHCT116 cells, a colorectal cancer model engineered with inducible degradation of MLH1 using indole acetic acid (IAA), enabling high (mut-high, +IAA) or low (mut-low, −IAA) mutation rates depending on IAA treatment37. CIRc-004 suppressed proliferation in iHCT116 cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a). After barcoded iHCT116 cells were cultured for an extended period with CIRc-004, resistant clones were isolated from both mut-low and mut-high populations (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). These clones were over 100-fold more resistant than parental cells and remained sensitive to an unrelated toxin (MLN4924), ruling out non-specific resistance (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Exome sequencing of eight resistant clones revealed CDC20 mutations in five (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). Notably, two mutations affected Arg445, and all four unique mutations mapped to the same surface of CDC20 in the crystal structure where CDC20 interacts with the mitotic checkpoint complex to promote SAC activation38,39,40,41 (Extended Data Fig. 5g). These heterozygous mutations are probably dominant negatives, allowing SAC bypass and anaphase progression in the presence of CIRc-004. Ectopic expression of CDC20(R445Q), but not wild-type CDC20, in both iHCT116 and NCI-H1048 cells conferred resistance to CIRc-004 (Extended Data Fig. 5h–m). Together, these complementary CRISPR knockout and forward genetic screens converge on the spindle assembly checkpoint as the critical mechanism through which cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors induce mitotic arrest and apoptosis in SCLC and other cancer models.

To further determine how CIRc-004 induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis, we performed live-cell imaging of NCI-H1048 cells expressing GFP–H2B. CIRc-004 blocked anaphase initiation, consistent with SAC activation causing mitotic cell death (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). SAC components assemble on the scaffold protein KNL1, which is phosphorylated by MPS1 in early mitosis42. As KNL1 is dephosphorylated after satisfaction of SAC, persistent phosphorylated KNL1 (p-KNL1) serves as a SAC activation marker. CIRc-004 robustly increased p-KNL1 levels in sensitive, but not resistant, cell lines at apoptosis-inducing concentrations (Figs. 1h and 2i and Extended Data Fig. 6c–h). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of NCI-H1048 cells acutely treated with CIRc-004 revealed upregulation of SAC-related genes (such as CCNB1 and CDC20) and mitotic signatures, while the inactive enantiomer CIRc-005 had minimal transcriptional impact (Fig. 2j, Extended Data Fig. 6i,j and Supplementary Table 4). In RPE1 cells, CIRc-004 induced mitotic arrest and p-KNL1 only after CRISPR inactivation of RB1 and TP53, and only at high concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 6k,l), consistent with their relative resistance (Fig. 1f,h,i and Extended Data Fig. 2k–m), demonstrating that disruption of G1–S checkpoint control is necessary for induction of SAC. In contrast to cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors, CDK2 inhibition using PF-07104091 did not activate the SAC in NCI-H1048 cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a), but instead reduced S-phase progression and led to accumulation of 4N cells undergoing DNA replication, consistent with a late S-phase/early G2 arrest (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). Consistent with this, PF-07104091 treatment upregulated S-phase-associated genes, including CDC6 and CCNE1 (Extended Data Fig. 7d,e and Supplementary Table 4).

We hypothesized that chemical inhibition of MPS1 would phenocopy genetic SAC disruption. Using a sublethal dose of MPS1 inhibitor BAY-1217389 (3 nM), which blocked KNL1 phosphorylation without affecting proliferation (Fig. 2k and Extended Data Fig. 8a,b), we found that MPS1 inhibition blocked SAC activation and rescued SCLC (NCI-H1048, NCI-H69 and NCI-H446) cells from CIRc-004-induced growth arrest and apoptosis (Fig. 2k–m and Extended Data Fig. 8c–f). Similarly, expression of CDC20(R445Q), but not wild-type CDC20, abolished CIRc-004-induced SAC activation in iHCT116 and NCI-H1048 cells (Extended Data Fig. 8g,h). These findings confirm that SAC activation is essential for the apoptotic activity of cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors.

Cyclin B emerged as a top enriched hit in the CIRc-004 resistance screen, suggesting its activity is essential for the apoptotic effect of cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors (Fig. 2). This is paradoxical if CIRc-004 merely blocks cyclin B function, instead indicating a gain of cyclin B activity. Supporting this, increased cyclin B–CDK1 activity can drive SAC activation40,43, and CIRc-004 increased cyclin B activity as measured by phosphorylation at Ser12644,45 (Extended Data Fig. 8i). Furthermore, CCNB1-knockout NCI-H1048 cells failed to activate the SAC in response to CIRc-004 (Fig. 2n), demonstrating that cyclin B activity is necessary for SAC activation. We therefore hypothesized that CIRc-004 disrupts an interaction between cyclin B and an RxL-containing substrate that normally functions as a negative regulator of cyclin B–CDK1 activity. One such substrate is MYT1 (encoded by PKMYT1), a kinase that inhibits cyclin B–CDK1 activity by phosphorylating CDK1 at Thr1446. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that dual cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors and the cyclin B-selective inhibitor CIRc-019 disrupted the cyclin B–MYT1 interaction, whereas the cyclin-A-selective inhibitor CIRc-018 and inactive enantiomer CIRc-005 did not (Fig. 2o). Moreover, the MYT1 inhibitor RP-630647 potentiated cell killing by CIRc-018 in multiple SCLC cell lines (Fig. 2p and Extended Data Fig. 8j–n). This was selective for CIRc-018 as CIRc-004 and CIRc-019 did not (Extended Data Fig. 8o–t). WEE1 is another kinase that negatively regulates CDK1 activity48. Although a smaller fraction of WEE1 appears to co-immunoprecipitate with cyclin B, CIRc-004 and CIRc-019 also disrupted this interaction (Extended Data Fig. 8u). However, the selective WEE1 inhibitor MK1775 did not hypersensitize NCI-H1048 cells to CIRc-018 (Extended Data Fig. 8v–x). Together, these data show that cyclin B RxL inhibition can disrupt either a MYT1 or WEE1 interaction with cyclin B and that disruption of the cyclin B–MYT1 interaction is functionally important for cell killing by cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors leading to CDK activation on the cyclin B complex to promote SAC activation and mitotic cell death.

To further investigate how CIRc-004 induces mitotic cell death, we performed a CRISPR–Cas9 base editor screen in NCI-H1048 cells using A>G and C>T base editors49 and a custom sgRNA library tiling CCNB1, CCNA2, CDK2 and CDC20 (Fig. 3a). Cells were treated with CIRc-004 or the inactive control CIRc-005 from day 10 (ETP) to day 26 (LTP). Sequencing confirmed strong replicate correlation and robust depletion of essential gene controls (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b), validating screen performance. Consistent with our forward genetic screen (Extended Data Fig. 5f–m), sgRNAs predicted to mutate CDC20 at Arg445 were enriched (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Notably, sgRNAs targeting CCNB1 residues 169–177—where cyclin B canonically binds CDK150—were also enriched (Fig. 3b,c). We then repeated the screen and performed focused amplicon sequencing on CCNB1 amino acid residues 117–285. Amplicon sequencing directly validated several CCNB1 mutants (Glu169Lys, Tyr170His and Tyr177Cys) that conferred CIRc-004 resistance, all located within the region where cyclin B interacts with CDK1 (Fig. 3c,d). Additional enriched mutations were located in the hydrophobic patch of cyclin B where CIRc-004 binds (Fig. 3b,d and Extended Data Fig. 9a), suggesting on-target effects. Fluorescence-associated cell sorting (FACS)-based competition assays confirmed that mutations disrupting either the cyclin B–CDK interface or the hydrophobic patch conferred resistance (Fig. 3e). Amplicon sequencing of mixed cell populations from these assays identified the precise base editor-induced CCNB1 mutations, with the fraction of cells carrying Glu169Lys, Tyr170His or Tyr177Cys substantially enriched after CIRc-004 treatment (Fig. 3f).

Source Data

To examine protein-level effects, we performed cyclin B immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. Consistent with our experiments above (Fig. 2o), one of the top depleted proteins after treatment with CIRc-004 was MYT1 (encoded by PKMYT1) and known cyclin–CDK RxL-dependent inhibitors including p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 (encoded by CDKN1B and CDKN1C, respectively)14 (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). Notably, a top enriched protein after CIRc-004 treatment was CDK2 (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 9b). Although cyclin B binds to CDK2 in vitro51, cyclin B canonically binds to CDK152 and not to CDK2 in cells50. An AlphaFold model supported binding between cyclin B residues 169–177 and CDK2 (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Immunoprecipitation experiments for cyclin B in NCI-H1048, NCI-H446 and RPE1 cells confirmed that CIRc-004 increased the co-immunoprecipitation of CDK2 without affecting CDK1 (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 9d–g). CIRc-004 did not alter the immunoprecipitation/co-immunoprecipitation interaction between cyclin A and CDK2 (Extended Data Fig. 9h). CIRc-004 also induced phosphorylation of the CDK mitotic RxL-independent substrate stathmin (STMN1)53, which was blocked by a CDK2i, but not by a CDK1i (Extended Data Fig. 9i,j). Stathmin phosphorylation inactivates stathmin disabling its ability to depolymerize microtubules, which activates SAC54. Supporting this, STMN1 depletion sensitized cells to CIRc-004 in our CRISPR knockout screen (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3h,j,k), suggesting that CIRc-004-induced CDK2-dependent stathmin phosphorylation promotes sensitivity to cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors.

We next tested whether the cyclin B triple mutant (Glu169Lys/Tyr170His/Tyr177Cys) blocked CDK2 binding. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that CIRc-004 induced an interaction between CDK2 and wild-type cyclin B that was abrogated in cells expressing the cyclin B triple mutant (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 9k). Moreover, CDK2 inactivation in NCI-H1048 cells partially abrogated CIRc-004-induced SAC activation (Fig. 3j). Lastly, acute CDK2i also abrogated SAC activation by CIRc-004 after release from mitotic arrest with nocodazole further validating that CDK2 activity is necessary for SAC activation by CIRc-004 (Fig. 3k). These data, together with CDK2 being a top enriched hit in our CRISPR knockout screen, demonstrate that cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors promote the redirection of CDK2 to cyclin B to form cyclin B–CDK2 complexes to promote SAC activation and mitotic cell death.

Having established the role of cyclin B RxL inhibition in the CIRc-004 mechanism of action, we next explored the contribution of cyclin A RxL inhibition. Cyclin A is expressed and canonically associates with CDK2 in S phase55. SAC is normally activated during mitosis when there is improper attachment of kinetochores to the mitotic spindles, which can be caused by DNA damage and replication stress that occurs during S phase40. Consistent with this, pulse-labelling with EdU showed a large fraction of G2 cells undergoing active DNA synthesis after treatment with CIRc-004 (Fig. 4a). Moreover, CIRc-004 also induced replication stress markers, including γH2AX, p-RPA2 and p-KAP1, specifically in sensitive SCLC lines (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). CIRc-004 induced γH2AX irrespective of whether cells had the ability to form SAC complex and this required both cyclin A and cyclin B RxL inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 10d,e).

Source Data

High E2F activity strongly correlated with sensitivity to CIRc-004 in SCLC lines (Fig. 1e), and repressive E2Fs (E2F7 and E2F8) were top depleted hits in our CRISPR screen (Fig. 2b), suggesting that heightened E2F activity could enhance cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor sensitivity. Cyclin A binds to E2F1 through an RxL motif, enabling cyclin A–CDK2-mediated phosphorylation to repress E2F1 activity14,19,20,21. Blocking this interaction can promote apoptosis15. We therefore hypothesized that cyclin A RxL inhibition blocks the RxL-dependent interactions of cyclin A with activating E2Fs (E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3), leading to heightened E2F activity. Co-immunoprecipitatoin experiments confirmed that only dual cyclin A/B and cyclin A-selective RxL inhibitors disrupted interactions between cyclin A and E2F1 or E2F3 (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 10f). E2F2 was undetected, probably due to low abundance in NCI-H1048 cells. Overexpression of E2F1 in NCI-H1048, MDA-MB-231, NCI-H82 and Jurkat cells enhanced sensitivity to cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors with a corresponding increase in γH2AX and SAC activation after drug treatment in the cell lines examined (Fig. 4d–k and Extended Data Fig. 10g,h). Similarly, E2F2 or E2F3 overexpression also sensitized cells to the cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor (Extended Data Fig. 10i–l).

Consistent with this mechanism, both E2F1 overexpression and CDK2 inhibition led to persistent DNA replication during late S phase/early G2 (Fig. 4l,m and Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). As shown above, CIRc-004 induced this phenotype but also induced a profound mitotic arrest (Fig. 4a). However, in contrast to CIRc-004, neither E2F1 overexpression nor CDK2 inhibition triggered mitotic arrest, highlighting the unique contribution of cyclin B RxL inhibition to cell killing. Together, these results support a model in which the cyclin A–E2F RxL interaction is selectively disrupted by cyclin A RxL inhibition causing E2F hyperactivation leading to S-phase dysregulation and replication stress, which is necessary for cell killing by cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors.

We next performed in vivo studies first with a cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor tool compound, CIRc-028, with improved pharmacokinetic properties capable of being dosed intravenously (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c,e,f,h). Administered daily at 100 mg per kg for 14 days, CIRc-028 induced tumour regressions in NCI-H69 xenografts (Fig. 5a), substantially inhibited growth in NCI-H1048 xenografts (Fig. 5b) and was well tolerated without weight loss (Extended Data Fig. 11a,b). Tumour analyses confirmed that CIRc-028 induced SAC activation and apoptosis in vivo (Fig. 5c–f and Extended Data Fig. 11c).

For m and n, n = 5 (vehicle) and 6 (CIRc-014) tumours from independent mice. Data are mean ± s.d. Statistical significance was calculated using unpaired two-tailed students t-tests. o, The proposed mechanism: in cancers with compromised G1–S checkpoint (for example, RB1 and TP53 loss) and consequently high E2F activity, cyclin A binds to activating E2Fs through RxL motifs to dampen E2F activity, and cyclin B binds to MYT1 to restrain CDK1 activity during G2. Cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors disrupt both interactions: (1) blocking cyclin A–E2F1 repression increases replication stress; (2) blocking cyclin B–MYT1 binding allows cyclin B to form a neomorphic complex with CDK2, driving RxL-independent phosphorylation (of, for example, stathmin), SAC activation and mitotic death. The diagrams in g and o were created with BioRender. Scale bars, 50 µm (c,d), and 100 µm (×20) and 50 µm (×40) (k,l).

Source Data

We next developed a cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor, CIRc-014 (Extended Data Figs. 1c,e,f,h and 11d–f), with improved physicochemical properties and capable of being dosed orally. Orally dosed CIRc-014 was tested in two patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models—DFCI-393 and DFCI-402—each derived from a patient with chemotherapy-resistant SCLC (Fig. 5g). RNA-seq analysis classified DFCI-393 as ASCL1+ and DFCI-402 as ASCL1+NEUROD1+, with both models clustering with neuroendocrine-high SCLC tumours1 (Fig. 5h, Extended Data Fig. 11g and Supplementary Table 7). Notably, CIRc-014 caused near complete tumour growth inhibition in both chemoresistant SCLC PDX models (Fig. 5i,j) without weight loss relative to vehicle (Extended Data Fig. 11h,i).

Pharmacokinetic analysis in mice dosed with CIRc-014 for 4 days in an independent pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study showed that peak concentrations of unbound CIRc-014 (Cmax) were 141.6 nM, aligned with efficacious in vitro levels (Extended Data Fig. 11j). In contrast to CIRc-014—but as expected for an intravenously administered compound—the peak unbound concentration of CIRc-028 was higher, with a C0 of 4.9 µM for NCI-H69 and a C0 of 8.3 µM for NCI-H1048 xenografts studies (Extended Data Fig. 11k,l). Four days of CIRc-014 treatment induced SAC activation and apoptosis in DFCI-393 PDX tumours (Fig. 5k–n). RNA-seq analysis of these tumours showed upregulation of G2/M checkpoint and mitotic spindle gene sets, consistent with our in vitro findings and confirming on-target activity (Extended Data Fig. 11m,n and Supplementary Tables 4 and 7). Together, these studies demonstrate that orally dosed CIRc-014 achieves potent, on-target anti-tumour efficacy in chemoresistant SCLC PDX models without overt toxicity.

Here we describe the development of cell-permeable and orally bioavailable macrocycles that bind to cyclins to block their RxL-dependent interactions with RxL-containing substrates. We find that SCLCs with high E2F activity due to a compromised G1–S checkpoint from RB1 and TP53 loss are highly sensitive to macrocycles that inhibit the ability of both cyclin A and cyclin B to interact with their corresponding RxL-binding proteins, leading to SAC activation and mitotic cell death. Two unbiased orthogonal genome-wide genetic screens in cell lines from different cancer types both show that cell killing by cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors is achieved through activation of SAC, which is distinct from the mechanism of cell killing by an orthosteric CDK2i. Our data show that the efficacy of cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors is achieved by blocking the ability of cyclins to interact with at least two RxL-containing substrates including: (1) disruption of a cyclin A–E2F1 inhibitory interaction, leading to increased E2F activity, priming cells for SAC-induced apoptosis; and (2) disruption of a cyclin B–MYT1 RxL inhibitory interaction, which hyperactivates cyclin B–CDK activity, thereby increasing downstream SAC activation and mitotic cell death (the proposed mechanism is shown in Fig. 5o). While disruption of these two RxL interactions is necessary for cell killing by cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors, there are almost certainly other cyclin–RxL–substrate interactions10,14,56,57,58 disrupted by these macrocycles that contribute to their ability to induce apoptosis.

We found that cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors promote a neomorphic interaction between cyclin B and CDK2, forming complexes that phosphorylate RxL-independent substrates such as stathmin54, leading to SAC activation and apoptosis (Fig. 5o). This finding explains why CCNB1 and CDK2 were among the top enriched hits in our CRISPR knockout screen. Canonically, cyclin A50,59 binds to and activates CDK2 during S phase, while cyclin B binds to and activates CDK1 during mitosis50. Although cyclin B–CDK2 binding has been observed in vitro51, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that such an interaction occurs in cells achieved through a cyclin A/B RxL macrocycle. Future studies will investigate how RxL macrocycles promote this complex and whether CDK2 activity in this setting is regulated by MYT1, which is likely given the high sequence homology between CDK1 and CDK2 at their N termini and the central role of cyclin–substrate interactions in determining specificity12,51,60.

Despite cyclin A and cyclin B being essential for proliferation61,62, RxL macrocycles are well tolerated in vivo and selectively toxic to E2Fhigh cancer cells with 1,000-fold lower concentrations required to kill sensitive cancer cells relative to normal cell lines that were inherently resistant indicating a therapeutic window.

We focused this study on SCLC as SCLCs have near-universal LOF mutations in RB1 and TP53, compromising cell cycle checkpoints leading to high and dysregulated E2F activity1. However, our findings probably extend beyond SCLC. Genomic alterations that disrupt the G1–S checkpoint—such as RB1 mutation1, CDKN2A deletion, or cyclin D or E amplifications2,3—are common across many cancer types and lead to E2F hyperactivation. Our data show that high E2F activity sensitizes diverse cancer cell lines to cyclin A/B RxL inhibition, suggesting that E2F expression signatures may serve as predictive biomarkers for therapeutic response. Moreover, this work aligns with previous studies showing SCLCs and other cancers with genomic alterations that compromise the G1–S checkpoint can be therapeutically exploited by disrupting mitotic checkpoint control47,63,64,65.

In summary, we present cyclin A/B RxL macrocycles as a promising class of anti-cancer agents with a distinct mechanism from orthosteric CDK inhibitors. The orally bioavailable inhibitor CIRc-014 shows potent, on-target activity in chemoresistant SCLC PDX models without overt toxicity. Circle Pharma is advancing CID-078, a related compound, as a first-in-class cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor into phase 1 clinical evaluation (NCT06577987) to test the therapeutic potential of targeting cyclin–substrate interactions in SCLC and other cancers.

Macrocycle peptides offer a feasible strategy to block broad and shallow protein-protein interaction surfaces that until recently have been considered undruggable. Over the past decade, a growing body of research has demonstrated that peptidic macrocycles can be engineered to be both passively cell permeable67,68,69,70 and orally bioavailable26,28,71,72, therefore offering promise for this modality to access previously undruggable intracellular targets27. Our approach to identify passively permeable cyclin RxL inhibitors included the incorporation of peptidomimetic features based on our previous research67,68,73,74. Detailed descriptions of our medical chemistry efforts to achieve passive permeability, cyclin binding affinity and selectivity of an earlier series of distinct tool cyclin RxL macrocycles not included in this manuscript are reported in ref. 31. A detailed description of the synthesis of the cyclin RxL inhibitors in this manuscript is provided in the Supplementary Methods.

The binding potency of macrocycles for cyclin–CDK complexes was determined by a fluorescence polarization competitive assay based on previously established protocols25,75 with the following modifications: (1) a higher-affinity fluorescent-labelled probe was identified referred to as CIR7-2706 (Supplementary Methods); (2) cyclin–CDK protein complexes were sourced as follows: cyclin A2–CDK2 (CRELUX Protein Services; www.crelux.com), cyclin B1–CDK1 (Eurofins, Discovery, 14-450) and cyclin E1–CDK2 (Eurofins, Discovery, 14-475). Fluorescence polarization binding assays were performed in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% NP-40 and 1 mg ml−1 BSA for all 3 protein complexes in black 96-well plates (Costar, 3356). After experimental plates were set, they were equilibrated by gentle mixing by placing them on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm for 2 h at room temperature and then read on the SpectraMax i3X Multi-Mode Microplate Detection platform. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of binding of a fluorescence labelled probe CIR7-2706 at 2 nM to the cyclin–CDK complex was determined from an eight-point threefold serial dilution curve of CID-078. The protein concentrations used were 8 nM for cyclin A2–CDK2, and 10 nM for cyclin B1–CDK1 and cyclin E1–CDK2. Under these conditions, the assay dynamic range was about 120 mP units between 100% binding of CIR7-2706 to the proteins and its complete displacement by an unlabelled competitor compound. All experiments showed a Z′ factor of >0.80. The reported IC50 values are the average of all experiments described in Fig. 1b.

RxL inhibitor affinity determinations were performed in a WaveDelta instrument (Malvern Panalytical). Each of the cyclin–CDK complexes were immobilized to the chip surface by amine coupling on one of four channels of a 4PCP chip (9060001, Malvern Panalytical) in 10 mM MES pH 6.5 buffer for cyclin A2–CDK2 and cyclin E1–CDK2 and 10 mM MOPS pH 7.0 for cyclin B1–CDK1. For coupling, the proteins were diluted at 25 mg ml−1 and applied to the corresponding chip channel for 600 s at a flow rate of 10 ml min−1, followed by quenching by injecting 1 M ethanolamine-HCl pH 8.5 for 420 s at a flow rate of 10 ml min−1. Compounds were dissolved at 300 nM in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 0.05% Tween-20 and 3% DMSO. An eight-point 1:3 serial dilution of the compounds was sequentially injected into the chip at flow rate of 100 ml min−1 for 120 s to measure the association rates, followed by injection for 600 s of buffer alone to measure the dissociation rates. Background readings were subtracted using an empty channel on the chip on which no protein was immobilized. The data were analysed using a 1:1 binding kinetic model using the instrument software (Wave Control, v.4.5.17). The reported Kd, ka and kd are the average of two or more experiments as indicated. ClogP values were calculated using the calculator in ChemDraw. MDCK monolayer cell permeability, kinetic solubility (Ksol), and logD experimental values were generated by Quintara Discovery using standard experimental conditions.

sgRNA sequences were designed using the Broad Institutes sgRNA designer tool (http://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design) and chosen from the Brunello CP0043 sgRNA library and synthesized by IDT technologies. The sense and antisense oligonucleotides were mixed at equimolar ratios (0.25 nmol of each sense and antisense oligonucleotide) and annealed by heating to 100 °C in annealing buffer (1× annealing buffer: 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) followed by slow cooling to 30 °C for 3 h. The annealed oligonucleotides were then diluted at 1:400 in 0.5× annealing buffer. For CRISPR–Cas9 knockout experiments in cells, the annealed oligos were ligated into pLentiCRISPR Puro V2 (Addgene, 52961). Ligations were done with T4 DNA ligase for 2 h at 25 °C. The ligation mixture was transformed into HB101 competent cells. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were screened by restriction digestion of miniprep DNAs and subsequently validated by DNA sequencing.

The following sgRNA oligos were used for LentiCRISPRV2 Puro vector for CRISPR knockout experiments: non-targeting 1 sense (5′-CCGTCTCCGCATCGTCTTTT-3′); non-targeting 1 antisense (5′-AAAAGACGATGCGGAGACGG-3′); non-targeting 2 sense (5′-TATTTTGACTTGACGCAGGC-3′); non-targeting 2 antisense (5′-GCCTGCGTCAAGTCAAAATA-3′); human CCNB1 1 sense (5′-CATCAGAGAAAGCCTGACAC-3′); human CCNB1 1 antisense (5′-GTGTCAGGCTTTCTCTGATG-3′); human CCNB1 2 sense (5′-GAGGCCAAGAACAGCTCTTG-3′); human CCNB1 2 antisense (5′-CAAGAGCTGTTCTTGGCCTC-3′); human CDK2 1 sense (5′-CAAATATTATTCCACAGCTG-3′); human CDK2 1 antisense (5′-CAGCTGTGGAATAATATTTG-3′); human CDK2 2 sense (5′-CATGGGTGTAAGTACGAACA-3′); human CDK2 2 antisense (5′-TGTTCGTACTTACACCCATG-3′); human KNTC1 1 sense (5′-AAACATTCGGAACACTATGG-3′); human KNTC1 1 antisense (5′-CCATAGTGTTCCGAATGTTT-3′); human KNTC1 2 sense (5′-AAGCTAACGATGAAAATCGG-3′); human KNTC1 2 antisense (5′-CCGATTTTCATCGTTAGCTT-3′); human LIN54 1 sense (5′-GTTCTTTCACAGTCTACTCC-3′); human LIN54 1 antisense (5′-GGAGTAGACTGTGAAAGAAC-3′); human LIN54 2 sense (5′-AAGTAGTTACCATTGGAGGG-3′); human LIN54 2 antisense (5′-CCCTCCAATGGTAACTACTT-3′); human MAD1L1 1 sense (5′-GAAGAAGCGCGAGACCCACG-3′); human MAD1L1 1 antisense (5′-CGTGGGTCTCGCGCTTCTTC-3′); human MAD1L1 2 sense (5′-GAGAGACTGGACCAGACCAT-3′); human MAD1L1 2 antisense (5′-ATGGTCTGGTCCAGTCTCTC-3′); human ZWINT 1 sense (5′-CACCTACAGGGAGCACGTAG-3′); human ZWINT 1 antisense (5′-CTACGTGCTCCCTGTAGGTG-3′); human ZWINT 2 sense (5′-CAGTGGCAGCTACAACAGGT-3′); human ZWINT 2 antisense (5′-ACCTGTTGTAGCTGCCACTG-3′); human RB1 2 sense (5′-CGGTGGCGGCCGTTTTTCGG-3′); human RB1 2 antisense (5′-CCGAAAAACGGCCGCCACCG-3′); human TP53 1 sense (5′-CCATTGTTCAATATCGTCCG-3′); and human TP53 1 antisense (5′-CGGACGATATTGAACAATGG-3′).

CDC20 (NM_001255.3) or CDC20 with an N-terminal 3×Flag tag was cloned into the pLVX IRES Hygro vector (Clontech). The CDC20 R445Q mutation was generated using site-directed mutagenesis (Pfu polymerase). pTwist Lenti SFFV Puro WPRE lentiviral vectors encoding: (1) CCNB1 wild-type-HA, (2) CCNB1 triple mutant-HA (E169K/Y170H/Y177C) or a (3) negative control that encodes a functionally inactivated EED mutant-HA with mutations to inactivate EED (F97A/Y148A/Y365A) were codon optimized and synthesized by Twist Biosciences. All plasmids were sequence verified by sanger sequencing. To make the DOX-on pTripz neo E2F1, E2F2 or E2F3 construct, pDONR223 E2F1 (W. G. Kaelin's laboratory), pCMVHA E2F2 (Addgene, 24226) and pCMV Tag2B E2F3 (Addgene, 202522) were used as templates for overhang PCR to introduce the attB1 and attB2 sites onto the 5′ and 3′ ends of E2F1 (sense primer, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGGCCTTGGCCGGGGCCCCTGCG; and antisense primer, 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTGAAATCCAGGGGGGTGAGGTCCCC-3′), E2F2 (sense primer, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGCTGCAAGGGCCCCGGGCCTTG-3′; and antisense primer, 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTATTAATCAACAGGTCCCCAAGGTC-3′) and E2F3 (sense primer, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGAGAAAGGGAATCCAGCCCGCT; and antisense primer, 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTTACTACACATGAAGTCTTCCACCAG-3′). The PCR product was then gel extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Purified E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 double-stranded DNA fragments containing attB1 and attB2 sites were introduced into the pDONR223 vector by homologous recombination using BP clonase (Life Technologies, 11789020) for 1 h at 25 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction mixture was then transformed at a ratio of 1:10 (reaction volume/volume competent cells) into HB101 competent cells (Promega). Spectinomycin-resistant colonies were screened by restriction digestion of miniprep DNA and subsequently validated by DNA sequencing. A homologous recombination reaction was then performed using LR Clonase II (Life Technologies, 11791100) with the pDONR223-E2F1, pDONR223-E2F2 or pDONR223-E2F3 plasmids and DOX-on pTripz-NEO DEST vector that was modified to be used as destination vectors for Gateway recombination cloning. The LR reaction was transformed into HB101 competent cells (Promega). Kanamycin-resistant (pTripz-NEO) colonies were screened by restriction digestion of miniprep DNA and subsequently validated by DNA sequencing. Lentivirus was then generated and then transduced into cells to make stable DOX-on cell lines for inducible E2F1, E2F2 or E2F3 expression.

Lentiviruses were made by Lipofectamine-2000-based co-transfection of HEK293FT cells with the respective lentiviral expression vectors and the packaging plasmids psPAX2 (Addgene, 12260) and pMD2.G (Addgene, 12259) at a ratio of 4:3:1. Virus-containing supernatant was collected at 48 and 72 h after transfection, pooled together (7 ml total per 6 cm tissue culture dish), passed through a 0.45-µm filter, aliquoted and frozen at −80 °C until use.

The cells were counted using a Vi-Cell XR Cell Counter (Beckman Coulter) and 2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 1 ml lentivirus with 8 μg ml−1 polybrene in individual wells of a 12-well plate. The plates were then centrifuged at 931g (Allegra X-15R Centrifuge (Beckman Coulter), rotor SX4750A, 2,000 rpm) for 2 h at 30 °C. Then, 16 h later, the virus was removed and cells were grown for 72 h before being placed under drug selection. Cells were selected in puromycin (0.5 μg ml−1) or G418 (500 μg ml−1).

RPE1 cells were first infected with lentivirus encoding an sgRNA targeting RB1 (sgRB1) or a non-targeting sgRNA (sgC0111, sgControl) in LentiCRISPR-V2 Puro vector. RPE1 sgRB1 or sgControl cells were superinfected with lentiviruses encoding an sgRNA targeting TP53 (sgTP53) or a non-targeting sgRNA (sgC0111, sgControl) and a G418 resistance gene in the pLentiCRISPR-V2 vector. Cells were selected in G418 (500 µg ml−1) until all mock-infected cells were killed and immunoblot analysis was performed for RB1 and p53 in the presence or absence of CIRc-004 at the concentrations indicated.

For dose–response assays with cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor (CIRc-004), inactive enantiomer of CIRc-004 (CIRc-005) and CDK2i (PF-07104091), the cells were counted on day 0 using a Vi-Cell XR Cell Counter and plated in a tissue-culture-treated six-well plate at 50,000 cells per ml in 2 ml of complete medium. Cells were treated with the compounds (CIRc-004, CIRc-005, PF-07104091) at the indicated concentrations for 6 days. Normalized cell counts were calculated as (day 6 count for treated samples)/(day 6 count for DMSO treated sample). The EC50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism v.10.0.0.

For DOX-inducible (DOX-on) E2F1-, E2F2- or E2F3-overexpressing cell lines, cells were counted on day 0 and plated in tissue-culture-treated six-well plates at 250,000 cells per ml for 3-day assays or 50,000 cells per ml in 2 ml of complete medium for 6-day assays. For 3-day cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor assays, E2F1 expression was induced with DOX (1 µg ml−1) for 24 h followed by drug treatment for 3 days. For 6-day cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor assays, E2F1 expression was induced with DOX for 24 h followed by drug treatment for 6 days, with replacement with fresh DOX every 3 days.

NCI-H1048, NCI-H446 and WI-38 cells were counted using a Countess II FL (Invitrogen) and plated at 5,000 cells per well in 96-well plates. NCI-H69 cells were grown to confluency in a T150 flask. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 283g (Thermo Fisher Scientific X4R Pro-MD centrifuge, Sorvall TX1000 rotor, 1,100 rpm) and resuspended in 30 ml medium of which 10 ml was used to seed six 96-well plates. NCI-H526 cells were grown to confluency in a T75 flask, collected by centrifugation at 283g and resuspended in 10 ml medium of which 2.5 ml was used to seed six 96-well plates. The next day, cells were dosed with cyclin A/B/E RxL inhibitor (CIRc-001), cyclin A/B RxL inhibitors (CIRc-004; CIRc-028), cyclin-A-selective RxL inhibitor (CIRc-018), cyclin-B-selective RxL inhibitor (CIRc-019) or inactive enantiomer of CIRc-004 (CIRc-005). Roscovitine and staurosporine were used as plate controls to define the top and bottom of the growth inhibition curves, respectively. Inhibitors were dosed in duplicate in either an 8-point (WI-38) or 10-point (SCLC cell lines) 1:3 serial dilution with 10 µM maximum concentration. Roscovitine was dosed in singlet in an 8- or 10-point 1:2 serial dilution with 100 µM maximum concentration. Staurosporine was dosed in singlet in an 8- or 10-point 1:2 serial dilution with 1 µM maximum concentration. After dosing, plates were maintained in tissue culture incubators (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 3 days (WI-38) or 5 days (SCLC cell lines) to allow for at least two cell doublings before processing in an MTT proliferation assay (R&D systems, 4890-050-K) performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The average absorbance value obtained with the highest two concentrations dosed for roscovitine and staurosporine was used for background subtraction. The top of the assay (100% growth) was determined by normalization with the top of the roscovitine curve. The GI50 was determined by nonlinear regression analysis using log(inhibitor) versus response-variable slope (four parameters) using GraphPad Prism (v.10.1.0).

For MTT proliferation assays with the MYT1 inhibitor RP-6306, NCI-H1048, NCI-H446 and NCI-H69 cells were seeded in 96-well plates as described above. The next day, cells were dosed in duplicate in a 10-point 1:3 serial dilution with CIRc-018, CIRc-019, or CIRc-004 alone or in combination with RP-6306 at 100 nM for NCI-H1048 cells or 500 or 1,000 nM for NCI-H446 and 1,000 nM for NCI-H69 cells. After 5 days, cells were processed in an MTT proliferation assay and GI50 values were determined using GraphPad Prism (v.10.1.0) as described above.

Viability of cells were quantified using Cell Titer Glo according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) and the IC50 values were determined using GraphPad Prism (log inhibitor versus response four parameters).

Cells were plated at 250,000 cells per ml density and grown in cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor (CIRc-004), MPS1 inhibitor (BAY-1217389) or DMSO at the indicated concentrations for 72 h. Cells were then collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by a PBS wash, and then permeabilized in ice-cold 90% methanol (added dropwise) for 30 min on ice.

FACS analysis was then performed to determine the percentage of positive p-histone H3 (Ser10) cells using FlowJo v.10.8.1. The FACS gating strategy is provided in Supplementary Fig. 3.

Cells were plated at 500,000 cells per ml and grown in cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor (CIRc-004) or DMSO at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. After incubation, cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS and then fixed in ice-cold 80% ethanol (added dropwise) for at least 2 h at −20 °C. The cells were then centrifuged at 206g (Eppendorf centrifuge 5804R, A-4-44 rotor, 2,000 rpm) for 5 min, washed once in PBS, centrifuged again at 206g and then washed again in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. Finally, cells were stained with propidium iodide (BD, 550825) for 15 min at room temperature. FACS analysis for PI was then performed on the LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and analysis was performed using FlowJo v.10.8.1. The FACS gating strategy is provided in Supplementary Fig. 3.

NCI-H1048 cells were plated at 500,000 cells per ml in a 12-well (Fig. 4a) or 6-well (Fig. 4l and Extended Data Fig. 7b) plate and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were dosed with cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor (CIRc-004) or DMSO for 24 h. Cells were pulsed for 1 h with 10 µM EdU (Click-It Plus EdU Flow Cytometry Assay kit, Invitrogen, C10632) before collection. After incubation, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and fixed by incubation in ice-cold 80% ethanol for at least 2 h at −20 °C. EdU was fluorescently tagged with Alexa Fluor 488 by click reaction (Click-it Plus EdU flow cytometry assay kit, Invitrogen, C10632). DNA content was monitored by FxCycle Violet stain (Invitrogen, F10347) or 1 μg ml−1 DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Cell Signaling) for 5 min. For Fig. 4a, flow cytometry analysis for EdU and DNA content was performed by full spectral flow cytometry on the Northern Lights cytometer (Cytek Biosciences) and analysis was carried out using FlowJo v.10.9.0. For Fig. 4l and Extended Data Fig. 7b, flow cytometry analysis for EdU and DNA content was performed using the LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and analysis was carried out using FlowJo v.10.8.1. FACS gating strategy is given in Supplementary Fig. 3.

G-CSF mobilized human peripheral blood CD34+ cells were plated in a 24-well plate at 25,000 cells per ml after counting with a VI-Cell BLU (Beckman Coulter). Cells were then allowed to recover for 48 h before dosing cells with CIRc-004, staurosporine (100 nM) or DMSO for 24 h. Cells were pulsed for 1 h with 10 µM EdU (Click-It Plus EdU Flow Cytometry Assay kit, Invitrogen, C10634) before collection. After incubation, cells were collected, washed once with PBS and resuspended in 1% BSA-PBS before staining with CD34 (8G12) Per-CP (BD, 340666) for 30 min at a 1:10 dilution protected from light. The cells were centrifuged for 200g (Eppendorf centrifuge, 5424R) for 5 min at all wash steps. Cells were then washed in 1% BSA-PBS. Cells were then fixed by resuspending cells in 50 µl of Click-it Fixitive (4% PFA) and incubated for 15 min. Cells were then washed with 1% BSA-PBS and resuspended in permeabilization and wash buffer prepared as directed from Click-It Plus kit (Click-It Plus EdU Flow Cytometry Assay kit, Invitrogen, C10634) for 15 min. EdU was fluorescently tagged with Alexa Fluor 647 by click reaction (Click-It Plus EdU Flow Cytometry Assay kit, Invitrogen, C10634). Cells were then resuspended in permeabilization buffer and stained with FITC mouse anti-cleaved PARP (Asp214) (BD, 558576) for 1 h at a 1:5 dilution protected from light. DNA content was monitored by FxCycle Violet stain (Invitrogen, F10347). Flow cytometry analysis for EdU and DNA content was performed by full spectral flow cytometry on a Northern Lights cytometer (Cytek Biosciences) and analysis was carried out using FlowJo v.10.9.0. The FACS gating strategy is given in Supplementary Fig. 3.

Cell pellets were lysed in a modified EBC lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Roche Applied Science, 11836153001) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP, Sigma-Aldrich, 04906837001). Soluble cell extracts were quantified using the Bradford protein assay. Then, 20 µg of protein per sample was boiled after adding 3× sample buffer (6.7% SDS, 33% glycerol, 300 mM DTT and Bromophenol Blue) to a final concentration of 1×, resolved by SDS–PAGE using either 10% or 6% SDS–PAGE, semi-dry transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 h, and probed with the indicated primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed three times in TBS-T, probed with the indicated horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, and washed three times in TBS-T. Bound antibodies were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) western blotting detection reagents (Immobilon, Thermo Fisher Scientific, WBKLS0500) or Supersignal West Pico (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PI34078). The primary antibodies and dilutions used were as follows: mouse anti-β-actin AC-15 (Sigma-Aldrich, A3854, 1:25,000), mouse anti-vinculin hVIN-1 (Sigma-Aldrich, V9131, 1:10,000), rabbit anti-p-CASC5/KNL1 Thr943/Thr1155 D8D4N (Cell Signaling, 40758, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-CASC5/KNL1 E4A5L (Cell Signaling, 26687, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-cyclin B1 D5C10 (Cell Signaling, 12231, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-E2F1 (Cell Signaling, 3742, 1:1,000), CDC20 (Cell Signaling, 4823S, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-p-KAP1 Ser824 (Cell Signaling, 4127, 1:1,000) and Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, A8592).

To detect p-stathmin S38, total stathmin, p-cyclin B1 (Ser126), p-nucleolin (Thr84), p-RPA2 (Ser33) and p-FOXM1 (Thr600), after incubation with the indicated cyclin RxL inhibitors or DMSO control, NCI-H1048 cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 120 mM sodium chloride and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete, Sigma-Aldrich, 5892970001) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP, Sigma-Aldrich, 4906837001). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 9,391g (Eppendorf centrifuge 5424R, FA-45-24-11 rotor, 10,000 rpm) for 10 min. The supernatant (cell extract) was removed and the protein content was estimated by performing a Bradford assay. Cell extracts (30 μg of protein) were boiled after adding 4× Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked in TBS plus 0.2% Tween-20 (TBS-T) containing 5% skimmed milk and incubated with relevant primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer containing 5% BSA. After incubation with primary antibodies, the membranes were washed in TBS-T and then incubated with HRP-labelled secondary antibodies for 1–-2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed again in TBS-T, incubated with ECL reagent (LI-COR, WesternSure, 92695000) and scanned on the Odyssey Fc Analyzer (LI-COR Biosciences).

Immunoblots were quantified using Fiji (Image J2, v.2.9.0) or LICOR Odyssey built-in Image Studio Software (v.5.2). Quantified values from immunoblots are provided in Supplementary Tables 8 and 9. Raw immunoblots are included as Supplementary Fig. 1.

For immunoprecipitation of endogenous cyclin A and cyclin B in Figs. 2o, 3h and 4c and Extended Data Figs. 8u and 9d–f,h, NCI-H1048 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 107 cells per 15 cm plate and were allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, cells were incubated with the indicated cyclin RxL inhibitors at 300 nM or DMSO for 2 h before rinsing once in ice-cold PBS and lysing in 1% NP-40 buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 120 mM sodium chloride and 1% NP-40) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete, Sigma-Aldrich, 5892970001) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP, Sigma-Aldrich, 4906837001). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 9,391g for 10 min. The supernatant (cell extract) was removed and the protein content was estimated by performing a Bradford assay. Then, 2 mg cell extract was rotated overnight at 4 °C with 2 µg anti-cyclin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SCBT) sc-271682) or 2 µg anti-cyclin B (SCBT sc-245) antibodies. The next day, 20 µl packed protein-A- and protein-G-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads Protein A and Dynabeads Protein G, Invitrogen, 10002D and 10003D, respectively) were added and lysates were rotated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The protein A/G beads were collected using a magnet, washed three times with 1% NP-40 cell lysis buffer, boiled and denatured in 1× Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS–PAGE and immunoblotting was performed as described above. The primary antibodies and dilutions used were as follows: anti-MYT1 (Fortis Life Sciences, A302-424A, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-WEE1 (Cell Signaling, 4936, 1:1,000), mouse anti-cyclin B (Cell Signaling, 4135 1:1,000), mouse anti-E2F1 (SCBT, sc-251, 1:1,000), mouse anti-cyclin A (Cell Signaling, 4656, 1:1,000), mouse anti-CDK2 (Origene, TA502935), rabbit anti-CDC2 (Cell Signaling 28439). The secondary antibodies used and dilutions were: mouse anti-rabbit (confirmation specific)-IgG HRP (Cell Signaling, 5127, 1:2,000), goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Cell Signaling, 7074S, 1:5,000), horse anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Cell Signaling, 7076S, 1:5,000), goat anti-mouse-IgE-HRP (Southern Biotech, 1110-05, 1:5,000).

For immunoprecipitations of cyclin B–HA and CDK2 in Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 9k, HEK293T cells were stably infected with pTwist Lenti SFFV Puro WPRE lentiviral vectors (SYNTHESIZED by Twist Biosciences) encoding (1) CCNB1 wild-type-HA, (2) CCNB1 triple mutant-HA (E169K/Y170H/Y177C) or a (3) negative control encoding a functionally inactivated EED mutant-HA with mutations to inactivate EED (F97A/Y148A/Y365A). In total, 2.0 × 107 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per ml density and, the next day, were treated with the cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor (CIRc-004) at 300 nM or DMSO for 2 h before cell collection. Cells were lysed in 700 µl lysis buffer (Cell Signaling, 9803) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Roche Applied Science, 11836153001) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP, Sigma-Aldrich, 04906837001). Samples were sonicated (Branson Digital Sonifier) three times for 5 s each to ensure homogenization and centrifuged at 14,000g for 10 min at 4 °C (Eppendorf centrifuge 5424R, FA-45-24-11 rotor). The supernatant was precleared by rotating 20 µl protein A agarose beads (Cell Signaling, 9863) for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were then briefly centrifuged to remove the beads and protein concentration was determined. Then, 60 µl of lysate was removed as input (~10% total for ~2.5% input per immunoblot) and boiled after adding 3× sample buffer (6.7% SDS, 33% glycerol, 300 mM DTT and Bromophenol Blue) to a final concentration of 1×. Then 300 µl of lysate was immunoprecipitated by rotating overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-HA epitope (Cell Signaling, 3724, 1:100) for exogenous cyclin B, rabbit anti-CDK2 E8J9T (Cell Signaling, 18048, 1:100) or equivalent amount of rabbit (DA1E) monoclonal antibody IgG XP isotype control (Cell Signaling, 3900). The next day, 20 µl protein A agarose beads was added to each sample tube and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with cold lysis buffer followed by boiling in 3× sample buffer. The samples were run on SDS–PAGE and immunoblotting was performed as described above. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting were as follows: rabbit anti-cyclin B1 D5C10 (Cell Signaling, 12231, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-CDK2 E8J9T (Cell Signaling, 18048, 1:1,000) and mouse anti-HA.11 epitope tag (BioLegend, 901501, 1:1,000).

For immunoprecipitation of endogenous cyclin A with E2F3 in Extended Data Fig. 10f, NCI-H1048 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 107 cells per 15 cm plate and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, cells were incubated with the indicated cyclin RxL inhibitors at 300 nM or DMSO for 2 h before rinsing once in ice-cold PBS and lysing in 1% Triton buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 120 mM sodium chloride and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete, Sigma-Aldrich, 5892970001) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP, Sigma-Aldrich, 4906837001). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 9,391g for 10 min. The supernatant (cell extract) was removed and the protein content estimated by performing a Bradford assay. Anti-cyclin A antibody (SCBT, sc-271682) was covalently coupled to M-270 Expoxy dynabeads (Dynabeads Antibody Coupling Kit, Invitrogen 14311D) at a ratio of 10 μg antibody per mg of beads and rotated overnight at 37 °C. Next, 2 mg cell extract was then rotated overnight at 4 °C with 1 mg coupled dynabeads. The dynabeads beads were collected using a magnet, washed three times with 1% Triton cell lysis buffer, boiled and denatured in 1× Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS–PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed as described above. The primary antibodies were mouse anti-E2F3 (SCBT, sc-56665, 1:1,000), and mouse anti-cyclin A (Cell Signaling, 4656, 1:1,000). The secondary antibodies were horse anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Cell Signaling, 7076S, 1:5,000) and goat anti-mouse-IgE-HRP (Southern Biotech, 1110-05, 1:5,000).

To synchronize cells in mitosis, as depicted in Fig. 3k, a preliminary evaluation was conducted to determine the minimal nocodazole concentration required to induce mitotic arrest and the optimal time post-washout for facilitating the re-entry of the majority of cells into the cell cycle. In brief, 500,000 cells per ml of NCI-H69 cells were seeded in six-well plates and treated with increasing concentrations of nocodazole (60, 120, 240 ng ml−1) or DMSO as a control. After overnight incubation, cells were collected, fixed and subjected to propidium iodide-based FACS to assess mitotic arrest. A nocodazole concentration of 60 ng ml−1 was sufficient to induce mitotic arrest in around 90% of cells. To determine the optimal wash-out time for mitotic exit, cells were plated at 500,000 cells per ml density and treated with 60 ng ml−1 nocodazole. After overnight incubation, nocodazole-containing media was removed, and cells were washed three times with DPBS (Life Technologies, 14190250). Fresh warm medium was then added, and cells were collected at 0, 3, 6 and 12 h after washout. A 6 h incubation period was optimal to allow the majority of cells to complete mitosis and re-enter the subsequent cell cycle. For the immunoblot analysis shown in Fig. 3k, cells were seeded in 6 cm tissue culture dish at a density of 500,000 cells per ml and incubated overnight with nocodazole (60 ng ml−1). The next day, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with CDK2i (PF-07104091, 500 nM), cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor (CIRc-004, 20 nM), nocodazole (60 ng ml−1) or the combinations as indicated using DMSO as control. At 6 h after incubation, cells were collected for immunoblot analysis.

For histone extractions in Fig. 4, cells were counted on day 0 using the Vi-Cell XR Cell Counter and plated in 6 cm plates at 250,000 cells per ml in 4 ml of medium per plate for all cell lines along with indicated concentration of cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor. Then, 3 days later, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 400g for 3 min at 4 °C in a 15 ml conical tube. The cell pellets were then washed once in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, transferred to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and pelleted by centrifugation at 400g for 3 min at 4 °C. The PBS was removed by gentle aspiration and the soluble proteins from the cell pellets were extracted by incubation in nucleus lysis buffer (250 mM sucrose, 60 mM KCL, 15 nM NaCl, 15 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.3% NP-40 supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitors) for 10 min at 4 °C. The extracts were then centrifuged at 10,000g for 1 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was removed by aspiration. The cell pellets were again resuspended in nucleus lysis buffer and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 10,000g for 1 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed by aspiration and the histones in the insoluble pellet were extracted by overnight incubation in 60 µl of 0.2 N HCl followed by centrifugation at 16,800g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and quantified using the Bradford protein assay. The pH was neutralized by adding 1/5 volume of 1 N NaOH, as confirmed by the colour of the samples after the addition of sample buffer containing Bromophenol Blue. Then, 1 μg of protein in sample buffer was boiled and resolved by SDS–PAGE on a 15% SDS–PAGE gel. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described above. The primary antibodies were as follows: rabbit anti-histone-3 DH12 (Cell Signaling, 4499, 1:5,000) and rabbit anti-p-histone H2A.X Ser 139 (Cell Signaling, 2577, 1:1,000). For all experiments, total histone H3 protein was run as a sample processing control on a separate gel owing to the low amount of protein lysate loaded onto the gel (1 μg) for histone blots.

A panel of 46 SCLC cell lines was tested for their sensitivity to cyclin A/B RxL inhibition in a Cell Titer Glo (CTG) proliferation assay performed at Shanghai ChemPartner (Fig. 1d). Cells were plated in 384-well format and dosed in duplicate with CIRc-004 in a 10-point, 1:3 serial dilution dose–response assay with a 10 μM starting concentration. Staurosporine was used as an assay control per cell line and was dosed in duplicate from 2 μM maximum concentration in a 10-point 1:3 serial dilution. Cells were exposed to inhibitor for 4–8 days depending on the length of time required for at least two cell doublings to occur. A time 0 h read and an end-point DMSO control read were obtained per cell line for calculation of GI50 values. SCLC panel GI50 values are included in Supplementary Table 1.

CIRc-001 was profiled in Horizon Discovery's High Throughput OncoSignature screening platform containing 302 cell lines across 18 indications (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Cells were seeded in 384-well tissue culture plates at 250–1,500 cells per well. Assay plates were dosed in triplicate with inhibitor in a 9-point, 1:3 serial dilution dose–response assay with 10 μM maximum concentration. Cells were incubated for 3 days and then analysed using CellTiter-Glo 2.0 (Promega). At the time of treatment, a set of assay plates that did not receive treatment were collected and ATP levels measured by adding CellTiter-Glo 2.0 (Promega). All datapoints were collected by automated processes and were subject to quality control. Potency and efficacy metrics were derived from logistics curves fitted to growth inhibition using Horizon's Chalice software. Horizon Discovery OncoSignature panel cell line GI50 values are provided in Supplementary Table 2.

To identify differentially expressed gene sets associated with sensitivity and resistance to CIRc-001 across the Horizon Discovery OncoSignature cell line panel, and to CIRc-004 across the SCLC panel (Fig. 1e), GSEA was first performed between sensitive and resistant cell lines using the MSigDB hallmark pathways using mRNA expression data obtained from the Broad Institute's Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia (CCLE) database (2019 release: DepMap 2019q3). Sensitive and resistant are defined as the top and bottom quartile of the area over the curve to identify hallmark pathways that were differentially enriched in sensitive versus resistant lines based on FDR < 0.05 For the Horizon Discovery OncoSignature cell line panel, 42 out of 46 SCLC lines and 288 out of 302 cell lines across Horizon Discovery OncoSignature cell line panel had mRNA expression that was available for the analysis.

The GSVA method33, using the MSigDb Hallmark collection of RNA-seq data, was then used to calculate GSVA scores for E2F targets and G2/M checkpoint pathway using the GSVA Bioconductor package (v.1.50.5). To visualize the top selected pathways from GSEA analysis, gene expression data were first aggregated as GSVA scores based on gene set annotations obtained from MSigDB. For each pathway, pathway scores were transformed to z scores across samples to standardize the data. The heat map was constructed using the ComplexHeatmaps package (v.2.18.0) in R (v.4.3.2), where rows represented Hallmark pathways, columns represented samples and the colour intensity reflected the mean z score of each pathway for each sample and was hierarchically clustered by pathway to reveal patterns of enrichment. For Fig. 1e (right), the median E2F target or G2M pathway score across the SCLC panel was used as the threshold to define low versus high groups and P values were calculated using Mann–Whitney t-tests.

On day 0, NCI-H1048 cells were counted using the Vi-Cell Counter. In total, 1.50 × 108 cells (which would yield representation of at least 500 cells per sgRNA if multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.3) were pelleted and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells per ml in complete medium containing 50 µl ml−1 of human genome-wide Brunello sgRNA library (CP0043) (purchased from the Broad Institute) lentivirus, which contains both the sgRNA and Cas9, and 8 µg ml−1 polybrene. The lentiviral titre was determined empirically in pilot experiments with a goal MOI of 0.3–0.5. CP0043 contains 77,441 sgRNAs targeting 4 sgRNAs per gene with 1,000 non-targeting sgRNAs controls. The cells mixed with polybrene and lentivirus were then plated in 1 ml aliquots onto 12-well plates and centrifuged at 931g (Allegra X-15R Centrifuge (Beckman Coulter), rotor SX4750A, 2,000 rpm), for 2 h at 30 °C. In parallel, 2 × 106 cells were also centrifuged under the same conditions but without lentivirus as a control for puromycin selection (Mock). Around 16 h later (day 1), the cells were collected, pooled and centrifuged again at 448g to remove the lentivirus and polybrene, and the cell pellet was resuspended in complete medium and plated into twenty-three 15 cm tissue-culture-treated plates at 0.3 × 106 cells per ml or in 6-well plates at the same density for the control (mock) cells. The cells were then cultured for 72 h at which time (day 4) the cells were counted and plated at 0.4 × 106 cells per ml in 15 cm tissue-culture-treated plates with fresh medium containing puromycin (0.25 µg ml−1) to select for puromycin-transduced cells. A parallel experiment was performed on day 4 to determine the MOI of the screen. To do this, cells infected with the sgRNA library or mock-infected cells were plated at 0.4 × 106 cells per ml in 6-well plates in the presence or absence of puromycin (0.25 µg ml−1). After 72 h (day 7), cells were counted using the Vi-Cell XR Cell Counter and the MOI was calculated using the following equation: (number of puromycin-resistant cells infected with the sgRNA library/total number of cells surviving without puromycin after infection with the sgRNA library) − (number of puromycin-resistant mock-infected cells/total number of mock-infected cells). The calculated MOI was 0.33. On the same day (day 7), the puromycin-containing medium was exchanged with fresh complete medium not containing puromycin.

On day 10, cells were pooled, counted and split into two replicates. Each replicate was split into four arms: (1) CIRc-004 (cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor, 200 nM); (2) CIRc-001 (cyclin A/B/E RxL inhibitor, 200 nM); (3) CDK2i (PF-07104091, 500 nM); or (4) CIRc-005 (inactive enantiomer of CIRc-004, 200 nM). CIRc-005 had no effect on cellular proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 2d) and therefore was used as a negative control comparison for all drug treated arms. A total of 4 × 107 cells were plated at 0.2 × 106 cells per ml in 15 cm tissue culture plates in complete medium containing the respective drugs maintaining 500 cells per sgRNA. At the same time, the remaining cells were collected and divided in aliquots of 4 × 107 (again to maintain representation of 500 cells per sgRNA), washed in PBS and cell pellets were frozen for genomic DNA isolation for the ETP before drug selection. Mock-infected cells were maintained at the same density for all drug conditions and carried out in parallel for the entire screen described below.

The medium on the plates under drug selection was exchanged every 3 days with complete medium containing fresh drug. Treatment arms were counted and passaged when cells were about 80% confluent and split back to a representation of 4 × 107 cells at a density of 0.2 × 106 cells per ml onto 15 cm tissue culture plates. This was done for the CIRc-005 inactive enantiomer every 3 days as CIRc-005 had no effect on cellular proliferation, and it happened only once or twice during the screen for all of the other drug treatment conditions as the drugs exhibited strong cytotoxicity. When cells were passaged, all cells were pooled, counted and replated maintaining 500 cells per sgRNA. The remaining cells were divided into aliquots of 4 × 107 cells, washed in PBS and cells pellets were frozen for genomic DNA isolation. The screen was terminated on day 26 (LTP) when there was an obvious growth advantage in the CIRc-004, CIRc-001, CDK2i arms infected with the sgRNA library relative to the mock infected cells treated with the same compounds.

After completion of the screen, genomic DNA was isolated using the Qiagen Genomic DNA maxi prep kit (51194) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Raw Illumina reads were normalized between samples using: log2[(sgRNA reads/total reads for sample) × 1 × 106) + 1]. The initial common ETP (day 10) was then subtracted from the LTP after drug treatment (day 26) to determine the relative enrichment of sgRNAs in the CIRc-004, CIRc-001 and CDK2i arms relative to the CIRc-005 inactive enantiomer control arm for each replicate. Apron analysis, hypergeometric analysis and STARS analysis (GPP web portal, https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/screener/) were performed using the normalized counts of the drug-treated arms LTP–ETP (Apron) or the log-normalized counts of the drug-treated arms LTP–ETP (hypergeometric, STARS) comparing the drug-treated condition to the CIRc-005 enantiomer control at the matched LTP or compared to the ETP. The averaged data from the two replicates were used for all analyses shown in the manuscript. All raw data and outputs of each analysis listed above are provided in Supplementary Table 3.

For validation studies, we focused on the cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor (CIRc-004) and not CIRc-001, as CIRc-004 spared cyclin E and, perhaps as a result, demonstrated modestly increased cellular potency. NCI-H1048 and NCI-H446 cells were first infected with pLentiCRISPR V2-Puro lentiviruses encoding sgRNAs targeting the selected screen hits and selected with puromycin. Stably infected cells were counted on day 0 using a Vi-Cell XR Cell Counter and plated onto tissue-culture-treated 6-well plates at 50,000 cells per ml in 2 ml of complete medium. For dose–response assays with CIRc-004 and the CDK2i (PF-07104091), the cells were treated with the compounds at the indicated concentrations for 6 days and counted using the Vi-Cell system. Normalized cell counts were calculated as day 6 counts for treated samples/day 6 counts for DMSO sample. Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism v.10.0.0.

The Nijhawan laboratory developed a forward genetic screening system using an engineered colorectal cancer cell line, termed iHCT116, that identifies mutations that confer compound resistance using HCT116 cells engineered for inducible protein degradation (with the addition of IAA) of mismatch repair protein, MLH137. As a result, cells cultured without IAA have a lower mutation rate (mut-low) than cells cultured with IAA (mut-high). These cells are diploid and, therefore, resistance mutations are more likely to be the result of a gain of function. For the forward genetic screen, 5 million iHCT116 cells that had previously been treated with vehicle or indole acetic acid were cultured in 10 μM of CIRc-004 for 17 days, with the medium replenished every 3 days. Six and twelve clones from the mut-low and mut-high conditions, respectively, were isolated. The surviving clones were analysed for resistance to CIRc-004 in a 3-day proliferation assay in which CIRc-004 was added in dose–response with a final concentration of DMSO of 0.5%. The EC50 for all clones were at least 100-fold higher than parental cells. All clones tested were resistant to an unrelated toxin, MLN4924, suggesting that non-specific mechanisms of CIRc-004 resistance were unlikely (Extended Data Fig. 5d). After evaluating the barcode sequence in all 18 clones, 5 and 12 founder clones were identified in the mut-low and mut-high condition, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Eight distinct clones were selected for exome sequencing. Barcode sequences were PCR amplified and sequenced as described previously37. Genomic DNA was collected from select clones (Qiagen) and processed for whole-exome sequencing. Mutations unique to individual clones were identified using the previously described analysis37. Only four genes were mutated in more than 1 of 8 clones and heterozygous CDC20 mutations were found in 5 of 8 clones.

For dose–response assays with MPS1 inhibitor (BAY-1217389) to empirically identify concentrations of the MPS1 inhibitor that effectively blocked MPS1 activity (measured by immunoblotting for p-KNL1) without gross effects on cellular proliferation, the cells were counted on day 0 using the Vi-Cell XR Cell Counter and plated in a tissue-culture-treated 6-well plate at 250,000 cells per ml in 2 ml of complete medium. Cells were treated with the drug (BAY-1217389) at the indicated concentrations for 3 days. The normalized cell count was calculated as (day 3 count for treated samples)/(day 3 count for DMSO treated sample). Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism v.10.0.0. These experiments identified 3 nM of BAY-1217389 blocks p-KNL1 without grossly affecting proliferation.

For rescue experiments with the MPS1 inhibitor, cells were counted using the Vi-Cell XR Cell and plated at 250,000 cells per ml for NCI-H1048 cells or at 50,000 cells per ml for NCI-H69 and NCI-H446 cells and then treated with cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor (CIRc-004) at the indicated concentrations with or without MPS1 inhibitor (BAY-1217389 at 3 nM) and collected after 3 days for dose–response assays using the Vi-Cell system. For FACS-based cleaved PARP apoptosis assay, cells were counted and plated at 250,000 cells per ml and then treated with CIRc-004 at the indicated concentrations with or without MPS1 inhibitor (BAY-1217389 at 3 nM) and, 3 days later, were collected, stained and analysed as described above.

For immunoblot analysis of p-KNL1 levels after BAY-1217389 treatment, about 2 million cells were counted using the Vi-Cell XR Cell and plated at 500,000 cells per ml and then treated with CIRc-004 at the indicated concentrations with or without BAY-1217389 at 3 nM, and collected 24 h later for immunoblot analysis.

Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips at 250,000 cells per ml and treated with CIRc-004 as indicated. Coverslips were fixed with ice-cold 100% methanol for 15 min on ice. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (5% BSA in PBS) for 1 h. Coverslips were then incubated with the following primary antibodies diluted in fresh blocking buffer: rabbit anti-p-histone H2A.X Ser139 (Cell Signaling, 2577, 1:400), rabbit anti-p-CASC5/KNL1 Thr943/Thr1155 D8D4N (Cell Signaling 40758, 1:400), ACA (Antibodies, 15-235, 1:500) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS + 0.05% Triton X-100 and then incubated with secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11011, 1:300) and Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-human (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A21445, 1:300) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were then washed three times in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated with 1 μg ml−1 DAPI (Cell Signaling) for 5 min. After rinsing with PBS coverslips, the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with ProLong Glass mounting reagent (Invitrogen, P36930). Images were acquired using the Zeiss LSM980 laser-scanning microscope (Oberkochen) with ZEN 2.3 SP1 software. Image analysis was performed using Image J2 v.2.9.0.

Image quantification was performed using Fiji (Image J2 v.2.9.0). In brief, regions of interest were defined by identifying mitotic cells and drawing an area centred on the DAPI stain. Background values measured in an adjacent region were subtracted and the resulting corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) was calculated using the formula CTCF = (integrated density) − (area of selected cell × mean fluorescence of background). Each individual mitotic cell CTCF was plotted in a dot plot and CIRc-004-treated cells were compared with vehicle-treated cells.

Live-cell imaging was performed on a Ti2 inverted microscope fitted with a CSU-W1 spinning-disk system (Nikon). To perform live-cell imaging, NCI-H1048 cells were transduced to stably express both mCherry-PCNA and PGK-H2B-eGFP (Addgene, 21210). Two rounds of FACS sorting were performed to obtain a pure population of eGFP and mCherry double-positive cells. To capture mitotic events for these experiments, we focused our live-cell imaging experiments on H2B–eGFP. Cells were seeded onto 35 mm µ-Dish (iBiDi, 80137) at 500,000 cells per ml and allowed to attach and grow for 48 h. CIRc-004 (20 nM) was added 2 h before live-cell imaging. z stacks (+6 (above) and −4 (below) planes at 0.5 μm spacing) were captured every 5 min for 10 h, using a Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera (Andor), and a ×20/0.95 NA Plan Apochromat Lambda objective with the correction collar set to 0.17. An environmental enclosure was used to maintain cell culture conditions (37 °C and humidified 5% CO2) for all live-cell confocal imaging. Images were analysed on NIS Elements Viewer v.4.2 (Nikon). The timing of mitosis was measured from DNA condensation (beginning timepoint) to cytokinesis completion (end timepoint).

For FUCCI reporter LIC, RPE1 cells were stably transduced with Incucyte cell cycle green/red construct (47741, Sartorius). After selection with puromycin (2 µg ml−1), cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 1,000 cells per well. CIRc-004 (2,000 nM) was added before initiating live-cell imaging. Plates were imaged every 20 min for 24 h. Imaging and analysis was performed using Incucyte Zoom/S3 live-cell imagers (Essen Biosciences) and quantified using the Incucyte analysis software.

To establish the adenosine or cytosine base editor Cas9-expressing cell line for the screen with the tiling library, NCI-H1048 cells were transduced with pRDA_867 (A>G base editor Cas9) and pRDB_092 (C>T base editor Cas9), respectively. Successfully transduced cells were selected with blasticidin (5 µg ml−1) to make stable adenosine or cytosine base editor cell lines.

The base editor library (CP1985) was custom designed using the Broad Institute's CRISPR base editor library designer Beagle (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gppx/beagle/screener) to include a total of 2,802 sgRNAs tiling CCNB1, NM_031966.4 (572 sgRNAs), CCNA2 NM_001237.5 (577 sgRNAs), CDK2 NM_001798.5 (476 sgRNAs) and CDC20 NM_001255.3 (897 sgRNAs). As controls the library contained 56 guides against essential genes (EEF2, DBR1, PLK1, KIF11, GAPDH, PCNA, RPA3, RPL3, POLR2B and PSMB1), 112 guides against intergenic sites and 112 guides as non-targeting controls.

First a pilot experiment was performed to empirically determine the lentiviral titre needed for a goal MOI of 0.3–0.6. Cells were mixed with polybrene and increasing amounts of the lentiviral CP1985 sgRNA library and plated in 1 ml aliquots onto 12-well plates and centrifuged at 931g (Allegra X-15R Centrifuge (Beckman Coulter), rotor SX4750A, 2,000 rpm), for 2 h at 30 °C. In parallel, 2 × 106 cells were also centrifuged under same conditions but without lentivirus as a control for puromycin selection (Mock). Then, about 16 h later (day 1), the cells were collected, pooled and centrifuged again at 448g to remove the lentivirus and polybrene, and the cell pellet was resuspended in complete medium and plated into 15 cm tissue-culture-treated plates at 0.4 × 106 cells per ml or in 6-well plates at the same density for the control (mock) cells. The cells were then cultured for 72 h at which time (day 4) the cells were counted and plated at 0.4 × 106 cells per ml in 15 cm tissue-culture-treated plates with fresh medium containing puromycin (0.5 µg ml−1) to select for puromycin-transduced cells. After 72 h (day 7), cells were counted using the Vi-Cell XR Cell Counter and the MOI was calculated using the following equation: (number of puromycin-resistant cells infected with the sgRNA library/total number of cells surviving without puromycin after infection with the sgRNA library) − (number of puromycin-resistant mock-infected cells/total number of mock-infected cells). These experiments demonstrated that 25 µl ml−1 of CP1985 virus was needed to achieve a MOI of about 0.3–0.6.

For the screen, adenosine or cytosine base editor Cas9-expressing NCI-H1048 cell lines were counted using the Vi-Cell counter on day 0. Two replicates of 2.4 × 107 cells (which would yield representation of at least 2,000 cells per sgRNA if MOI = 0.3) were pelleted and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells per ml in 1 ml of complete medium containing 25 µl ml−1 of the pooled sgRNA library (CP1985) lentivirus and 8 µg ml−1 polybrene. A parallel experiment was performed on day 4 to determine the actual MOI of the screen as described above, which showed that the MOI of the screen was about 0.6. On the same day (day 7), puromycin-containing medium was exchanged with fresh complete medium not containing puromycin for all cells in the screen.

On day 10, cells from each replicate were pooled, counted and then split into two additional replicates (four replicates in total). In total, 6 × 106 cells from each replicate were collected for an ETP for representation of 2,000 cells per sgRNA. This was done by washing cells in PBS and freezing cell pellets at −80 °C for genomic DNA isolation. The remaining cells from each replicate were then split into two treatment arms: (1) CIRc-004 (cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor, 200 nM) and (2) CIRc-005 as a negative control and comparator (inactive enantiomer of CIRc-004, 200 nM) with 4.5 × 106 cells in each treatment arm plated in 15 cm tissue culture plates at 0.2 × 106 cells per ml in complete medium containing the respective drugs listed above to maintain representation of 1,500 cells per sgRNA. Mock-infected cells were maintained at the same density for all drug conditions and carried in parallel for the entire screen described below.

The medium on the plates under drug selection was exchanged every 3 days with complete medium containing fresh drug at the concentrations described above. Treatment arms were counted and passaged when cells were about 80% confluent and split back to a representation of 4.5 × 106 cells at a density of 0.2 × 106 cells per ml onto 15 cm tissue culture plates. This occurred for the CIRc-005 inactive enantiomer every 3 days as CIRc-005 had no effect on cellular proliferation. As the CIRc-004 exhibited strong cytotoxicity, this treatment arm required medium exchange only every 3 days. When cells were passaged, the cells were pooled, counted and replated maintaining 1,500 cells per sgRNA. The remaining cells were divided into aliquots of 6 × 106 cells, washed in PBS and the cell pellets were frozen for genomic DNA isolation. The screen was terminated on day 26 when there was an obvious growth advantage in the CIRc-004 arm infected with the sgRNA library relative to the mock infected cells treated with the same compounds.

After completion of the screen, genomic DNA was isolated using the Qiagen Genomic DNA midi prep kit (51183) and mini prep kit (51106) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Raw Illumina reads were normalized between samples using log2[(sgRNA reads/total reads for sample) × 1 × 106) + 1]. LFC values in Supplementary Fig. 2a,b were calculated by subtracting the plasmid DNA (pDNA) log-normalized value from the CIRc-005 LTP (day 26) log-normalized value and this was used for replicate reproducibility and dropout of essential sgRNA versus negative-control sgRNAs. To calculate the z-scored LFC values in Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 2c–e, we first subtracted the log-normalized value of the negative enantiomer control (CIRc-005) at the LTP (day 26) from the log-normalized value of the cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor (CIRc-004) at the LTP (day 26). This LFC value (CIRc-004 minus CIRc-005) for each sgRNA was z-scored, a transformation that factors in the performance of the control guides, using the following equation: z score = (x − μ)/σ, where x, μ and σ correspond to the LFC of an individual guide, the mean LFC of all negative control guides and the s.d. of all control guides, respectively. These z-scored LFC values for each sgRNA were then matched to the annotated CP1985 library where Beagle (Broad Institute) was used to predict the expected nucleotide edit and plotted for each tiled gene as indicated in each figure panel listed above. The averaged data from the four replicates were used for all analyses shown in the manuscript. All raw data and outputs of each analysis listed above are provided in Supplementary Table 5.

To validate the exact mutations enriched after CIRc-004 treatment in CCNB1 corresponding to the amino acids 117–285, which contained several enriched CCNB1 variants from our original base editor screen in Fig. 3b, we repeated the screen as in Fig. 3a at scale with a representation of 1,500 cells per sgRNA, and at the LTP (day 26), mRNA was isolated from the cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor (CIRc-004)-treated and enantiomer control (CIRc-005)-treated arms using the Quick-RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA concentration was determined using the Nanodrop 8000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) system. A cDNA library was synthesized using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (BioRad, 1708841) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 3,000 ng of RNA. The target site on CCNB1 was amplified by two-step PCR using KOD XTREME HOT START DNA POLYMERASE (Sigma-Aldrich, 71975-3) using 25% of the total cDNA reaction above. For the first PCR step, CCNB1 1F, 5′-GGAACGGCTGTTGGTTTCTG-3′; and CCNB1 1R, 5′-AAGTAAAAGGGGCCACAAGC-3′ primers were used to amplify a 1,514 bp region. Then, 0.2 μl of the first PCR reaction was used for a second round of PCR amplification using the following primers: 2F, 5′-CGCCTGAGCCTATTTTGGTTG-3′; and CCNB1 2R, 5′-CCATCTGTCTGATTTGGTGCTTAG-3′ to yield a 510 bp product. This final PCR product was column purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, 28704) and sent for amplicon sequencing using next-generation sequencing by the MGH DNA Core Facility and analysed using MGH DNA Core's complete amplicon sequencing pipeline for data analysis of >600 bp amplicons using the following CCNB1 NM_031966.4 refseq amplicon: CGCCTGAGCCTATTTTGGTTGATACTGCCTCTCCAAGCCCAATGGAAACATCTGGATGTGCCCCTGCAGAAGAAGACCTGTGTCAGGCTTTCTCTGATGTAATTCTTGCAGTAAATGATGTGGATGCAGAAGATGGAGCTGATCCAAACCTTTGTAGTGAATATGTGAAAGATATTTATGCTTATCTGAGACAACTTGAGGAAGAGCAAGCAGTCAGACCAAAATACCTACTGGGTCGGGAAGTCACTGGAAACATGAGAGCCATCCTAATTGACTGGCTAGTACAGGTTCAAATGAAATTCAGGTTGTTGCAGGAGACCATGTACATGACTGTCTCCATTATTGATCGGTTCATGCAGAATAATTGTGTGCCCAAGAAGATGCTGCAGCTGGTTGGTGTCACTGCCATGTTTATTGCAAGCAAATATGAAGAAATGTACCCTCCAGAAATTGGTGACTTTGCTTTTGTGACTGACAACACTTATACTAAGCACCAAATCAGACAGATG.

To analyse variants from the CCNB1 refseq above, the percentage of mismatched reads at individual base positions were normalized to the percentage of sequencing reads to get the percentage of variants at each position and then averaged across two independent experiments. Then the enrichment of percentage of variants in the CIRc-004-treated arm was compared to the variants in the CIRc-005-treated arm to determine the fold change in CIRc-004 versus CIRc-005 at the LTP. All data outputs are in Supplementary Table 5.

Co-folding of proteins were done by AlphaFold 2 implemented in ColabFold76. The default parameters were used to predict their relative positions (parameters: msa_mode (MMseqs2_UniRef_Environmental), pair_mode (unpaired_paired), model_type (auto), number of cycles (3), recycle_early_stop_tolerance(auto), relax_max_iterations (200), and pairing_strategy (greedy)). The resulting co-folding structure along with the PAE files was analysed using ChimeraX software77. The command ‘alphafold contacts /A to /B distance 3' was used to identify residues potentially interacting within a putative predicted distance of less than 3.0 Å.

Schrodinger software suite (2024-3 version) was used to conduct modelling studies on cyclin B. Initially, the binding model of CIRc-004 to wild-type cyclin B1 was generated using the crystal structure of the cyclin B–p-CDK2 complex (PDB: 2JGZ). The crystal structure was superimposed onto the cyclin A–CIRc-004 model by performing backbone alignment using the Protein Structure Alignment tool in Maestro, and was prepared using the Protein Preparation Workflow with the default settings. Starting from the binding pose in the cyclin A model, CIRc-004 was minimized in the cyclin B's RxL site using Prime MM-GBSA with the VSGB solvent model, OPLS4 force field and a rigid protein, followed by docking using Glide SP with the ‘refine-only' option. The resulting binding model was then used as the input structure for free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations78,79 to assess the binding of CIRc-004 to various single and double mutants of cyclin B. Using the protein FEP for ligand selectivity module, the relative binding free energies of CIRc-004 to various cyclin B mutants were computed with the wild-type cyclin B treated as the reference. The default settings were used for the FEP calculations with the SPC water model and OPLS4 force field.

sgRNA sequences targeting specific base edits in CCNB1 were selected from the CP1985 sgRNA library based on z-scored LFC enrichment after CIRc-004 treatment in our primary screens, synthesized by IDT technologies and cloned using the same approach as for sgRNA oligo cloning described above. These sgRNAs were integrated into the GFP-expressing pMV_AA013 lentiviral vector (Broad Institute) using sgRNA Cloning method described above. NCI-H1048 cells, expressing either pRDA_867 (A>G base editor Cas9) or pRDB_092 (C>T base editor Cas9), were transduced with the pMV_AA013 plasmid carrying the sgRNA sequences and GFP and subsequently subjected to puromycin selection to establish stable edited cell lines.

The following sgRNA oligos were used for A>G edits: non-targeting sense (5′-CAACGTCGCGAACGTCGTAT-3′); non-targeting antisense (5′-ATACGACGTTCGCGACGTTG-3′); human CCNB1 Tyr170His sense (5′-ACATATTCACTACAAAGGTT-3′); human CCNB1 Tyr170His antisense (5′-AACCTTTGTAGTGAATATGT-3′); human CCNB1 Tyr177Cys sense (5′-TATGCTTATCTGAGACAACT-3′); human CCNB1 Tyr177Cys antisense (5′-AGTTGTCTCAGATAAGCATA-3′); human CCNB1 Gln213Arg/Met241Val sense (5′-GGTTCAAATGAAATTCAGGT-3′); human CCNB1 Gln213Arg/Met241Val antisense (5′-ACCTGAATTTCATTTGAACC-3′); human CCNB1 Val227Ala/Ser228Pro sense (5′-ATGGAGACAGTCATGTACAT-3′); human CCNB1 Val227Ala/Ser228Pro antisense (5′-ATGTACATGACTGTCTCCAT-3′).

The following sgRNA oligos were used for C>T edits: non-targeting sense (5′-CAACGTCGCGAACGTCGTAT-3′); non-targeting antisense (5′-ATACGACGTTCGCGACGTTG-3′); human CCNB1 Glu169Lys sense (5′-CATATTCACTACAAAGGTTT-3′); human CCNB1 Glu169Lys antisense (5′-AAACCTTTGTAGTGAATATG-3′); human CCNB1 Glu314Lys sense (5′-TGTACCTCTCCAATCTTAGA-3′); human CCNB1 Glu314Lys antisense (5′-TCTAAGATTGGAGAGGTACA-3′); human CCNB1 Ala346Thr/Gly347Arg sense (5′-CTCCTGCTGCAATTTGAGAA-3′); human CCNB1 Ala346Thr/Gly347Arg antisense (5′-TTCTCAAATTGCAGCAGGAG-3′); human CCNB1 Glu374Lys sense (5′-GAGATTCTTCAGTATATGAC-3′); human CCNB1 Glu374Lys antisense (5′-GTCATATACTGAAGAATCTC-3′).

The GFP-expressing stable base-edited cells were combined with their parental base editor counterpart cells (without the sgRNA and GFP) at a ratio of 1:4 with the exact ratio confirmed by FACS analysis for GFP and seeded at a density of 0.1 × 106 cells per ml in 10 cm dishes. The cells were cultured in the presence of CIRc-004 (20 nM or 200 nM) or DMSO. Cells were collected for FACS analysis on days 6 and 13. After each timepoint, cells were replated and cultured in the presence of drug with fresh drug added every 3 days. On day 13, the remaining cells after FACS were collected, and genomic DNA was extracted. Data from the FACS-based competition assay at day 13 is shown in Fig. 3e.

To verify the exact mutations in CCNB1 made by the base-editing sgRNAs and to determine whether CIRc-004 caused enrichment of these mutations, genomic DNA from the competition assay above at day 13 was collected and PCR amplification of the CCNB1 target region (forward 3F, 5′-GCCCAATGGAAACATCTGGATG-3′; reverse 3R, 5′- GCGATCTCTTAAGAAATGCTGCCC-3′) was performed followed by next-generation sequencing using CRISPR amplicon sequencing conducted at the MGH DNA Core Facility as previously described80. Variant reads are listed in Supplementary Table 5.

To identify proteins that are modulated by CIRc-004, we performed cyclin B immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry in NCI-H1048 cells treated with CIRc-004 (50 nM),CIRc-005 (50 nM) or DMSO for 2 h. The cyclin B1 immunoprecipitation was performed as described above with the following modifications: 10 mg cell extract was rotated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg anti-cyclin B antibodies. After cyclin B1 immunoprecipitation, beads were washed with PBS before freezing at −80 °C. Dry beads were resuspended with 200 μl of Smart digest buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 60113-101) before adding 3 μl of Smart trypsin. Beads were digested in a Thermo block (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h 30 min at 70 °C with 1,400 rpm (~250g) agitation. Trypsin digestion was then stopped by adding trifluoroacetic acid at 1% final concentration. The samples were then desalted using SOLA HRP SPE cartridges (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 60109-001) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified peptide eluates were dried by vacuum centrifugation and re-suspended in 0.1% formic acid and stored at −20 °C until analysis.

Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis was performed using an Ultimate 3000 HPLC connected to an Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and interfaced with an EASY-spray source. Then, 0.5% of the tryptic peptides were loaded onto an AcclaimPepMap100 trap column (100 µm × 2 cm, PN164750; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and separated on a 50 cm EasySpray column (ES903, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 60 min linear gradient from 2 to 35% B (acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) and at a 250 nl min−1 flow rate. Both trap and column were kept at 50 °C. The Orbitrap Ascend was operated in data-independent mode (DIA) to automatically switch between MS1 and MS2, with minor changes from previously described method81,82,83. In brief, MS1 scans were collected in the Orbitrap at a resolving power of 45,000 at m/z 200 over an m/z range of 350–1,650 m/z. The MS1 normalized AGC was set at 125% (5 × 105 ions) with a maximum injection time of 91 ms and a RF lens at 30%. DIA MS2 scans were then acquired using the tMSn scan function at 30,000 orbitrap resolution over 40 scan windows with variable width, with a normalized AGC target of 1,000%, maximum injection time set to auto and a 30% collision energy.

DIA-NN software (V8.1) was used to analyse the raw data in library-free mode and using the recommended default settings83. In brief, a library was created from human UniProt SwissProt database (downloaded 22 July 2022 containing 20,386 sequences) using deep learning. Trypsin was selected as the enzyme (1 missed cleavage), N-term M excision and methionine were enabled. The identification and quantification of raw data were performed against the in silico library applying 1% FDR at precursor level and match between runs (MBR). Perseus (v.1.6.2.2) was used to further analyse the DIA-NN protein group output. Protein intensities were log2-transformed and normalized by median subtraction (by column) after applying a pre-processing filter based on valid numbers (3 out of 3 in at least one group). Subsequently, missing values were imputed following the normal distribution down shifted. A two-sample Student's t-test combined with multiple-testing correction using permutation-based FDR (5%) was applied. For ranking the proteins based on intensity, the average intensity was calculated for all values in the three treatment groups, log10-transformed and ranked. CIRc-004-dependent interactome is included in Supplementary Table 6.

All mouse experiments complied with National Institutes of Health guidelines. The PDX studies were approved and performed at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. The NCI-H69 and NCI-H1048 xenograft studies were approved and performed at Labcorp Early Development Laboratories and Pharmaron (Ningbo) Technology Development, respectively. Housing conditions for mice include a 12 h–12 h day–night cycle where the temperature is maintained at 72 °F.

For NCI-H69 studies, 5 × 106 NCI-H69 cells were suspended in serum-free RPMI1640 medium, combined with an equal volume of ECM gel (Sigma-Aldrich, E1270), and implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of 7–8-week-old female Nude mice (Envigo, Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu). After 13 days, when tumours were between 88–200 mm3 in size, mice were randomized and put into treatment groups of CIRc-028 or vehicle (5% DMSO, 10% Solutol HS15, in 85% D5W). Mice were treated daily with i.v. injections of 100 mg per kg CIRc-028 or vehicle for 14 days. Tumours were measured with callipers 3 times per week for the duration of the study. Tumours were collected 18 h after the last dose, formalin fixed for 24 h and paraffin embedded for IHC analysis.

For NCI-H1048 studies, 3 × 106 NCI-H1048 cells were suspended in a 1:1 mixture of HITES medium and Matrigel (Corning, 354234) and implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of 6–8-week-old female BALB/c nude mice (GemPharmatech Biotech, D000521). After 16 days, when tumours were between 180–315 mm3 in size, the mice were randomized and put into treatment groups. Treatment with CIRc-028 and vehicle was carried out as described above for NCI-H69 xenografts. Tumours were measured with callipers twice per week for the duration of the study. For NCI-H69 and NCI-H1048 xenograft studies, the investigator was not blinded but was agnostic to the outcome of the study. Animal use protocols specified that animals with tumour volumes larger than 2,000 and 2,500 mm3, respectively, or experiencing greater than 20% body weight loss or other severe clinical signs of deteriorating condition would be euthanized and these end-point criteria were not exceeded for any mice on study without prompt euthanasia.

RNA-seq was performed on untreated SCLC DFCI-393 and DFCI-402 PDX tumours that were used for the PDX studies. For RNA-seq analysis of experimental PDX, DFCI-393 tumours were treated with the orally bioavailable cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor CIRc-014 at 100 mg per kg orally three times per day or vehicle (30% PEG400, 20% Solutol HS15, 50% Phosal 53 MCT) three times a day for 4 days and tumours were collected 8 h after the morning dose on the last day of treatment and snap-frozen. Six independent tumours from six independent mice were used for CIRc-014 and five independent tumours from five independent mice were used for vehicle. For RNA-seq of NCI-H1048 cell line, cells were plated at 500,000 cells per ml in the presence of DMSO (vehicle), cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor (CIRc-004 or CIRc-014, 200 nM), inactive enantiomer (CIRc-005, 200 nM) or a CDK2i (PF-07104091, 500 nM). Then, 24 h after drug treatment, cells were collected for RNA. The NCI-H1048 cell line experiments were done in two biologically independent experiments. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, 74106) including a DNase digestion step according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was submitted to Novogene. The libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II non-stranded kit. Paired-end 150 bp sequencing was performed on NovaSeq 6000 sequencer using S4 flow cell. Sequencing reads were mapped to the hg38 genome by STAR. Statistics for DEGs were calculated by DESeq2 (v.1.36.0) (Supplementary Tables 4 and 7).

Principal component analysis (PCA) in Extended Data Fig. 11g was performed using the top 500 genes with the largest s.d. of log-transformed FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped fragments) values and these genes were subjected to PCA using the removeBatchEffect function in the limma package (v.3.58.1) and prcomp function of R software (v.4.3.3). The log-transformed sum of ASCL1, NEUROD1, CHGA, CHGA, INSM1 and SYP FPKM values was calculated as the neuroendocrine score for each sample. FPKM values are included in Supplementary Table 7. Heat maps were generated by calculating the z score using log-transformed FPKM values. To calculate the z score, a log-transformed FPKM value was subtracted from the mean and then divided by the s.d. The genes were then sorted for the log2-transformed fold change of treatment versus control samples. z-score values are provided in Supplementary Tables 4 and 7. For HALLMARK pathway enrichment analysis, differentially expressed genes were tested if over-represented against the HALLMARK pathways from the MSigDB using R packages msigdbr (v.7.5.1) and clusterProfiler (v.4.8.3). List of differentially expressed genes are included in Supplementary Tables 4 and 7.

PDXs were generated from either tumour biopsies or pleural effusions of patients with SCLC. All patient samples were collected after obtaining written informed consent. PDX tumour DFCI-393 originated from a surgical biopsy at resistance from a patient who received previous chemotherapy and radiation. The surgical biopsy of DFCI-393 was directly implanted directly into the subrenal capsule of NSG mice for expansion. DFCI oncopanel genomic DNA sequencing of DFCI-393 showed an RB1 E280* mutation with a single-copy deletion of RB1 at 13q14.2, and a TP53 K132N mutation with single-copy deletion of TP53 at 17p13.1 together showing biallelic inactivation of RB1 and TP53. DFCI-402 was derived from pleural effusion of a patient who was treated with first-line carboplatin/etoposide and then second-line nivolumab and the pleural effusion was removed as part of routine clinical care. The pleural fluid from the effusion was immune depleted and implanted subcutaneously to make DFCI-402. DFCI oncopanel genomic DNA sequencing of DFCI-402 showed an RB1 R358* mutation with copy loss of 13 probably contributing to biallelic loss of RB1. It also showed a TP53 G154Afs*16 mutation. RNA-sequencing of DFCI-393 and DFCI-402 with confirmation by immunoblot analysis showed that both PDX models are neuroendocrine-high SCLCs and DFCI-393 dominantly expresses ASCL1 while DFCI-402 expresses both ASCL1 and NEUROD1. RNA-seq data are included in Supplementary Table 7.

Studies and procedures were performed at Dana Farber Institute in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines in an AAALAC accredited vivarium. PDX models were generated using 7- to 8-week-old female NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1WjI/SzJ) mice purchased from Jackson Laboratories. After initial implantation of patient samples, all PDX tumours were expanded and passaged continuously in NSG mice as subcutaneous tumours.

Female NSG mice (aged 7–8 weeks) were used for all in vivo studies. PDX tumour fragments were dipped in Matrigel and implanted subcutaneously in NSG mice. Tumour growth was measured twice weekly when palpable. Once tumour volumes reached approximately 200 ± 50 mm3, mice were randomized using Studylog software into the treatment groups as: vehicle (30% PEG400, 20% Solutol HS15, 50% Phosal 53 MCT) or orally bioavailable cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor CIRc-014 (100 mg per kg, Circle Pharma). For the DFCI-393 model, CIRc-014 was administered orally three times a day for 28 days continuously and, for the DFCI-402 model, it was administered orally twice a day for 28 days continuously. For the DFCI-393 model, tumour samples were collected on day 28 after 8 h and for DFCI-402, tumours were monitored for regrowth after treatment withdrawal. Animals were euthanized if the tumour was necrotic/ulcerated or if the tumour volume exceeded 2,000 mm3. For the PD study in DFCI-393, mice bearing PDX tumours were treated with either vehicle or CIRc-014 (100 mg per kg orally three times per day) for 4 days. All tumour samples were collected 8 h after the morning dose on the last day of treatment. Tumour samples were fixed and snap-frozen for further downstream IHC analysis (see below). For DFCI-393 and DFCI-402 PDX studies, the investigator was not blinded but was agnostic to the outcome of the study. Animal-use protocols specified that animals with tumour volumes larger than 2,000 or experiencing >15% body weight loss or other severe clinical signs of deterioration would be euthanized, and these endpoint criteria were not exceeded for any mice on study without prompt euthanasia.

For the pharmacokinetic studies with the orally bioavailable cyclin A/B RxL inhibitor CIRc-014, DFCI-393 PDX-tumour-bearing NSG mice were used from the PD study above. After 4 days of CIRc-014 being dosed at 100 mg per kg orally three times per day, plasma timepoint sampling was conducted after the last dose in the CIRc-014 treatment group (n = 6). Animals 1–3 were bled at 0.5 and 2 h and animals 4–6 at 1 and 4 h followed by terminal bleed through cardiac puncture at 8 h. Blood was collected in K2EDTA tubes, centrifuged and plasma was collected, frozen and sent for analysis. The concentration of CIRc-014 was quantified in the mouse plasma samples using LC–MS/MS at Charles River Laboratories. CIRc-014 was used as a reference standard and glyburide (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the internal standard. Blank matrix CD-1 mouse plasma, pooled/mixed gender with K2EDTA anticoagulant (BioIVT) was used to prepare calibration standards and quality-control samples.

Sample extraction was performed on ice. A 10 µl aliquot of sample (calibration standards, quality control samples, blanks and study samples) was added to a 96-well plate. Then, 60 µl of internal standard solution (100 ng ml−1 glyburide in acetonitrile) was added to each well, except for wells designated for matrix blanks to which 60 µl of acetonitrile was added. The samples were covered, vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min. Then, 50 µl of supernatant was transferred to a new 96-well plate and the samples were diluted with 50 µl of MilliQ water before analysis. A Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18, 50 × 2.1 mm (1.7 µm) column was used and maintained at 50 °C during analysis. 5% acetonitrile/water with 0.1% formic acid was used as mobile phase A and 5% acetonitrile/methanol with 0.1% formic acid was used as mobile phase B. The chromatography condition with flow rate at 0.8 ml min−1 was started with 60% B, ramped to 90% B in 1 min and further increased to 95% B in 0.05 min and held for 0.25 min and the column was re-equilibrated at the initial conditions for 0.4 min. Analyte and internal standard were detected using an Applied Biosystems Sciex API 6500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The instrument was equipped with an electrospray ionization source (550 °C) operated in the positive-ion mode. The analyte and internal standard were monitored in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) scan mode. The selected [M+H]+ precursor ions were m/z 962.4 for CIRc-014, and 494.1 for glyburide, and the product ions monitored were at m/z 423.4 and 169.0 for CIRc-014 and glyburide, respectively. Linear fitting with 1/x2 weighting for a calibration range from 1.00 to 10,000 ng ml−1 was used for data analysis. Analytical results for all samples met acceptance criteria.

For the pharmacokinetic studies with the i.v. dosed cyclin A/Bi CIRc-028, NCI-H69- and NCI-H1048-tumour bearing Nude mice were used from the cell line xenograft efficacy studies described above. After 14 days of dosing with CIRc-028 at 100 mg per kg i.v. once per day, plasma timepoint sampling was conducted after the last dose in the CIRc-028 groups. For the NCI-H69 study, animals 1–5 were bled at 5 min followed by terminal bleed by cardiac puncture at 4 h, and animals 6–10 were bled at 0.5 and 2 h followed by terminal bleed by cardiac puncture at 18 h. For the NCI-H1048 study, animals 1–8 were bled at 5 min and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h followed by terminal bleed by cardiac puncture at 24 h. Blood was collected in K2EDTA tubes, centrifuged and plasma was collected, frozen and sent for analysis.

For the NCI-H69 study, the concentration of CIRc-028 was quantified in the mouse plasma samples by LC–MS/MS at Integrated Analytical Solutions. CIRc-028 was used as a reference standard and dextromethorphan (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the internal standard. Blank matrix mouse plasma, with K2EDTA anticoagulant (Bioreclamation) was used to prepare the calibration standards and quality-control samples. Sample extraction was performed on ice. A 20 µl aliquot of sample (calibration standards, quality control samples, blanks and study samples) was added to 2 volumes of cold internal standard solution except samples designated for matrix blanks to which 40 µl of acetonitrile was added. The samples were covered, vortexed and centrifuged for 30 min at 6,100g. An aliquot of each supernatant was transferred to an autosampler plate and diluted with 2 volumes of 0.2% formic acid in water before analysis. A Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18, 50 × 2.1 mm (1.7 µm) column or equivalent was used and maintained at room temperature during analysis. Water with 0.2% formic acid was used as mobile phase A and acetonitrile with 0.2% formic acid was used as mobile phase B. The chromatography condition with a flow rate at 1.2 ml min−1 was started with 5% B, ramped to 95% B in 1.5 min and held for 0.2 min at 95% B with a flow rate of 0.8 ml min−1 and the column was re-equilibrated at initial conditions for 0.5 min. The analyte and internal standard were detected using an Applied Biosystems Sciex API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The instrument was equipped with an electrospray ionization source operated in the positive-ion mode. The analyte and internal standard were monitored in the MRM scan mode. The selected [M+H]+ precursor ions were m/z 976.4 for CIRc-028, and 272.2 for dextromethorphan, and the product ions monitored were at m/z 596.0 and 215.2 for CIRc-028 and dextromethorphan, respectively. Power fit regression with no weighting for a calibration range from 25 to 50,000 ng ml−1 was used for data analysis. Analytical results for all samples met acceptance criteria.

For the NCI-H1048 study, the concentration of CIRc-028 was quantified in the mouse plasma samples by LC–MS/MS at Pharmaron Laboratories. CIRc-028 was used as a reference standard. Blank BALB/c nude mice matrix mouse plasma with K2EDTA anticoagulant was used to prepare calibration standards and quality-control samples. Sample extraction was performed on ice. A 10 µl aliquot of sample (calibration standards, quality control samples, blanks and study samples) was added to 200 volumes of cold internal standard solution in acetonitrile except samples designated for matrix blanks to which 200 µl of acetonitrile was added. The samples were covered, vortexed and centrifuged for 15 min at 4,000 rpm. An aliquot of each supernatant was transferred to an autosampler plate and diluted with 2 volumes of with water before analysis. A phenomenex Halo ES-CN 2.7 µ (30 × 3 mm) column or equivalent was used for analysis. 95:5 water:acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid was used as mobile phase A and 95:5 acetonitrile:water with 0.1% formic acid was used as mobile phase B. The chromatography condition with flow rate at 0.6 ml min−1 was started with 10% B, ramped to 100% B in 1.7 min and held for 0.3 min at 95% B and the column was re-equilibrated at initial conditions for 0.4 min. The analyte and internal standard were detected using an Shimadzu LCMS-8050 quadrupole mass spectrometer. The instrument was equipped with an electrospray ionization source operated in the positive-ion mode. The analyte and internal standard were monitored in the MRM scan mode. The selected [M+H]+ precursor ion was m/z 976.4 and the product ion monitored was m/z 596.35 for CIRc-028. An appropriate internal standard was used. An appropriate linear fit was used for calibration range from 0.5 to 2,000 ng ml−1 was used for data analysis. Analytical results for all samples met acceptance criteria.

IHC staining was performed with a Bond RX Autostainer (Leica Biosystems) using a Polymer Refine Detection kit (Leica Biosystems). Sections (thickness, 4 μm) were serially cut from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded mouse tumour samples to perform single IHC studies using antibodies recognizing p-KNL1 (1:100, rabbit monoclonal antibody, Cell Signaling, 40758), and cleaved caspase-3 (1:400, rabbit monoclonal antibody, Cell Signaling, 9664). The immunostained slides were scanned at (×40) using the PhenoImager HT instrument (Akoya Biosciences). For each slide, tumour areas were identified by a pathologist (Y.N.L.) and manually annotated using the HALO system. The number of positive and negative tumour cells was then determined using the HALO platform multiplex-IHC v.3.2.5 algorithm (Indica laboratory) and the percentage of positive tumour cells was subsequently calculated.

For the CRISPR–Cas9 screen in Fig. 2, the data were analysed using the Apron, STARS and Hypergeometric analysis algorithms on the GPP portal (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/screener/). Genes were considered hits if q < 0.25, using the STARS analysis.

a, Overlay of cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes shown in surface representation with bound ligands at the RxL binding site, including a macrocycle (yellow, PDB: 1URC) and p27Kip1 (purple, PDB: 1JSU). b, Computational model of a lariat decapeptide macrocycle bound at the RxL binding site, based on the bound structures of p27Kip1 (purple) and lariat macrocycle (yellow), as a ligand alignment template for binding prediction. c, Structures of CIRc-001, CIRc-004, CIRc-014, CIRc-018, CIRc-019 and CIRc-028. Two published cyclin A2 co-crystal structures with ligand bound at the RxL binding site, including the macrocycle, Ace-Arg-Lys-Leu-Phe-Gly (PDB code: 1URC) and the p27Kip1 peptide (PDB code: 1JSU), were used to generate a reference binding mode for our lariat macrocycles (Extended Data Fig. 1aabove). All modelling studies were performed using the Schrodinger software suite (version 2023-3). The crystal structures were first prepared using the Protein Preparation Workflow with default settings, and the cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes were subsequently aligned by using the protein structure alignment module. The bound ligands, aligned at the RxL binding motif, were combined to produce a template for novel ligand alignment. Specifically, the template model (Extended Data Fig. 1babove) is a lariat decapeptide (Lys-Pro-Ser-Ala-Cys-Arg-Lys-Leu-Phe-Gly) that contains the N-terminal hexapeptide segment of p27Kip1 (Lys25-Pro26-Ser27-Ala28-Cys29-Arg30, PDB: 1JSU) and the lariat cyclic pentapeptide (Lys502-Leu503-Phe504-Gly505, PDB: 1URC). To generate binding models of novel peptidic macrocycles, the 3D coordinates were generated by LigPrep and projected onto the template model by performing the maximum common substructure alignment for macrocycles in the ligand alignment module in Maestro (version 13.7.125) with cyclin A crystal structure (PDB: 1URC) specified as the receptor. The aligned ligand was further refined in the binding site by running Glide (ver. 10.0) SP docking with the “refine only” option in a docking grid based on the lariat-bound cyclin A crystal structure (PDB: 1URC). The docking grid was generated using the template model with default parameters. d, Detailed representation of modelled hydrogen bonds of CIRc-004 to Ile281, Trp217 and Gln 254 on cyclin A. e, Binding kinetic parameters determined in a WaveDelta instrument (Malvern Pananalytical) to Cyclin/Cdk complexes immobilized by amine coupling on a 4PCP chip (Malvern Pananalytical).

Source Data

a, Predicted effects of cyclin B mutations identified from the base editor screen on CIRc-004 ligand binding determined by free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations (see Methods). Mutating residues at the RxL binding site, including Ile204 and Trp208 were predicted to have the most significant effect, reducing binding affinity by 1 to 3 kcal/mol relative to cyclin B WT. Mutations of Met214Val and Val227Ala/Ser228Pro mutations showed medium impact on ligand binding 0.5-0.6 kcal/mol. *The energy convergence for the Trp208Arg mutations was poor possibly due to a conformational change from the Arg where Arg's side chain became solvent-exposed instead of being buried under the ligand. To supplement this, the Trp208Ala mutation was examined. Consistently, both Trp208Ala and Trp208Arg mutations were predicted to have a high effect on ligand binding. b, Mass spectrometry analysis after IP of endogenous Cyclin B1 in NCI-H1048 cells treated with CIRc-004 (50 nM), CIRc-005 (50 nM) (inactive enantiomer of CIRc-004, I.E) or DMSO for 2 h.

Perineural invasion (PNI) is a well-established factor of poor prognosis in multiple cancer types1, yet its mechanism remains unclear. Here we provide clinical and mechanistic insights into the role of PNI and cancer-induced nerve injury (CINI) in resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our study demonstrates that PNI and CINI of tumour-associated nerves are associated with poor response to anti-PD-1 therapy among patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and gastric cancer. Electron microscopy and electrical conduction analyses reveal that cancer cells degrade the nerve fibre myelin sheets. The injured neurons respond by autonomously initiating IL-6- and type I interferon-mediated inflammation to promote nerve healing and regeneration. As the tumour grows, the CINI burden increases, and its associated inflammation becomes chronic and skews the general immune tone within the tumour microenvironment into a suppressive and exhaustive state. The CINI-driven anti-PD-1 resistance can be reversed by targeting multiple steps in the CINI signalling process: denervating the tumour, conditional knockout of the transcription factor mediating the injury signal within neurons (Atf3), knockout of interferon-α receptor signalling (Ifnar1−/−) or by combining anti-PD-1 and anti-IL-6-receptor blockade. Our findings demonstrate the direct immunoregulatory roles of CINI and its therapeutic potential.

The development of cancer immunotherapy, specifically of antibodies blocking PD-1 and its ligand (PD-L1), has ushered in a new oncological era. Yet, the majority of patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy still do not respond to treatment2,3,4,5. Considerable efforts have been invested in identifying potential resistance mechanisms to anti-PD-1 therapy, including the role of immune regulation by non-immune cells. Tumour-associated nerves (TANs) are peripheral nerve fibres found within, or in close proximity to tumours6. Tumour infiltration into TANs, known as PNI, is a well-established adverse prognostic factor in many cancers1,7, especially in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)8, melanoma9, gastric cancer10 and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC)11. While TANs may promote tumour progression through adrenergic signalling12, little is known about the role of TANs in regulating antitumoural immune activity. This limited knowledge regarding the immune–nerve–cancer reciprocal relationship contrasts with the established evidence of bidirectional communication between the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the immune system. A healthy PNS supports haematopoiesis, regulates immune responses against infections and participates in the creation of immune memory13,14,15. By contrast, injured peripheral nerves attract immune cells such as immunosuppressive (M2) macrophages16—key players in tumour progression and resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy17—to promote nerve healing and regeneration18. Here we delineated the interaction between cancer cells, TANs and intratumoural immune activity across neurotropic cancers such as cSCC, melanoma, gastric cancer and PDAC. We demonstrated that cancer cells inflict nerve injury through myelin degradation. Injured TANs initiate type I interferon (IFN-I)- and IL-6-mediated inflammation, promoting nerve healing and regeneration. As the cancer progresses, more TANs are injured, and the nerve-driven inflammation turns into a chronic process, leading to immune exhaustion and resistance against anti-PD-1 therapy.

To evaluate the potential role of TAN injury in clinical response to anti-PD-1 therapy, we collected tumour samples from 56 patients with locally advanced (stage II–IVA) cSCC who were enrolled in two anti-PD-1 clinical trials (NCT03565783 and NCT04154943)19,20. In brief, all patients underwent two to four cycles of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy with cemiplimab, followed by surgery (Fig. 1a). None of the patients underwent radiation treatments before anti-PD-1 therapy. Responders (n = 33) were defined as patients with less than 10% viable tumour cells in their neoadjuvant-treated surgical specimens (Fig. 1b); while non-responders (n = 14) were defined as patients with more than 50% viable tumour cells, as previously described19,20. Patients who had 10–50% viable tumour cells in the surgical specimens (n = 9) were excluded from our cohort a priori19,20 as this patient subpopulation has been inconsistently assigned to either the responders or non-responders groups in previous neoadjuvant clinical trials and might also represent mixed biological resistance phenotypes. After surgery, patients received standard-of-care adjuvant treatments at the discretion of the treating physician20. Our initial step was to assess the presence of PNI in the clinical trial tumour samples, as PNI is the most established and clinically relevant form of cancer–nerve interaction21. At the baseline, non-responders had a significantly higher incidence of PNI than responders (50% versus 15%, respectively; P = 0.012; Fig. 1c). As the definition of PNI is histomorphological and not based on functional evidence of nerve damage1, we measured the expression of the canonical neuron injury markers, ATF322,23 and JUN24, using multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) to test whether cancer cells can injure the invaded neurons (Fig. 1d,e). Analysis of tumour samples (Extended Data Fig. 1; n = 7 responders and n = 6 non-responders) demonstrated that non-responders expressed higher levels of ATF3 in neurons (B3T+GFAP−) compared with responders (P = 0.005; Fig. 1e). In healthy neurons, ATF3 is bound to the neuron nucleus; the increased abundance of ATF3 in TAN axons therefore strongly implies the presence of neuronal injury and neuroregeneration attempts25,26,27. While the expression of JUN in non-responder TAN axons was increased compared with responders, this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.55; Fig. 1e), potentially as JUN is transported into the nucleus after neuronal injury28,29, resulting in a lower abundance in the axons.

To validate the association of TAN injury and anti-PD-1 resistance, we used an independently established and publicly available gene signature developed to assess PNI in cSCC30 (Supplementary Table 1). The signature was enriched among the cSCC clinical trial non-responder pretreatment samples (false-discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01; Fig. 1f). PNI is an established adverse prognostic factor in other immunogenic cancers, such as melanoma9 and gastric cancer31. To demonstrate a nerve-driven, tumour-agnostic effect we applied the same PNI/nerve injury signature to three publicly available RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) cohorts in patients with melanoma32,33 and gastric cancer34 (Supplementary Table 2). The PNI/nerve injury signature was enriched among pretreatment samples of anti-PD-1 non-responders in all three patient cohorts (FDR < 0.01 for all; Fig. 1g). In contrast to the patient population of our cSCC clinical trial, which included only patients with locally advanced disease, the patients in the melanoma and gastric cancer cohorts had metastatic disease. To validate the presence of CINI in a metastatic setting, we used the B16F10-OVA melanoma lung metastases mouse model. The lung-innervating nociceptor neurons within the jugular nodose ganglia of the melanoma-bearing mice demonstrated significant upregulation of both Atf3 and Jun compared with the control mice that were injected with PBS vehicle (FDR-adjusted P < 0.001 for both; Extended Data Fig. 2).

The functional association between CINI and resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy was validated in vivo. First, we eliminated nerves from the TME by plucking and removing nerves innervating the skin of immunocompetent SKH1-Elite mice (SKH1-Hrhr). This procedure, called denervation, was performed while preserving the skin vasculature35. A sham procedure was performed in the control group (Fig. 1h) and included a skin incision and closure while avoiding injury to cutaneous nerves. cSCC cells (B610K, ultraviolet-induced, SKH1-Hrhr derived) were intradermally injected into the denervated skin. Then, 7 days after cancer inoculation, mice were treated with either anti-PD-1 or IgG control. The denervated mice demonstrated enhanced anti-PD-1 efficacy compared with the sham control groups (P = 0.0027; Fig. 1i).

Next, we tested the impact of TANs injury on anti-PD-1 efficacy. Nerve injury was induced using surgical axotomy (Fig. 1j). In this mouse model, nerves were severed and left in place, resulting in Wallerian degeneration36 (anterograde disintegration of axons and their transected myelin sheaths). Surgical axotomy did not induce damage to the tumour blood vessels (Extended Data Fig. 3a). To increase the experiment's robustness, we used a different, syngeneic, ultraviolet-light-induced, cSCC cell line termed UVcSCC-M4 cells (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Then, 7 days after axotomy, UVcSCC-M4 cells were orthotopically injected into the injured dermatome of C57BL/6 black mice, followed by anti-PD-1 administration. Axotomized mice treated with anti-PD-1 had worse tumour control compared with the anti-PD-1 sham-operated controls (P < 0.001; Fig. 1k), serving as a mirror image to the denervation experiment. To assess the potential drug-specific effects of anti-PD-1 on human immune cells, we repeated this experiment with human-leukocyte-antigen-matched IC8 (human cSCC cells37) that were injected into axotomized or sham-operated skin of humanized CD34+ NOD scid gamma mice (huCD34-NSG; Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). huCD34-NSG mice that underwent axotomy and anti-PD-1 therapy had poorer treatment efficacy compared with the sham controls (P < 0.01). Overall, these results emphasized the association between CINI and anti-PD-1 therapy resistance.

To identify the mechanism of CINI, we examined the interaction between cancer cells and neurons in vitro. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were co-cultured with mouse SCC cells (Moc1 and B6). As shown in Supplementary Video 1, the SCC cells demonstrated neurotropism and made direct contact with the axon within 72 h. The ultrastructural changes associated with cancer–neuron interaction were assessed using electron microscopy (EM). Scanning EM (SEM) images were obtained on day 5 of co-culture, confirming the cancer cell attachment and invasion to the epineurium (Fig. 2a). Compared with naive neurons, cancer-exposed neurons demonstrated myelin breakdown, with myelin debris presenting as large circular aggregates, distinct from the linear appearance of normal compact myelin (Fig. 2a,b). On the basis of transmission EM (TEM), myelin degradation was evident at the endoneurial and axonal level, with disentanglement of the compact myelin lamellae (Fig. 2b). After 7 days of co-culture, a complete loss of the myelin sheath was found at the point of contact with cancer cells, as well as proximal loss of compact myelin integrity and axonal mitochondria (Fig. 2b,c), implying the presence of nerve injury. These in vitro findings were validated in vivo using an invaded sciatic nerve mouse model38—human oral SCC cells (HSC-3) were microinjected directly into the right sciatic nerve of mice, therefore minimizing the potential effect of immune cells. The EM images of the invaded sciatic nerve fibres showed similar myelin degradation (Extended Data Fig. 4). Notably, there was no evidence of synaptic cleft formation between cancer cells and neurons, as the EM images did not show electron-dense material and trans-cleft elements between pre- and post-synaptic membranes39,40 (Fig. 2c,d).

Myelin degradation is associated with decreased nerve conduction velocity and propagation of evoked electrical activity41. To confirm the presence of myelin degradation in CINI, we first conducted high-throughput electrical conduction studies in a mouse cSCC model. Using multimicroelectrode array (MEA), electrophysiological recordings were obtained from 3–5 mm orthotopic cSCC (intradermally injected B6 cells) and from non-tumour-bearing littermate healthy control skin. Simultaneous spatial and temporal continuous recording of the extracellular field potential (FP) revealed that conduction in tumour-bearing skin was significantly lower compared with the normal skin conduction (41.8 µV and 60.2 µV, respectively; P < 0.0001; Fig. 2e). Moreover, tumour-bearing skin demonstrated compound potentials, suggestive of myelin degradation42 (Fig. 2f). We validated these observations using an in vitro neuron viability assay, which included the following conditions: naive neurons, exogenous stress (no medium exchange for 6 days leading to exhausted neuronal medium), neurons treated with MOC1-conditioned medium, neurons co-cultured with MOC1 cells. Culture medium exchanges did not affect neuron viability, and neurons exposed to MOC1-conditioned medium did not show significantly reduced viability compared with the controls (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). The assay was validated using cell lines of two other cancer types associated with PNI, melanoma B16 and PDAC MIAPaCa (Extended Data Fig. 5c–g). Moreover, direct cancer–neuron contact resulted in a complete loss of spontaneous and evoked electrical activity after 48 h, while this effect was not observed in the MOC1-conditioned medium or exogenous stress neurons. Overall, these findings implied that CINI results from a direct cancer–neuron contact, not from paracrine secretion or synapse formation.

To clinically validate that CINI is associated with myelin degradation, we tested the co-localization of CINI and degraded myelin in an independent cohort of treatment-naive patients with cSCC with localized cancer who underwent surgical resection (wide local excision) of their tumour at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2013 and 2019 and had archived formalin-fixed paraffin tissue blocks available for analysis. Using mIF, the tumours were stained for pan-neuronal markers (B3T and NFH), nerve injury markers (JUN and ATF3) and myelin debris markers such as degraded myelin base protein (dMBP) and galactosylceramidase (GALC). The density of injured nerves (B3T+ATF3+JUN+) correlated with the density of degraded myelin (dMBP+, Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.79, P < 0.0001; Fig. 2g,h, n = 32 patients, n = 86 regions of interest (ROIs)).

CINI's mechanism was further explored in vitro. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived human DRG neurons were either cultured alone (naive), co-cultured with normal keratinocytes (HEK cell line) or co-cultured with human cSCC cells (IC8) for 48 h. Cells were labelled with a live neuron marker (NeuO). NeuO+ neurons were sorted and were analysed using RNA-seq. Compared with naive neurons and neurons co-cultured with normal keratinocytes, ATF3 gene expression was highest among the neurons co-cultured with cancer cells (Fig. 2i; P < 0.001). A gene set analysis compared the transcriptomic differences between NeuO+ neurons from the neuron–cancer co-culture and neuron-only controls. Among the top 12 Hallmark gene sets upregulated in cancer-exposed neurons, six were immune related, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IFNα, IFNγ and IL-6 signalling (all FDR < 0.01; Fig. 2j, Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Table 3). By contrast, neither nerve-injury-related nor immune-related transcriptional changes were detected when neuron-only controls were compared with neurons co-cultured with normal keratinocytes (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Anti-PD-1-exposed neurons did not demonstrate a significant transcriptional change compared with naive neurons (Extended Data Fig. 6c), suggesting that CINI is driven by cancer, not by anti-PD-1 therapy. To validate the CINI-related, neuron-intrinsic transcriptional changes in TNF, IFNα, IFNγ and IL-6, we measured the levels of these cytokines in the medium of neuron–cancer co-cultures using the Luminex immunoassay. As an additional validation degree, this experiment used mouse trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons instead of the iPS cell DRG neurons, as most of the tumours in our trial originated from the head and neck region (an area receiving the majority of its sensory innervation from the TG). TG neurons and MOC1 SCC cells were either cultured alone or co-cultured together for 48 h. IL-6 was not secreted by cancer cells and had the most prominent increase in secretion from neurons after exposure to cancer cells (Fig. 2k). Overall, our results demonstrated that cancer cells induced highly specific neuronal injury through myelin degradation, followed by the initiation of an inflammatory response by the injured neurons themselves, supporting the role of neurons as immune regulators.

After a peripheral nerve injury, neurons attract immune cells to the perineural niche to promote healing and neuroregeneration36. This healing process is led by immunosuppressive macrophages, inducing local immune exhaustion and suppression16. We therefore tested CINI's ability to alter the immune activity in the perineural niche and the general TME over time. Mice were intradermally injected with MOC2 SCC cells into their whisker pads, a highly innervated area43, followed by tumour extraction at different timepoints (7, 9, 11 and 13 days after tumour inoculation). The number of invaded nerves increased through day 11 when the neuroinvasive capacity saturated (Fig. 3a). Immune activity was assessed by mIF stains (Fig. 3b), using markers of immunosuppressive macrophages (CD68+CD163+PD-L1+) and exhausted CD8+ T cells (CD8+TIM3+). This analysis demonstrated that an increase in the abundance of NFH+ATF3+ injured nerves was coupled with an increase in the intratumoural infiltration of immunosuppressive macrophages and exhausted CD8+ T cells in the entire TME. To further establish the causal relationship between CINI and the immunosuppressive activity in the TME, we conducted a series of experiments. Our first goal was to demonstrate that the origin of immunosuppression was the injured nerves. To do so, we used mIF to assess immune infiltration in the perineural niches of nerves with CINI (NFH+ATF3+) versus nerves without CINI in cSCC tumours collected from treatment-naive patients. The analysis showed increased infiltration of immunosuppressive macrophages (CD163+PD-L1+) and neutrophil extracellular traps (MPO+C3H+, previously associated with post-nerve injury neuroinflammation44; Fig. 3c (top)) in the perineural niches of CINI nerves. These findings were validated in patients with PDAC45—a highly neurotropic cancer with a well-established deleterious effect of PNI on its clinical outcome46. The CINI mIF pattern in treatment-naive patients with PDAC was similar to that of cSCC (Fig. 3c (bottom)). Next, we validated the mIF findings using an independent cohort. PDAC tumours, which were resected from seven treatment-naive patients, underwent CosMx spatial transcriptomics analysis to profile the immune infiltration in the perineural niches. TANs were divided into three categories based on their ATF3 or JUN expression—injured (expression of both ATF3 and JUN), intermediate (expression of one marker) or non-injured (not expressing either transcript). Perineural niches were defined as areas in the TME within 150 μm from TANs47. Compared with healthy nerves, injured nerves had a higher infiltration of CD163+ macrophages and LAG3+CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3d; P = 0.018 and P = 0.048, respectively). This consistency across different cancer types, patient cohorts and scientific methods strengthens our initial observations and suggests a common mechanism of CINI-related immune effect across different neurotropic cancers.

To spatially test the interaction between CINI and immune activity in the perineural niche in the context of anti-PD-1 therapy, our cSCC neoadjuvant clinical trial samples were assessed using GeoMx digital spatial profiling (DSP). Neural niches were identified by immune labelling of the pan-neuronal markers NFH and B3T (Extended Data Fig. 7a–d). The protein expression in neoadjuvant-treated samples of non-responders (n = 109 ROIs) was compared to those of responders (n = 360 ROIs). Tumours from non-responding patients demonstrated increased expression of neurodegeneration protein markers such as PARK7, PARK5, PINK1 and LRRK2 (all FDR < 0.01; Fig. 3e). Analysis of the pretreatment tumour samples showed that the neuroprotective protein APOA-I was overexpressed in the perineural niches of responders versus non-responders (FDR < 0.01; Extended Data Fig. 7e), suggesting a lower degree of CINI among responders. Moreover, the CD31 expression level did not differ between responders and non-responders in the pretreatment samples (FDR = 0.76; Extended Data Fig. 7f), further suggesting that CINI is a nerve-specific process that does not affect nearby blood vessels. Next, we assessed the perineural niche immune activity using the DSP protein expression data. Perineural niches of neoadjuvant-treated non-responders showed a direct and significant correlation between markers of neuronal response to injury and both immune activation and suppression markers (Fig. 3f), suggesting perineural niche inflammation. By contrast, the perineural niches of responders showed mostly an inverse correlation between markers of neuronal injury and immune markers. These findings were validated using mIF stains. The perineural niches (defined as an area within 150 μm of the TAN epicentre47) in neoadjuvant-treated samples showed a higher abundance of CD68+CD163+, CD8+PD-1+ and CD8+LAG3+ cells among non-responders compared with responders (P = 0.055, P = 0.078 and P = 0.095, respectively; Fig. 3g).

To demonstrate that the CINI-related inflammatory response extends beyond perineural niches, we conducted a spatial transcriptomic analysis using fresh tumour samples from an independent, treatment-naive cohort of patients with cSCC (n = 11) who underwent Mohs surgery at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Supplementary Table 4). We examined the spatial relationships among three functional phenotypes: CINI, antitumoural immunity (included CD8A+GZMB+PRF1+ and CD4+IL2+ T cells, as well as CD86+IRF8+TNF+ and CD68+PSMB10+HLADQA1+HLADRA+HLADRB1+ antigen-presenting cells) and immunosuppressive inflammation phenotype (included CD204+CD206+CD163+ and CD68+IL-10+ tumour-associated macrophages, and CD4+FOXP3+ T regulatory cells). The spatial analysis revealed a correlation between the CINI and immunosuppressive inflammation phenotypes (r = 0.44), but no correlation with antitumoural immunity (r = 0.13; Extended Data Fig. 8). Examination of 27,420 tumour regions showed that 61.1% of areas with significant CINI presence (fold change > 2, FDR < 0.01) co-localized with the immunosuppressive phenotype (n = 1,544 out of 8,812 and 4,780 out of 7,817; P < 0.001; Extended Data Fig. 8). Figure 3h shows the spatial distribution of these phenotypes in individual tissue sections, visually representing the relationship between CINI and immunosuppressive inflammation across the tumour microenvironment. These findings were further validated using mIF of treatment-naive patients with cSCC in two distinct tumoural regions: the perineural niche (immune cells within 100 μm of the nerve epicentre) and nerve-remote areas (immune cells more than 1,000 μm away from the nerve epicentre). To focus on the active tumour areas, we excluded nerve-remote ROIs that contained non-active tumour sites, such as stroma. This analysis demonstrated that the presence of CD8+LAG3+ and CD163+PD-L1+ immunosuppressive cells in the perineural niche of nerves with PNI corresponded with similar infiltration patterns in nerve-remote areas (r = 0.5, P = 0.011; and r = 0.67, P < 0.001, respectively; Fig. 3i). Such spatial concordances did not exist in non-invaded nerves (n = 32 patients; n = 25 (PNI− nerves) and n = 25 (PNI+ nerves) ROIs). Overall, these findings suggested that the local immunosuppressive activity in the invaded perineural niche may extend more broadly, skewing the general immune tone in the TME towards a more suppressive state.

To establish causality between CINI and immunosuppressive activity in the TME, we conducted a series of in vivo experiments. To increase the robustness, we used a third cancer model, melanoma, as PNI has a critical deleterious effect on its clinical outcome9. First, we inoculated either B16F10-OVA melanoma cells or non-tumorigenic keratinocytes into mouse hind paws (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Then, 14 days after inoculation, the mice were euthanized, and the L3–L5 DRG neurons innervating the tumour/keratinocytes-inoculated paw were collected and analysed using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq; n = 32,951 neurons from 8 mice). The melanoma-innervating neurons were enriched for a unique subpopulation of neurons which we termed cancer-injured neurons (Fig. 4a). Cancer-injured neurons were characterized by high expression of neuronal injury markers, most prominently Atf3 (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 9b), and upregulation of multiple immune-related pathways, such as Hallmark inflammatory response and Hallmark IL-6 JAK STAT3 signalling (FDR < 0.001; Extended Data Fig. 9c,d). Atf3 is an adaptive response gene activated by stressful stimuli22. In neurons, ATF3 expression is rapidly upregulated in response to injury (Extended Data Fig. 9e,f), promoting axonal regeneration22,25,48. To test the effect of CINI signalling blockade on tumour growth and intratumoural immune activity, we used a conditional cre-lox Atf3 knockout (Atf3-cKO) mouse model, limiting the cKO only to nociceptors neurons (Nav1.8cre::Atf3fl/fl mice versus their permissive littermate controls (Nav1.8WT::Atf3fl/fl, termed wild type (WT)). B16F10-OVA melanoma cells were injected into both Atf3-cKO and WT mice. Tumours were collected after 10 days. mIF stains showed that CINI occurred in both mouse groups, as nerves with degraded myelin were present in both the WT and the Atf3-cKO tumours (MBP–dMBP; Extended Data Fig. 9g). Atf3-cKO mice had a lower melanoma tumour volume compared with WT mice (P < 0.01; Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9h), and increased tumour infiltration of IFNγ+CD8+ T cells (P = 0.04; Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 10a), suggesting a superior antitumoural immune activity within Atf3-cKO tumours. To test this hypothesis, we conducted scRNA-seq analysis of intratumoural immune cells. Atf3-cKO and WT mice were injected with B16F10-mCherry-OVA melanoma cells; tumours were collected after 10 days and cells were sorted per CD45+ expression. In total, 938 immune cells CD45+ were detected and divided into 4 clusters of immune cells: macrophages, B cells, neutrophils and T cells (Extended Data Fig. 10b). There was no difference in the proportional abundance of these clusters among the two conditions (Fig. 4e), suggesting a functional difference between the groups rather than immune trafficking differences. Our analysis revealed that CD8+ T cells in Atf3-cKO tumours (for which CINI neuron stress signalling was impaired) had a lower expression of exhaustion markers such as Lag3 (P = 0.05; Fig. 4f). Moreover, macrophages from Atf3-cKO tumours demonstrated an M1-like phenotype17 (Fig. 4g), which is associated with reduced immunosuppression and improved tumour control49. By contrast, WT macrophages were enriched with inflammatory pathways such as IL-6 signalling (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Table 5). Overall, the Atf3-cKO model demonstrated that ameliorating CINI intraneuronal injury signalling resulted in reduced immunosuppressive/exhaustive activity in the general TME of melanoma tumours. As the mice were treatment naive, these findings support the role of CINI in shaping the intratumoural immune activity before the administration of anti-PD-1 therapy.

To test the potential to overcome anti-PD-1 resistance by blocking CINI's inflammatory signalling, we returned to our neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 cSCC clinical trial samples. Blinded analysis of immunohistochemical staining demonstrated no differences in CD8+ T cell abundance between responders and non-responders before or after treatment (Fig. 5a), further suggesting a functional impairment of intratumoural CD8+ T cells rather than reduced trafficking. Neoadjuvant-treated tumours of non-responders had a significantly higher overall expression of PD-1 (P = 0.03; Fig. 5b). Gene Ontology (GO) gene pathway analysis of neoadjuvant-treated tumour of responders demonstrated upregulation of antitumoural immune-related pathways (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 6), such as T cell activation (GO:0042110; FDR = 0.001), and negative regulation of IL-6 production (GO:0032729; FDR = 0.03). By contrast, non-responders upregulated immunosuppressive pathways, such as IL-10 production (GO:0032733; FDR = 0.03) and wound healing (GO:0042060; FDR < 0.01). NanoString nCounter PanCancer immune profiling demonstrated upregulation of IFNα and IFNβ (IFN-I) signalling in the tumours of neoadjuvant-treated non-responders (Fig. 5d–f). This finding, echoing the results of our in vitro neuron-cancer co-culture (Fig. 2j), might initially seem counterintuitive as IFN-I signalling has been associated with a favourable response to immunotherapy. However, while acute IFN-I signalling promotes antitumoural immunity, chronic IFN-I signalling can result in immunosuppression as a negative feedback loop, leading to immunotherapy resistance50.

IL-6 and IFN-I are well-established critical mediators of neuroinflammation in both the central and PNSs51,52. IL-6 consistently showed a strong link to CINI across our experiments. IFN-I demonstrated a connection to CINI in several of our tests and, crucially, was associated with resistance to anti-PD-1 in our clinical trial tumour samples. On the basis of these findings, we investigated whether blocking IFN-I or IL-6 signalling in a CINI model could enhance anti-PD-1 efficacy. First, we used an IFNα receptor subunit 1 knockout (Ifnar1-KO) mouse model53. Seventeen days after inoculating UVSCC-M4 cells into Ifnar1-KO and WT (C57 black) mice, the mice underwent injection of a demyelinating agent (ethidium bromide, EtBr) into the tumour–normal skin interface versus a sham PBS injection to the same location. Anti-PD-1 or IgG control treatment was initiated 2 days after the sham/EtBr injection. In the setting of demyelination and anti-PD-1 therapy, the WT EtBr mice had the poorest tumour control, with tumours significantly larger than both the WT sham and Ifnar1-KO EtBr groups (P < 0.01 for both; Fig. 5g,h). By contrast, Ifnar1-KO mice were unaffected by demyelination, as Ifnar1-KO sham, Ifnar1-KO EtBr and WT sham mice had similar tumour sizes after anti-PD-1 therapy (Fig. 5g–i). The addition of STING agonists, which promote IFN-I signalling, did not improve anti-PD-1 efficacy. As there was no correlation between the tumour size based on imaging with the pathological response to treatment in the neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 cSCC clinical trials (51% pathological complete response, CR, rate versus only 6% of radiological CR)20, histological cancer cell viability was assessed for each collected tumour. On the basis of cancer viability, demyelination adversely affected anti-PD-1 efficacy in WT mice (Fig. 5j; P < 0.01). Despite the significant difference in tumour size, the differences in tumour viability between demyelinated Ifnar1-KO and WT mice treated with anti-PD-1 did not reach statistical significance.

Next, we tested the effect of IL-6 signalling blockade on anti-PD-1 efficacy. One week after the inoculation of B610K cSCC cells, immunocompetent SKH1-Hrhr mice underwent either EtBr injection into the tumour–normal skin interface or a sham PBS injection, followed by initiation of anti-PD-1 treatment 2 days later (Fig. 5k). In this model, we allowed the priming of immune cells against the tumour54 by administering the first two anti-PD-1 doses alone. Subsequent anti-PD-1 doses were given alone or in combination with antibodies blocking the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). The addition of anti-IL-6R antibodies to anti-PD-1 did not reduce the tumour size in a statistically significant manner (Fig. 5l). However, similar to the efficacy results of the clinical trial, there was a difference in tumour viability. Compared with anti-PD-1 monotherapy, the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-IL-6R significantly reduced tumour viability among mice with demyelination (P < 0.001; Fig. 5m). The anti-IL-6R reduction in tumour viability did not occur in mice without demyelination, supporting the hypothesis that IL-6 activity in the tumours was not due to an inherent IL-6 secretion from the tumour cells themselves but, rather, the result of an inflammatory response driven by CINI.

Although the role of the nervous system as an immune regulator has gained recognition in recent years12,55, little is known about the PNS effect on antitumoural immunity. Our data, based on rigorous and extensive experiments such as multiomics analysis of patient cohorts with multiple PNI-associated cancer types, in vitro assays of different cell lines (including neurons from both mice and humans) and in vivo models using different mice (including genetically modified mice), has consistently suggested that CINI confers resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. We proposed a mechanism driving this effect. Cancer cells cause myelin degradation in nerves, as evident by myelin structural changes and abnormal nerve electrical conduction studies. The myelin degradation results in nerve injury. ATF3, a response gene for neuronal injury, mediates intraneuronal injury signalling that leads to upregulation of IFN-I and IL-6 pathways. The immune response, which was directly initiated by the neurons, attracted immune cells into the perineural niche to regenerate the injured nerves36. As the tumour progresses, it expands to nearby nerves and causes more CINI, which in turn increases the injured neurons' inflammatory signalling, turning it into a chronic process. Chronic infiltration of pro-healing suppressive immune cells into the perineural niches eventually affects the general immune tone in the TME, dampening overall antitumoural immunity and response to anti-PD-1. Targeting different steps in the CINI pathway, including Atf3-cKO, Ifnar1-KO or antibodies blocking IL-6 signalling, reversed immunosuppression and restored anti-PD-1 efficacy.

Our findings suggest that the observed reduction in neuron viability and signalling is specifically associated with the process of CINI/PNI rather than a general cancer-induced effect, highlighting the importance of cancer cell invasive behaviour. This effect may represent an initial phase of cancer–nerve interaction, with the potential for surviving or regenerated neurons to contribute to cancer growth over time. Our co-culture system mimicked the conditions of active PNI, providing insights into direct cancer–neuron interactions.

In conclusion, our findings suggest an anti-PD-1 resistance mechanism mediated by CINI and its associated chronic inflammation. These findings might also serve as a basis for identifying biomarkers and the development of therapeutic agents that might overcome anti-PD-1 resistance in patients with multiple cancer types.

The clinical trials protocol, statistical analysis plan, and institutional review board approvals were previously reported19,20. In brief, the trials were conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent. The authors had unrestricted access to the data and were responsible for all content. Patients older than 18 were eligible if they had resectable stage II–IV (M0) CSCC, for which primary surgery would be recommended in routine clinical practice. Patients with stage II CSCC should have a primary tumour ≥3 cm in longest diameter to be eligible. Patients were additionally required to have adequate organ function (determined by assessment of complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic function), at least one measurable lesion on the basis of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)57 and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. After a screening period of up to 28 days, the patients received the neoadjuvant cemiplimab (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals) 350 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or withdrawal of consent. Imaging assessments were performed at the baseline and at weeks 6 and 12. After completion of neoadjuvant treatment, the protocol window for surgery was study days 75–100. If the patient met the criteria for early discontinuation of cemiplimab during the neoadjuvant period, the treating physician could divert the patient to surgery earlier. Pretreatment biopsy specimens were subjected to histopathological assessment for confirmation of diagnosis and to permit morphologic comparison between tumour tissue before treatment and any residual tumour following therapy. Pathologic response was assessed in the post-treatment surgical specimens according to standard pathologic evaluation recommendations58 and re-reviewed by a dedicated dermatopathologist (P.N.) to standardize reporting. The primary end point was pathologic complete response, defined as the absence of viable tumour in post-treatment surgical specimens, determined on the basis of independent central pathology review. Major pathologic response was a secondary end point defined by the presence of >0% but ≤10% viable tumour cells in post-treatment surgical specimens. The definitions specified for major pathologic response and pathologic complete response were in accordance with the immune-related pathologic response criteria59. Further clinical information regarding the trial patients is provided in Fig. 1b. The allocation of the trial patient tumour samples into different analyses is described in Extended Data Fig. 1.

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using 4-μm-thick formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cSCC tissue samples obtained before and after anti-PD-1 therapy. Staining was performed using antibodies against CD8 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MS-457s), PD-1 (Abcam, ab137132) and PD-L1 (Cell Signaling Technology, 13684S) using a BOND-RX instrument with a Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (Leica Biosystems, DS9800). Stained slides were scanned and digitalized using a Scan Scope XT system (Aperio/Leica Biosystems). Single-stain annotations were performed by a pathologist, and staining quantification was done using HALO software (v.2.3.2089.70; Indica Labs). The number of marker-positive cells was calculated and expressed as positive-cell density (number of positive cells per mm2). Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-tests using Prism (v.9). P < 0.05 was considered to be significant.

We used the Lunaphore Comet to stain and image the FFPE tissue samples. In brief, FFPE slides were placed in tanks containing BioGenex EZ Elegans AR 2 buffer, enclosed inside a BioGenex EZ Retriever microwave system. The samples were heated in the microwave to 107 °C for 15 min to dewax, rehydrate and retrieve the antigens. After heating, the slides were cooled to room temperature, loaded into the Comet system, and covered and sealed by a fast-fluidic exchange microfluidics chip for staining and imaging in the instrument. The Comet system performs a sequential IF-based staining and imaging followed by an elution of the primary and secondary antibodies. Optimal staining conditions for each antibody panel were determined using the ‘Characterization Part 2' instrument protocol, in which antibodies are titrated for optimal signal and the elution efficiency is verified by an iterative procedure comprised of staining, imaging, elution and re-imaging for elution confirmation for all antibodies. This study used four mIF panels, described in Supplementary Table 10 (neuroimmune panel 1; myelin degradation panel; neuroimmune panel 2; and neuroimmune panel 3) for patient-derived tissues. Two panels (m-neuroimmune panel; and m-myelin degradation panel) were used for mouse-derived tissues (Supplementary Table 10). The Comet collected images in OME-Tiff formats, which were scanned and then visualized in Comet Viewer (Lunaphore). Image analysis was performed using Oncotopix Discovery (Visiopharm, v.2023.01)60,61. A deep learning classifier was trained using specific tissue features from annotated reference images to guide the identification of ROIs. In brief, a tissue ROI was created after training two variables (tissue and non-tissue regions). Tissue and ROI boundaries were then delineated using image analysis smoothing. Aberrant signals, such as those caused by dust particles, tissue folds or air bubbles, were excluded manually from the ROIs. Another deep learner classifier was developed and trained for nerve identification following two training variables (nerve and non-nerve structure) within the delineated tissue ROI regions. Staining for the nerve markers NFH and B3T delineated the nerve within the tissue ROIs. The following training parameters were used to develop the nerve identification app: input: NFH and B3T; learning parameters: learning rate-1.0e-05; Mini-batch size-2; loss function: cross-entropy; iteration: 300,000. Cells in non-nerve areas (NFH−B3T−) were identified by watershed desegmentation of the nuclear DAPI signal and removal of incomplete nuclei by size exclusion. The resulting nuclear mask was enlarged by 1.25 μm (5 pixels) to capture nuclear and adjacent cytoplasmic fluorescence signals. A further estimation of the cytoplasm was generated using a dilation of the nuclear mask to a maximum of 3.75 μm (15 pixels). Cell types were identified using a hierarchical decision tree with empirically determined thresholds visually verified across the tissues. NFH+B3T+ nerves were segmented using the NFH/B3T signal intensity. Nerve nuclei were excluded a priori from the initial cell classification strategy, and only those that exceeded the threshold for NFH+B3T+ levels were incorporated into the nerve mask. Neural niches were determined to have a 150-μm ROI diameter around each nerve (NFH+B3T+). All object-based phenotyping resulting tables were exported as CSV files for downstream analyses. Staining was performed 4–8 min per cycle for primary antibodies, diluted 1:50–1:2000 in a Multistaining Buffer (Lunaphore). Secondary antibodies, AlexaFluor 555 and AlexaFluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were diluted 1:200 and 1:400, respectively, in a multistaining buffer. Tissues were counterstained with DAPI solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at every cycle. Imaging was performed on the Comet at 80 ms for DAPI, 400 ms for AlexaFluor 555, and 200 ms for AlexaFluor 647 at each cycle. Elution was performed for 4 min using an elution buffer (Lunaphore).

cSCC anti-PD-1 clinical trial FFPE tumour samples were used for DSP of the neural and immune protein expression (see below the description of assays and markers used). First, we mapped the neural niches using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections, including the tumour and surrounding tissue. These slides were scanned using a Scan Scope digital pathology system (Aperio) in SVS format at a 40× magnification and visualized using Image Scope software (Aperio). All nerve profiles in the specimen were annotated, including PNI. The extent of viable tumour or tumour bed and uninvolved tissue was drawn or designated on whole-slide scans. The respective tumour and surrounding tissue were obtained using the annotations in Aperio files. The nerve density was calculated as the ratio between total number of nerves and the tumour or normal area (mm2), and the nerve invasion index was calculated as the number of invaded nerves divided by the tumour area (mm2).

Next, two consecutive 5-μm-thick tissue sections from samples obtained before and after anti-PD-1 therapy were stained according to the semiautomated GeoMx DSP standard protein protocol62 using the BOND-RX system to profile TANs and their perineural microenvironments (neural niches). Both sections were stained for the following morphology biomarkers: panCK, SYTO 13 (GeoMx Solid Tumour TME Morphology Kit, NanoString, 121300301), β-III-tubulin (EP1569Y, AF, Abcam, ab52623; 1:2,000 mg ml−1) and neurofilament (EPR20020, AF, Abcam, ab207176; 1:1,000 mg ml−1; Extended Data Fig. 6). Optimization of IF biomarkers was previously performed with different antibody dilutions using normal colon tissue to achieve the highest signal-to-noise ratio. One tumour section was used to profile TANs with the DSP neural cell profiling core (GMX-PROCO-NCT-HNCP-12) and GeoMx Parkinson's pathology panel (GMX-PROMOD-NCT-HPDP-12). A serial tissue section was used to profile the perineural microenvironment with the following DSP human immuno-oncology protein core panel and modules: GeoMx Immune Cell Profiling (121300101), GeoMx IO Drug Target Assay (121300102), GeoMx Immune Activation Status Assay (121300103) and GeoMx Immune Cell Typing Assay (121300104; 49 protein targets). The full list of targets is described in Supplementary Table 10.

After scanning using the GeoMx DSP device, mIF imaging slides were visualized with the adjustment of channel thresholds for each fluorophore. ROIs were selected after pathological evaluation of sequential sections of H&E-stained nerve fibres in tumour tissue and tumour bed tissue identified by an expert pathologist (P.N.). Using a two-step strategy, a polygon and rectangle selection tool was applied to select ROIs of up to 660 × 785 mm. (1) Nerve profiling: a slide labelled with a DSP neuroprotein panel was used to select up to 12 intratumoural ROIs containing tumour-associated nerve fibres. Neural niches were identified and segmented using the β-III-tubulin (+), Neurofilament Heavy (NF-H) (+) and panCK (−) phenotype. (2) Perineural niche immune profiling: a consecutive section labelled with a DSP human immuno-oncology protein panel was used to select up to 12 matching ROIs with TANs. The matching perineural microenvironment compartment, that is, neural niches, were identified using the same morphology markers (β-III-tubulin (+), neurofilament heavy (NF-H) (+) and panCK (−) phenotype). Segmented areas (also known as areas of illumination) were illuminated individually using ultraviolet light with the GeoMx DSP device. Oligonucleotide tags conjugated with antibodies present within each area of illumination were photocleaved. Released tags were quantified using nCounter, and tag counts of the various markers were mapped back to their corresponding tissue locations, yielding a spatially resolved digital profile of analyte abundance. Digital counts were normalized using background correction. DSP data analysis software was used to visualize protein expression patterns and perform statistical analysis62. These data are available in Supplementary Table 8.

Nucleic acid extraction, library preparation and sequencing: DNA/RNA extraction was performed using the Mag-Bind FFPE DNA/RNA 96 Kit (Omega Bio-Tek) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Isolated RNA sample quality was assessed using the High Sensitivity RNA Tapestation (Agilent Technologies) and quantified by Qubit 2.0 RNA HS assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Libraries were constructed with KAPA RNA HyperPrep with RiboErase (Roche) and performed based on the manufacturer's recommendations. The final library quantity was measured by KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR, and library quality was evaluated by TapeStation D1000 ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies). The final library size was about 430 bp with an insert size of about 200 bp. Illumina 8-nucleotide dual-indices were used. Equimolar pooling of libraries was performed based on quality-control values and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq system (Illumina) with a read length configuration of 150 PE for 80 million paired-end reads per sample (40 million in each direction). Extracted genomic DNA was then quantified using the Qubit 2.0 DNA HS Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the quality was assessed using the Tapestation genomic DNA Assay (Agilent Technologies). Library preparation was performed using SureSelectXT Low Input Reagent Kits (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Exome capture was performed with IDT xGen Exome Research Panel v2.0. Library quality and quantity were assessed using the Qubit 2.0 DNA HS Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Tapestation High Sensitivity D1000 Assay (Agilent Technologies) and QuantStudio 5 System (Applied Biosystems). Illumina 8-nucleotide dual-indices were used. Equimolar pooling of libraries was performed based on quality-control values and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq (Illumina) system with a read length configuration of 150 PE for 130 million paired-end reads (65 million in each direction) or 26 million paired-end reads (13 million in each direction). RNA-seq data processing and analysis: raw paired-end reads in FASTQ format were checked for read quality using FastQC (v.0.11.8; http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Illumina TruSeq adapters were trimmed from the paired-end reads using cutadapt (v.1.18). The trimmed reads were aligned to the GENCODE human reference genome GRCh38 using STAR software (v.2.7.0f). FeatureCounts (subread 1.6.3) was applied to count reads mapped to each gene. Genes were annotated using the gene transfer format file for GRCh38. Read counts were normalized using the trimmed mean of M method implemented in the R Bioconductor package edgeR to determine the abundance of each gene. The generalized linear model likelihood ratio test from edgeR was used to identify DEGs between groups. The Benjamini–Hochberg correction method was applied to the P values for multiple testing adjustments. These data have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession umber GSE289743.

The PNI signature was based on an independent and previously published gene expression signature associated with PNI in cSCC of the head and neck30. The initial dataset consisted of DEGs from tumours lacking PNI compared with those exhibiting incidental PNI, identified solely through histopathological evaluation (n = 2,412). The second dataset included DEGs from tumours with no PNI versus those with clinical PNI, detected using imaging techniques (n = 7,793). To curate a gene list that captures the molecular features associated with any form of PNI (both incidental and clinical), we focused on DEGs that were upregulated in both datasets. Further refinement involved excluding genes exhibiting a fold change < 2 and a FDR > 0.001 across both comparisons (no PNI versus incidental PNI and no PNI versus clinical PNI). In our analysis, DEGs represented by multiple microarray probes were excluded if one or more probes failed to satisfy our inclusion criteria. Specifically, cases in which one probe suggested significant upregulation of a gene in PNI-positive cases, while another indicated either downregulation in PNI or no significant difference, were not considered. Ultimately, the final gene set consisted of 46 genes enriched in PNI-positive cases of cSCC of the head and neck (Supplementary Table 1).

This 46-gene PNI/nerve injury signature was first tested on our anti-PD-1 neoadjuvant cSCC clinical trial bulk RNA-seq data using GSEA. GSEA was conducted to investigate the enrichment the signature in the pretreatment trial tumour samples performing 1,000 permutations63. GSEA calculates an enrichment score (ES) for gene sets by ranking genes based on their overrepresentation in two groups. A positive ES indicates enrichment in one group, while a negative ES indicates enrichment in the other. The ES is normalized to a NES to enable comparisons. We considered the gene sets to be significantly enriched at a threshold of P < 0.05. We did not apply corrections for multiple-hypothesis testing in this case, as only a single gene signature was assessed. The 46-gene PNI/nerve injury signature was later validated in external, publicly available cohorts of patients who had PNI-associated tumours and were treated with anti-PD-1 therapy. The bulk RNA-seq data of three patient cohorts were available (two melanoma32,33 and one gastric cancer34; Supplementary Table 2):

Reference 33: this study included 88 patients with metastatic melanoma, receiving either nivolumab (n = 39) or pembrolizumab (n = 49). The response rates were as follows: complete response (CR) = 14 (15.9%), partial response (PR) = 27 (30.7%), and progressive disease (PD) = 47 (53.4%). For GSEA, patients with CR and PR were classified as responders (n = 41, 46.6%), while those with PD were categorized as non-responders (n = 47, 53.4%).

Reference 32: this study evaluated 41 samples from patients treated with nivolumab (n = 9) or pembrolizumab (n = 32). The response distribution was: CR = 4 (9.7%), PR = 15 (36.6%), stable disease (SD) = 6 (14.6%) and PD = 16 (39%). In GSEA analysis, the CR and PR patients were grouped as responders (n = 19, 46.3%), while SD and PD patients were grouped as non-responders (n = 22, 53.7%).

Reference 34: this study comprised 45 patients with metastatic gastric cancer who received pembrolizumab as salvage therapy, with available RNA-seq data. Patients were treated with pembrolizumab in second-line or third-line settings for metastatic disease. The response rates recorded were: CR = 3 (6.6%), PR = 9 (20%), SD = 15 (33.3%) and PD = 18 (40%). For GSEA, those with CR and PR were considered responders (n = 12, 26.7%), while patients with SD and PD were classified as non-responders (n = 33, 73.3%).

RNA was isolated from FFPE tumour sections by dewaxing using a deparaffinization solution (QIAGEN), and total RNA was extracted using the RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA purity and quantity were assessed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For a NanoString assay, 100 ng of RNA was used to detect immune gene expression using a nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel along with a custom CodeSet (NanoString). Counts of the reporter probes were tabulated for each sample using a nCounter Digital Analyzer, and raw data output was imported into the nSolver software program (v.4.0; NanoString). Moreover, the nSolver (Advanced Analysis 2.0) data analysis package was used for the normalization of expression levels, cell type and differential gene expression analyses. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed with Qlucore Omics Explorer software (v.3.7). Data were plotted using Prism software (v.9; GraphPad Software) and two-tailed Mann–Whitney U-tests were performed to compare groups. P < 0.05 was considered to be significant. These data are provided in Supplementary Table 9.

Non-trial original clinical cohorts were used in this Article: (1) 32 treatment-naive patients with stage I–II cSCC whose tumours were excised at MDACC (The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center) before February 2023. The archived tumour samples were used for the construction of an 86-core tissue microarray (TMA). The TMA was used to characterize immune infiltration in perineural niches using mIF. (2) 187 treatment-naive patients with stage I–II PDAC whose tumours were resected at MDACC between 2004 to 2015. Archived tumours from these patients were used for the construction of another TMA, as described before64. This TMA was also used to characterize immune infiltration in perineural niches using mIF as a means of external validation. (3) 11 treatment-naive patients with stage I–II cSCC whose primary tumours were excised by Mohs surgery at MDACC between 2020 and 2022 (Supplementary Table 4). Their fresh-frozen collected tumours were used for spatial transcriptomic analysis. (4) 7 treatment-naive patients with PDAC whose tumours were resected at Massachusetts General Hospital, provided to this study by W. Hwang. This cohort has been described previously45. In brief, these patients with locally advanced PDAC underwent surgical resection of the primary tumour with or without previous neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The tumours were FFPE.

Fresh-frozen collected and FFPE archived cSCC primary tumours were used to demonstrate the spatial relationship between nerve injury and different immune phenotypes. The tumours were prepared for sequencing according to the manufacturer's instructions (10x Genomics, Visium Spatial) using the following kits: Visium Spatial Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagent Kit, 4 slides PN-1000193; Visium Gateway Tissue Optimization Slide & Reagent Kits, 1 slide (PN-1000313, PN-1000314); Visium Accessory Kit, PN-1000194. The prepared libraries were pooled and sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) system, generating ~40 million 2 × 150 base paired-end reads per sample. The raw spatial sequencing data were processed in the Space Ranger workflow (https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/choosing-how-to-run).

The spaceranger (v.1.3.0) mkfastq pipeline was used to convert Illumina sequencer's binary base call (BCL) files into FASTQ format. The samples were then run through the spaceranger count pipeline, which performs alignment, tissue detection, fiducial detection and barcode/unique molecular identifier counting. The RNA-seq aligner STAR was used as the samples were fresh-frozen. Reference-sequence alignment of human samples was performed using the GRCh38 Reference 2020-A (23 June 2020). Images were processed using Fiji to divide them into individual capture areas and then rotated to align the fiducial spot patterns65. The pipeline uses Visium spatial barcodes to generate feature-spot matrices, determine clusters and perform gene expression analysis. Functions in the R package Seurat (v.4.1.1) were used for downstream analysis66. Spots that did not overlap with the tissue sections or had ≥20% mitochondrial reads (10% for humanized mouse) or had <200/500 detected genes were removed from the downstream expression analysis. Expression counts were normalized using Seurat's NormalizeData. The 3,000 most variable genes were identified using the FindVariableFeatures function. The normalized expression data were further scaled to mean 0 and variance 1 using the function ScaleData. RunPCA and RunUMAP were used for dimensionality reduction. Sample batch effect correction was performed using RunHarmony. Clustering was done using the functions FindNeighbors and FindClusters. We performed transcriptional phenotyping for each sequenced tissue section based on the molecular characteristics of TANs and tumour immune infiltrate using gene signatures obtained from the literature67. Nerves were scored according to the CINI signature that included the following genes: TAGAP, KCNJ8, COL1A1, PECAM1, TMEM119, ATF3, JUN, KLF6, NOCT, LMO7, CSF1, ENTPD1, UCHL1, PINK1, BHLHE41, ITGAM, CHL1, SNCA, SCPEP1 and VEGFA. The immune infiltrate was scored according to two signatures: antitumoural immunity (CD8A, PRF1, GZMB, IL12A, IFNG, IRF8, CD86, NOS2, TNF and IL2) and immunosuppression (IDO1, CTLA4, FOXP3, IL10, IL6, CD163, MSR1, MRC1, PDCD1, PDCD1LG2 and CD274) signatures. The gene signature scores were calculated for all spots using the Seurat AddModuleScore function68. Spatial feature expression plots were generated using the SpatialFeaturePlot function. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test was used to assess the significance of the group difference. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the magnitude of the association between the CINI and the immune signatures. These data have been deposited in the NCBI GEO under accession number GSE289745.

Nanostring CosMx spatial molecular imaging (MDACC-external PDAC cohort): this spatial molecular imaging analysis was conducted on human PDAC primary tumours provided by W. Hwang (see above for a description of the clinical cohort). FFPE tissue sections (5 µm) were prepared and mounted onto Superfrost Plus Micro Slides (VWR) under RNase-free conditions. The samples underwent deparaffinization, proteinase K digestion and heat-induced epitope retrieval using the Leica Bond RX system. After preparation, Nanostring CosMx spatial transcriptomics imaging was performed on the sections. TANs were categorized into three groups based on ATF3 or JUN expression (healthy: no ATF3 or JUN expression; intermediated: ATF3 or JUN expression; injured: ATF3 and JUN concomitant expression). Perineural niches were defined as regions within 150 μm of TANs in the TME. RNA in situ hybridization probes targeting a 960-plex base panel, along with 30 additional custom-selected probes, were hybridized overnight at 37 °C. After hybridization, the samples were washed and blocked and protein staining was performed using a fluorophore-conjugated antibody cocktail targeting CD298, B2M, PanCK, CD45 and CD3 proteins, along with DAPI for nuclear staining. Data acquisition and image processing were conducted using an in-house spatial molecular imaging data-processing pipeline45. z-stack images were collected, and cell segmentation was performed using Cellpose (v.2.0.5), with robustness evaluated through comparison to Baysor (v.0.6.0). Transcripts were assigned to individual cells based on location and cell segmentation boundaries. Expression profiles for individual cells were normalized and log-transformed. Cell types were annotated using Insitutype (v.1.0.0) based on protein and RNA expression profiles, with malignant and nonmalignant cells identified using PanCK expression and cytokeratin RNA markers. Batch correction across tissue slides was performed using ComBat (sva, v.3.46.0). These data have been deposited in the NCBI GEO under accession number GSE199102.

The different cell types used for in vitro assays in this study, along with the figure panel presenting the results of their relevant analysis, are summarized in Supplementary Table 10. For in vitro experiments in which there were replicate samples, we repeated the experiments at least three times to confirm the findings.

Human neurons used in this study were obtained from human donors or were derived from commercially available human iPS (hiPS) cells. RealDRG cryopreserved hPS-cell-derived sensory neurons (nociceptors). Using the Senso-DM directed differentiation process on internal hiPS cell lines, we can generate billions of neurons at scale and at 99% purity—without the need for mitotic inhibitors. Principal component analysis shows that RealDRG neurons mature in the shortest time and are closer to primary human DRG tissue compared with other hiPS-cell-derived sensory neurons (https://www.anatomic.com/realdrg). Donors provided written informed consent to donate tissue samples for the study, for which the protocol was reviewed and approved by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board. In brief, each donor was undergoing surgical treatment that necessitated ligation of spinal nerve roots to facilitate tumour resection or spinal reconstruction. Spinal roots were ligated proximal to the DRG, spinal roots were sharply cut both proximal and distal to the DRG and excised DRGs were transferred immediately into a cold (∼4 °C) and sterile balanced salt solution containing nutrients. DRGs were transported to the laboratory on ice in a sterile, sealed 50 ml centrifuge tube. After arrival at the laboratory, each ganglion was carefully dissected from the surrounding connective tissues and sectioned into several 1–2 mm pieces, digested in 2 ml of a mixed enzyme solution (0.1% trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, T9201), 0.1% collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, C1764; w/v, final concentration) and 0.01% DNase (Sigma-Aldrich, D5025) diluted in DMEM/F-12), and transferred to a 37 °C rotator to shake at a speed of 124–128 rpm. Every 20 min, tissue fragments were allowed to settle, and the supernatant/dissociated cells were collected and transferred to DMEM/F-12 with an enzyme inhibitor. The supernatant was replaced with 2 ml of fresh digestion solution. The tissue was returned to the 37 °C rotator, and this process was repeated until tissue fragments were completely digested. Dissociated cells were centrifuged at 180 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and the cells were gently resuspended in culture medium with DMEM/F-12 supplemented with EV-free 10% serum and 2 mM glutamine. Cells were plated onto laminin-coated µ-Slide 8 Well (Ibidi) and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24–72 h. hIPS-cell-derived motor (RealMOTO) and sensory neurons (RealDRG) were purchased from Anatomic.

Primary sensory neurons were isolated from the TG dissected from 6–8-week-old mice as previously described69. After TG dissection, tissue was enzymatically digested with papain (40 U ml−1, EMD Millipore) for 20 min at 37 °C followed by 20 min of digestion with collagenase II (4 mg ml−1)/dispase II (4.6 mg ml−1) solution. Using the Percoll gradient, comprising 12.5% and 28% Percoll in complete L-15 medium (L-15 with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin–streptomycin, HEPES), we separated the myelin and nerve debris from trigeminal neurons. Neurons were labelled with NeuroFluor NeuO (01801) membrane-permeable fluorescent probe for detecting live neurons according to the manufacturer's protocol (StemCell Technologies) and sorted by flow cytometry using the LSR II flow cytometer running FACSDiva 8.0 software and FACSAria (all BD Biosciences).

The co-culture system using neurons and cancer cells is based on a technique initially described for prostate cancer cells70 and modified by our group12. Neurons were prepared as described previously12 and cocultured with cancer cells or normal keratinocytes. Human neurons were co-cultured with the human cSCC IC8 cell line (obtained from the laboratory of I.L. and C.H.37, or with the human epidermal keratinocyte HEK cells (ATCC, PCS-200-011). Mouse neurons were co-cultured with the mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma MOC1 cell line (Sigma-Aldrich, scc469) and B6-10K (obtained from the laboratory of K.Y.T.). Sensory or motor neurons were cultured to assess the impact of nerves' degenerative/regenerative status on immunotherapy in vitro. Neurons were plated on laminin-coated (Life Technologies, 23017015) round glass coverslips set in 12-well plates. Then, 2 h after plating, the wells were flooded with 1 ml of warm (37 °C) Ham's F12 culture medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% EV-depleted fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. The carcinoma cells were plated (1:10 neuron: cancer cells ratio), and cultures were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% EV-depleted fetal bovine serum in 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubation conditions, for 72 h, with or without anti-PD-1 antibody (cemiplimab, 1,000 μg ml−1, or RMP1-14, 100 μg ml−1, InVivoMAb Antibodies, BioXCell, for human and mouse, respectively), before neuron sorting and RNA extraction.

TG neurons were obtained from C57BL/6J mice (n = 8), processed using the above protocol, seeded to 12-well culture plates (3 × 105 total cells per well) and cultured for 72 h. The cultured neurons were then divided into four experimental groups (two wells per group) in which each group was exposed to different culture conditions for an additional 72 h. The first group (control) received no medium change; the second group received fresh medium (20% FBS in Ham's 12 + penicillin–streptomycin + 1% vitamin); the third group received conditioned medium from the MOC1 mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line previously cultured (10 × 103 seeded cells in 20% FBS in Ham's 12 + penicillin–streptomycin + 1% vitamin) for 3 days. The fourth group of neurons was co-cultured with the MOC1 (10 × 103) cells. After 72 h of exposure, neurons were collected by trypsinization, medium was added (F-15 + 30% FBS) and then live neuro cells were stained with NeuO (membrane-permeable fluorescent dye) dye for 1 h and washed. NeuO-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry using the CytoFLEX SRT Cell Sorter. RealDRG cryopreserved hPS-cell-derived sensory neurons were obtained from Anatomic. RealDRG neurons were seeded on 0.01% poly-l-ornithine-coated (Millipore Sigma, A-004-C) µ-slide 8-well ibidi plates (80827) at a density of 0.15 × 105 total cells per well. The poly-l-ornithine coating was performed overnight at room temperature in the tissue culture hood, followed by three washes with sterile water. Subsequently, iMatrix-511 silk (Takara, T304) diluted 1:50 in Dulbecco's PBS (dPBS) was added as a secondary coating and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h after washing off the poly-l-ornithine. The RealDRG cells were cultured for 10 days to allow for maturation, with half of the Senso MM medium (Anatomic) being replaced every alternate day. After the initial 10-day culture period, the neurons were divided into four experimental groups (two wells per group) and exposed to different culture conditions for an additional 4 days (96 h), aligning with the timeline in the provided PDF. The experimental groups were as follows: fresh medium: cells received fresh Senso MM medium (Anatomic). No medium change: cells were cultured for the entire 14-day period without any medium change. Conditioned medium: cells received conditioned media from B16-F10 (melanoma) and Mia PaCa2 (PDMC) cells. To obtain conditioned medium, B16-F10 and Mia PaCa2 cells were seeded at 10 × 103 cells in Senso MM medium and cultured for 24 h. The medium was then replaced, and the supernatant was collected after another 24 h, filtered with a 0.22 µm filter and stored at 4 °C. This process was repeated, and the two collections were mixed at a 1:1 ratio. Co-culture: cells were co-cultured with 2 × 103 seeded B16-F10 (melanoma) and Mia PaCa2 (PDMC) cells.

After the 4-day exposure period, the mature neurons from µ-slide 8-well ibidi plates were fixed with 4% buffered formalin. Neurons were then stained with NFH antibody (ab4680, Abcam) followed by a secondary Texas Red-conjugated antibody. Images were acquired using the Cytation 7 imaging reader.

Cell counts and neurite morphology were assessed using the neurite outgrowth module of the Gen5 Cytation 7 software. The experiment included four conditions (fresh medium, no medium change, conditioned medium and co-culture), with two wells per condition.

rDRGs were plated in duplicate wells in an 8-well Ibidi plate and assigned to one of four conditions: (1) fresh medium; (2) no medium change; (3) conditioned medium; or (4) direct co-culture with either B16-F10 or Mia PaCa-2 cells. Cell viability was confirmed using NeuO staining in the GFP channel before fixation. Cells were then fixed and stained with neurofilament heavy chain (NFH, Texas Red channel) to assess neuronal morphology and with DAPI to label nuclei. Using a ×20 magnification, multichannel fluorescence images were taken as a 12 × 12 image montage from the centre of each well in an 8-well Ibidi plate. The Agilent BioTek Cytation 5 cell imaging multimode reader was used for all image acquisition. A minimum of ten ROIs per condition was selected based on consistent cell density. ROIs were excluded if they exhibited low cell density or imaging artifacts. Morphological analysis and thresholding for the selection of neurons and assessment of neuronal morphology were completed using the neurite outgrowth module in Gen5 Cytation 7 software. We assessed neurite length and thickness across the four conditions, with two wells per condition. The Gen5 neurite outgrowth module analysis automatically provides results for both image-level metrics, such as total outgrowth length per image and cell-level average values, like the per-cell average neurite length. Default thresholding for soma selection was applied to exclude weak NFH signal in the TexasRed channel, and neurons were selected and distinguished from cancer cells by using the ‘optimize soma using nuclear signal' setting for DAPI staining and by selecting for cells with NFH+ protrusions extending more than 20 µm from the cell, which represent neurites (dendrites and axons). ‘Only keep neurites connected to a soma', ‘Discard short neurites' and ‘Discard short ending branches' were selected in the ‘Neurite' settings window, with short neurites under 20 µm excluded and short ending branches under 5 µm excluded to ensure that only the true intact neurite signal was studied. From these 8–10 final ROIs, we exported morphology data from the manually programmed neurite outgrowth module. The metrics reported from each ROI were the average neurite length (µm) and the average neurite thickness (calculated as NFH+ area divided by neurite length in µm).

The 24-well CytoView MEA plate (Axion, M384-tMEA-24W) electrodes were prepared for culturing realDRG according to the Anatomic protocol (https://www.anatomic.com/_files/ugd/a239f4_97800271c1964458aa21c9a9008849a3.pdf). In brief, around 7 ml cell-culture-grade water with penicillin–streptomycin was added to the outer rim of the plate. Then, electrodes were coated with 50 μl per well of 0.01% PLO for 1 h at room temperature. PLO was washed off four times with 500 μl cell-culture-grade water, ensuring complete removal between washes. Then, 50 μl of iMatrix-511 SILK (Takara, T304) diluted 1:50 in dPBS per well was added as a secondary coating and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The human realDRG cells were quickly thawed in a water bath, collected in fresh F12 medium (20% FBS, 1% penicillin–streptomycin), centrifuged at 300 rpm for 4 min and resuspended in Senso MM media (Anatomic). The realDRGs were plated at 20,000 and 50,000 cells per well. Basal spontaneous firing rate of iPS-cell-derived sensory neurons assessed by MEA. After 10 days in normal culture, mature, firing neurons were cultured for 6 days under control conditions, stressed conditions (no medium exchange), in MOC1 conditioned medium or in MOC1-co-culture. Spontaneous firing rates were recorded at the baseline, 24 and 72 h. The mean firing rate of iPS-cell-derived sensory neurons co-cultured with MIA PaCa-2 cells (20,000 or 50,000 cells per well) over 5 days was measured by MEA. RealDRGs were plated at 20,000 and 50,000 cells per well on 24-well CytoView MEA plates, with medium changes every 48 h. After 8–9 days in culture, mature neurons started firing spontaneously and, at day 10, all neurons established stable spontaneous activity. After 10 days in normal culture, mature firing neurons were cultured for 6 days under control conditions, stressed conditions (no medium exchange), in Mia-PaCa2-conditioned medium or in Mia-PaCa2 co-culture. The spontaneous functional activity of the realDRGs was recorded for a minimum of 10 min and every 24 h for 6 days (days 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. Error bars in the figures represent the s.e.m. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple -comparisons test was used to determine statistical significance between groups, with a significance level of P < 0.05.

RNA was isolated from cultured neurons using total RNA was extracted using the RecoverALL Total Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA libraries were prepared and sequenced at the University of Houston Sequencing and Editing Core according to standard protocols. Enrichment for mRNA from total RNA was performed by coding-region-specific biotinylated capture probes, which were selected using streptavidin magnetic beads. mRNA-enriched libraries were prepared using the QIAseq Stranded Total RNA Kit (Qiagen) with 200 ng of input RNA. RNA was fragmented, reverse-transcribed into cDNA, ligated with sequence adaptors and amplified by PCR. Size selection for libraries was performed using SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter). The library purity was analysed using the DNA HS1000 tape with a 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent) and the Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The prepared libraries were pooled and sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina), using an S4 flow cell at paired-end 150 bp configuration at 20–30 million read depth for each sample.

The raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) were imported into Qiagen CLC Genomics Workbench 20.0.4. Initial quality control of the sequencing reads was performed using the built-in tools, including the Quality Control function, to evaluate read quality metrics, such as read length distribution, quality scores and potential adapter contamination. Low-quality reads and contaminants were trimmed or filtered out. The cleaned sequencing reads were mapped to the GRCh38.p14 reference genome using the Map Reads to Reference tool in the CLC Genomics Workbench. Gene expression levels were quantified using the Count Features tool. This step involved counting the number of reads mapped to each gene based on the annotation file corresponding to the reference genome. The output generated a count table indicating the raw read counts for each gene across all samples. Read counts were normalized using the trimmed mean of M method implemented in the R Bioconductor package edgeR (v.4.2.1)71 to determine the abundance of each gene. Next, we fit a negative binomial generalized log-linear model to estimate the quasi-dispersions with empirical Bayes moderation (glmQLFit function), followed by hypothesis testing with empirical Bayes quasi-likelihood F-tests. P-value adjustment was performed using the Bonferroni correction method. These data have been deposited in the NCBI GEO under accession number GSE289744.

GSEA was conducted to investigate the enrichment of gene sets of mouse neurons cultivated in vitro. GSEA analysis was performed considering the Hallmark gene set (MH) from the Mouse MSigDB Collections (mh.all.v2024.1.Mm.symbols.gmt) and performing 1,000 permutations63,72.

Fixed samples containing 3% glutaraldehyde plus 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, were washed with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, post fixed with 1% cacodylate-buffered osmium tetroxide, washed with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, then in distilled water. Next, the samples were sequentially treated with Millipore-filtered 1% aqueous tannic acid, washed in distilled water, treated with Millipore-filtered 1% aqueous uranyl acetate, then rinsed thoroughly with distilled water. The samples were dehydrated with a graded series of increasing concentrations of ethanol, then transferred to a graded series of increasing concentrations of hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and air-dried overnight. The samples were mounted on double-stick carbon tabs (Ted Pella), previously mounted onto glass microscope slides. The samples were then coated under vacuum using a Balzer MED 010 evaporator (Technotrade) with platinum alloy for a thickness of 25 nm, then immediately flash-carbon-coated under vacuum. The samples were transferred to a desiccator for examination at a later date. The samples were examined/imaged in a JSM-5900 scanning electron microscope (JEOL) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV.

Samples were fixed with a solution containing 3% glutaraldehyde plus 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, then washed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer and treated with 0.1% Millipore-filtered cacodylate buffered tannic acid, post fixed with 1% buffered osmium tetroxide and stained en bloc with 1% Millipore-filtered uranyl acetate. The samples were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, infiltrated and embedded in LX-112 medium. The samples were polymerized in a 60 °C oven for approximately 3 days. Ultrathin sections were cut in a Leica Ultracut microtome (Leica), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Digital images were obtained using AMT Imaging System (Advanced Microscopy Techniques).

Cytokine, chemokine and growth factor profiling of the cell culture supernatants was performed using the Luminex Mouse Immune Monitoring 48-Plex (ProcartaPlex; Invitrogen) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The samples were not diluted before use in the assay and were assessed in triplicate. Then, 50 µl of capture beads were added per well to the assay plate, followed by 50 μl of cell culture supernatant. The assay plate was incubated overnight at 4 °C and then at room temperature for 30 min with shaking at 500 rpm. After three washes, 25 µl of detection antibody was added per well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with shaking at 500 rpm. Then, 50 µl of streptavidin-PE solution was added per well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with shaking at 500 rpm. After three washes, 120 µl of reading buffer was added per well and incubated for 5 min. Data were acquired using the Luminex 200 analyzer and xPONENT v.4.2 software. Analysis was performed using Bio-Plex Manager v.6.1 software.

The different cell types used for in vivo experiments in this study, along with the figure panel presenting the results of their relevant analysis, are summarized in Supplementary Table 10. A minimum of five mice per experimental group was used to ensure that appropriate statistical analyses could be conducted. This determination was made based on our preliminary data, the implementation of internal controls and the observed variability within the experimental groups. In each experiment conducted, all efforts to replicate the results were successful. All animal studies were carried out according to protocols approved by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (protocols 00000950-RN03, 00001522-RN01, 00001522-RN02, 00002342-RN00), NYU, Queen's University (protocols 2380 and 2393), and Université de Montréal (protocols 21046 and 21047) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mouse housing, husbandry and care practices met or exceeded the minimum requirements outlined in the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition). Disease development and progression were closely monitored. According to our approved protocol, mice with metastases were euthanized as soon as we noticed signs of discomfort in the mice or when the largest dimension of a tumour reached 20 mm. In none of the experiments were these limits exceeded.

Mice were housed in standard environmental conditions (12 h–12 h light–dark cycle; 23 °C; food and water ad libitum) at facilities accredited by the Canadian Council of Animal Care (UdeM and Queen's University).

As per our IACUC-approved protocol, the following end points have been used in all the experiments and have not been exceeded. Along with excessive body weight loss (maximum of 10%), the end points include excessive tumour volume (10% of animal's body weight; ~20 mm × 20 mm, not exceeded in any experiment), skin ulceration, necrosis, bleeding, infection and self-inflicted injury, prostration, lethargy, unresponsiveness to stimulation and/or lack of grooming.

To generate murine skin SCC cell lines, p53-deficient (K14Cre; p53R172H/flox) C57BL/6 mice (4–6-week-old, both males and females) were exposed to 7 kJ m−2 s−1 of ultraviolet B light, 3 doses per week for 100 days. The hair on the mice's dorsal surface was shaved twice or thrice a week before UV exposure. This model has been shown to effectively simulate human cuSCC development, producing tumours with a genomic profile similar to those found in humans with cuSCC73. Skin tumours (minimum 5 mm in diameter and persistent for at least 2 weeks) started to develop 9 months after the end of the UV-exposure protocol. Each tumour was split in half. One section was processed for FFPE, H&E stained and IF staining with anti-pan-keratin (type I) was performed for confirmation of cSCC diagnosis. The remaining tissue section was macrodissected and incubated in cell culture medium for 7–10 days. The cultured cells were sorted using the CD326 (EPCAM) antibody, and the resulting isolated epithelial cells were again incubated in cell culture medium, IF stained with anti-pan-keratin (type I) (E6S1S) antibody and DAPI to confirm their epithelial origin. The isolated malignant keratinocytes were injected intradermally (200,000 cells per 60 μl) into C57BL/6 WT mice, and their tumorigenicity was recorded. The newly developed tumours were assessed using H&E staining to confirm the histopathological diagnosis of cSCC. This process resulted in five distinct UVSCC cell lines (M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6) (Extended Data Fig. 3b).

We used denervation and surgical axotomy to assess in vivo nerve injury modulation of the immune response. For denervation, we used 6–8-week-old male and female SKH1-Elite mice (SKH1-Hrhr, Charles River). For axotomy, we used 6–8-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice (strain 000664, Jackson Laboratory) and 4–6-week-old female HU-NCG CD34+ humanized mice (Charles River). Denervation was performed under microscopy guidance, and an incision was made along the dorsal midline from the base of the neck to approximately 0.5 cm above the tail. Using blunt forceps, we gently reflected the skin on the right side away from the flank to visualize the underlying tissue from the scapular fat pads near the neck to just above the hind limb. Next, we removed the nerves exclusively from the animal's right side at anatomical sites T3–12 by plucking from where the segments bend at the trunk wall to their entry sites into the skin. Then, we removed any nerves from the skin flap. Next, 7 days after denervation, the mice were injected with the mouse (SKH1-Hrhr derived) ultraviolet-induced cSCC B610K cells (mouse cells generated by primary culture of UV-induced skin tumours in SKH1-Elite, hairless, euthymic and immunocompetent mice (Charles River; https://www.criver.com/products-services/find-model/skh1-elite-mouse?region=3646)74. For axotomy, we made an incision along the dorsal midline from the base of the neck to roughly 0.5 cm above the tail. Using blunt forceps, we gently reflected the skin on the right side away from the flank to visualize the underlying tissue from the scapular fat pads near the neck to just above the hind limb. Next, we used a scalpel to sever the nerves innervating the skin at anatomical sites T3–12, where the segments bend at the trunk wall to their entry sites into the skin. We did not pluck the nerves or remove any nerves from the skin flap. Then, 7 days after axotomy, C57BL mice were injected with the mouse ultraviolet-induced cSCC M4 cells (Extended Data Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 3). Hu-NCG CD34+ Humanized Mice were injected with the human IC8 cuSCC cell line (C.H.)37. The human cell line HLA was tested at the Histocompatibility Typing Laboratory at the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant program of MD Anderson Cancer Center. For the sham-operated control, we used blunt dissection to gently reflect the skin on the right side of the dorsal midline incision without removing or cutting the nerves. Then, 1 week after tumour implantation, the mice were treated biweekly with either murine (intraperitoneal (i.p.), 250 μg, RMP1-14) or human (for experiments with humanized mice) (i.p., 10 mg per kg, cemiplimab-rwlc, NDC 61755-008-01) anti-PD-1 for 4 weeks75,76. We used the rat IgG2a (BE0089, 2A3, BioXCell) as a control.

An Ifnar1-KO mouse model (B6(Cg)-Ifnar1^tm1.2Ees/J, 028288, Jackson Laboratory) and WT C57BL/6J mice (000664, Jackson Laboratory), aged 10–12 weeks, both male and female, were used in this experiment. On day 0, UVSCC-M4 cells (200,000 cells in 30 µl PBS) were inoculated into the footpads of Ifnar1-KO and WT mice. Then, 17 days after inoculation (day 17), the mice underwent either injection of ethidium bromide (25 µl of 0.5% solution) into the tibial nerve at the tumour–normal skin interface to induce demyelination or a sham procedure involving PBS injection into the same location. Anti-PD-1 treatment (BioXCell Clone RMP1-14, BP0146; 250 µg per mouse, i.p. in sterile PBS) was initiated 2 days after demyelination (day 19) and administered twice weekly for a total of 6 doses. WT mouse groups, both with and without demyelination, were treated with anti-PD-1 alone or in combination with the STING agonist c-di-GMP (CDG; Invivogen, 25 µg per mouse, intratumoural), administered according to the same schedule to enhance IFN type I signalling. An InVivoPlus rat IgG2a isotype control (anti-trinitrophenol, 2A3, BioXCell, BP0089) was used as a control. The tumour volumes were measured every 3 days using callipers, and after euthanizing the mice, the footpads were excised, weighed and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histopathological viability analysis. Pathologic assessment of treatment response was performed by histopathologic evaluation of H&E-stained sections of tumours/tumour bed, as previously described19. In brief, the tumour bed was evaluated, and the average percentages of viable tumour, necrosis, anucleate keratin, inflammatory infiltrate or fibrosis were estimated for each tumour sample.

We evaluated the effect of IL-6 signalling blockade on anti-PD-1 efficacy in 6–8-week-old male C57BL mice (000664, Jackson Laboratory). One week after the orthotopic inoculation of mouse UV-induced cSCC M4 cells into the skin, mice received either an injection of ethidium bromide into the tumour periphery at the tumour-normal skin interface to induce demyelination or a sham injection. Anti-PD-1 treatment (BioXCell, RMP1-14, BP0146; 250 µg per mouse, i.p.) was initiated 2 days after demyelination and administered twice weekly for 8 doses over 4 weeks. To allow for the priming of immune cells against the tumour, the first two doses of anti-PD-1 were given alone. Subsequent anti-PD-1 doses were administered either alone or in combination with an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody (InVivoMAb anti-mouse IL-6, BioXCell, MP5-20F3, BE0046; 200 µg per mouse, twice weekly for 3 weeks). Tumour volumes and immune response outcomes were monitored throughout the experiment. Pathologic assessment of treatment response was performed by histopathologic evaluation of H&E-stained sections of tumours/tumour bed, as previously described19. In brief, the tumour bed was evaluated, and the average percentages of viable tumour, necrosis, anucleate keratin, inflammatory infiltrate or fibrosis were estimated for each tumour sample.

PNI over time (whiskers pad model): 8–10-week-old female C57BL mice (000664, Jackson Laboratory) were used. All procedures were approved by the New York University Institutional Animal Care. Animals were housed in a temperature-controlled, pathogen-free room under a 12 h–12 h light–dark cycle (06:00–18:00) with ad libitum access to food and water. The MOC2 mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (Sigma Chemicals) were cultured in IMDM/F12 (2:1 mixture) with 5% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 1% amphotericin, 5 ng ml−1 EGF (Millipore), 400 ng ml−1 hydrocortisone and 5 mg ml−1 insulin. Under 3% isoflurane anaesthesia, 20 μl of MOC2 cells (5,000 cells total) in serum-free culture medium was injected into the left whisker pad using a 10 μl Hamilton syringe. The mice were randomly allocated to four groups. The experimental groups were defined by the interval between cancer cell injection and the subsequent euthanasia of the animals, resulting in tumour development periods of 7, 9, 11 and 13 days. The tumours were processed for histological assessment and mIF staining, focusing on identifying PNI by tumour cells and characterizing the perineural immune infiltrate.

Mouse tumours were quickly dissected from euthanized animals (orthotopic B610K intradermal model in SKH1-Elite animals and normal skin controls) and analysed by P.D.V.'s laboratory, as previously described77. Tissues were immediately sectioned to generate tissue slices. One tumour slice/sample was formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and processed for histological staining (H&E) to assess tumour presence. Electrical recordings were captured using a MEA1060-Inv-BC microelectrode array system (Multichannel Systems) with a perforated microelectrode array, 60pMEA100/30iR-Ti MEAs (890335, Harvard Apparatus). The MEAs used contained 60 electrodes, of which one is a reference electrode. These electrodes are spaced 100 µm apart in a 6 × 10 grid (ten electrodes per row arranged in six columns generating a rectangle of electrodes onto which tissue slice is placed); each electrode is 30 µm in diameter. The titanium nitride electrodes are contained within a glass ring, enabling us to maintain tissue slices under oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose, 1.3 mM MgSO4, 1.5 mM CaCl2); this buffer preserves neuronal functions. The perforated MEAs allow for a gentle suction (applied by a vacuum pump) to keep the tissue slice in contact with electrodes for the duration of recordings. This enables us to capture the electrical activity from every electrode for every second of each recording. As such, recordings from 59 electrodes per second per slice were collected (one electrode is a reference electrode). Recordings occurred at room temperature using a 25-kHz sampling frequency and a Butterworth second-order digital filter set to high-pass with a cut-off frequency of 10 Hz (to eliminate slow FPs). A STG4000 stimulus generator (Multichannel Systems) was used for stimulation, which consisted of biphasic voltage, −0.5 V and +0.5 V each for 100 µs and repeated after a 23 ms interval. Stimulation was applied to selected electrodes; evoked spike responses were recorded. Two independent types of stimulations were used on each slice. The first consisted of 14 electrodes while the second consisted of 20 electrodes. The same electrode sets were stimulated for all slices analysed and the stimulation parameters were identical. Recordings continued after electrical stimulations were turned off to allow for capturing of activity back to baseline. In all cases, continuous electrical activity per second per electrode recordings were captured and analysed using the MC_Rach4.6.2 software (Multichannel Systems).

TEM analysis was conducted on mouse tissue samples from a previously established model of PNI in the sciatic nerve78. In brief, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Sciatic nerves were dissected and fixed for 2 h. Fixation was performed using a modified reduced osmium impregnation method. The samples were embedded in fresh 100% durcupan. The processed samples were sectioned (1 µm) and stained with 1% toluidine blue to identify the areas of interest. Thinner sections (70 nm) were mounted onto slot grids and loaded onto the Zeiss grid holder for EM imaging. Images were taken with a beam acceleration of 20.0 kV and a working distance of approximately 2.0 mm, capturing 6,144 px by 4,608 px images with a pixel size of 100 nm to 200 nm. A Talos120C transmission electron microscope with the Gatan (4k × 4k) OneView Camera was used for high-resolution EM imaging. Ultrathin sections (50–60 nm) were imaged at ×1,250.

Bulk RNA-seq analysis of lung-metastasis-innervating neurons was performed after intravenous injection of 5 × 105 B16F10-OVA melanoma cells or PBS vehicle into nociceptor neuron reporter mice (Trpv1cre::TdTomatofl/WT). Then, 2 weeks later, the mice were euthanized, and lung metastases were visually confirmed in the B16F10-eGFP-inoculated group. Jugular nodose ganglia (JNC) were dissected into ice-cold HEPES-buffered DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12430062). For each biological replicate, JNC from four mice (two male, two female) were pooled and transferred into HEPES-buffered DMEM containing 1 mg ml−1 collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich, C5138) and 2.4 U ml−1 dispase II (Sigma-Aldrich, 04942078001), then incubated at 37 °C for 70 min. After washing with DMEM, ganglia were gently triturated using glass Pasteur pipettes of decreasing diameter. Cells were centrifuged at 200g over a 15% BSA gradient in PBS to remove debris, stained with SYTO 40 (10 μM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, S11351) for 5 min at room temperature to distinguish cells from axonal debris, washed with PBS and resuspended in sterile flow cytometry buffer (PBS with 2% FBS and 1 mM EDTA). The cell suspension was filtered through a 70 µm mesh (VWR, 10204-924) and nociceptor neurons (tdTomato+) were FACS-enriched on a BD FACSAria cell sorter, collected directly into 500 µl TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596026), and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction, according to established protocols79. Library preparation was conducted at the Institut de Recherche en Cancérologie et en Immunologie (IRIC), Université de Montréal. The RNA quality was confirmed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer, with all samples achieving an RNA integrity number of ≥7.5. Libraries were prepared using a poly(A)-enrichment, single-stranded RNA-seq method (KapaBiosystems, KAPA RNA Hyperprep Kit, KR1352) and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq500 platform with 75-cycle single-end reads. Basecalling was performed using Illumina RTA v.2.4.11, and demultiplexing was done using bcl2fastq v.2.20 (allowing for one mismatch in the index). Trimmomatic was used to remove adapter sequences and low-quality bases from the 3′ end of each read, and the resulting high-quality reads were aligned to the GRCm38 mouse genome using STAR v.2.5.11, which also generated gene-level read counts. Differential expression analysis was performed using edgeR. The generalized linear model likelihood ratio test from edgeR was used to identify significant DEGs between groups. Genes were considered to be differentially expressed if they had an FDR-adjusted P < 0.05. log2-transformed fold changes and −log10-transformed P values were calculated from the normalized data, and additional data analysis and visualization were carried out in RStudio. These data have been deposited in the NCBI GEO under accession number GSE292089.

Six- to ten-week-old male and female C57BL6J (000664); Trpv1cre (017769)80, td-tomatofl/fl (007908)81, Dtafl/fl (Jax, 009669)82 and NaV1.8cre (036564) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Atf3fl/fl and Atf3GFP/GFP were supplied by C. J. Woolf. All lines were backcrossed >6 generations on the C57BL6/J background (H2-Kb). We used the cre/lox toolbox to engineer the various mice lines used (Trpv1cre::tdTomatofl/WT, NaV1.8cre::Atf3fl/fl and littermate controls) by crossing heterozygote cre mice with homozygous loxP mice. Littermates with no Cre (that is, Trpv1WT::tdTomatofl/WT, NaV1.8WT::Atf3fl/fl) were used as controls referred to as WT for the Atf3 gene in the relevant figures. Mice of both sexes were used for these crosses. All Cre driver lines used were viable and fertile, and abnormal phenotypes were not detected. Offspring were tail-clipped; tissue was used to assess the presence of transgene by standard PCR, as described by Jackson Laboratory or the donating investigators. Offspring of both sexes were used at 6–10 weeks of age.

B16F10-mCherry-OVA83 (M. F. Krummel), B16F10-OVA (Biocytogen, 311537), B16F10-eGFP (Imanis, CL053) or non-tumorigenic keratinocytes (CellnTEC, MPEK-BL6100) were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose (DMEM, Corning, 10-013-CV) supplemented with 10% FBS (Seradigm, 3100) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Corning, MT-3001-Cl), and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2. All of the cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma, and none are listed by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee registry (v.11). Non-commercial cell lines (B16F10-OVA-mCherry) were authenticated using antibody (against OVA, mCherry) and/or imaging as well as morphology and growth property. Commercial cell lines have not been further authenticated.

Cancer cells were resuspended in PBS (Corning 21040CV) and injected into the mouse skin right flank (2.5 × 105 cells or 5 × 105 cells; intradermal, 100 μl) or hindpaw (2 × 105 cells intradermal, 50 μl). Growth was assessed daily using handheld digital calipers and the tumour volume was determined using the formula L × W2 × 0.52 (ref. 84), where L is the length and W is the width.

Six-week-old male and female littermate control (Trpv1WT::Diptheria-Toxinfl/WT) mice were intradermally injected into the left paw with 2 × 105 B16F10-OVA cells or non-tumorigenic keratinocytes (MPEK-BL6). Then, 7 days later, tumour-infiltrating neurons (or neurons in MPEK-injected skin) were retrogradely labelled by an acute intratumour injection of AAV9-CAG-mCherry-WPRE-SV40p (10 µl, 5.5 × 109). Then, 14 days after inoculation, the mice were euthanized, and the L3–L5 DRG was collected and digested. Most CD45+ cells were depleted using the MagniSort mouse CD45 depletion kit (Invitrogen, 8804-6864). The remaining neurons were resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 2% FCS and EDTA) and stained with Viability Dye eFluor 780 (eBioscience, 65-0865-14) at 4 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, nuclei were stained with SYTO 40 (10 µM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, S11351) for 5 min at room temperature to distinguish cells from axonal debris. Cells were then purified by FACS on the BD FACSAria IIu cell sorter and subjected to single-cell barcoding using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ GEM, Library and Gene Expression v3.1 system (10x Genomics). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq X platform, generating 120 million total reads. Reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome using Cell Ranger (10x Genomics) and analysed with Seurat. Low-RNA-content and dead cells were excluded (nFeature_RNA > 100, percent.mt < 5%). AAV9 expression was not detected and therefore subsequent analysis was performed using principal component analysis, which identified 19 clusters, which were assigned cell types using known markers and the Tabula Muris reference atlas. Clusters were grouped into major cell types, and cells that were not classified as neurons were excluded from the analysis. Four biological replicates per group were analysed to compare B16F10-injected mice and keratinocyte-injected mice. These data have been deposited in the NCBI GEO under accession number GSE292522.

Enrichment of gene signatures at the single-cell level was evaluated by performing single-cell GSEA using the R package irGSEA85. Enrichment calculation was performed using the ssGSEA86 method using a rank-normalized approach and generating an empirical cumulative distribution function for each cell. For this analysis, we considered the 50 gene expression signatures from the Mouse MSigDB MH collection: hallmark gene sets72.

B16F10-mCherry-OVA melanoma cells (5 × 105) were inoculated intradermally into the flank of 8-week-old male and female mice of which the nociceptor neurons were either permissive (NaV1.8WT::Atf3fl/fl) or resistant (NaV1.8cre::Atf3fl/fl) to injury. Then, 10 days after tumour inoculation, the tumours were excised, minced with a razor blade and digested for 30 min in DMEM containing 10 mM HEPES, 1.6 mg ml−1 collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich, C5138) and 10 μg ml−1 DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, 4942078001). The resulting cell suspensions were filtered through a 40 μm mesh, and samples from two mice were pooled for each experiment. After red blood cell lysis (Gibco, A10492-01), cells were stained with Zombie Aqua viability dye (BioLegend, 423105) and a FITC anti-mouse CD45 antibody (BioLegend, 103107). Approximately 500,000 live immune cells, which included around 80% CD45+ cells, were sorted on the BD FACSAria III cell sorter into a collection buffer (PBS, 0.04% BSA and 50% FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, F4135), then fixed and prepared for single-cell library construction using the Chromium 10x Fixed RNA kits (PN-1000414 and PN-1000497). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq X system and reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome using Cell Ranger (10x Genomics). Count matrices were generated and analysed in Seurat. Next, low-quality cells, potential doublets and multiplets were removed. Batch effect was corrected using canonical correlation analysis in Seurat. The threshold for dead cells was percent.mt < 10. The threshold to remove low-quality cells, potential doublets and multiplets were nFeature_RNA > 200 and nFeature_RNA < 2500. Identification of the major immune phenotypes was performed based on the expression of key phenotypical markers (Extended Data Fig. 9i). Differences in the frequency of tumour-associated leukocytes between groups were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Over-representation analysis was performed using the Enrichr R package87. These data have been deposited in the NCBI GEO under accession number GSE292090.

Mice were euthanized 14 days post-tumour inoculation. Tumours were harvested and enzymatically digested in DMEM + 5% FBS (Seradigm, 3100) + 2 mg ml−1 collagenase D (Sigma, 11088866001) + 1 mg ml−1 Collagenase IV (Sigma, C5138-1G) + 40 µg ml−1 DNAse I (Sigma, 10104159001) under constant shaking (40 min, 37 °C). The cell suspension was centrifuged at 400g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 70% Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare), overlaid with 40% Percoll and centrifuged at 500g for 20 min at room temperature with acceleration and deceleration at 1. The cells were aspirated from the Percoll interface and passed through a 70-μm cell strainer. Single-cell suspensions were prepared in FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% FCS and EDTA) and stained with either Zombie Aqua (BioLegend, 423102) for 15 min at room temperature or Viability Dye eFluor 780 (eBioscience, 65-0865-14) for 15 min at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with Fc Block (0.5 mg ml−1; BD Biosciences, 553141) for 20 min at 4 °C, then stained for 30 min at 4 °C with anti-CD45-FITC (1:100; BioLegend, 103107) and anti-CD8-PerCP/Cyanine5.5 (1:100; BioLegend, 100733). For cytokine expression analysis, cells were stimulated in vitro for 3 h with PMA (50 ng ml−1; Sigma-Aldrich, P1585), ionomycin (1 μg ml−1; Sigma-Aldrich, I3909) and GolgiStop (1:100; BD Biosciences, 554724). They were then fixed and permeabilized (1:100; BD Biosciences, 554714), stained with anti-IFN-γ-APC (1:100; BioLegend, 505810) and analysed on a Cytoflex (Beckman) flow cytometer.

A total of 2 × 105 B16F10-OVA-mCherry melanoma cells were injected intradermally into the right hindpaw of C57BL/6 mice or Atf3GFP/GFP mice. Then, 14 days after inoculation, the mice were anaesthetized with urethane (Sigma-Aldrich, U2500, 20%, 250 μl, i.p.) and perfused with 10 ml of PBS followed by 10 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich, 158127). The ipsilateral (tumour-bearing paw) and contralateral (control paw) L3–L5 DRGs were collected, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h at 4 °C and then immersed sequentially in 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, S8501) for 24 h each. The tissues were embedded in Fisher Healthcare Tissue-Plus O.C.T. Compound (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23-730-571), frozen at –80 °C and cryosectioned into 15–30 μm sections. The sections were blocked in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 5% BSA and 5% goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich, G9023) for 2 h at room temperature, then incubated at 4 °C for 48 h with rabbit anti-mouse ATF3 (1:100, Abcam, ab207434) and chicken anti-mouse TUBB3 (1:500, Abcam, ab41489) in staining solution (PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 3% goat serum). After three 15-minute washes in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, the sections were incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with AF488 anti-chicken (1:1,000, Abcam, ab150169) and AF647 anti-rabbit (1:1,000, Invitrogen, A-21245) antibodies. The samples were then washed and stained with DAPI (2 μg ml−1, Invitrogen, D1306) for 10 min at room temperature. Images were acquired using the Nikon Ti2 microscope equipped with a Photometrics Prime 95B camera. Using ImageJ or Nikon Elements software, circular ROIs were drawn around each neuron and nucleus. The mean grey values for ATF3 and TUBB3 fluorescence (in a.u.) within each ROI were exported for further analysis in Microsoft Excel. The ratio of ATF3+ neurons to TUBB3+ neurons was determined, indicating increased ATF3 expression in ipsilateral (tumour-bearing) L3–L5 DRGs compared with the contralateral side. In parallel, a threshold-based method was also applied to define the relative number of ATF3+ nuclei, which also show increased relative expression in ipsilateral (tumour-bearing) L3–L5 DRGs neurons. Values from Atf3GFP/GFP mice independently validated these findings and are not shown.

Unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were conducted to analyse immunohistochemical, in vitro and mouse data. Survival was analysed using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate nominal statistical significance. Owing to the variance of xenograft growth in control mice, we used at least three mice per genotype to give 80% power to detect an effect size of 20% with a significance level of 0.05. The number of independent mice used is listed in the figure legend for all mouse experiments. No statistical methods were used to predetermine the sample size. The experiments were not randomized, and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. To assess differences in cytokine levels between groups, we used a nested one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to account for both technical and biological replicates, followed by Tukey's post hoc test. The cytokine levels were standardized by calculating z scores based on the mean for plotting purposes. To compare tumour growth in mouse models under different interventions, tumour volume was recorded at multiple timepoints. In this way, we used a mixed-effects model (REML) to compare tumour growth curves and account for repeated tumour measures. Intervention groups, time and their interaction were considered to be fixed effects, and individual animals were considered to be random factors. Differences among growth curves were considered to be significant if the P value from the fixed-effects test for the interaction between the intervention group and time was lower than 0.05. Moreover, post hoc Tukey's multiple-comparison test was conducted for pairwise comparisons between groups at specific timepoints. Analyses were performed using JMP Pro v.17.0 software and R.

Patient tumour samples were collected as part of two clinical trials of neo-adjuvant immunotherapy in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma patients - NCT03565783 and NCT04154943. This figure details the number of available patients and tumour samples per each analysis reported in this manuscript. For patients who had a large neo-adjuvant-treated tumour, several samples from the same patient tumour were used to minimize a potential tumour heterogeneity bias.

Gene expression of c-Jun and Atf3 in the jugular-nodose ganglia neurons from mice with melanoma lung metastases (B16F10-OVA) was compared to PBS vehicle controls. Each dot represents an independent biological sample, with n = 3 for each group. The box plots illustrate the median (centre line), the 25th and 75th percentiles (box bounds), and the minimum and maximum values (whiskers). P-values (FDR) were calculated using the empirical Bayes quasi-likelihood F-test implemented in edgeR and were corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.

(a) Immunohistochemistry stain against ERG, an endothelial cell marker, was conducted on tumour samples of axotomized cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) bearing mice (see Fig. 1). This representative ERG stain showed intact intra-tumoral vasculature (red arrowheads, see vascular lumen integrity) despite perineural inflammation (asterisks), suggesting that the tumour-associated nerve injury (nerve marked with black arrowheads) and perineural inflammation were not accompanied by vascular damage. (b) Generation of the ultraviolet (UV)-induced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) murine cell lines. p53-deficient (K14Cre; Trp53R172H/flox) C57BL/6 mice (4–6 weeks old) were exposed to 7 Kilojoules/m2/S of ultraviolet B (UVB) light, 3 doses/week for 100 days. The hair on the mice's dorsal surface was shaved twice or thrice a week before UV exposure. Skin tumours (minimum 5 mm in diameter and persistent for at least 2 weeks) started to develop 9 months after the end of the UV-exposure protocol. Each tumour was split in half. One section was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE), H&E stained, and immunofluorescence (IF) staining with anti-Pan-Keratin (Type I) was performed for confirmation of cSCC diagnosis. The remaining tissue section was macro-dissected and incubated in cell culture media for 7–10 days. The cultured cells were sorted using the CD326 (EpCAM) antibody, and the resulting isolated epithelial cells were again incubated in cell culture media, IF stained with anti-Pan-Keratin (Type I) (E6S1S) antibody and DAPI to confirm their epithelial origin. The isolated malignant keratinocytes were injected intradermally (200 K cells/60ul) into C57BL/6 wild-type mice, and their tumorigenicity was recorded. The newly developed tumours were assessed using H&E staining to confirm the histopathological diagnosis of cSCC. This process resulted in five distinct UVSCC cell lines (M2, M3, M4, M5 and M6). (Created with BioRender.com) (c) The susceptibility of UV-cSCC cells to anti-PD-1 therapy was tested in vivo. The UVcSCC cells were intradermally injected into C57BL/6 mice and subsequently treated with either IgG or anti-PD-1 antibody. Among the five cell lines tested, only UVcSCC-M4 exhibited susceptibility to anti-PD-1 treatment. The data, displayed as mean ± s.e.m. over time, reflects results from multiple biologically independent animals in each group: M2 aPD1 n = 5, M2 IgG n = 5, M3 aPD1 n = 3, M3 IgG n = 4, M4 aPD1 n = 5, M4 IgG n = 5, M5 aPD1 n = 4, M5 IgG n = 5, M6 aPD1 n = 3, and M6 IgG n = 4. Statistical analysis was performed using a mixed-effects model with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation, and post hoc comparisons at specific time points were conducted using Šidák's multiple comparisons test. (d) Experiment design of the axotomy experiment in HLA matched humanized huCD34+ NSG mice. (Created with BioRender.com) (e) Tumour growth curve of the huCD34+ NSG axotomy experiment. Initially, both groups demonstrated a response to anti-PD-1 therapy (Cemiplimab, Cem). However, only sham-operated mice had a durable response (417.7 mm3 versus 105.4 mm3 in axotomized and sham-operated mice, respectively, on day 40, p-value < 0.01). Data is shown as mean ± s.e.m. over time, reflecting results from 7 biologically independent animals per group. A mixed-effects model utilizing restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation was used for statistical analysis. Post hoc comparisons at specific time points were conducted using Šidák's multiple comparisons test, with an adjusted p-value of <0.001 at day 40.

Representative electron microscopy (EM) images of nerves from mice who underwent micro-injection of human oral SCC cells (HSC-3) directly into the right sciatic nerve, simulating PNI, versus sham controls (PBS injection). Top row (PBS control): Nerves from sham mice show large numbers of normal-appearing myelinated axons, both large and small. The axoplasm contains scattered organelles, and the contours of the myelinated axons are circular with few or no myelin invaginations. The overall structure appears intact and unremarkable. Bottom row (HSC-3 SCC cells): Nerves from mice with PNI exhibit several pathological changes. Myelin invaginations (red asterisks) demonstrated an excessive in-folding of the myelin sheath into the axons. Intra-axonal accumulation of dark organelles is observed, often associated with a narrow myelin sheath. Myelin splitting is occasionally seen, indicating subtle segregation or splitting of the myelin layers. Some axons (yellow asterisks) show signs of dilatation with accumulated organelles and thinning of the myelin sheath, possibly reflecting compensatory changes due to axonal damage. Scale bar: 10 μm.

(a) Representative images of RealDRG neurons (stained with NeuO) after 72 h in standard sensory neuron media (Senso-MM) followed by different treatments: no media exchange, fresh media exchange, co-culture with MOC1 squamous cell carcinoma cells, or culture in MOC1-conditioned media for an additional 72 h. Initial seeding density: 0.15 × 105 cells/well in poly-l-ornithine and iMatrix-511 coated 8-well ibidi plates. (b) Bar plot showing the viability of NeuO+ neurons, normalized to the “No media change” control. Neuronal viability was reduced only in the co-culture group. Data are represented as mean ± s.e.m., based on 6 biologically independent samples for each group. (c) Neurite analysis pipeline demonstration showing the methodology for quantifying neuronal morphology. Representative multichannel fluorescence images demonstrate the automated analysis approach using the Neurite Outgrowth Module in Gen5 Cytation 7 software, with neurons identified by neurofilament heavy chain (NFH) staining and DAPI nuclear labelling. (d) Representative monochrome immunofluorescence images of neurofilament heavy chain (NFH) staining showing neuronal morphology under different experimental conditions used for neurite metric quantification. Images were acquired using an Agilent BioTek Cytation 5 cell imaging multimode reader at 20x magnification as 12 × 12 image montages from the centre of each well. Upper row: Fresh media, no media change, B16 melanoma-conditioned media, and co-culture with B16 melanoma cells. Lower row: Fresh media, no media change, MIA PaCa-2-conditioned media, and co-culture with MIA PaCa-2 cells. Scale bars = 100 μm. (e) Quantification of average neurite length showing a trending decrease in B16 melanoma co-culture conditions (left, p = 0.054) and no significant difference in MIA PaCa-2 (PDAC) co-culture (right, p = 0.606). Data represent mean ± standard deviation from a minimum of 10 regions of interest per condition. Analysis performed using automated neurite outgrowth module with short ending branches <5 μm excluded. (f) Quantification of neurite thickness (calculated as NFH+ area divided by neurite length) showing a significant decrease in both B16 melanoma (left, p = 0.006) and MIA PaCa-2 (right, p = 0.014) co-culture conditions compared to controls. Data represent mean ± standard deviation from a minimum of 10 regions of interest per condition, with duplicate wells per condition. (g) Basal spontaneous firing rate of iPSC-derived sensory neurons assessed by multi-microelectrode array (MEA). After 10 days in normal culture, mature, firing neurons were cultured for 6 days under control conditions, stressed conditions (no media exchange), in MOC1-conditioned media, or co-cultured with MOC1 cells. Spontaneous firing rates were recorded at baseline (day 10), 24 h (day 11), and 72 h (day 13) after applying experimental conditions. Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. derived from two biologically independent samples for each group. Statistical significance was assessed using one-way ANOVA (p = 0.678 at baseline, p = 0.241 at 24 h, p = 0.302 at 72 h). (h) Mean firing rate of iPSC-derived sensory neurons co-cultured with MIA PaCa-2 cells over 5 days, measured by MEA. RealDRGs were plated at 20 K cells/well (n = 3 biologically independent samples, left panel) and 50 K cells/well (n = 2 biologically independent samples, right panel) on 24-well CytoView MEA plates, with media changes every 48 h. After 10 days in normal culture establishing stable spontaneous activity, mature neurons were cultured for 6 days under control conditions, stressed conditions (no media exchange), in MIA PaCa-2-conditioned media, or in MIA PaCa-2 co-culture. Spontaneous functional activity was recorded for a minimum of 10 min every 24 h from day 10 through day 15. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m.

Volcano plots showing the differentially expressed (DE) genes between (a) monoculture of human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons vs. DRG neurons co-cultured with IC8 human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells; see Fig. 2 for gene set enrichment analysis (b) monoculture of human DRG neurons vs. DRG neurons co-cultured with normal keratinocytes (HEK). Only eight genes were DE in the presence of normal keratinocytes. (c) mono-culture of DRG neurons vs. monoculture of DRG neurons treated with anti-PD-1. Only one gene was DE in the presence of anti-PD-1 – SCN10A, which encodes the alpha subunit of a sodium channel found in sensory nerves. (d) Monoculture of motor neurons vs. motor neurons co-cultured with IC8 SCC cells. Only four genes were DE between the conditions. Differential expression was determined with the empirical Bayes quasi-likelihood F-tests (two-sided) followed by multiple comparisons adjustment with Bonferroni correction. All experiments were done in triplicate.

(a-c) Representative images of the nerve identification process for digital spatial profiling (DSP) analysis. Nerves were identified using NFH (yellow) and B3-tubulin (red) staining in neoadjuvant-treated tumour samples of a responder (a) and a non-responder patient (b-c); note the pan-cytokeratin (PanCK)-positive cancer cells (in pink) surrounding the nerve. The white line outlines the region of interest (ROI) analysed for protein expression. A total of 553 neural niches (84 ROI for pre-treatment samples and 469 ROI for neoadjuvant-treated) were identified and analysed. Original magnification, ×40. (d) Geometric ROI (white rectangle) showing a representative digital capture of the nerve (middle, shadowed, nerve capture panel) and the surrounding peri-neural niche, which was assessed for immune markers (right, shadowed, immune capture panel). The former was analysed for neural phenotypic markers and the latter for immune markers. (e) Box plots showing expression levels of neuro-protective marker ApoA-I in tumour-associated nerves (TANs) among pre-treatment tumour samples according to clinical response status. A higher expression among responders suggests a lower abundance of injured nerves compared to non-responders prior to anti-PD-1 therapy. Box plots display the median (centre line), the 25th and 75th percentiles (box limits), and the minimum and maximum values (whiskers). The statistical significance was determined using the Wilcoxon test, followed by the False Discovery Rate (FDR) calculation with the Benjamini and Hochberg method. (f) The box plot demonstrates the expression level of CD31, a marker of blood-nerve barrier reactivity and angiogenesis. The lack of difference in CD31 expression between responders and non-responders suggests that endothelial cells or blood vessels are not affected by CINI. Black dots represent individual samples. n = 118 perineural niches; FDR, false discovery rate.

Spatial transcriptomic analysis of tumour samples from an independent treatment naïve cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma patient cohort (n = 11). We examined the spatial relationships among three functional phenotypes: CINI, anti-tumoral immunity, and immunosuppressive inflammation. The anti-tumoral immunity phenotype included CD8A+GZMB+PRF1+ and CD4+IL2+ T cells, as well as CD86+IRF8+TNF+ and CD68+PSMB10+HLADQA1+HLADRA+HLADRB1+ antigen-presenting cells. The immunosuppressive inflammation phenotype comprised CD204+CD206+CD163+ and CD68+IL10+ tumour-associated macrophages, along with CD4+FOXP3+ T regulatory cells. The CINI signature included general markers for nerve detection (NEFL, NEFH, NEFM, NEUROD1, MRGPRD, TAC1, SSTR2, HAPLN4, SST) and nerve injury markers (ATF3, JUN, SOX1, SMAD1, BHLHE41, KLF7, KLF6). (a) Scatterplots show the overall correlation across the entire patient cohort. (b) Representative scatterplots showing correlations for individual patients. r, Pearson correlation coefficient.

(a) Illustration of experimental design: B16F10-OVA melanoma cells (2 × 105 cells) or non-tumorigenic keratinocytes (MPEK-BL6) were injected into the right hind paw of 8-week-old male and female mice. Fourteen days post-inoculation, the mice were euthanized, and the L3–L5 DRG neurons, which innervate the paw inoculated with tumour/keratinocytes, were harvested based on anatomy and underwent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). (Created with BioRender.com) (b) Neuron scRNA-seq cluster abundance bar plot – please see main text Fig. 4a for the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). (c) Neuron single-cell gene set enrichment analysis (sc-GSEA), based on the Hallmark dataset. The bubble plot shows the pairwise fold change for the top differentially enriched Hallmark pathways based on 1-way ANOVA. Bubble size represents the pairwise post hoc comparisons (Tukey test). The fold change colour scheme considered the first described group for each pairwise comparison (x-axis) as the numerator. KIN – keratinocytes-innervating neurons; MIN – melanoma-innervating neurons; CIN – Cancer-injured neurons. (d) Density heatmaps showing the distribution of scGSEA scores for inflammatory pathways across neurons in the KIN, MIN, and CIN groups. Each panel represents a distinct pathway: Hallmark Inflammatory Response, Hallmark IFN-γ Response, Hallmark IL–6–JAK–STAT3 Signalling, and Hallmark IFN-α Response. Warmer colours indicate a higher density of neurons at a given enrichment score. Notably, CIN neurons show a greater density at higher enrichment scores across all pathways. (e-f) Representative immunofluorescence images (e) and corresponding quantification (f) of ATF3 expression in L3–L5 dorsal-root-ganglion neurons innervating the melanoma-bearing paw (ipsilateral) versus the contralateral tumour-free paw (control). Tubb3 served as a pan-neuronal marker. Data are from n = 5 mice per group, and an unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test confirmed a significant difference between groups (p = 0.005). Box-and-whisker plots display the median (centre line), interquartile range (box), and full data range (whiskers). (g) Multiplex IF staining of melanoma (S100+) tumours from mice with a cre-flox conditional knockout of Atf3 in nociceptors neurons (NaV1.8cre::Atf3fl/fl, Atf3-cKO) versus their permissive littermate controls (NaV1.8 wt::Atf3fl/fl). The stains show a similar degree of myelin degradation (dMBP+) between the two experimental groups, but lack of Atf3 expression in the neurons (S100-) of the Atf3-cKO melanoma tumours. (h) Tumour weight plot of the experiment detailed in main text Fig. 4, comparing the weight (mg) of melanoma B16F10-OVA tumours which were extracted from littermate control (Nav1.8WT::Atf3fl/fl) (n = 5) or mice whose nociceptor neurons are cKO for Atf3 (Atf3-cKO) (n = 4) (Nav1.8cre::Atf3fl/fl). The statistical significance was determined using an unpaired two-tailed t-test (p = 0.033). (i) The dot plot illustrates the expression levels and the proportion of cells expressing the canonical marker genes employed to identify the immune cell types in the single-cell RNA sequencing data.

(a) Gating strategy used to assess the percentage of IFNγ+CD8+ T-cells in melanoma tumours from littermate controls and Atf3-cKO animals, shown in Fig. 4. (b) Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) of scRNA-seq data demonstrates the distribution of CD45+ cells from littermate controls and Atf3 cKO animals (left) and their phenotypes (right). See the main text, Fig. 4, for the abundance of each major immune subtype.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) anchors a conserved signalling pathway that regulates growth in response to nutrient availability1,2,3,4,5. Amino acids activate mTORC1 through the Rag GTPases, which are regulated by GATOR, a supercomplex consisting of GATOR1, KICSTOR and the nutrient-sensing hub GATOR2 (refs. 6,7,8,9). GATOR2 forms an octagonal cage, with its distinct WD40 domain β-propellers interacting with GATOR1 and the leucine sensors Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 (SESN1 and SESN2) and the arginine sensor CASTOR1 (ref. 10). The mechanisms through which these sensors regulate GATOR2 and how they detach from it upon binding their cognate amino acids remain unknown. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined the structures of a stabilized GATOR2 bound to either Sestrin2 or CASTOR1. The sensors occupy distinct and non-overlapping binding sites, disruption of which selectively impairs the ability of mTORC1 to sense individual amino acids. We also resolved the apo (leucine-free) structure of Sestrin2 and characterized the amino acid-induced structural rearrangements within Sestrin2 and CASTOR1 that trigger their dissociation from GATOR2. Binding of either sensor restricts the dynamic WDR24 β-propeller of GATOR2, a domain essential for nutrient-dependent mTORC1 activation. These findings reveal the allosteric mechanisms that convey amino acid sufficiency to GATOR2 and the ensuing structural changes that lead to mTORC1 activation.

The large eukaryotic protein kinase mTORC1 regulates mass accumulation, metabolism and ageing, and dysregulation of mTORC1 is associated with various common diseases, such as cancer and neurodegeneration1,2,3,4,5,11. Nutrients activate mTORC1 by promoting its translocation to the lysosomal surface. This process depends on the heterodimeric Rag GTPases (RagA or RagB bound to RagC or RagD) and several protein complexes that control their localization and nucleotide state, including Ragulator and GATOR, an approximately 2 MDa supercomplex comprising two subcomplexes: GATOR1–KICSTOR and GATOR2 (refs. 6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,15). Although the biochemical function of GATOR2 is unknown, genetic experiments have shown that it opposes GATOR1, an inhibitor of mTORC1 signalling that serves as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) towards RagA/B7. In human cells, GATOR2 serves as the primary conduit through which nutrients signal to mTORC1 via the leucine sensors Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 and the arginine sensor CASTOR1, which directly interact with GATOR2 in the absence of their respective ligands7,10,16,17. Although structures of CASTOR1 in the apo and arginine-bound forms have been determined18,19,20, only the leucine-bound structure of Sestrin2 has been resolved, with its apo form remaining unsolved21,22. Recently, the structures of human and budding yeast GATOR2 (SEACAT in yeast) were determined and revealed that human GATOR2 forms a large cage decorated with WD40 domain β-propellers that interact with Sestrin2 and CASTOR1 to convey nutrient cues10,23. However, several major mechanistic questions remain unanswered, including how the nutrient sensors impact GATOR2 and how ligand binding mechanistically relieves their inhibition. Here we present the structures of GATOR2 bound to Sestrin2 or CASTOR1 and shed light on these questions.

We previously determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the apo GATOR2 complex, produced by co-expressing its five core subunits (WDR24, WDR59, MIOS, SEC13 and SEH1L), which form heterodimer pairs consisting of MIOS–SEH1L, WDR24–SEH1L and WDR59–SEC13 (ref. 10). During single-particle analysis, however, it became apparent that most GATOR2 particles were incomplete, missing at least one of the smaller SEH1L or SEC13 subunits required for GATOR2 to interact with partners, including Sestrin2 and CASTOR1.

To address this problem, we generated ‘single-chain' variants of WDR24, MIOS and WDR59, in which SEH1L or SEC13 were inserted in frame into their cognate heterodimer partners, each of which donates a three-stranded β-blade to complete the β-propellers of SEH1L or SEC13. Thus, the single-chain variants each encode two complete WD40 β-propellers, ensuring full subunit occupancy of GATOR2 particles (Fig. 1a).

The grey trapezoids indicate β-blade donation by WDR24, MIOS or WDR59 to complete the β-propellers of SEH1L or SEC13. b, sc-GATOR2 interacts with GATOR1, KICSTOR and the nutrient sensors. Anti-Flag immunoprecipitates (IPs) were prepared from MIOS-deficient HEK293T cells transiently expressing the indicated cDNAs and were analysed by immunoblotting for the indicated proteins. Data are representative of two independent experiments.

Views of the experimental maps are shown. Sestrin2 and CASTOR1 bind to distinct, non-overlapping sites on sc-GATOR2. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.

We verified that individual single-chain variants sc-WDR24–SEH1L, sc-MIOS–SEH1L and sc-WDR59–SEC13 restore amino acid-dependent mTORC1 activation to knockout cell lines comparably with separately expressed GATOR2 components (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). We also confirmed that co-expressed single-chain constructs assemble into a sc-GATOR2 variant that binds to Sestrin2, CASTOR1, GATOR1 and KICSTOR, and that more effectively reactivates mTORC1 signalling in MIOS-null cells than wild-type GATOR2 (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1d–g). These results also indicate that dissociation of SEH1L or SEC13 is not a regulatory mechanism required for nutrient signalling through GATOR2.

We transiently expressed sc-GATOR2 in HEK293F cells and purified it by affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1c,d). The resulting elution profile and subunit stoichiometry of sc-GATOR2 matched those of wild-type GATOR2, leading us to a successful cryo-EM structure determination at 3.47 Å resolution (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 1h,i, Supplementary Figs. 2–5 and Supplementary Video 1).

sc-GATOR2 exhibits an architecture that closely mirrors that of wild-type GATOR2, with four MIOS–SEH1L, two WDR24–SEH1L and two WDR59–SEC13 heterodimeric subunits assembling into a symmetric cage built on an octagonal scaffold10 (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1j). The scaffolds of sc-GATOR2 and wild-type GATOR2 were nearly superimposable with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.1 Å (Extended Data Fig. 1j). Local resolution analysis confirmed complete occupancy of SEH1L and SEC13, as expected given their covalent fusion to their core GATOR2 partners (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). Consistent with greater particle integrity in sc-GATOR2, we were able to model an additional region of WDR24 (residues 610–630), extending along WDR59 and its associated SEC13 subunit (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c), as well as a portion of the engineered sc-WDR59–SEC13 linker (Extended Data Fig. 2d–f). As with wild-type GATOR2, we were unable to visualize the N-terminal β-propeller and RWD domains of WDR59 (Extended Data Fig. 1j). Similarly, the local resolution corresponding to the WDR24 β-propeller was limited, suggesting that this domain is either flexible or conformationally dynamic (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). We conclude that sc-GATOR2 recapitulates the structure and function of wild-type GATOR2.

To obtain a GATOR2–Sestrin2 co-complex, we transiently co-expressed sc-GATOR2 with a Sestrin2 mutant (Glu451Gln) that does not bind to leucine and constitutively associates with GATOR2 (ref. 21). We further supplemented the affinity-purified sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2 complex with additional purified Sestrin2 before size-exclusion chromatography. Compared with apo sc-GATOR2, the sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2 complex eluted with a larger apparent hydrodynamic radius, indicating a conformational rearrangement upon Sestrin2 binding (Fig. 1c,d).

We determined the structure of the sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2 complex using single-particle cryo-EM at a resolution of 3.36 Å (Figs. 1e and 2a,b, Supplementary Figs. 6–9 and Supplementary Video 1) and found that Sestrin2 binding did not induce any major structural rearrangements involving the GATOR2 α-solenoidal domain or C-termainal domain (CTD). Among the sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2 complex particles, the vast majority were doubly occupied, indicating that two polypeptides of Sestrin2, and probably Sestrin1 and Sestrin3, can simultaneously bind to the same GATOR2 particle (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Comparison of the structures of leucine-bound Sestrin2 (pink; 5DJ4 rebuilt) with leucine-free, GATOR2-bound Sestrin2 (magenta). i, The binding of leucine to Sestrin2 promotes the formation of helices αL1 and αL2 atop Sestrin2. j, The binding of leucine to Sestrin2 repositions the ‘lid' to close the leucine-binding pocket and allow for the formation of helix αL1. k, The formation of the Sestrin2 helix αL2 repositions critical residues, including Arg404 and Arg338, that repel GATOR2. Data are representative of two independent experiments (g,h). For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.

Sestrin2 directly bound to the obtuse surface created between the bottom face of the WDR24 β-propeller and the lateral sides of the SEH1L(WDR24) β-propeller (Fig. 2a–f). The interaction is driven by the negatively charged surface of Sestrin2 helices αC1 and αC2 (Fig. 2c) and the αC3–αC4 loop (Fig. 2d), which are recognized by a positively charged surface formed by multiple WDR24 β-propeller loops. Key interactions involve the WDR24 residue Arg228 and the Sestrin2 residues Tyr349, Glu345 and Asp364. The Sestrin2 residues Asp406, Asp407 and Gln340 form a hydrogen bond network that stabilizes two Sestrin2 loops and engage the WDR24 residues Arg46 and Arg121. The interface is further supported by an extensive hydrophobic network, including the WDR24 residues Met273 and Val274; the Sestrin2 residues Leu191, Ile195, Leu351, Ile352, Leu355, Leu472 and Leu479; and the SEH1L residue Val110, which forms at the junction where all three proteins meet (Fig. 2e). In addition, SEH1L enhances the recruitment of Sestrin2 via its blades 2 and 3, with critical involvement of residue Asp111 (Fig. 2e).

We confirmed that these residues (particularly the WDR24 residues Arg46, Arg121 and Arg228) are critical for the GATOR2–Sestrin2 interaction by co-immunoprecipitation after complementation of WDR24-deficient cells (Fig. 2g). We mutagenized SEH1L within the WDR24–SEH1L single-chain construct so as not to disrupt its roles in other cellular pathways and found that disruption of the Sestrin2 interaction surface on SEH1L was sufficient to disrupt the GATOR2–Sestrin2 interaction (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Reciprocal mutagenesis of Sestrin2 validated the GATOR2–Sestrin2 interaction surface and confirmed the essential role of the Sestrin2 residues Asp406 and Asp407 (Fig. 2h). These results establish that the GATOR2–Sestrin2 interaction is principally driven by electrostatic interactions between a basic surface on WDR24 and a complementary, acidic surface on Sestrin2 (Fig. 2d,g,h). As previously reported, Sestrin2 must bind to GATOR2 to inhibit mTORC1 signalling when overexpressed21 (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Sestrin2 also makes auxiliary contacts with the MIOS CTD, including through the Sestrin2 residue Asp104, which is positioned against SEH1L(WDR24) in the MIOS–WDR24 CTD–CTD junction (Fig. 2f). Disruption of this interface weakened the association between GATOR2 and Sestrin2 (Fig. 2h).

GATOR2 variants that cannot bind to Sestrin2 were also unable to interact with Sestrin1 or Sestrin3, indicating that the Sestrin proteins share a common binding site, consistent with the conservation of residues involved in GATOR2 binding (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d).

Given that the WDR24 β-propeller is required for mTORC1 activation, we sought to identify the WDR24 variants that are able to signal to mTORC1 but unable to interact with Sestrin2. Although mutations of some residues critical for Sestrin2 binding (for example, Arg121) abolished mTORC1 signalling, substitution of other residues (for example, Arg46 and Met273) did not affect it (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Thus, GATOR2 uses partially overlapping surfaces for binding Sestrin2 and for activating mTORC1, suggesting that the Sestrins directly occlude a crucial GATOR2 function.

The GATOR2–Sestrin2 interaction was required for cells to sense the absence of leucine, but not arginine (Extended Data Fig. 3f), similar to cells lacking all Sestrins16. Likewise, overexpression of Sestrin2 variants deficient in GATOR2 binding failed to inhibit mTORC1 signalling (Extended Data Fig. 3b). These results provide further evidence that mTORC1 senses leucine availability through the Sestrin1/2–GATOR2 axis.

Until now, the structure of leucine-free Sestrin2 has remained unsolved because apo Sestrin2 is unstable and not amenable to purification and structural studies22. Furthermore, artificial intelligence-based structure prediction algorithms have yet to model conformational differences between wild-type Sestrin2 and variants that cannot bind to leucine24. Here we observed no density corresponding to leucine in the Sestrin2 ligand binding pocket. Thus, we have captured the apo state of Sestrin2 (Fig. 2i). These observations suggest that Sestrin2 binds mutually exclusively to either GATOR2 or to leucine. The leucine-binding pocket of Sestrin2 does not contribute to the GATOR2-binding surface and is solvent accessible, suggesting that Sestrin2 can encounter leucine without needing to first dissociate from GATOR2 (Fig. 2i).

There is a high degree of core structural similarity between the leucine-bound Sestrin2 structure (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 5DJ4) and our structure of apo Sestrin2 in complex with sc-GATOR2 (RMSD of approximately 1.15 Å)21. However, we identified two critical features that differentiate these two structures and suggest a mechanism for leucine-dependent dissociation of Sestrin2 from GATOR2 (Fig. 2i–k).

First, we observed that the Sestrin2 loop αC2–αC3 adopts a fully extended configuration when bound to GATOR2 (Fig. 2j), unlike the compacted two-stranded β-sheet ‘lid' covering the pocket entrance in leucine-bound Sestrin2. Second, a significant proportion of the ‘linker' region (residues 220–338), which connects the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes of Sestrin2, is either absent in our structure or undergoes substantial conformational changes. Specifically, a 14-residue segment within the linker region (residues 324–338, the ‘transducer segment') exhibits a dramatic shift in both backbone and side-chain positions. In addition, the characteristic helix–loop–helix motif (αL1–αL2) seen in the leucine-bound Sestrin2 structure is flexible and missing from our structure. Overlaying the leucine-bound Sestrin2 structure with our sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2 structure revealed that the αL1–αL2 helix–loop–helix would directly clash with both the extended ligand pocket lid and the rearranged 14-residue transducer segment. Thus, leucine binding to Sestrin2 is associated with compaction of the αC2–αC3 loop and reorganization of the linker region, allowing for the formation of the αL1–αL2 helices.

Sestrin2 αL1 contains Leu261, which is required for leucine binding and dissociation from GATOR2 (ref. 16). We wondered whether the formation of the αL1 and αL2 helices is needed for leucine to disrupt the GATOR2–Sestrin2 interaction. To test this hypothesis, we generated variants of Sestrin2 containing substitutions in αL2 (Glu288Ala and Lys291Ala) designed to disrupt its packing against the Sestrin2 linker residues 333–336 (Fig. 2k), and we found that leucine failed to break the complex formed between GATOR2 and these variants (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Thus, intramolecular interactions distant from the ligand-binding pocket are required for leucine to disrupt the GATOR2–Sestrin2 interaction.

The leucine-binding pocket and the GATOR2-binding surfaces are located on distinct faces of Sestrin2, suggesting that bound leucine does not directly break the GATOR2–Sestrin2 complex. To clarify the mechanism of Sestrin2 release from GATOR2, we compared leucine-bound Sestrin2 and the GATOR2-bound apo Sestrin2 (Fig. 2i–k). Neither the rigidified αL1 and αL2 helices, nor their connecting linker, directly clash with GATOR2, indicating that their leucine-dependent formation does not preclude the GATOR2–Sestrin2 interaction (Fig. 2i). We then considered whether leucine binding may allosterically reorganize the GATOR2–Sestrin2 interface.

The Sestrin2 residue Asp406 forms a salt bridge with the WDR24 residue Arg46, which is essential for the GATOR2–Sestrin2 interaction21. When bound to GATOR2, the Sestrin2 residue Asp406 also interacts with the side chain of the Sestrin2 residue Arg338, orienting it towards the body of Sestrin2 (Fig. 2k). We found that leucine binding is associated with a molecular cascade that reorients the Arg338 side chain. Specifically, leucine binding reconfigures the ligand-binding pocket lid and allows for rigidification of αL1 and αL2. Residues within the transducer segment, including Thr327, must reposition to resolve clashes caused by αL1 and αL2. Of note, after a clash with Phe287 in αL2, the side chain of the Sestrin2 residue Arg404 shifts towards Arg338, which in turn shifts towards the GATOR2 interface and clashes with the WDR24 residue Arg46. We propose that this allosteric cascade disrupts the GATOR2–Sestrin2 interaction through a repulsive interaction between the Sestrin2 residue Arg338 and the WDR24 residue Arg46 (Fig. 2k and Supplementary Video 2).

Indeed, we found that leucine could not dissociate Sestrin2(Arg404Gly) or Sestrin2(Arg338Ala), variants deficient in the allosteric cascade, from GATOR2 in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 4b). These findings suggest that leucine increases the off-rate of Sestrin2 from GATOR2. As we could not determine the precise positions of all Sestrin2 αL1–αL2 linker segment side chains, it is possible that additional residues may contribute to the leucine-stimulated dissociation of Sestrin2 from GATOR2. As the structure of apo Sestrin2 in its free state remains unknown, we also note that some structural features observed in our sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2 complex may be induced by GATOR2 binding rather than loss of leucine.

Using a similar approach as with Sestrin2, we prepared the sc-GATOR2–CASTOR1 complex and analysed its structure using cryo-EM (Fig. 1c,d). We determined the structure of the CASTOR1-bound sc-GATOR2 complex using single-particle cryo-EM, achieving a resolution of 3.40 Å (Figs. 1e and 3a,b, Supplementary Figs. 10–13 and Supplementary Video 1).

Data are representative of two independent experiments (e,f). For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.

CASTOR1 is a homodimer, and both protomers are required to engage GATOR2 and inhibit mTORC1 signalling17,19. We discovered that the CASTOR1 dimer binds to the GATOR2 ‘brace', with each CASTOR1 protomer interacting in a structurally equivalent manner with the bottom face of one MIOS β-propeller (Fig. 3a,b). In a subset of particles, we detected a CASTOR1 dimer associated with the opposite ‘glove' side of GATOR2 via only a single MIOS β-propeller (Fig. 3a). The inhibitory function of CASTOR1 requires two GATOR2-binding sites19, so we suspect that these glove-associated CASTOR1 molecules are technical artefacts due to supplementation of excess free CASTOR1.

Three connecting loops of the MIOS β-propeller (β2.4–β3.1, β3.2–β3.3 and β3.4–β4.1) constitute the CASTOR1-binding site (Fig. 3c,d). The middle MIOS loop β3.2–β3.3 projects its Arg137 side chain into a cleft formed by the CASTOR1 ACT2–ACT4 interface, where it makes a salt bridge with the CASTOR1 residue Asp121, which is essential for the GATOR2–CASTOR1 interaction19 (Fig. 3c). The flanking MIOS loops provide additional cross-loop hydrogen bonding that supports their fully outstretched configurations (Arg114, His136, Asp139 and Asn184). The MIOS loop β2.4–β3.1 interacts with CASTOR1 via a combination of backbone and side-chain hydrogen bonding, driven by the MIOS residues Lys111, His112 and Ala113 and the CASTOR1 residue Ser258, as well as Tyr118, a residue previously implicated in GATOR2 binding19 (Fig. 3c).

CASTOR1 also extends an 8-residue loop β6–α3 (residues 83–90) that engages the interface between the third and the fourth MIOS blades. Aside from weak interactions with the MIOS residues Phe221 and Gln218 (Fig. 3c), this loop lacks a strong electrostatic anchor point, as indicated by its low resolution in our structure.

We validated the GATOR2–CASTOR1 interaction through complementation of MIOS-deficient cell lines and found that the MIOS residue Arg137 is essential for GATOR2 to bind to CASTOR1 (Fig. 3e). GATOR2 was also unable to interact with CASTOR2 in cells expressing the MIOS(Arg137Ala) variant, indicating that CASTORs share a binding mode (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Similarly, we found that the CASTOR1 residues Tyr118, Gln119 and Asp121 are required for the interaction with GATOR2 (Fig. 3f). In agreement, wild-type CASTOR1, but not the CASTOR1(Tyr118Ala/Gln119Ala) or CASTOR1(Asp121Ala) mutants, suppressed mTORC1 signalling when overexpressed (Extended Data Fig. 5b).

We previously found that the MIOS β-propeller is necessary for arginine deprivation to inhibit mTORC1 (ref. 10) (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Likewise, mTORC1 signalling in cells expressing MIOS(Arg137Ala) is resistant to regulation by arginine but could be suppressed by leucine starvation (Extended Data Fig. 5e). These findings reinforce that the GATOR2–CASTOR1 interaction transmits arginine availability to mTORC1.

Previous crystallographic studies have reported nearly identical configurations of apo and arginine-bound CASTOR1 in the crystal18,19,20. Here, however, we identified several structural features unique to GATOR2-bound CASTOR1. First, we observed a subtle rotation (approximately 15°) in the relative angle between the two protomers of CASTOR1. Of note, this angled conformation is not unique to the double-engaged MIOS brace β-propellers but also appears on the ‘glove' side of GATOR2, where CASTOR1 engages a single MIOS β-propeller. We also resolved the CASTOR1 β6–α3 loop (residues 82–90), which adopts a conformation different from those determined in the crystal structures of CASTOR1 in either the apo or arginine-bound forms18,19,20 (Fig. 3c). Finally, we built the CASTOR1 loop β10–β11 (residues 157–173), which connects the ACT2 and ACT3 domains. We suspect that these apparent differences may be artefacts of crystal packing that limited previous studies.

The CASTOR1 arginine-binding pocket and GATOR2-interacting surface are located on distinct surfaces, so we reasoned that arginine may allosterically regulate the GATOR2–CASTOR1 interaction. We analysed our sc-GATOR2–CASTOR1 structure alongside published structures of free CASTOR1. Apart from the presence of arginine, the position of the β6–α3 loop (residues 82–90) emerged as the second most distinguishing feature. This loop is absent in the apo CASTOR1 structure and inconsistently modelled in arginine-bound structures18,19,20. By re-evaluating the density maps of all protein chains, we found that many CASTOR1 protomers did exhibit a common position of the β6–α3 loop, distinct from that seen in our sc-GATOR2–CASTOR1 structure, that was not attributable to crystal packing. In fact, we were able to build the missing β6–α3 loop into the 1.8 Å density map of arginine-bound CASTOR1 (PDB ID: 5I2C)19. We propose that arginine binding triggers a series of structural rearrangements that reposition the β6–α3 loop to promote release of CASTOR1 from GATOR2 (Supplementary Video 3).

First, arginine binding triggers compaction of the CASTOR1 ligand-binding pocket lid (loop β14–α7), which repositions several residues essential for engaging arginine (Fig. 3h). This compaction creates a hydrophobic repulsion between Leu273 and Ile280, displacing helix α7 by approximately one-half turn towards MIOS (Fig. 3h). This shift alters the local chemical environment at the interface between helix α7 and the adjacent discontinuous helix α3, causing helix α3 to kink dramatically by around 60° (Fig. 3i). To accommodate this kink, Tyr297 reorients its side chain, and the new position of helix α3 is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions involving Val94 and hydrogen bonding via Thr95. As helix α3 kinks, it pulls along the β6–α3 loop, causing the Ala92 residue in this loop to collide with the MIOS residue Arg137 (Fig. 3i). We propose that this series of allosteric events disrupts the GATOR2–CASTOR1 interaction by creating a direct clash between the CASTOR1 residue Ala92 and the MIOS residue Arg137 (Fig. 3i).

We generated a CASTOR1 variant with a shortened loop β6–α3 (∆85–90), which we hypothesized might preclude its reorientation and clash with GATOR2, and found that this truncation mutant more effectively immunoprecipitated GATOR2 from arginine-starved cells than wild-type CASTOR1 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Likewise, arginine did not disrupt the CASTOR1(∆85–90)–GATOR2 complex in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 6b). We also introduced a Val94Asp mutation into helix α3 of CASTOR1 and found that this substitution partially impaired the arginine-mediated release of CASTOR1 from GATOR2 in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Thus, we conclude that the reconfiguration of the CASTOR1 helix α3 is critical for its arginine-stimulated dissociation from GATOR2.

Through molecular dynamics simulations, we found that the ligand-binding lid of CASTOR1 is tightly closed and does not open over long simulation times (approximately 2.5 µs; Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). We wondered whether a multistep binding process might be required in which pocket lid opening is followed by translocation of arginine into the pocket. During dissociation from CASTOR1, we found that arginine pauses near helix α7 for 20 ns on average, maintaining hydrogen bond interactions with residues Ser111 and Glu277, before fully dissociating. We propose that arginine also enters CASTOR1 through this two-step route and that an interaction with helix α7 is an intermediate required to release CASTOR1 from GATOR2. Indeed, we mutated the CASTOR1 residue Glu277, which does not participate in arginine binding at the orthosteric site, to alanine and observed that this mutation strengthened the GATOR2–CASTOR1 interaction and blunted the ability of arginine to disrupt the complex in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 7c–g). Thus, CASTOR1 binds to arginine through a multistep process with crucial transient intermediate states.

We next considered the effect of CASTOR1 on the GATOR2 scaffold. CASTOR1 binds to GATOR2 at the brace, formed by dimerization of two MIOS β-propellers (Fig. 3a,b). Compared with apo sc-GATOR2, we observed that CASTOR1 binding causes the two MIOS brace β-propellers to move apart, leading to the relative translation and rotation of the adjacent SEH1L(MIOS) (Fig. 1e). In apo sc-GATOR2, as in wild-type GATOR2, SEH1L(MIOS) rigidifies the scaffold by binding the WDR59 zinc-finger (ZnF) domain. However, in CASTOR1-bound sc-GATOR2, we were unable to detect density corresponding to the WDR59 ZnF (Extended Data Fig. 8a). The cross-section of the scaffold is thinnest at the CTD–CTD junctions and the loss of the WDR59 ZnF compromises scaffold rigidity. This effectively creates a hinge at that position, enabling remodelling of the shape of the scaffold. We found that the forced separation of the MIOS brace β-propellers, driven by CASTOR1 binding, results in a more compact and squared GATOR2 scaffold than that of apo GATOR2 (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 8b and Supplementary Video 4).

To investigate the role of the WDR59 ZnF in mTORC1 signalling, we generated a mutant (Cys914Ala/Cys917Ala) that mimics the disruptive effect of CASTOR1. This mutant GATOR2 showed reduced interaction with GATOR1–KICSTOR and blunted activation of mTORC1 signalling compared with wild-type WDR59 (Extended Data Fig. 8c). In parallel, we tested the ability of CASTOR1 to co-immunoprecipitate the GATOR subcomplexes. Unlike Sestrin2, which co-immunoprecipitated with all GATOR subcomplexes, or SAMTOR, which exclusively co-immunoprecipitated with GATOR1–KICSTOR, CASTOR1 predominantly captured GATOR2 (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Thus, CASTOR1 influences subcomplex interactions within GATOR. These results suggest that CASTOR1 allosterically reshapes the GATOR2 scaffold, which weakens the GATOR2–GATOR1 interaction and dampens mTORC1 activation.

The WDR24 β-propeller is critical for the function, but not the structure, of GATOR2 (ref. 10). We were unable to detect the WDR24 β-propellers in most particles used to determine the structure of apo sc-GATOR2, suggesting that this domain is flexible (Supplementary Fig. 2). The association of Sestrin2 significantly enhanced the detection of the WDR24 β-propellers during single-particle analysis as did the binding of CASTOR1 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs. 6 and 10). Both Sestrin2 and CASTOR1 increased the apparent hydrodynamic radius of sc-GATOR2 (Fig. 1c), possibly consistent with rigidification of the WDR24 β-propeller, so we wondered whether stabilization of this domain could reflect a common mechanism of GATOR2 regulation.

a, Association of either CASTOR1 or Sestrin2 stabilizes the dynamic WDR24 β-propellers and promotes their attachment to the GATOR2 scaffold. b, Quantification of the WDR24 β-propeller position in apo GATOR2, sc-GATOR2–CASTOR1 and sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2 particles used for structural determination. Both Sestrin2 and CASTOR1 rigidify the WDR24 β-propeller, but Sestrin2 does so more effectively. Data are mean and s.d. c, Epitope tagging of the WDR24 N-terminal β-propeller impairs mTORC1 activation in a tag size-dependent manner. WDR24-deficient cells transiently expressing the indicated cDNAs were starved of all amino acids for 60 min and restimulated with all amino acids for 15 min before collection. Anti-HA IPs were prepared and analysed by immunoblotting for the indicated proteins. Data are representative of two independent experiments. For gel source data, see Supplementary Fig. 1.

We generated a mask covering the positions of the two WDR24 β-propellers and we reanalysed our single-particle datasets to quantify their occupancy (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Most apo sc-GATOR2 particles exhibited no detectable WDR24 β-propeller density (Fig. 4b). By contrast, most of the sc-GATOR2–CASTOR1 particles had at least one detectable WDR24 β-propeller and both WDR24 β-propellers were resolved in the overwhelming majority of sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2 particles (Fig. 4b).

Principal component analysis of conformational heterogeneity within the sc-GATOR2 particle revealed two major internal motions: lateral and longitudinal (Supplementary Video 5). Both motions compress the two halves of sc-GATOR2, bringing the MIOS glove β-propellers closer together. Of note, the occupancy of the WDR24 β-propeller remains stable across longitudinal motion states but improves dramatically in the fully outstretched configuration of the lateral motion trajectory. Nutrient sensors modulate these dynamics in distinct ways: CASTOR1 stabilizes WDR24 occupancy across the entire lateral trajectory by gently squaring the GATOR2 scaffold, whereas Sestrin2 restricts longitudinal motion through direct association with the WDR24 β-propeller.

In general, we found that mTORC1 signalling is more sensitive to deprivation of leucine than arginine25, which may reflect the greater degree of WDR24 β-propeller restraint imparted by Sestrin2 than by CASTOR1. In agreement, we found that fusion of an epitope tag to the WDR24 β-propeller inhibited mTORC1 activation in a manner that correlated with its size (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9b). Collectively, these results suggest that WDR24 β-propeller flexibility is required for GATOR2 to stimulate mTORC1 signalling, and that both Sestrin2 and CASTOR1 antagonize the function of this domain.

The GATOR2 complex is a critical nutrient-sensing hub and regulator of mTORC1 signalling7,10. Despite its importance, the mechanisms by which amino acids influence GATOR2 through their cognate sensors have remained elusive. Here we determined the structure of GATOR2 when bound to its nutrient-gated regulators: Sestrin2 and CASTOR1. We have revealed that the Sestrin and CASTOR protein families occupy non-overlapping binding sites and antagonize GATOR2 function through both distinct and common mechanisms.

The ligand-binding pockets of both Sestrin2 and CASTOR1 do not directly overlap with their respective GATOR2-interacting surfaces, suggesting that ligand binding does not first require dissociation from GATOR2. Our results suggest that cognate ligand binding triggers allosteric changes in the nutrient sensors, which reconfigure their GATOR2-binding surfaces to form steric clashes that dissociate them from GATOR2. Thus, GATOR2 can ‘read' the ligand state of a nutrient sensor by interacting with a dynamic portion of the sensor, distant from its ligand-binding pocket. We suspect that nutrient-stimulated allosteric rearrangements probably also prevent nutrient sensor reassociation until cytosolic nutrient levels fall and the sensors dissociate from their ligands.

We also found that auxiliary structural features of the nutrient sensors, distant from the ligand-binding pockets, are required for stable association with a sensed metabolite. We speculate that the evolution of these allosterically regulated intramolecular interactions, which stabilize the ligand-bound form of the sensor, might have enabled the adaptation of ancestral enzymes with intrinsically weaker ligand affinities into nutrient sensors capable of stable engagement with their cognate metabolites. These sensors could then have been assimilated into the mTORC1 pathway through the evolution of an interaction between the sensor and a critical GATOR2 region. Given the role for allostery in ligand binding, divergent residues located at surfaces other than the ligand-binding pocket or the GATOR2 interaction surface, such as the poorly resolved Sestrin N termini, may explain the different ligand-binding affinities of Sestrin1–3 and CASTOR1–2 (refs. 16,17).

Despite interacting with distinct surfaces on GATOR2, we found that both Sestrin2 and CASTOR1 promote WDR24 β-propeller rigidification, suggesting that this may be a shared mechanism of GATOR2 antagonism. Our results also suggest that the extent of WDR24 β-propeller interference dictates the potency of mTORC1 inhibition. CASTOR1-dependent allosteric stabilization of the WDR24 β-propeller may also potentiate the GATOR2–Sestrin2 interaction, hinting at synergistic regulation of mTORC1 signalling by distinct amino acids. We also found that the nutrients sensors impact GATOR2 through unique mechanisms: Sestrin2 obstructs an essential GATOR2 functional surface and CASTOR1 reshapes the GATOR2 scaffold and weakens assembly of the GATOR supercomplex. Previously, WDR24 was proposed to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase regulated by direct interaction between Sestrin2 and its RING domain26. We report, however, that Sestrin2 does not affect the fold or solvent accessibility of the WDR24 RING domain, which does not interact with Sestrin2.

The Drosophila melanogaster protein Unmet was identified as a lineage-specific S-adenosyl methionine sensor for the dTORC1 pathway27. Like CASTOR1, Unmet is a dimer and requires the MIOS β-propeller to interact with GATOR2, which suggests that CASTOR1 and Unmet may share a binding site and mechanism of GATOR2 inhibition. Yet-to-be-discovered nutrient sensors may also function through GATOR2 β-propellers.

The study of amino acid sensing by mTORC1 in vivo is complicated by the presence of multiple members of the Sestrin and CASTOR families in mammalian genomes, necessitating generation of simultaneous loss-of-function variants28. Here we generated single amino acid substitution variants in GATOR2 that rendered mTORC1 signalling resistant to either Sestrins or CASTORs. We anticipate that these GATOR2 variants will facilitate delineation of distinct physiological roles for leucine and arginine sensing by mTORC1 in vivo.

As of submission, artificial intelligence-driven structural prediction tools, trained on the PDB, cannot adequately model the conformational changes that occur in the nutrient sensors upon ligand or GATOR2 binding24,29. We anticipate that empirical structural determination of the GATOR complex, including its unresolved component KICSTOR and regulator SAMTOR, will be critical to unveil the regulatory logic of the mTORC1 nutrient-sensing pathway and to rationally design therapeutics to modulate its function.

Adherent HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% inactivated fetal serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 4.5 g l−1 glucose containing 2 mM GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 IU ml−1 penicillin and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin. Adherent cell lines were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Expi293F cells were grown in Expi293 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 100 IU ml−1 penicillin and 100 µg ml−1 streptomycin. Suspension cells were grown in an INFORS Multitron Pro shaker operating at 37 °C, 8% CO2, 80% humidity and 90–125 rpm. HEK293T cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and Expi293F cells were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. All cell lines were validated and tested for mycoplasma.

Transfection, cell lysis and immunoprecipitations were performed as previously described10. To harvest samples, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and then lysed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 40 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 10 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mM pyrophosphate and 2.5 mM MgCl2) and 1 tablet of EDTA-free protease cocktail (Roche) per 25 ml buffer. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 21,000g at 4 °C for 10 min.

For anti-Flag immunoprecipitations, magnetic beads bound to antibody recognizing the Flag epitope tag were prepared in-house by coupling Dynabeads M-270 epoxy (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to Flag-M2 antibody (MilliporeSigma) as previously described10. For anti-HA immunoprecipitations, anti-HA-coupled magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used. Before use, beads were washed three times with Triton X-100 lysis buffer and then incubated with the supernatant of each clarified lysate for 1 h at 4 °C. Each immunoprecipitation used 10 µl of anti-Flag or 30 µl of anti-HA magnetic beads. For anti-MYC immunoprecipitations (Extended Data Fig. 9b), 4 µl of anti-MYC antibody was added to each sample of clarified lysate and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, 30 µl of pre-washed protein G magnetic beads was added to each sample and incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Following immunoprecipitation, beads were washed one time with Triton X-100 lysis buffer and two times with Triton X-100 lysis buffer supplemented to contain 150–500 mM NaCl. Immunoprecipitated proteins were denatured by addition of SDS–PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then resolved by 4–20% SDS–PAGE before analysis by immunoblotting.

For experiments requiring transfection of cDNAs into HEK293T cells, 2 × 106 cells were plated in 10-cm culture dishes or 5 × 106 cells in 15-cm culture dishes. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with the appropriate pRK5-based cDNA expression plasmids using the polyethylenimine method, as previously described30. The total amount of plasmid DNA in each transfection was normalized to 5 μg with empty pRK5 (10-cm plates) or 20 µg of empty pRK5 (15-cm plates). Thirty-six hours following transfection, cells were lysed as described above.

For experiments that required amino acid starvation, cells were incubated in amino acid-free RPMI for 60 min, as previously described31. To restimulate cells following starvation, an amino acid mixture prepared from individual powders of amino acids (MilliporeSigma) was added to cell culture media for 15 min. Starvations for individual amino acids were performed similarly.

Experiments evaluating the in vitro dissociation of GATOR2–sensors complexes were performed as previously described16,17,19,21, with the following modifications. Following immunoprecipitation, washing and equilibration in cytosolic buffer, the beads incubated with either 300 µM leucine or 400 µM arginine for 20 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The beads were then washed twice more, after which the samples were denatured by addition of sample buffer and analysed by immunoblotting, as described above.

Sestrin2, CASTOR1 and wild-type GATOR2 were expressed and purified as previously described10. For purification of sc-GATOR2, 5 l of Expi293F cells grown in Expi293 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding N-terminally Flag-tagged sc-WDR59–SEC13 (Addgene 237416), tag-free sc-MIOS–SEH1L (Addgene 237417) and tag-free sc-WDR24–SEH1L (Addgene 237418) in the pRK5 vector. To prepare sc-GATOR2 in complex with Sestrin2 or CASTOR1, the cDNA mixture was supplemented with HA–Sestrin2(E451Q) (Addgene 237420) or HA–CASTOR1(D304A) (Addgene 237419) in the pRK5 vector, respectively. Cells were transfected at a density of 3 × 106 per millilitre with 1 mg total cDNA and 4 mg PEI MAX 40 K (Polysciences) per litre culture. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were harvested, washed in ice-cold PBS and then lysed in Triton lysis buffer (TLB; 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM arginine, 50 mM glutamic acid and 2.5 mM MgCl2) with EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche; 1 tablet per 25 ml buffer) and 1 mM ATP (100 ml of lysis buffer was used per litre cell culture). The lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation at 50,000g for 20 min. Pre-washed anti-FLAG-M2 affinity gel (MilliporeSigma) was added to the clarified lysate (2 ml slurry per litre culture) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a nutator. The beads were washed once in TLB, twice in TLB supplemented with 50 mM NaCl, once in CHAPS buffer (0.1% CHAPS, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM arginine, 50 mM glutamic acid and 2 mM MgCl2), once in CHAPS buffer supplemented with 20 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM ATP, and once again in CHAPS buffer. The GATOR2 complex was eluted from the beads by competitive elution in CHAPS buffer supplemented with 0.5 mg ml−1 3× Flag peptide (sequence DYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDK). Eluate was collected with bead separator columns, concentrated with a regenerated-cellulose centrifugal filter (100 kDa MWCO; MilliporeSigma), and clarified by centrifugation at 21,000g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove any debris. Further purification was performed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a TSKgel G4000SWxl column (Tosoh) pre-equilibrated in CHAPS buffer supplemented with 2 mM dithiothreitol. Before SEC purification of the sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2 or sc-GATOR2–CASTOR1 complexes, the eluates were supplemented with fivefold molar excess of purified wild-type Sestrin2 or CASTOR1(D304A), respectively. Elution fractions were resolved by SDS–PAGE (4–12% Bolt gels, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stained with InstantBlue Coomassie Protein Stain (Abcam). Pure protein fractions were pooled, concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration, supplemented with 10% glycerol and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at −80 °C. For analysis by cryo-EM, GATOR2 samples were prepared immediately following SEC. Immediately before grid preparation of the sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2 or sc-GATOR2–CASTOR1 complexes, the purified samples were supplemented with threefold molar excess of purified wild-type Sestrin2 or CASTOR1(D304A), respectively.

To generate single-chain constructs, fragments with the following boundaries were prepared by PCR amplification using Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase (New England Biolabs) and assembled into pRK5 by Gibson Assembly (New England Biolabs):

sc-WDR24–SEH1L: WDR24(1–404)–SEH1L(1–360)–WDR24(405–790)

sc-MIOS–SEH1L: MIOS(1–380)–SEH1L(1–360)–MIOS(381–875)

sc-WDR59–SEC13: WDR59(1–651)–GSGSG–SEC13(1–321)–GSGSG–WDR59(652–974).

To generate point mutants in cDNAs for structural validation, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the KLD Enzyme Mix (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Cells that stably expressed cDNAs were generated as previously described8. The lentiviral expression plasmids used were: pLJM60-Flag-METAP2 and pLJM1-WDR24, with the latter containing site-directed mutations.

Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using GROMACS (2024-rc)32. The initial model was constructed using the coordinates of dimeric CASTOR1 from our cryo-EM structure of sc-GATOR2–CASTOR1, with an arginine ligand positioned in the binding pocket according to its placement in the crystal structure of arginine-bound CASTOR1 (PDB ID: 5I2C)19. To accurately quantify the relocation of the arginine-binding loop relative to the initial input state, simulations specifically targeting loop dynamics were conducted using a single CASTOR1 protomer. By contrast, simulations investigating the mechanism of arginine release and the swimming molecular dynamics binding study were performed using the CASTOR1 dimer to account for potential allosteric effects. Seven independent unbinding events were analysed, five of which exhibited the transient state described in the article. The swimming molecular dynamics simulation exposed the apo CASTOR1 dimer to 150 mM arginine.

Missing atoms were added, and protonation states of titratable residues were adjusted to reflect physiological pH using the Protein Repair and Analysis Server33. Protein interactions were modelled using the CHARMM36m force field34, and the solvent was represented explicitly using the TIP3P water model35. Protein chain termini were modelled in their charged ionic states. The arginine ligand topology was generated using ACPYPE (antexhamber Python parser interface)36. The system was solvated in a triclinic box of explicit TIP3P water molecules, with a 20 Å buffer between the protein and box edges. Na+ and Cl− ions were added to neutralize the system and achieve a physiological ionic strength of 150 mM.

Energy minimization was performed using the steepest descent algorithm until the maximum force on any atom fell below 1,000 kJ mol nm−1, ensuring the absence of steric clashes or inappropriate geometry. The system was then equilibrated in two stages: first, isothermal-isochoric (NVT) equilibration at 300 K for 100 ps using the V-rescale thermostat with a time constant of 0.1 ps; second, isothermal-isobaric (NPT) equilibration at 1 bar for 1 ns using the Parrinello–Rahman barostat with a time constant of 2.0 ps.

Production molecular dynamics simulations were typically run for 1,000 ns (2-fs time step) at 300 K and 1 bar. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all three dimensions. Non-bonded interactions were calculated using a 1.0-nm cut-off for van der Waals forces, and long-range electrostatics were computed using the particle-mesh Ewald summation method with a Fourier spacing of 0.12 nm. Bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using the LINCS algorithm. Simulations were run on the Stanford University high-performance computing cluster (SHERLOCK), utilizing 1× GPU and 4× CPU per simulation.

Trajectory analyses of RMSD were performed using the RMSD Trajectory Tool in VMD37. RMSD calculations assessed the stability and flexibility of the arginine-binding loop (CASTOR1 residues 273–277) by aligning the protein backbone to the average reference structure derived from aligned simulation frames.

In accordance with the reliability and reproducibility standards for molecular dynamics simulations for Nature38, additional details have been provided in Supplementary Table 4. Coordinate files corresponding to critical simulation outputs (Extended Data Fig. 7c–e) are available as Supplementary Information 1 and 2.

Cryo-EM specimens were prepared using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All three purified sc-GATOR2 complexes — apo state, Sestrin2 bound and CASTOR1 bound — were concentrated to 3 mg ml−1 in a final volume of 3 µl. These samples were applied to glow-discharged gold 300 square-mesh Quantifoil R 1.2/1.3 holey carbon grids (Quantifoil) and blotted from both sides for 3 s at 95% humidity before plunge freezing in liquid ethane.

Datasets were collected on a Titan Krios G3 electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV, equipped with a Gatan K3 direct detection camera (super-resolution counting mode) and a BioQuantum energy filters (slit width of 20 eV). Specific microscope parameters for each dataset are provided in Supplementary Tables 1–3. Fully automated data collection was performed using the EPU software.

Data processing workflows for reconstitution of the three sc-GATOR2 complexes are illustrated in Supplementary Figs. 2–13. Details for each dataset are summarized below.

Large movie datasets recorded with a Titan Krios microscopes (27,853 for apo, 34,122 for Sestrin2 and 23,777 for CASTOR1) were corrected for drift using MotionCor2 implementation in RELION (v5.0)39,40,41. Contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were determined using CTFFIND (v4.1.14)42. Motion-corrected micrographs were denoised using Topaz-Denoise43 with pretrained models. For each dataset, particle picking was performed in Topaz (v0.2.5)44 using two distinct search models: (1) a default pre-calculated model provided by the software developers, and (2) a custom-trained model generated from a manually picked subset of 1,000 GATOR2 particles. The resulting particle sets (2,515,780 and 2,512,791 for apo, 2,284,441 and 1,716,534 for Sestrin2 and 2,225,804 and 1,981,836 for CASTOR1) were extracted and downscaled for further processing in RELION.

Reference-based 2D classifications45 were applied to effectively eliminate contaminating non-GATOR2 particles and partially disassembled GATOR2 complexes. The deposited global consensus map from our previously published apo GATOR2 state (EMD-26519) served as the reference input map10. Remaining particles were reclassified in 3D, and the best classes from different Topaz sets (default and trained) were combined using a strict distance cut-off (150 Å) to remove duplicates. The resulting cleaned particle sets (758,113 for apo, 287,922 for Sestrin2 and 537,062 for CASTOR1) were then used to train a refined Topaz search model for a final round of reference-based particle picking. The collected data included a minor subset of CCT–TRiC complex particles, which co-eluted with GATOR2 during SEC due to their similar size of approximately 1 MDa. These particles were identified and removed during the initial 2D classification of each respective dataset.

The resulting refined particle sets (3,252,339 for apo, 2,987,526 for Sestrin2 and 2,418,964 for CASTOR1) were screened for intact sc-GATOR2 complex particles by reference-based 2D classifications (2,063,260 for apo, 1,240,221 for Sestrin2 and 1,248,533 for CASTOR1) and subsequent 3D classifications (806,219 for apo, 478,005 for Sestrin2 and 704,956 for CASTOR1) in RELION. The resulting cleaned refined particle sets were then merged with the clean default and trained sets, using a strict distance cut-off (150 Å) to remove duplicates. These combined particle sets (1,148,926 for apo, 605,308 for Sestrin2 bound and 865,410 for CASTOR1 bound) were re-extracted at full size and refined through iterative cycles of CTF and aberration refinement in RELION (per-particle defocus, per-micrograph astigmatism, beam tilt and higher-order aberrations)46. Alignment of the GATOR2 maps to C2 symmetry and correction of per-particle motion in RELION40 further improved the resolution of the reconstructions. These particle sets were then transferred to cryoSPARC (v4.5)47 and refined using iterative cycles of non-uniform refinement48 and per-particle CTF refinement46. The final consensus maps, generated with C2 symmetry applied, reached resolutions of 3.47 Å (apo state), 3.36 Å (Sestrin2-bound state) and 3.40 Å (CASTOR1-bound state), as determined by Fourier shell correlation at the 0.143 threshold between independently refined half-maps.

All sc-GATOR2 particle sets exhibited significant heterogeneity. In contrast to our previous GATOR2 dataset (EMD-26519), in which subunit dissociation complicated the analysis of compositional and conformational heterogeneity10, the newly designed single-chain constructs guaranteed compositional homogeneity. This allowed us to specifically focus on characterizing the intrinsic conformational flexibility of the GATOR2 complex. All particle sets were expanded using C2 symmetry (2,297,852 for apo, 1,210,616 for Sestrin2 and 1,730,820 for CASTOR1) and subjected to masking and local refinement in cryoSPARC (without particle subtraction). This allowed improved visualization of multiple overlapping regions within the GATOR2 complex: four regions for sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2 and five regions each for apo sc-GATOR2 and sc-GATOR2–CASTOR1 (Supplementary Figs. 2, 6 and 10). The resulting particles were further analysed for heterogeneity using 3D variability analysis (3DVA)49 in cryoSPARC (filter resolution = 5 Å and iterations = 40) to isolate particle subsets with the highest occupancy in each masked region and to identify rigid sections that move as semi-independent bodies.

These selected subsets underwent additional local refinement in cryoSPARC, followed by final sharpening using automated post-processing routines in DeepEMhancer (v0.16)50. High-resolution features were enhanced using the high-res algorithm (resolution cut-off = 2.5 Å), whereas low-resolution features were improved using the wide-target algorithm (resolution cut-off = 4.5 Å). Finally, high-occupancy composite maps (both unsharpened and DeepEMhancer sharpened) were generated in phenix.combine_focused_maps (Phenix v2.0)51 by combining rigid bodies within the respective sc-GATOR2 complexes (Supplementary Figs. 4, 8 and 12). The resulting composite sc-GATOR2 maps were generated as pseudosymmetric, with C2 symmetry applied to all structural regions except the brace MIOS–SEH1L β-propellers, which directly span the C2 symmetry axis. Because these β-propellers adopt two distinct orientations — one symmetric and one asymmetric (Supplementary Fig. 15) — we treated them as a C1 feature for consistency.

All model building tasks were performed using the C2-symmetric composite maps of the respective sc-GATOR2 complexes. Previously published structures — human apo GATOR2 (PDB ID: 7UHY)10, human leucine-bound Sestrin2 (PDB ID: 5DJ4)21 and human arginine-bound CASTOR1 (PDB ID: 5I2C)19 — were docked into the cryo-EM reconstructions using UCSF ChimeraX (v1.8)52. These initial models were iteratively rebuilt through cycles of interactive adjustments in Coot (v0.9.8)53 and refinement in phenix.real_space_refine (Phenix v2.0)54, incorporating AlphaFold 2 (refs. 55,56) predictions to improve backbone geometry in regions of lower map resolution. For each sc-GATOR2 complex, only one protomer (the asymmetric unit) was built and refined as described above; the full complex was generated by applying C2 symmetry operators. Model refinement was carried out with restraints applied to secondary structure elements and zinc-coordinating residues. Model quality was evaluated using MolProbity (v4.5.2)57.

The final models consist of the following: apo sc-GATOR2 (7,588 amino acids and 32 zinc ions), Sestrin2-bound sc-GATOR2 (8,426 amino acids and 32 zinc ions) and CASTOR1-bound sc-GATOR2 (9,594 amino acids and 30 zinc ions). The atomic model of leucine-bound Sestrin2 (originally PDB ID: 5DJ4) was rebuilt based on insights from the sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2 cryo-EM structure. Specifically, residues previously assigned as linker residues 233–240 were reassigned to residues 40–57 of the N-terminal domain (helix αN0). In addition, residues 249–255, 270–280 and 296–297 (the αL1–linker–αL2 segment) were added to the model based on weaker but interpretable electron density. The updated model was improved through iterative cycles of interactive model building in Coot and refinement using phenix.refine (Phenix v2.0)58. After each refinement cycle, the model was evaluated, geometry corrected and adjusted for density fit until convergence was reached. The final updated leucine-bound Sestrin2 model was deposited in the PDB under the accession code 9PDM.

Similarly, the atomic model of arginine-bound CASTOR1 (originally PDB ID: 5I2C) was rebuilt using insights from the sc-GATOR2–CASTOR1 cryo-EM structure. Residues 82–89, corresponding to the release loop, were added to the model based on weaker but interpretable electron density, and the model was iteratively refined as described above. The final updated arginine-bound CASTOR1 model was deposited in the PDB under accession code 9PDO.

To evaluate the effects of inhibitor (CASTOR1 and Sestrin2) binding on the dynamic behaviour of the WDR24 β-propeller, particle subsets with full inhibitor occupancy were first selected. Non-symmetry-expanded particle sets for sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2 (605,308 particles) and sc-GATOR2–CASTOR1 (865,410 particles) were analysed for heterogeneity using cryoSPARC 3DVA47,49 (filter resolution = 5 Å and iterations = 40). Masks were applied to cover Sestrin2, SEH1L(WDR24) and the WDR24 β-propeller for sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2, and the brace-associated CASTOR1, SEH1L(MIOS) and the MIOS β-propeller for sc-GATOR2–CASTOR1. The resulting particle subsets with full inhibitor occupancy (307,953 for sc-GATOR2–Sestrin2 and 559,052 for sc-GATOR2–CASTOR1) were locally refined using relaxed C2 symmetry parameters and the masks from 3DVA. To evaluate the flexibility of the WDR24 β-propeller, 3D classifications were performed using a global mask covering the entire GATOR2 complex and a targeted mask focusing on the two WDR24 β-propellers (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Hard classification was enforced (convergence criterion = 1% and filter resolution = 10 Å) to strictly distinguish between the presence or absence of the WDR24 β-propeller. Initial testing confirmed that 15,000 particles are sufficient to generate a high-quality sc-GATOR2 map. To ensure robustness and reproducibility, particles were repeatedly classified into subsets of 20,000, 22,000, 25,000, 28,000 and 30,000 particles per class. The resulting classes were categorized based on the presence of double, single or no WDR24 β-propellers on the GATOR2 complex surface (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Occupancy ratios were calculated and plotted, with error bars representing the range of values obtained across repeated classifications for each GATOR2 complex. The same WDR24 β-propeller masks and classification protocols were applied to the control particle set of apo sc-GATOR2 (1,148,926 particles).

B-1 cells are innate-like immune cells abundant in serosal cavities with antibodies enriched in bacterial recognition, yet their existence in humans has been controversial1,2,3. The CD5+ B-1a subset expresses anti-inflammatory molecules including IL-10, PDL1 and CTLA4 and can be immunoregulatory4,5,6. Unlike conventional B cells that are continuously replenished, B-1a cells are produced early in life and maintained through self-renewal7. Here we show that the transcription factors TCF1 and LEF1 are critical regulators of B-1a cells. LEF1 expression is highest in fetal and bone marrow B-1 progenitors, whereas the levels of TCF1 are higher in splenic and peritoneal B-1 cells than in B-1 progenitors. TCF1–LEF1 double deficient mice have reduced B-1a cells and defective B-1a cell maintenance. These transcription factors promote MYC-dependent metabolic pathways and induce a stem-like population upon activation, partly via IL-10 production. In the absence of TCF1 and LEF1, B-1 cells proliferate excessively and acquire an exhausted phenotype with reduced IL-10 and PDL1 expression. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of B-1 cells lacking TCF1 and LEF1 fails to suppress brain inflammation. These transcription factors are also expressed in human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia B cells and in a B-1-like population that is abundant in pleural fluid and circulation of some patients with pleural infection. Our findings define a TCF1–LEF1-driven transcriptional program that integrates stemness and regulatory function in B-1a cells.

B-1a cell development is instructed by B cell receptor (BCR) signal strength and selection is based on BCR recognition of components of bacterial and senescent red blood cell membranes, as well as apoptotic cells and oxidized lipids8. B-1a cells have a restricted BCR repertoire9 and persist through adulthood due to their capacity to self-renew, a process that requires sustained but limited proliferation to maintain a stable cell pool over time10. Because of these properties, B-1a cells have been referred to by some as ‘natural memory' cells11. B-1a cells in the peritoneal cavity have slow turnover rates compared with B-2 cells12, and can completely reconstitute host tissues lacking these cells after adoptive transfer, persisting for many months with little contribution from host-derived cells13. B-1a cells are potent repressors of autoreactive and inflammatory immune responses and tissue damage, largely due to their ability to produce IL-10 (refs. 14,15). The existence of B-1 cells in humans has, however, been controversial. Here we show that TCF1 and LEF1—known to confer stem-cell like properties in various cell types including CD8+ T cells16—are expressed in mouse B-1 cells and human B-1-like cells. In vivo experiments in mice showed that TCF1 and LEF1 promote B-1 maintenance and regulatory ability via enhancing IL-10 production.

To understand the transcriptional program governing B-1 cell homeostasis, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on sorted peritoneal CD19+ cells from adult mice. The determinants of the two major subclusters after removing immunoglobulin genes were the B-2 gene Fcer2a (encoding CD23) and the B-1a gene Cd5. Tcf7 (encoding TCF1) was expressed in the Cd5 subcluster, together with Bhlhe41, a regulator of B-1a cell development17 (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a). ImmGen also revealed high Tcf7 expression in B-1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b). B-1 cells in both the peritoneal cavity and the spleen identified as CD19highB220low (refs. 17,18) expressed TCF1 by flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 1c–e). LEF1 is a transcription factor that interacts with TCF1 (ref. 19), sharing overlapping yet not redundant functions in many biological processes20. Although peritoneal cavity B-1a (PC B-1a) cells expressed low amounts of Lef1 mRNA by scRNA-seq, flow cytometric analysis revealed that the LEF1 protein shared the same pattern of expression as TCF1 (Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 1c–e). Lef1 was also expressed in splenic T3 B cells, and both transcription factors were also highly expressed in memory B cells according to Immgen (Extended Data Fig. 1b). B-1a cells are enriched in phosphatidylcholine (PtC) reactivity1. We found that peritoneal B-1a cells expressing the lowest amount of B220 contained more PtC-binding B cells and expressed the highest amounts of TCF1 and LEF1 (Fig. 1d). TCF1 and LEF1 were also detected in bone marrow pro-B cells that give rise to both B-1 and B-2 cell progenitors, as well as B-1 progenitor (B-1P) cells21 (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g).

Source data

In humans, rare circulating B cells bearing B-1 markers have been thought to be pre-plasmablasts22. A recent study sequencing human fetal tissues has identified a B-1-like cell subset expressing CD5 and CD43 (ref. 23). In search for a human adult B-1-like population that might co-express TCF1 and LEF1, we stained cells from pleural effusions drained from patients with bacterial pleural infection. Paired CTV-labelled peripheral blood mononuclear cells and unlabelled pleural fluid cells from the same donor were stained in the same tube, and gatings were applied to exclude CD38+ plasmablasts (Fig. 1e,f). We found a population bearing the B-1 markers CD43 and CD5 and co-expressing TCF and LEF1 that constituted over 80% of all B cells in pleural fluid and up to 60% of peripheral blood B cells in some patients (Fig. 1e–g and Extended Data Fig. 1h,i). Despite this B-1-like population being rare in blood from healthy donors (Fig. 1f,h), it was still enriched in PtC reactivity and expressed higher levels of TCF1 and LEF1 than CD43−CD5+ cells and the bulk of CD43−CD5− cells (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 1j). Expression of CD27 and CD24 was heterogenous in human CD43+CD5+ B-1-like cells (Extended Data Fig. 1j). Although the majority of CD43+CD5+ cells were IgM+, up to 6% expressed IgA (Extended Data Fig. 1j). Of note, PtC-reactive cells were also found in the CD38+ population (Extended Data Fig. 1k). A CD43+CD5+ phenotype also characterized the neoplastic chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) B cells24, which also co-expressed LEF1, a diagnostic marker for CLL25 and/or TCF1 (Fig. 1e,i). Together, these data show that human CD38− B cells that co-express both CD43 and CD5 express higher levels of LEF1 and TCF1 than other mature B cell subsets and are enriched in PtC reactivity, thus displaying a phenotype that resembles mouse B-1 cells.

To determine whether TCF1 and LEF1 have a role in B-1 cell homeostasis, we generated mice lacking these transcription factors only in B cells by crossing Tcf7-floxed and Lef1-floxed mice to mice expressing Cre under the control of the Mb1 (Cd79a) promoter (CreMb1)26. Although B-2 and B-1b cells were comparable in all groups, mice double deficient in TCF1 and LEF1 (TCF1ΔLEF1Δ) had a 45% reduction in total peritoneal B-1 cells, a 71% reduction in peritoneal B-1a cells and a 67% reduction in splenic B-1 cells compared with CreMb1-expressing littermate controls (TCF1WTLEF1WT; Fig. 1j–m and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Deficiency of TCF1 alone only decreased splenic B-1 cells. TCF1–LEF1 deficiency reduced CD5 expression in B-1a cells but these remained identifiable (Extended Data Fig. 2c). To establish whether TCF1 and LEF1 influence homeostasis of both fetal liver-derived and bone marrow-derived B-1a cells, we reconstituted sublethally irradiated Rag1−/− mice with either embryonic day 14.5 fetal liver cells or adult bone marrow cells from mice sufficient or deficient in TCF1 and/or LEF1. B-1a cells were decreased by 70% and 60% in mice receiving TCF1ΔLEF1Δ fetal liver and bone marrow cells, respectively, compared with recipients of wild-type cells (Fig. 1n and Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).

B-1P cells identified as Lin−CD93+IgM−CD19+B220neg-low peak during late gestation and differentiate into both B-1a and B-1b cells or mature in the spleen through a transitional (TrB-1a) cell stage27 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). TCF1 and LEF1 deficiency resulted in an increased frequency of B-1P cells in embryonic day 18.5 fetal liver and neonatal (days 1, 3 and 9) bone marrow (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c), yet splenic transitional B-1a cells (TrB-1a; CD93+IgM+CD19+B220lowCD5+) known to exclusively generate B-1a cells27, as well as their likely counterparts in the bone marrow28—B-1Ps (BM B-1Ps)—appeared significantly reduced (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Although this suggests that TCF1–LEF1 are involved in B-1a cell development, the decrease in CD5 expression observed in the absence of these transcription factors may underestimate the number of progenitors. Together, our results indicate that TCF1 and LEF1 are required for the formation of a replete peripheral mature B-1a cell pool.

TCF1 and LEF1 are important for proliferation and self-renewal of memory CD8+ T cells29,30 and stem cells29. A median of 90% of TrB-1a cells were Ki-67 positive—a marker of proliferation—compared with 77% of TrB cells (Extended Data Fig. 3f,g). Both the proliferative rate and the expression of TCF1 and LEF1 were significantly higher in young (4 weeks of age) than adult (10–16 weeks of age) mice (Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 3h). Peritoneal B-1a cells lacking TCF1 and LEF1 failed to expand in adult life compared with the steady increase seen in littermate controls (Fig. 2c). To formally evaluate self-renewal, we adoptively transferred peritoneal cells from TCF1WTLEF1WT or TCF1ΔLEF1Δ (CD45.2) donors into congenic CD45.1 recipients, who then received 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in the drinking water for 12 days. Deficiency in TCF1 and LEF1 led to a greater reduction in the proportion of donor-derived BrdU-labelled B-1a cells (P = 0.0210) than B-2 cells (P = 0.0948; Fig. 2d). In a complementary approach, we adoptively transferred 50:50 mixes of CD45.2 TCF1ΔLEF1Δ:CD45.1 TCF1WTLEF1WT-sorted or control CD45.2 TCF1WTLEF1WT:CD45.1 TCF1WTLEF1WT-sorted peritoneal B-1a cells into unirradiated Rag1−/− mice that cannot repopulate the B-1a cell pool. A smaller fraction of donor-derived CD45.2 B-1a cells was found in both the peritoneal cavity and the spleen when donor B-1a cells lacked TCF1 and LEF1 (Extended Data Fig. 3i).

Source data

Consistent with the well-described constitutive BCR signalling in B-1a cells31, phosphorylated SYK, BTK and BLNK could be readily detected ex vivo in B-1a cells in the absence of exogenous stimulation; this was diminished in TCF1ΔLEF1Δ B-1a cells (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Downregulation of κ-light and λ-light chains that characterizes B-1a cells was also increased in TCF1ΔLEF1Δ B-1a cells (Extended Data Fig. 4b). CD19 remained unchanged in both fetal liver B-1P (FL B1P) and PC B1a cells lacking TCF1 and LEF1 (Extended Data Fig. 4c). BCR scRNA-seq of peritoneal CD19+ cells from adult TCF1–LEF1 sufficient versus deficient mice revealed three highly expanded clonal clusters (Fig. 2e) expressing B-1a-associated immunoglobulin V genes composed of heavy-chain and light-chain pairs Ighv11-2/Igkv14-126 (c1), Ighv12-3/Igkv4-91 (c2) and Ighv9-3/Iglv2 (c3) in mice from both genotypes, albeit reduced in TCF1–LEF1-deficient mice (Fig. 2f). Although the BCR repertoire of the total peritoneal CD19+ B cell population from TCF1–LEF1-deficient mice appeared more diverse (Extended Data Fig. 5a, top), this was probably only due to the overall decrease in the more clonal B-1a cells and overrepresentation of sequenced B-1b and B-2 cells. By contrast, the B-1 cell BCR repertoire of TCF1–LEF1-deficient peritoneal cavity B cells did appear less diverse than that of wild-type counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 5a, bottom, and 5c) despite reduced CD5 expression, which has been associated with clonal dominance32. Consistent with a decrease in the absolute numbers of B-1a cells, the number of PtC-binding peritoneal B cells was decreased in TCF1–LEF1-deficient mice (Fig. 2g), while still representing approximately 42% of B-1a cells, comparable with wild-type littermates (Extended Data Fig. 5c).

We did not detect decreased serum antibodies in mice lacking TCF1 and LEF1 (Extended Data Fig. 5d), suggesting compensation by B-1 cell-derived plasma cells33. Indeed, B-1 plasma cells were comparable with those of wild-type mice when quantified as a fraction of total splenic cells, but B-1 plasmablasts were increased when quantified as a fraction of splenic B-1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 5e). An approximately sevenfold increase in IgG3+ B-1a cells was seen in mice lacking TCF1–LEF1 (Extended Data Fig. 5f).

To obtain insights into signalling pathways downstream of TCF1–LEF1 in B-1a cells, we performed RNA-seq on purified TCF1WTLEF1WT and TCF1ΔLEF1Δ B-1a cells, and expression of B-1a signature genes was superimposed for comparison34. B-1a cell identity was largely maintained within the residual B-1a subset in the absence of TCF1–LEF1 (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Transcripts encoding the transcriptional factors Ets1 and Irf4 were downregulated in single and double TCF1–LEF1-deficient B-1a cells (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Given a previous report showing the B cell intrinsic roles of ETS1 on B cell activation and differentiation35, we investigated whether this transcription factor regulates B-1a cell numbers and found that B-1a cells were reduced in the peritoneal cavity, but not the spleen, of adult mice lacking ETS1 in B cells (Fig. 2h); albeit, this was not evident in young mice (data not shown), suggesting that ETS1 may act downstream of TCF1–LEF1 to promote maintenance of B-1a cells with age.

Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that TCF1–LEF1-dependent pathways were linked to cell cycle, including G2–M checkpoint (Cdk1 and Ccnb2) and E2F targets (E2f8 and Cenpm; Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). The hallmark ‘MYC targets' pathway was downregulated in TCF1ΔLEF1Δ B-1a cells (Fig. 3a). There was also a strong and significant correlation between the expression of MYC—a master regulator of metabolism—as well as its target gene Bcl2 (ref. 36), and expression of both TCF1 and LEF1 (Fig. 3b). B-1 cells depend on glycolysis, acquisition of exogenous fatty acids and autophagy for self-renewal37. Consistent with this, inhibition of fatty acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis pathways were also prominent pathways in the residual TCF1ΔLEF1Δ B-1a cells (Fig. 3a).

Source data

To delineate unique versus overlapping or shared roles of TCF1 and LEF1 in B-1a cell maturation, we generated scRNA-seq data from four distinct B-1 developmental stages, individually enriched, barcoded and then pooled: (1) FL B1Ps, (2) adult bone marrow B-1 progenitors (BM B1Ps), (3) PC B1 cells, and (4) spleen B-1 cells (SP B1s; Fig. 3c). Trajectory analysis revealed a continuous, well-populated path with FL B1Ps at one terminus of the trajectory, SP B1 and PC B1 clusters positioned close to the other end, and BM B1Ps dispersed between FL B1Ps and SP B1s or PC B1s (Fig. 3d). A small number of SP B1 and PC B1 cells located within the FL B1P cluster (Fig. 3e), supporting the existence of splenic B-1a precursors38. Lef1 was expressed strongly in B-1Ps from both fetal liver and bone marrow and maintained expression, albeit at low levels, in peripheral B-1 cells. Tcf7 by contrast was low at the progenitor stages, and expression increased in peripheral splenic and peritoneal cavity B-1 cells (Fig. 3f). Molecules associated with B-1 cell development including Lin28b39 and Arid3a40 as well as Il7r were highly expressed in fetal B-1Ps, whereas Bhlhe41 was expressed in BM B1Ps, and more strongly in SP B1 and PC B1 cells. The latter also expressed Ctla4 (ref. 4) and Bmi1 (ref. 41) (Fig. 3f).

Interrogation of pathways revealed that IL-6–STAT3, TGFβ and TNF signalling were dysregulated in LEF1-deficient B-1a cells, whereas TCF1 deficiency predominantly affected cell cycle via regulation of E2F targets and G2–M checkpoints. By contrast, deficiency of either transcription factor caused changes in the IL-2–STAT5 signalling pathway (Fig. 3g). Reanalysis of a scRNA-seq atlas of human prenatal tissues23 revealed that most cells expressing the mouse B-1a marker genes CD5 and SPN (encoding CD43) co-expressed TCF1 and LEF1 alone or in combination. Cells co-expressing both TCF1 and LEF1 also expressed the highest amounts of CD5, SPN, IL2RG and IL7RA (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 6e). As seen in mice (Extended Data Fig. 1g), TCF1 and LEF1 were also expressed in human progenitor B cells, particularly in ProB cells, as well as in cycling B cells, as indicated by Mki67 expression23 (Extended Data Fig. 6f).

Given that IL-2 signalling is a TCF1–LEF1-dependent hallmark pathway in mouse B-1a cells (Fig. 3g) and that LEF1–TCF1 co-expressing human B-1 cells express high levels of IL-2Rγ and IL-7RA (Fig. 3h), we asked whether these receptors influence B-1 cell development in humans. We evaluated the B-1-like cells in the circulation of patients with paediatric severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with genetic loss-of-function variants in IL2RG and IL7RA, and sufficient events in the CD19+CD38− gate. Patients with IL-2Rγ deficiency had an 80% reduction in B-1-like cells out of total B cells (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Given that the median age of the healthy donors was 24 years compared with 6 years in the patients, and that adult mice have twofold more B-1a cells than young mice, further work is needed to reach definitive conclusions.

Next, we set out to investigate the potential targets of TCF1 and LEF1 in B-1a cells. Owing to low cell numbers and low-level expression of these transcription factors in B-1a cells, CUT&Tag was not successful. Analysis of TCF1 peaks from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing datasets of mouse thymocytes42 and comparison with open chromatin regions identified by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) in B-1a cells from Vh12/Vk4 transgenic mice17 revealed TCF1 peaks at promoters or enhancers of Cd5, Myc and Ets1 that also harboured open chromatin regions in B-1a cells, suggesting that they are TCF1 targets (Extended Data Fig. 6h).

B-1a cells have been described to exert regulatory roles via production of IL-10 (ref. 15). In mice, IL-10-producing B cells referred to as ‘B10' co-express B220 and CD1d and lack CD23 and CD21 expression43. CD21highCD1dhigh marginal-zone B cells44 and plasma cells can also produce IL-10 (ref. 45). We scored the expression of ‘B10-associated genes' and the related ‘negative regulation of immune system genes'46 in our scRNA-seq analysis of peritoneal B cells. Both gene signatures were upregulated in the B-1a c1, c2 and c3 clonal clusters (Figs. 2f and 4a,b), which also co-expressed Tcf7 and Cd5. These signatures included CTLA4 and PDL1, known to be expressed by B-1a cells and to contribute to various immunoregulatory processes, including promoting regulatory T cell responses, dampening inflammatory macrophage activity, limiting T cell-mediated central nervous system (CNS) damage and maintaining B cell tolerance4,5,6,47,48. Indeed, the PDL1 protein was highly expressed in peritoneal B-1 cells compared with conventional B cells (Fig. 4c). B-1 cells with high TCF1–LEF1 expression produced twofold higher IL-10 upon activation than those expressing low amounts of TCF1–LEF1 (Fig. 4d), and B-1a cells lacking TCF1 and LEF1 produced approximately 40% less IL-10 than LEF1–TCF1-sufficient cells (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 7a). Intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection induces IL-10-producing LAG3+CD138+ cells49; the number of these cells was also decreased in mice lacking TCF1ΔLEF1Δ in B cells (Extended Data Fig. 7b).

Source data

Among splenic B cells, only CD19low cells exhibiting a CD5+CD1d+ phenotype characteristic of B10 cells43 produced IL-10 in the steady state, whereas upon LPS stimulation, we observed an increase in IL-10 production among CD19high cells that displayed a B-1a phenotype (B220lowCD5highCD21lowCD1dlow) and higher expression of TCF1 and LEF1 (Fig. 4f,g and Extended Data Fig. 7c). Only the latter were significantly reduced in TCF1ΔLEF1Δ mice (Fig. 4h). There was a strong correlation between the increase in IL-10-producing cells and TCF1 and LEF1 expression. A positive correlation, albeit weak, was also seen with CD5 expression, consistent with the known role for CD5 in promoting IL-10 production50, and the observed reduction in CD5 expression in B-1a cells lacking TCF1–LEF1 (Fig. 4i,j). As TCF1+ and LEF1+ fetal B cells express minimal IL-10 (Fig. 3h), it is likely that these transcription factors promote IL-10 production upon postnatal exposure to commensal bacteria bearing Toll-like receptor (TLR) and B-1a BCR ligands (for example, PtC) that coincides with the largest wave of B-1 cells51. Together, our data revealed that TCF1 and LEF1 promote the induction of IL-10+ B-1a cells in both the peritoneal cavity and the spleen.

B cells have been shown to have protective roles in human multiple sclerosis52 and its experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model53. In EAE, such regulation requires B-1a cells rather than recirculating follicular B-2 cells48,54 and is dependent on IL-10 (ref. 53). To test whether TCF1 and LEF1 were required for B-1a-mediated regulation in EAE, an equal number of activated peritoneal B-1 cells from TCF1–LEF1-sufficient or TCF1–LEF1-deficient mice was adoptively transferred 3.5 days after recipient mice were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35–55). Clinical disease severity was significantly reduced in mice receiving TCF1WTLEF1WT B-1 cells and disease onset was also delayed compared with mice receiving TCF1ΔLEF1Δ B-1 cells (Fig. 4k and Extended Data Fig. 7d).

We asked whether adoptively transferred B-1 cells can migrate into the CNS. Activation of B-1 cells modulates markers used for their identification55. We thus generated Gramd2amApple-cre mice in which B-1 cells can be tracked due to expression of the mApple fluorochrome driven by Gramd2a (encoding GRM2A) that we found to be selectively expressed in peripheral B-1 cells (Fig. 4l–n and Extended Data Fig. 7e–g). Immunofluorescence of brain sections 21 days after B-1 cell adoptive transfer in the EAE model (Fig. 4o and Extended Data Fig. 7h) revealed GRM2A+ donor-derived B-1 cells in the brain. These were predominantly located underneath the meninges or nearby parenchyma. Although this suggests that B-1a cells can enter the brain and may thus exert local regulatory effects, we cannot exclude additional distal effects in secondary lymphoid organs.

Finally, we considered the possibility that TCF1 and/or LEF1 control B-1 cell expansion and self-renewal via boosting B cell-derived IL-10, as B-1 cell-derived IL-10 has been shown to repress proliferation56. In the absence of TCF1–LEF1, LPS-activated B-1 cells proliferated extensively and the ratio of CD138+ plasma cells to non-plasma cells was decreased (Fig. 5a–c). IL-10 blockade using IL-10R-Fc antibody in wild-type B-1 cell cultures mimicked the excessive proliferation seen in TCF1–LEF1-deficient B-1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 7i), whereas the addition of IL-10 to cultures of TCF1–LEF1-deficient B-1 cells partially rescued this phenotype (Fig. 5d).

In CD8+ T cells, TCF1 expression allows the emergence of resting memory ‘stem-like' MYClow cells from cycling effector MYChigh cells via regulation of proliferation, metabolism and differentiation30. A comparable MYClow population appeared among B-1a but not B-2 cells around the third division post-LPS stimulation, and MYClow cells exhibited limited proliferation (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 7j,k). MYClow cells were not generated in B-1 cell cultures lacking TCF1–LEF1 where cells continued to proliferate extensively without downregulating CD19 (Fig. 5f,g). Loss of MYC1low cells appeared more profound with single TCF1 than single LEF1 deficiency (Fig. 5h). Consistent with being a stem/memory-like population, emerging MYClow B-1a cells at the third division downregulated CD19 and markers associated with B cell activation and exhaustion including CD86, FCRL5 and CD11b (Fig. 5i); this was not seen in TCF1–LEF1-deficient cells (Fig. 5j). Expression of CD11c and ZEB2 that identify ‘aged-associated B cells'57 remained unchanged in TCF1–LEF1-deficient B-1a cells (Extended Data Fig. 7l and data not shown). In the absence of TCF1–LEF1, PDL1 was strongly downregulated in activated B-1 cells independently of cell division (Fig. 5k). Reanalysis of published ATAC-seq from B-1a cells17 revealed two chromatin-accessible regions in the first two exons of Cd274 (encoding PDL1; Fig. 5l), suggesting that PDL1 is a direct target of TCF1 as reported in double-positive thymocytes42. Thus, TCF1–LEF1 are likely to also promote the regulatory function of B-1a cells by maintaining PDL1 expression. Together, these data suggest that TCF1–LEF1 promote PDL1 and IL-10 expression that contribute to the regulatory function of B-1a cells while limiting excessive proliferation and exhaustion to allow emergence of a MYC1low stem-like population essential for B-1a maintenance.

Our findings suggest that TCF1 and LEF1 are important for the generation of IL-10-producing regulatory B-1 cells in the periphery. As the major wave of B-1 cell expansion occurs postnatally upon microbiome exposure58 and bacterial CpG is a potent inducer of IL-10 secretion59, B-1a regulatory function is probably key to help prevent inappropriate immune responses to commensal bacteria and viruses. Gut IgA plasma cells have been shown to arise from the same haematopoietic progenitors as B-1a cells during ontogeny and produce IgA clones in response to neonatal gut viral infection60. Whether early-life B-1a education and their antimicrobial IgA production determines the outcome of protective versus pathogenic or autoimmune reactions to microbial exposures later in life remains to be determined. Our identification of expanded B-1-like cells in the blood of some patients with pleural infection based on CD5, CD43, TCF1 and LEF1 expression suggests that these cells may also serve as a biomarker for early detection of serosal infections (for example, pleuritis and peritonitis) and possibly sepsis. Given the observed gradation in PtC reactivity across CD43+CD5+, CD43–CD5+ and CD43–CD5– circulating populations in healthy donors—and the fact that a fraction of CD38+ cells also exhibit PtC reactivity—it is likely that surface markers such as CD5, CD43 and CD38 change dynamically as B-1-like cells mature. Similarly, an inter-relationship may exist between CD38+ and CD38– B-1-like cells, with CD38 expression changing as these cells mature and undergo activation. Our data also suggest that chronic activation of B-1 cells—known to be selected for self-reactivities early in life32–or loss of IL-10 or PDL1-mediated regulatory function as observed in the absence of TCF1–LEF1, may contribute to autoimmunity. Although TCF1 and LEF1 deficiency had more pronounced effects on B-1 cells, it is possible that these transcription factors also contribute to the homeostasis of long-lived B-2 cell subsets. We observed a trend towards reduced B-2 cell turnover and diminished surface BCR expression in the absence of TCF1 and LEF1. This effect may be particularly relevant for B-2 cells that rely on self-renewal for their maintenance, such as memory B cells, which exhibit the highest expression levels of both transcription factors among B-2 cell populations. Together, our work paves the way for studies that can harness the TCF1–LEF1 axis to control B cell stemness and regulatory ability, and to further investigate the function of human B-1-like cells in infection, autoimmune diseases and cancer.

Tcf7flox/floxLef1flox/flox mice were generated by H.-H.X. (Center for Discovery and Innovation)20,61. Mb1Cre mice, Rag1−/− and CD45.1 mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 background and housed in specific pathogen-free conditions at the Australian National University (ANU) Bioscience Facility. Tcf7flox/floxLef1flox/flox mice were backcrossed at least six times onto the C57BL/6 background, then were subsequently crossed to Mb1Cre mice to generate conditional Tcf1;Lef1-knockout mice. Mice were used from 8 to 12 weeks, and they were age matched when comparing the effect of two genotypes, except for ageing assessment (4–21 weeks). The Gramd2a-T2A-iCre-P2A-mApple strain was generated by the Genetic Modification Service at the Francis Crick Institute. Following adeno-associated virus (AAV) induction of a packaged rAAV donor molecule CRIPSR–Cas9 reagents were electroporated into fertilized single-cell C57BL/6 zygotes. The donor vector contained an in-frame T2A iCre P2A mApple cassette flanked by 5′ and 3′ regions of homology (400 bp, respectively) designed to insert the donor template in-frame immediately upstream of the Gramd2a stop codon in exon 12, such that expression of iCre and mApple was controlled by the endogenous Gramd2a machinery. The AAV donor vector was synthesized and packaged into AAV serotype 1 by VectorBuilder. The guide sequence used was 5′-ATGTGCAGGTAACAGTCACT-3′ and this was synthesized as a synthetic guide RNA by IDT. Mouse procedures were approved by the ANU's Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee or UK Home Office under project licence (PP2867252). Ets1flox/flox mice crossed more than 12 generations onto a C57BL/6 background were obtained from B. Kee at the University of Chicago. CD19–Cre mice on a C57BL/6 background were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and crossed to Ets1flox/flox mice to generate knockout CD19–Cre Ets1flox/flox (Ets1Δ)62 and control CD19–Cre (Ets1WT) mice. Mice were used at both 9 weeks and 20 weeks of age to compare phenotypes. Mouse procedures involving Ets1flox/flox mice were approved by the University at Buffalo Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

All patients and healthy controls provided written informed consent. Patients with confirmed bacterial pleural infection were invited to donate samples (Extended Data Table 1); all patients had pleural neutrophil counts of more than 10 million per litre, a neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio of more than 4 and were on antibiotic treatment. All clinical specimens (pleural fluid and blood) were collected for Oxford Radcliffe Pleural Biobank (ethical approval reference: 19/SC/0173, South Central-Oxford C Research Ethics Committee) and the study was approved by the Oxford Radcliffe Biobank Tissue Access Committee (reference number: 22/A093). All donors provided written informed consent.

Patients and healthy donors were also recruited following favourable study approval on 4 March 2024 by the London-Brent Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 24/PR/0218, IRAS 330505) and as part of the CAPTURE (NCT03226886) study, a prospective longitudinal cohort study investigating COVID vaccine responses in patients with cancer (Extended Data Table 2). CAPTURE is sponsored by the Royal Marsden Hospital and was approved as a substudy of TRACERx Renal (NCT03226886) by the National Research Ethics Service Committee London, Fulham on 1 May 2020 (REC 11/LO/1996). Baseline samples before COVID vaccination from patients with untreated CLL were selected. Collected as part of the EXACT study, a prospective longitudinal cohort study investigating response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in patients with cancer. EXACT is sponsored by the Royal Marsden Hospital and was approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee, West Midlands-Black Country on 22 November 2021 (REC/WM/0251). A baseline sample from one patient with untreated CLL and before immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy was selected.

Patients and healthy donor peripheral blood samples (Extended Data Table 3) were obtained upon written informed consent, according to protocols NCT03394053 (www.clinicaltrials.gov) approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Children's National Hospital and of the National Institutes of Health and 93-I-0119, approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Institutes of Health.

Adenoid tissue samples were collected from children (2–6 years of age, two girls and four boys) undergoing elective adenoidectomy surgery for either otitis media with effusion (OME) or sleep disordered breathing (SDB) at the Great North Children's Hospital. The parents of all donors provided written consent for tissue donation for research and this project was approved by Newcastle University Biobank (project code: NRTB-1).

Ethical approval to obtain blood from healthy individuals was provided by the London-Brent Regional Ethics Committee (REC: 21/LO/0682).

Pleural fluid and blood specimens were transferred and processed in the laboratory within hours after collection. Pleural fluid specimens were centrifuged at 800g for 10 min. The acellular supernatant was removed and stored in −80 °C. Then, the cellular pellet was resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer (5–10 ml; J62990.AK, Thermo Scientific) and incubated for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged at 500g for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded. If there were red blood cells, the process was repeated, otherwise the cells were washed in 5 ml of PBS and centrifuged at 500g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 5 ml of RPMI enriched with 10% FBS, passed through a 70-µm filter and counted. Whole blood was collected in EDTA tubes (VWR) and stored at 4 °C until processing or processed freshly. All samples were processed within 24 h. Before processing, tubes were brought to room temperature. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation using centrifugation tubes (SepMate, StemCell) per the manufacturer's instructions. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells either proceeded to be stained with antibodies directly or resuspended in recovery cell culture freezing medium (Fisher Scientific) containing 10% DMSO, placed overnight in CoolCell freezing containers (Corning) at −80 °C and then transferred to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. Adenoid tissue samples were collected in PBS and immediately mechanically dissociated into a single-cell suspension using scalpel blades and a 100-µm filter. Cells were then cryopreserved in freezing media (10% DMSO and 90% FBS) in liquid nitrogen before flow cytometry experiments.

Single-cell suspension from mouse peritoneal cavity, spleens and bone marrow were treated with TruStain FcX rat anti-mouse CD16/32 antibodies (101320, BioLegend). The cells were then stained with primary antibodies used for mouse samples along with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell strain (Invitrogen) or eBioscience Fixable eFluor780 viability dye (Invitrogen). The primary antibodies included: B220-BUV737 (RA3-6B2; 612838, BD Horizon), CD19-BV605 (6D5; 115540, BioLegend), CD23-BV421 (B3B4; 101621, BioLegend), CD5-APC (53-7.3; 17-0051-82, eBioscience), IgM-PE-Cy7 (II/41; 25-5790-82, eBioscience), CD19-BUV395 (1D3; 563557, BD Horizon), CD3-BV650 (17A2; 100229, BioLegend), CD21-BV605 (7G6; 747763, BD), IgD-PerCP/Cyanine5.5 (11-26c.2a; 405710, BioLegend), CD93-BV480 (AA4.1; 746239, BD), CD93-PE/Cyanine7 (AA4.1; 136506, BioLegend), CD24-Pacific Blue (M1/69; 101820, BioLegend), CD43-BV605 (S7; 563205, BD), CD3-APC-Cy7 (17A2; 100222, BioLegend), CD4-APC-Cy7 (GK1.5; 100414, BioLegend), CD11b-APC-Cy7 (M1/70; 101226, BioLegend), CD11b-AF700 (M1/70; 101222, BioLegend), TER119-APC-Cy7 (TER-119; 560509, BD), Gr1-APC-Cy7 (RB6-8C5; 108424, BioLegend), Sca-1-BV421 (Ly-6A/E; 108128, BioLegend), Kit-APC (2B8; 105812, BioLegend), CD127-PE-Cy7 (A7R34; 135014, BioLegend), CD16/32-PerCP/Cyanine5.5 (93; 101324, BioLegend), CD135-PE (A2F10; 135306, BioLegend), CD45.1-BV711 (A20; 110739, BioLegend), CD45.2-BUV737 (104; 612779, BD), CD274-BV711 (B7-H1; 124319, BioLegend), CD86-PE-Cy7 (GL-1; 105014, BioLegend), FCRL5-AF488 (FAB6757G, biotechne), CD223(LAG-3)-PE (C9B7W; 125208, BioLegend), CD138-BV605 (281-2; 142515, BioLegend), CD138-PE (281-2; 142504, BioLegend), CD43-BV711 (S7; 740668, BD), CD43-BV605 (S7; 747726, BD), CD1d-PerCP/Cy5.5 (1B1; 123513, BioLegend), Ig light chain κ-AF700 (RMK-45; 409508, BioLegend), Ig light chain λ-FITC (R26-46; 553434, BD), IgG3-biotin (RMG3-1; 406803, BioLegend), streptavidin-BV605 (405229, BioLegend), BLNK phosphorylated at Tyr84 (J117-1278; 558442, BD), ERK1/2 phosphorylated at Thr202/Tyr204 (20A; 561991, BD), phosphorylated PLCγ2 (K86-1161; 560134, BD), SYK phosphorylated at Tyr525/526 (C87C1; 6485S, Cell Signaling Technology), BTK phosphorylated at Tyr551 (M4G3LN; 12-9015-42, eBioscience), Ki-67-PerCP-eFluorTM710 (SolA15; 46-5698-82, eBioscience), MYC-AF647 (Y69; ab190560, abcam), TCF1/TCF7-AF488 (C63D9; 6444S, Cell Signaling Technology) and LEF1-AF488 (C12A5; 8490S, Cell Signaling Technology). DOPC/CHOL/fluorescein-DHPE (54:45:1) and rhodamine-DH PE liposomes (DOPC/CHOL/rhodamine-DHPE(54:45:1)) were used (F60103F2-R, FormumMax).

For cytokine intracellular staining, the cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), ionomycin, brefeldin A and LPS for the terminal 5 h of culture. Cells were harvested and stained for surface markers, including ebioscience Fixable eFluor780 viability dye (Invitrogen) to exclude dead cells before cells were fixed. Intracellular staining was performed with the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD) with IL-10-PE (JES5-16E3; 505008, BioLegend) and IL-10-BV421 (JES5-16E3; 563276, BD) as recommended. For transcription factors, the eBioscience FOXP3/transcription factor staining buffer set (Invitrogen) was used per the manufacturer's instructions. For staining phosphorylated BCR signalling components, peritoneal cells were isolated using ice-cold FACS buffer (2% FBS in PBS) and stained on ice with CD19, B220 and CD5 antibodies, followed by immediately being fixed with pre-warmed 1.6% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then permeabilized with PERM III buffer (558050, BD) for 30 min on ice and subsequently stained with phosphorylated BCR signalling components for 40 min at room temperature.

Human samples were treated with human TruStain FcX CD16, CD32 and CD64 antibodies (BioLegend) and then stained with the following anti-human antibodies: CD3-BV785 (HIT3a; 740961, BD Bioscience), CD19-BUV737 (SJ25C1; 612756, BD Bioscience), CD19-PerCP/Cyanine5.5 (SJ25C1; 363016, BioLegend), CD27-PECy7 (M-T271; 560609, BD Bioscience), CD38-BV605 (HIT2; 569699, BD Bioscience), CD43-BV510 (1G10; 563377, BD Horizon), CD43-FITC (1G10; 555475, BD), CD38-BV510 (HIT2; 303540, BioLegend), CD5-APC (UCHT2; 300612, BioLegend), CD5-PE/Cyanine7 (UCHT2; 300622, BioLegend), IgA-PerCP-Vio700 (IS11-8E10; 130-113-478, MACS), CD24-BV711 (ML5; 563401, BD), IgM-BUV395 (G20-127; 563903, BD), TCF1/TCF7 (C63D9; 2203, Cell Signaling Technology), LEF1 (EPR2029Y; ab137872, Abcam), Alexa Fluor-488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (minimal x-reactivity Poly4064; 406416, BioLegend) and Alexa Fluor-647 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (minimal x-reactivity Poly4064; 406414, BioLegend). Flow cytometers (LSRFortessa X-20, FACSAria II and LSR II; BD) and software (CellQuest and FACSDiva; BD) were used for the acquisition of flow cytometric data, and FlowJo software (Tree Star) was used for analysis.

To generate fetal liver chimera, 1 × 106 fetal liver cells from Tcf7+/floxLef1+/floxCreMb1 or Tcf7flox/floxLef1flox/floxCreMb1 mice (at embryonic day 14.5) were transferred intravenously into sublethally irradiated (500 rad) Rag1−/− recipients. To generate bone marrow chimeras, 2 × 106 bone marrow- derived haematopoietic stem cells from 8-week-old mice with aforementioned genotypes were transferred intravenously into sublethally irradiated Rag1−/− recipients. Mice were given Bactrim in their drinking water for 48 h before injection and for 6 weeks after injection and housed in sterile cages. After 6 weeks of reconstitution, mice were taken down for phenotyping by flow cytometry.

Equal numbers (1 × 105 cells) of flow-cytometry-sorted peritoneal CD19+B220−CD5+CD23− B-1a cells from Tcf7+/+Lef1+/+ (CD45.2+) or Tcf7flox/floxLef1flox/floxCreMb1 (CD45.2+) and wild type (CD45.1+) were adoptively transferred into Rag1−/− recipients intraperitoneally. The frequency of donor B cells among total peritoneal and splenic B cells was analysed at 2 months after transfer.

Peritoneal cells were harvested from Tcf7+/+Lef1+/+ (CD45.2+) or Tcf7flox/floxLef1flox/floxCreMb1 (CD45.2+) donors by injecting 5 ml of serum-free, DMEM medium without l-glutamine (Gibco) into the peritoneal cavity and withdrew as much fluid as possible, followed by centrifuging to harvest the cells; 3 × 106 cells were then injected intraperitoneally into the CD45.1 recipients. The recipients were fed with water containing 0.8 mg ml−1 BrdU for 12 days. Mice were then killed; the frequency of BrdU-positive cells among indicated donor cells in the peritoneal cavity was analysed using a BrdU staining kit (8811-6600-42, Thermo Fisher) and analysed by flow cytometry.

Flat-bottom 96-well ELISA plates (3855, Thermo Fisher) were coated with goat anti-mouse κ-UNLB (1050-01, Southern Biotech) overnight. The plates were subsequently washed and blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin in 1× PBS for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Serial dilution of the mouse serum was added to the wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Targeted antibodies were detected using AP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (1020-04, Southern Biotech) and AP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG3 (1100-04, Southern Biotech). Plates were developed using 1 mg ml−1 phosphatase substrate tablets (S0942, Sigma-Aldrich), and the absorbances at 405 nm and 605 nm were measured using an Infinite 200 PRO plate reader (Tecan) equipped with i-control (v1.9) software. Serum was added in serial dilution before the addition of secondary antibody: alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (1020-04, Southern Biotech) and AP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG3 (1100-04, Southern Biotech).

In brief, isolated leukocytes or purified cells were resuspended (1 × 106 cells per millilitre) with LPS (10 μg ml−1), PMA, ionomycin and brefeldin A (1:500; BioLegend) for 5 h. For IL-10 detection, cells were stained with surface markers followed by fixation, permeabilization with the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Bioscience) and staining with IL-10-PE (JES5-16E3, BioLegend) or IL10-BV421 (JES5-16E3, BD) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Total RNA was purified from sorted peritoneal B-1a cells (CD19+CD3−B220−CD5+CD23−7AAD−) using the PicoPure RNA isolation kit. Library construction and sequencing were performed in the Biomolecular Resource Facility, the John Curtin School of Medical Research, ANU. The single end reads of 76-bp sequencing were generated on a HiSeq2000 machine with a depth of more than 30 million reads per sample. The raw reads were aligned to the mm10 (GRCm38) genome assembly using hisat2 (ref. 63) and the mapped reads were assigned with FeatureCounts (v2.4)64 based on the genome-build GRCm38.p4 annotation and NCBI Refseq gene mode by removing ribosomal genes and non-coding RNA, respectively. Differential expression analyses were performed with voom-limma65, after removal of lowly expressed genes and normalized using the trimmed mean of M-values method66,67. Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified by applying a Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P value threshold of 0.05 (ref. 68). Gene set enrichment or pathway analysis were performed using clusterProfiler69 and Camera70 against the Gene Ontology database, KEGG database and HALLMARK C2 and C7 gene sets in the MSigDB (v7.5).

Peritoneal B cells (CD19+CD3−7AAD−) from three 8-week-old mice, B-1Ps (Lin−CD93+IgM−CD19+B220low/−) from embryonic day 18.5 fetal livers (three fetal livers were pooled together as one replicate) or bone marrow from three 8-week-old mice, and B-1 cells (CD19+B220low/−) from the peritoneal cavity and spleen from three 8-week-old mice were sorted by the FACS Aria II cell sorting system (BD Immunocytometry Systems). Cells (n = 10,000–20,000) per sample were run on the 10X Chromium platform (10X Genomics). Library preparation and sequencing were performed by the Australian Cancer Research Foundation Biomolecular Resource Facility, the John Curtin School of Medical Research, ANU or Genomics STP, The Francis Crick Institute according to the manufacturer's instructions for the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ Kit v2 or v3. Two libraries were generated and the mRNA transcript expression and BCR repertoire were measured. The samples were sequenced using the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) system or NovaSeq S2. The FASTQ files were aligned to the mm10 mouse reference genome using the 10X Genomics CellRanger pipeline (v6.0.1 or v7.0.1). Data were processed and analysed using the Seurat package (v5.0.3) in R (v4.4.1). Raw gene expression matrices were filtered to exclude low-quality cells based on the thresholds for mitochondrial gene content (set at 5%) and the number of detected genes per cell, using the PercentageFeatureSet() and subset() functions.

For multiplexed samples labelled with cell hashing antibodies, demultiplexing was performed using the MULTIseqDemux() function in Seurat. Hashtag oligonucleotide counts were normalized using centred log-ratio (CLR) transformation via the NormalizeData() function with normalization.method = ‘CLR', and cells were classified as singlets, doublets or negatives based on the hashtag oligonucleotide signal. Only singlets were retained for downstream analysis.

Normalization and integration were performed using the scTransform() workflow, followed by the identification of highly variable features. Dimensionality reduction was performed using principal component analysis via the RunPCA() function, and the top 20–30 principal components were selected to construct a shared nearest neighbour graph using FindNeighbours(). Clustering was conducted using the FindClusters() function. Clusters were visualized using UMAP via the RunUMAP() function. Differential expressed genes for each cluster were identified using the FindAllMarkers() function with test.use set as either ‘wilcox' or ‘MAST'. Where applicable, cell types were annotated based on canonical marker expression or informed by publicly available datasets.

Cell trajectory analysis was performed using Monocle2 (v2.32.0) in R (v4.4.1). The annotated Seurat object was first transformed into a CellDataSet object using the as.CellDataSet() function from the Seurat package. To filter relevant genes, those expressed in at least 10 cells and with a mean expression value of 0.1 or greater were selected. Next, highly variable genes across cell subsets were identified using the differentialGeneTest() function with the formula fullModelFormulaStr = ‘~cell_subset'. On the basis of their q-value, the top 2,000 genes were selected, and setOrderingFilter() was applied to prioritize them for ordering in pseudo-time analysis. Dimensionality reduction was performed using reduceDimension() with the parameter reduction_method = ‘DDRTree'. Cells were subsequently ordered along the trajectory using the orderCells() function and visualized with plot_cell_trajectory(). All other parameters were set to their default values.

BCR repertoire analysis was conducted with the Immcantation framework, following the guidelines provided by its developers (http://immcantation.org/). This was implemented in a Python environment (v3.11.10). We began with 10X Genomics BCR sequencing data processed through the CellRanger pipeline (v7.0.1) to obtain annotated clonotype and contig sequences. For V(D)J gene assignment, the AssignGenes.py command from the Change-O toolkit was used, referencing the mouse IMGT and IgBLAST (v1.22.0) databases. MakeDb.py was used to standardize the data to AIRR format. Cells expressing more than one heavy chain or only light chains were removed. Clonotypes were assigned using the DefineClones.py tool based on heavy chain sequences, using the default Hamming distance substitution model. Subsequently, light_cluster.py was applied to refine clonotype grouping by incorporating light chain information. Finally, the resulting datasets were merged with the annotated Seurat file and key metrics, including V(D)J gene usage, CDR and FWR sequences, lengths and mutational content were extracted for downstream analysis and visualization.

For diversity analysis, we used the iNEXT package (v3.0.1) to perform coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation analyses. We computed the three most common Hill numbers: species richness (q = 0), Shannon diversity (q = 1) and Simpson diversity (q = 2). The resulting sampling curves, which illustrate diversity estimates with respect to sample coverage, were visualized using ggiNEXT() function. In addition, we constructed circle packing plots using the packcircles package (v0.3.6) to visualize the immune repertoire composition of individual samples. These analyses were conducted in R (v4.4.1).

Processed and annotated scRNA-seq data of fetal immune cells, specifically the haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and the B cell lineages, in Suo et al.23 were downloaded from the developmental cell atlas portal (https://developmentcellatlas.cellgeni.sanger.ac.uk/fetal-immune/lymphoid/). The mean expression of Tcf7 and Lef1 in the cell types of the above-mentioned lineages are represented as dot plots (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 6f). The B-1 cells were classified into four clusters based on the expression of LEF1 and TCF7. The total B-1 cells expressing LEF1 exclusively is 463, TCF7 exclusively is 325, both is 73 and neither LEF1 nor TCF7 is 4,789 (Extended Data Fig. 6e). All the analyses were performed using scanpy (v1.9.8).

FASTQ files were downloaded from the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus database for TCF1 and LEF1 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq) data (SRP142342)42. FASTQ files were aligned to Enembl's mouse GRCm38 genome using BWA (v0.7.15). The resulting BAM files were sorted, duplicates marked and indexed using Picard (v2.1.1). Peaks were called using MAC2 (v2.1.1) that were enriched in TCF1 or LEF1 relative to input using default parameters. Peaks were annotated using HOMER (v4.8). BAM files were normalized to 10 million reads, and IGVTools (v2.3.75) was used to generate coverage files.

FASTQ files were downloaded from the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus database for ATAC-seq samples in B-1a cells (GSM2461745)17. FASTQ files were aligned to Ensembl's mouse GRCm38 genome using BWA (v0.7.15). The resulting BAM files were sorted, duplicates marked and indexed using Picard (v2.1.1). IGVTools (v2.3.75) was used to generate coverage file for visualization.

Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U penicillin–streptomycin, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 100 mM HEPES and 55 μM 2-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C in 5% CO2. B-1 cells were magnetically purified from the peritoneal cavity using the Pan B cell isolation kit II (130-104-443, Miltenyi Biotec) with anti-mouse CD45R (B220) antibody (130-110-707, Miltenyi Biotec) and labelled with CellTrace Violet (C34557, Thermo Fisher) followed by stimulating with or without 5 µg ml−1 LPS (O111:B4; L4391, Sigma), 0.4 µg ml−1 IL-10 (210-10-10UG, Thermo Fisher), 10 µg ml−1 InVivoMAb anti-mouse IL-10R (CD210; BE0050, BioXCell) and its isotype control, InVivoMAb rat IgG1 isotype control, anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP; BE0088, BioXCell) for 72 h.

B-1 cells were magnetically purified from the peritoneal cavity using the Pan B cell isolation kit II (130-104-443, Miltenyi Biotec) with anti-mouse CD45R (B220) antibody (130-110-707, Miltenyi Biotec) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U penicillin–streptomycin, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 100 mM HEPES, 55 μM 2-mercaptoethanol and 5 µg ml−1 LPS (O111:B4; L4391, Sigma) for 3 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Supernatant was collected from cell culture, and IL-10 production was measured by the cytometric bead array mouse IL-10 Flex set (BD).

EAE was induced by immunization with MOG35–55 peptide, emulsified in Complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) and pertussis toxin (Sigma-Aldrich). On day 3.5, 2 × 105 B-1 cells that had been previously activated with R848 (0.1 μg ml−1) for 48 h were transferred intravenously. Mice were examined daily and scored using the following scoring system: 0 for no disease, 1 for loss of tail tonicity, 2 for hindleg weakness, 3 for complete hindleg paralysis, 3.5 for complete hindleg paralysis with partial hind body paralysis, 4 for full hindleg and foreleg paralysis, and 5 for moribund or dead animals71.

Sections (3 µm) were staining on the Leica Bond Rx automated staining platform using sequential application of antibodies with Opal TSA fluorophore detection followed by heat stripping of the antibody complex between stainings using ER1 or ER2 antigen retrieval solution (Leica) for 20 min at 95 °C. The following antibodies, secondaries and opal TSA reagents were used: mApple (1:100; STJ140269, St John's Laboratory), CD45R/B220 (1:750; 553086, BD Biosciences), CD19 (1:200; ab245235, Abcam), Immpress HRP Horse anti-goat IgG polymer (MP-7405-50, Vector), streptomycin-HRP (1:500; P0397, Dako), NovoLink Max Polymer (RE7260-CE, Leica) and Opal 520/570/690 (FP1487001KT/FP1488001KT/FP1497001KT, Akoya Biosciences). Slides were counterstained with DAPI and imaged on the PhenoImager HT (Akoya Biosciences).

Statistical methods used in RNA-seq, scRNA-seq and single-cell BCR-seq are described above. Comparison between groups was performed using parametric t-test, two-tailed Welch's t-test, Mann–Whitney t-test, one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple-comparison test, two-way ANOVA and two-tailed Pearson correlation analysis from GraphPad Prism10 (GraphPad Software). Sample sizes are provided in the figures, and statistically significant differences are indicated as exact P values.

Stars are initially powered by the fusion of hydrogen to helium. These ashes serve as fuel in a series of stages1,2,3, transforming massive stars into a structure of shells. These are composed of natal hydrogen on the outside and consecutively heavier compositions inside, predicted to be dominated by He, C/O, O/Ne/Mg and O/Si/S (refs. 4,5). Silicon and sulfur are fused into iron, leading to the collapse of the core and either a supernova explosion or the formation of a black hole6,7,8,9. Stripped stars, in which the outer hydrogen layer has been removed and the internal He-rich or even the C/O layer below it is exposed10, provide evidence for this shell structure and the cosmic element production mechanism it reflects. The supernova types that arise from stripped stars embedded in shells of circumstellar material (CSM) confirm this scenario11,12,13,14,15. However, direct evidence for the most interior shells, which are responsible for producing elements heavier than oxygen, is lacking. Here we report the discovery of the supernova (SN) 2021yfj resulting from a star stripped to its O/Si/S-rich layer. We directly observe a thick, massive Si/S-rich shell, expelled by the progenitor shortly before the supernova explosion. Exposing such an inner stellar layer is theoretically challenging and probably requires a rarely observed mass-loss mechanism. This rare supernova event reveals advanced stages of stellar evolution, forming heavier elements, including silicon, sulfur and argon, than those detected on the surface of any known class of massive stars.

a, UV-optical. b, NIR. Up to day 11, the spectra are characterized by a black-body shape with superimposed narrow emission and P Cygni lines from silicon, sulfur, argon, carbon and helium. As the photosphere cools, the ionization state of silicon, sulfur and argon decreases. By day 20, the spectrum is dominated by a blue pseudocontinuum with superimposed intermediate-width emission lines from magnesium, silicon, sulfur and helium. The most prominent features of both phases are marked. Regions of high atmospheric absorption are marked (‘⊕') and a NIR spectrum of the opacity of Earth's atmosphere is shown as black vertical lines (black = high opacity). Host-galaxy emission lines are clipped. The original spectra are in grey and rebinned versions are in black.

a, At early times, all lines show well-developed P Cygni profiles. The absorption minima are at about 1,500 km s−1. The blue edge, a proxy of the maximum velocity, extends to about 3,000 km s−1. These velocities are comparable with velocities of winds around some Type Icn supernovae13,14, CSM shells around supernovae (refs. 24,64,110) and stellar winds as seen in Wolf–Rayet stars10 and much slower than supernova ejecta velocities at similar phases (approximately 10,000 km s−1 (ref. 23)). The Si iii and S iv lines are blended with other lines and exhibit complex line profiles. The Mg ii line shows narrow absorption lines from the ISM in the host galaxy. b, Up to day 6, the 5,876-Å feature shows a well-developed P Cygni profile and is dominated by He i. At later phases, this feature transitions into a pure emission line with time-variable contributions from silicon, sulfur and helium. The spectra are rebinned for illustration purposes.

The full spectrum covers the wavelength range from 2,635 to 21,960 Å. The shown wavelength range is limited to 2,720–11,000 Å, at which supernova features are well visible. The top panel shows the same wavelength interval as the discovery spectrum in Fig. 1 obtained 12 h earlier. The evolution between both epochs is gradual at most. As well as the supernova features, the spectrum shows emission lines from star-forming regions in the host galaxy and narrow absorption lines from the host ISM. Strong telluric features are marked with ‘⊕'.

The intensity spectrum is shown in black and the 1σ error spectrum is shown as a grey band. The red spectrum shows the corresponding S/N spectrum. The significance of a feature is the product of its average S/N ratio and the square root of the number of spectral bins. To guide the eye, a scale is provided in the upper-right corner of each panel. All labelled features (based on Supplementary Table 1) have a significance between 3 and several 10σ. For clarity, the spectrum was rebinned to 1.3 Å (top and middle panels) and 2.6 Å (bottom panel). Host-galaxy emission lines are indicated by the dotted vertical lines and strong telluric features by the ‘⊕' marker.

The panels above the main diagonal show all measurements in different projections of the feature space, the panels below the main diagonal show two-dimensional kernel density estimates and the panels on the main diagonal show one-dimensional kernel density estimates. The locations of SN 2021yfj and Type Ibn/Icn supernovae are highlighted in all two-dimensional projections. The light curve of SN 2021yfj shares similarities with Type Ibn and Icn supernovae: a fast rise and a high peak luminosity. However, it sustains a high luminosity for a much longer period of time, which is uncommon for interaction-powered SESNe but comparable with normal supernovae. The combination of short rise and long duration places SN 2021yfj in a sparsely populated area of the light-curve parameter space.

a, The CSM model provides an adequate description of the observations with ejecta mass Mej = 5 M⊙, a CSM mass of ≳1 M⊙ but <Mej and an explosion energy of approximately 1.6 × 1051 erg (Methods section ‘Light-curve modelling'). The mismatch between the observed and predicted rise can probably be mitigated with more complex CSM geometries and CSM density profiles than those considered here. The shaded bands of the bolometric light curve indicate the statistical uncertainties at the 1σ confidence level. b, Although CSM interaction is the primary source of energy, a spinning down magnetar or the decay of 56Ni might contribute to the peak luminosity of SN 2021yfj. The fit quality and the unphysical model parameters (magnetar: extremely low opacity; nickel model: 97% nickel mass fraction) rule out a substantial contribution of these powering mechanisms to the peak luminosity (Supplementary Information section ‘Additional light-curve fits'). The vertical dotted line in each panel indicates the date of the last non-detection.

Compared with examples of interaction-powered SESNe as well as the nickel-powered SN 2020oi, SN 2021yfj has a bright peak luminosity and a fast rise. Its black-body radius and temperature evolve slowly compared with Type Icn supernovae. This gradual evolution is reminiscent of some Type IIn supernovae that are embedded in an optically thick CSM (for example, ref. 67), whereas the rapid evolution of Type Icn events suggests a CSM that is much less optically thick (Methods section ‘Bolometric light curve'). The vertical dotted line in each panel indicates the date of the last non-detection of SN 2021yfj. The statistical uncertainties at the 1σ confidence level are indicated as vertical error bars in the left panel and as bands in all other panels. Non-detections are shown as ‘▾'.

This file provides details about the discovery, observations and data reduction, and additional discussions on SN2021yfj regarding the redshift measurement, limits on pre-cursor activity, X-ray emission, event rate, and host galaxy.

These Tiny Disks Will Sail on Sunlight into Earth's Mysterious ‘Ignorosphere'

With no fuel or engines, tiny explorers will surf sun-warmed air alone to explore high in the skies of Earth and Mars

By Payal Dhar edited by Lee Billings

This artist's impression shows multiple small devices soaring on sunlight at the edges of Earth's atmosphere.

Schafer et al. Nature (2025)

Scientists have devised tiny featherweight disks that could float on sunlight in Earth's mesosphere or the thin air of Mars, theoretically even while carrying payloads. Extending about 50 to 85 kilometers above Earth's surface, the mesosphere is too high to be reached by aircraft and weather balloons but too low for access by satellites, making it one of our planet's least-studied regions. Consequently, it's sometimes simply called the “ignorosphere.”

The new centimeter-wide disks are made from two thin perforated membranes of ceramic alumina connected by tiny vertical supports. They are kept aloft by a force called photophoresis: the light-induced movement of small particles at very low atmospheric pressures. In lab experiments simulating mesospheric air pressure and illumination, the researchers showed that their devices could float passively, without any power source. Their paper reporting the results was published in Nature on August 13.

Photophoresis causes gas molecules to bounce more forcefully off the warmer side of an object than the cooler one, creating airflow. In this case, the research team coated the bottom of the disks with chromium to absorb light and heat up more than the top. Thus, gas molecules bouncing off the lower part gained more momentum than those at the top, generating lift similar to how a rocket's jet produces upward thrust. Perforations in the disks increased this thrust, using an effect called thermal transpiration to passively channel the air from cooler to warmer regions. This enhancement boosted the disks' performance to surpass photophoretic flyers previously demonstrated by other groups, which had required illumination several times brighter than that of sunlight.

“The holes in the structure provide more pathways for air to flow,” says materials scientist Ben Schafer, co-lead author of the paper, who conducted the research as a graduate student at Harvard University. “So the air is not only moving around the sides of the structure—it moves through the structure, too, creating these little jets.”

Photophoresis was first demonstrated in the 1870s by the physicist William Crookes. He developed what came to be known as a Crookes radiometer, a toylike device that spins its metallic fins when exposed to sunlight. But because photophoresis only works at very low pressures and generates very weak force, it was long seen as a mere novelty. That began to change a couple of decades ago, Schafer says, as advances in nanofabrication allowed researchers to make devices light enough to levitate using the meager force of photophoresis alone.

Designing the disks to utilize thermal transpiration and optimizing them to carry the biggest possible payloads required careful computational modeling of mesospheric conditions and photophoretic forces, Schafer says. That prep work allowed the team to make informed trade-offs between, for instance, the density of the perforations and number of supports versus the resulting lofting force at a given atmospheric pressure. This “gave us really good insight into what would make an efficient structure” for mesospheric flight, he says.

Using a laser to mimic sunlight, the researchers demonstrated photophoretic levitation on their centimeter-scale structures in a low-pressure chamber in the lab. They also designed a six-centimeter-wide version of the disk to carry a 10-milligram payload—which, in theory, would be enough to power a small communications system with a radio-frequency antenna, a solar cell and integrated circuits. The team calculates that this larger version of the disk could stay aloft at an altitude of 75 km during daytime; in summertime at polar latitudes, it could even achieve constant mesopheric flight, sustained after sundown by the photophoretic force of infrared light emanating from Earth's gradually cooling surface.

Ruth Lieberman, a heliophysicist who worked on earlier attempts at photophoretic technology but wasn't involved in this project, calls it a brilliant design. “As long as the sun is shining, these things will work,” she says. “They are also made out of very inexpensive materials. Once you get past the prototype phase and can figure out how to manufacture [at scale], it strikes me as a really potentially fantastic solution for observing the atmosphere at very low cost in a way that gets you very good spatial temporal coverage.”

Schafer envisions a future in which swarms of these structures are used for atmospheric sensing and telecommunications not only in Earth's mesosphere but also in the tenuous atmosphere of Mars, which exhibits similarly low pressures. Schafer has co-founded a company based in part on the new research that is developing new iterations of the disks and planning to launch payload-free atmospheric test flights as early as 2026.

Creating disks truly capable of pulling their own weight in the mesosphere or beyond is a more formidable task—akin to a five- to 10-year project, Schafer says. “If you wanted to put a payload on board these devices, I think it's certainly doable, but it's going to take a lot of time and work,” he says. Scaling up is going to be a materials manufacturing challenge, he adds, that warrants more research.

When two passenger planes collided above the Grand Canyon, it changed the course of aviation forever.

When United Airlines Flight 718 and Trans World Airlines Flight 2 collided in midair above the Grand Canyon on a June morning in 1956—the spinning props of the United DC-7 slicing into the fuselage of the TWA L-1049 Super Constellation as its wing cut the aircraft in two—not a single known person on the ground saw it. Not a soul witnessed what we can only imagine were violent fireballs and streaming plumes of black smoke. No one even knew that the canyon's mighty peace had been disturbed—save, of course, the 128 people on board both aircraft, who lived through mere seconds of terror no human should ever know, the last seconds of their lives.

This despite the fact that the Grand Canyon was and is one of the world's most popular tourist attractions, even in the mid-1950s drawing around a million visitors a year. Despite the fact that the planes collided around 10:30 a.m. on a clear summer weekend day. And despite the fact that almost every railed ledge in the tourist area afforded unobstructed views, so the folks visiting from Waukegan and Sacramento and Hartford, their new Kodak Brownie cameras hanging from their necks, could see for miles across the massive chasm.

Despite all that, two planes collided spectacularly and nobody saw; in the quiet after the crash, it was as if it had never happened. That's how vast the Grand Canyon truly is. The greatest disaster in aviation history, up to that point, still gets lost in the scale of the terrain.

In fact, nobody anywhere knew anything was wrong until about an hour later, when both flights failed to check in at their shared radio waypoint, known as Painted Desert. There were no radar blips that suddenly disappeared from an air traffic controller's screen, no frantic bystanders rushing to the scene, no chilling mayday calls that spurred rescue teams into action. Though one such call was sent—a calm, defeated declaration that “Salt Lake, United 718 . . . ah . . . we're going in” from United copilot Robert Harms, transmitted to the Salt Lake City control center—it was garbled and not properly identified until weeks later, during the investigation.

The only sign of trouble was a lingering wisp of smoke that a private pilot noticed while flying over the canyon. On that day its walls would have been bathed in pure southwestern sunlight speckled with scrolling cloud shadows—a good day to fly. Presuming it to be a brush fire, the pilot later returned to investigate after hearing news reports of the missing aircraft; he was the first to spot the wreckage.

People would learn of the collision, of course. Within hours, the world would learn of it. The dramatic backdrop—the majestic Grand Canyon, steep rock walls looming above the rivers, revealing entire eras of geological formation in their colored striations—heightened the sense of tragedy when it was reported on the evening news, giving pause to a growing populace eager for the convenience and the excitement of flying around the country. People were mystified. How could two airplanes flying through the wide-open skies of the American West intersect at the same tiny point in the vastness of three-dimensional space? What were the odds?

It's easy now for us to look back at a 70-year-old calamity and think, That was early days. The industry was moving too fast, the technology was too advanced for its own good.

That would never happen today.

Then: January 2025. The midair collision of American Airlines Flight 5342 and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter over the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., killed 67 people. It happened barely three miles from the White House.

Are we so smart? Have we figured it out? And are there clues from 1956 that hold insight into how to prevent it from happening again, and again, and again?

Air travel in the 1950s was at once regal and primitive. Piston-powered airliners crisscrossed largely empty skies at what today would seem a leisurely pace. Transcontinental flights would often make multiple stops, in rustic Old West outposts like Oklahoma City and bustling heartland metropolises like Chicago. Journeys from New York to Los Angeles could take 10 or more hours, with the gleaming aluminum luxury liners soldiering languorously through the air at 300 mph, nothing like the withering 600mph paces the Jet Age would bring once it took hold in the early 1960s.

Yet the mere notion of reaching the opposite coast within a single day was beyond romantic, and the air travel experience often glamorous. Most airlines, in fact, operated dedicated first-class-only flights on popular routes. These flights had excellent cuisine, cocktail lounges, curtains on the windows, and roomy seats. Passengers could smoke in the main cabin or light up cigars and pipes in the lounge. The thunderous roar of four 3,400-horsepower, 18-cylinder radial engines furiously spinning their 14-foot-diameter Hamilton Standard Hydromatic props still wasn't as brain-meltingly loud as the narrow, screeching jet engines travelers would be subjected to once the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 debuted in 1958 and 1959, respectively. Air travel in the '50s was a new, exhilarating alternate reality.

The United and TWA flights that left Los Angeles International Airport on June 30, 1956, were among those special first-class-only flights. After boarding mere feet from each other at adjacent gates, the two aircraft taxied to the runway. TWA 2 took off first, at 9:01 a.m. local time, on its way to Kansas City Downtown Airport with 70 on board. At the controls: Captain Jack Gandy, First Officer James Ritner, and Flight Engineer Forrest Breyfogle. United 718 rolled down the same runway at 9:04 a.m., headed for Chicago's Midway Airport with 58 on board, including Captain Robert Shirley, First Officer Robert Harms, and Flight Engineer Gerard Fiore. Both aircraft had two flight attendants on duty. Neither had flight data recorders or cockpit voice recorders, which were not in widespread use at the time. The airplanes were supposed to take off about 15 minutes apart, but both had minor delays that separated their departures by just three minutes.

The airplanes were cleared to travel routes set by their airlines—TWA 2 past Daggett, California, at an altitude of 19,000 feet, and United 718 through Palm Springs, California, at 21,000 feet. Both were operating under visual flight rules (VFR), meaning the crews were obligated to scan for weather challenges and other aircraft visually. Their paths, diverging initially, would converge again after the first waypoints and then cross over each other near the Grand Canyon, just before the Painted Desert region. However, their staggered timing, different speeds (TWA 2 at 270 knots, United 718 at 288 knots), and 2,000-foot vertical separation should have kept them out of each other's way.

Both flight crews, however, opted to fly “off-airways” after getting their initial clearances, meaning they would take more direct paths to their next waypoints than they would have by staying on prescribed airline routes, which are meant to accommodate a wider range of flights. They'd also be in uncontrolled airspace, with no electronic tracking by any air traffic controllers (ATC), and were required to stay in visible airspace so as to avoid other aircraft. 

TWA 2 checked in with a company dispatcher at 9:21 a.m., requesting an increase to 21,000 feet to avoid turbulence. (Airline dispatchers often relayed communications for their pilots if the aircraft were out of radio range of controllers farther down the route.) Controllers at Los Angeles Center further checked with the Salt Lake City control center where TWA 2 was headed, and that controller, in Salt Lake, flagged the altitude as being assigned to United 718. He declined the request. A subsequent request for “1,000 on top”—meaning the plane would stay 1,000 feet above the cloud tops—was approved, but TWA 2 still had the responsibility of maintaining visual separation from other aircraft, and it was told of United 718's altitude. TWA 2 then settled in at 21,000 feet, matching United's altitude.

At 10:13, both airlines had reported the flights' revised positions and route estimates to the Salt Lake City controller, with both expected to arrive at the Painted Desert line at 10:31 while at 21,000 feet. The Salt Lake City controller wasn't required to pass potential conflicts on to the aircraft, as the planes were in uncontrolled airspace and flying VFR; the pilots were responsible for seeing each other and avoiding other aircraft, any number of which could be in the area without the knowledge of ATC. Investigations indicated that sharing this information could have prevented the accident, but didn't implicate the controller because he was managing a multitude of flights in the area and was correct to assume the flights would “see and avoid” each other, per ATC procedures.

With no active radar tracking above the Grand Canyon, the flight crews were effectively on their own. 

Though the airplanes were both due to arrive at the Painted Desert line at the same time, 10:31 a.m., both were tracking a few minutes late. The Civil Aeronautics Board—a precursor to the National Transportation Safety Board as the agency tasked with investigating aviation accidents—couldn't fully explain the discrepancy in its final report. Because there were no onboard data recordings, no cockpit recordings, and no witnesses to the accident, the CAB could only cite possible explanations. These included less favorable winds than expected, course deviations around clouds, and the chance that the pilots wanted to give passengers better views of the Grand Canyon below.

In his book about the tragedy, We Are Going In, Mike Nelson, whose uncle, Jack Groshans, was killed aboard United 718, explores this prospect of sightseeing diversions in detail. He notes that even though there were areas of overcast skies in the eastern half of the canyon, where the collision occurred, from above there may have been hopes or indications of gaps in the clouds below. Both flights appeared to have been chasing such prospects, as they had both made distinct, last-minute northward changes to their paths.

The consequences of these deviations were horrific. “It was as though their ends were predestined,” Nelson writes, citing their shared delays taking off, the converging paths of their original flight plans, TWA 2's bump to 21,000 feet cruising altitude, and their diversions north to the same square inches of Grand Canyon airspace. The CAB report speculates that the airplanes were simply flying on opposite sides of the same cloud and converged on the far side, perhaps seeing each other for just a millisecond before colliding; in fact, this was what lead investigator Jack Parshall surmised based on the slight downward pitch and the right bank angle of the United DC-7 when it struck the TWA Super Constellation.

That happened at 10:31 a.m., the exact time both aircraft were supposed to have arrived at the Painted Desert line 17 miles to the east. The collision altitude: 21,000 feet. 

The TWA aircraft's distinctive tail assembly was severed from the aircraft, instantly depressurizing the cabin and rendering the craft uncontrollable. It dove like a missile for the ground and impacted Temple Butte, a prominent formation in the eastern canyon, at more than 400 mph.

United 718 had slightly more controllability, but the tip of its left wing was mangled, reducing lift. It staggered on for just a mile before crashing into nearby Chuar Butte, copilot Harms fighting for control the whole way in. In his book, Nelson speculates that Captain Shirley of United 718 wasn't in the cockpit at the time of the crash, probably because he was in the cabin greeting passengers. This was an airline tradition at the time, particularly on those dedicated first-class flights. Nelson's reasoning: Shirley's remains were among the only four successfully identified from that aircraft, so he was likely not in the front of the plane, which faced the brunt of the impact; also, his voice wasn't heard in the background of the final radio transmission made by Harms. What's more, that message ordinarily would have been delivered by the pilot, not the copilot.

Nelson considers it unlikely that Shirley could have done any better had he still been at the controls.

The two crash sites, which crews finally reached a day after the collision, sat a mile apart, near the intersection of the Colorado and Little Colorado Rivers. The airplanes had slammed into separate canyon walls, exploding into flames and scattering debris across craggy terrain accessible only by experienced climbers, and even they had to be brought in via helicopter. Some of the wreckage was recognizable—shredded metal, bits of seat cushions and luggage, fragmented human remains. Then there was the distinctive three-vane tail assembly from the Super Constellation. The metal bore smeared paint from the other aircraft—“witness marks” that would help investigators piece together the tragedy over the coming months.

The crash debris and victim remains had settled over two wide areas, with much of it falling into deep gullies and crevices. Though recovery crews gathered as much as possible from the site over the following months, many aircraft fragments were left at the remote and largely inaccessible site for years—some to this day.

The collision of United's Douglas DC-7, named Mainliner Vancouver, and TWA's Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation—Star of the Seine—was at the time the worst-ever disaster in commercial aviation. It happened during a dramatic surge in civilian air travel, at the cusp of the coming Jet Age. Piston-powered propeller aircraft were able to stretch the speed and distances of air travel while their own obsolescence lurked on the horizon, as those faster and longer-range jet-powered airliners began to enter service.

Much of the industry's momentum could be traced to World War II, a conflict dominated by the development and large-scale deployment of innovative new aircraft, many of which would be quickly adapted from transporting soldiers and bombs to carrying paying passengers wearing heels and drinking martinis. But the overarching civilian air travel system of the 1950s—that is, the mechanics of air traffic control and the oversight of all the airplanes flying through any particular area—couldn't keep up with all the new planes blazing through the skies. For one thing, there were shortfalls in the federal budget that left the airlines hanging, says aviation historian Robert van der Linden, curator of air transportation at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. Active, radar-aided control, he says, was available only around major cities, and most air traffic control systems became antiquated and susceptible to human error.

The area where the airliners collided was a region where commercial pilots were simply supposed to “see and be seen” by other aircraft. But that point on the map also happened to be among the most spectacular geological attractions on the planet, and the pilots appeared to be maneuvering to offer passengers better views. That alone wasn't problematic, or shouldn't have been. “Pilots were allowed to deviate from their flight paths at the pilot's discretion to avoid weather or, in the case of this accident, fly over scenic attractions,” van der Linden says.

The accident led to congressional hearings focused on aviation safety and massive changes to how aircraft flew around the country and the world. It was an era of reform that the nation might be revisiting in modern times as well, given a recent surge in aviation accidents and close calls—including the Washington, D.C., collision in January; a FedEx cargo plane passing just 100 feet over the top of a Southwest Airlines jet in Austin in 2023; a Delta Airlines jet flipping over after a hard landing in Toronto in February; a Southwest Airlines flight aborting its Chicago landing after another aircraft crossed the runway in front of it in February; an aborted takeoff due to a similar runway crossing at New York City's LaGuardia airport in May; and, most recently, a private jet crash in San Diego in May that appeared to involve nonfunctional runway safety technology. This list doesn't include multiple midair collisions and close calls among small private or commuter aircraft.

These, along with revelations about antiquated technology causing a recent communications blackout at Newark International Airport, are prompting the public and the aviation industry to wonder if our air traffic control system needs to modernize far more aggressively. The FAA recently reported a shortage of 3,000 air traffic controllers.

A February headline from PBS News put it this way: “Aviation disasters and close calls have people worried about flying.”

The Grand Canyon crash horrified the public then, too. News spread later that day around the parking lots and visitor centers when the aircraft were reported missing in the vicinity; then the wider public found out as the aircraft transitioned from “missing” to confirmed lost. As search crews—including a team of five Swiss mountain climbers—were airlifted into the canyon to begin recovering evidence and victim remains, news crews descended on Grand Canyon Village on the South Rim and in nearby Flagstaff, Arizona, where the investigation would be headquartered.

Though flying was still expensive and a relative luxury, airlines were already lofting thousands of flights per day in the United States alone. Crashes and midair collisions were actually somewhat common amid this surge in flying—though rarely at cruising altitude—as safety steps struggled to keep up with progress. But this one, above the Grand Canyon, involving state-of-the-art airplanes and experienced crews, and with record-setting loss of life, was huge and unusual, and it shook people.

Led by Parshall, the investigative work focused on radio communications, common practices of aircraft while flying off-airways, and weather—the likely culprits for any aviation accident. But he also explored critical nuances as questions emerged not only about what led the airplanes to the same point in space and time, but also about why they couldn't be stopped.

Why didn't they see each other?

Among the threads investigators explored was the overall visibility from within each aircraft. At the time, cockpit windows in pressurized aircraft were notoriously small, and angles of visibility might have inhibited detection of other aircraft. They also noted a possible illusion scenario: Pilots sometimes can see objects ahead of them on a potential collision course, but the objects register no relative motion from the observing aircraft until they suddenly converge in an instant. (This is similar to the feeling of being a driver in a car stopped at a traffic light and sensing an adjacent vehicle nudging forward, but thinking it's your own vehicle drifting backward—or vice versa.)

Investigators also looked into that question of whether crews were chasing a better view of the Grand Canyon for their premier customers, who were paying what would today cost up to $3,000 for first-class transcontinental flights.

Meanwhile, the public was growing feverish about the broader air safety system. “The incredible odds against an accident such as this occurring, and the fact that it happened in such a dramatic and terrible fashion over the Grand Canyon, focused the public's attention on the pressing need for increased vigilance over the airways,” van der Linden says. The crash ultimately led to the creation of the Federal Aviation Agency (now the Federal Aviation Administration), which van der Linden says gave the government more regulatory authority over the nation's airways.

In August 1957, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the Airways Modernization Act, intended to develop and modernize the national system of navigation and air traffic control facilities to serve the present and future needs of civil and military aviation. At the time of the Grand Canyon collision, the FAA says, there was a debate in Washington over whether the common civilian and military air navigation system should be the military TACAN (Tactical Air Navigation System) or the civilian VOR/DME (VHF Omnidirectional Range with Distance Measuring Equipment). The former was a more precise system used for military operations, while the latter was more affordable and readily adaptable globally. It took time to make such determinations, and there wasn't a single authority forcing the decision.

“Airlines were delaying the purchase of navigational equipment as there was uncertainty regarding what standard would be implemented,” an FAA summary reported in hindsight. “At the time of the accident, negotiations on a compromise system were ongoing. Shortly after the collision, in August 1956, the deadlock was broken and the details of a compromise agreed upon.” The solution, dubbed VORTAC, incorporated key advantages from both systems in distance measuring and directional guidance, and it would provide a critical melding of civilian and military navigation systems.

The Grand Canyon disaster also became a lesson to the industry against trusting the odds. “When it happened, it was confidently regarded as impossible by nearly the whole populace,” Nelson, the author whose uncle died in the crash, says. Though midair collisions were indeed more frequent at the time, they typically occurred at low altitude near airports, not in high, wide-open skies. Nelson places this disaster in the same category as another familiar, and perhaps equally unlikely, transportation tragedy. “The Titanic was confidently held to be unsinkable, and then, on its maiden voyage, it sank. The world was shocked. And the world was shocked with the Grand Canyon disaster, too. No accident like it had ever happened before,” he writes.

As accident investigation methods improved, global aviation became safer and safer and safer. How safe? That conversation is ongoing, as is the broader one about upgrading current air traffic control technologies once again. The system is dated, rife with old technology, and still reliant on human intervention and oversight. A digitally based upgrade, with modern high-speed data communication systems and eventually automated tracking and collision-avoidance systems long in planning, may now arrive sooner than expected: In May, Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy announced an effort to radically overhaul the nation's air traffic control system, including recruiting more air traffic controllers and upgrading networks.

Meanwhile, the site of the tragedy that spawned the first industry-wide improvement in aviation safety nearly 70 years ago remains just as inaccessible from the ground now as it was then. Only the heartiest of hikers can reach it, though technically the area is closed to the public. It became a National Historic Landmark in 2014, the first such designation to commemorate something that happened in the air.

At the ceremony, attended by Nelson, victim relatives, and others affected by the disaster, park officials unveiled a plaque. It reads: “This tragic accident site represents a watershed moment in the modernization of America's airways leading to the establishment of the Federal Aviation Administration and national standards for aviation safety. The site possesses national significance in commemorating the history of the United States of America.”

The Potomac River collision in January 2025 was the first major incident on U.S. soil in 16 years, but to a lot of people, that 16-year stretch isn't good enough. In 1956, mass air travel was not yet fully realized—the accident then, while tragic, somehow feels explainable. But today millions of people fly every day, every hour, and helicopters aren't supposed to crash into planes. The investigation of that crash will take a while. But whatever the conclusion, the crash happened.

Yes, we have vastly better technology now. But inexplicably, we somehow don't have enough air traffic controllers, not even close, nor do we have the required technology to do this job in their absence. As in the terrible quiet moments that followed the Grand Canyon crash that no one saw, it's as if it never happened, so little have we learned from it. And so the questions haven't changed:

Are we so smart?

Have we figured this out?

Will it happen again, and again, and again?

Ask the families of the 67 people who lost their lives in the icy Potomac River one January night, seven decades after the collision of TWA Flight 2 and United Flight 718.

The attempt was only possible thanks to some pre-gaming with pure oxygen, but still eye-popping.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The act of breathing has been central to life on Earth since the beginning, and the average human will take more than 600 million breaths in a single lifetime. But there's a specific group of humans—a subclass of freedivers known as apneists—who train their minds and bodies to efficiently halt this intuitive autonomic function, far exceeding the typical 30-to-90-second limit of breath-holding.

Take, for instance, Croatian freediver Budimir Šobat. On March 27, 2021, Šobat held his breath underwater for an astounding 24 minutes and 37 seconds—a feat that was only possible thanks to minutes of huffing pure oxygen before making the attempt. Now, four years, fellow countryman and freediver Vitomir Maričić exceeded this world record—and it wasn't even close.

On June 14, 2025 in Opatija, Croatia, Maričić performed an oxygen-assisted breath hold that shattered Šobat's by nearly a full five minutes, clocking in at 29 min and 3 seconds. A member of the Adriatic Freediving group, Maričić performed the attempt in a three-meter-deep pool at the town's Bristol Hotel in front of a 100-person crowd, according to the website Divernet. He says he took on this record as both a personal challenge and a way to raise awareness for ocean conservation.

“After the 20-minute mark, everything became easier, at least mentally,” Maričić told Divernet. He clarified, however, that the experience “got worse and worse physically, especially for my diaphragm, because of the contractions. But mentally I knew I wasn't going to give up.”

Denying your body life-supporting oxygen isn't something to be taken lightly. While the body has various areas that detect oxygen levels, the main system is a group of specialized cells in the brain and neck known as chemoreceptors. These cells track the balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the body. When someone holds their breath, CO2 rises and drives an increased desire in the brain to breathe. Eventually, the diaphragm will begin contracting involuntarily, which is typically when untrained apneists will break down and start gulping down air.

However, Maričić pre-gamed his world-record-breaking attempt by inhaling pure oxygen for 10 minutes before submersion. This offsets that initial oxygen-carbon dioxide balance, allowing freedivers to hold their breath for significantly longer than is possible for our unaided biology. That's why the world record for unaided breath holding is a much shorter (but still very impressive) 11 minutes and 35 seconds.

As ScienceAlert notes, Maričić's world-record fully doubles the maximum breath hold for bottlenose dolphins, and nearly matches the abilities of the harbor seal. However, humans have zero hope of ever snatching any world record from marine mammals entirely—the Cuvier's beaked whale can stay submerged underwater for more than three hours.

She spent weeks searching, and plans to give the stone a very special place in her life.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When Micherre Fox made the trek from New York City to the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Pike County, Arkansas, she was hoping to find a rock worthy of her engagement ring. Days of searching revealed nothing but dust, but right before she left, she unearthed a real gem—literally. 

What Fox thought was a spiderweb glistening with dew in the late morning sunlight turned out to be a 2.3-carat white diamond. She almost pushed it away with the toe of her boot until she realized what she was looking at. Staff at the park's Diamond Discovery entry confirmed that she had indeed come upon not just a diamond, but the third largest found in park this year. 366 diamonds have been registered at the park since January, and of those, only 11 that surfaced from its literal crater of diamonds were over one carat in size.

Crater of Diamonds is the result of geologic processes that took billions of years—from the migration of continents to the subduction of tectonic plates that have often caused volcanism throughout our planet's history. And about a hundred million years ago, a volcanic vent made up of magma and gases (known as a diatreme) formed from instability in Earth's mantle.

When gases in the diatreme caused it to rupture near the surface, the region literally exploded with diamonds, leaving behind the 83-acre crater that would someday become a state park. The area was littered with debris that had been blasted into the atmosphere, and when some of the diatreme eroded away, it left diamonds and other heavy minerals in the soil. This is why some lucky parkgoers, like Fox, may not even have to dig for a diamond. 75,000 diamonds have been found on park grounds since 1906 (long before it was officially a state park), the largest of which is now owned by the Smithsonian and on display at the National Museum of Natural History.

Diamonds don't normally materialize at the feet of tourists. Unlike most rocks and minerals, which form relatively close to the surface, they are born deep in the mantle and tend to be anywhere from a billion to 3.5 billion years old (with the oldest being almost as ancient as Earth and older than many stars). For a diamond to become the poster child of engagement ring ads everywhere, billions of carbon atoms have to bond to each other in cubic crystal lattice structure, with each carbon atom bonded to four other carbon atoms. This usually happens at depths of 150-200 km (93-124 miles), with rarer forms crystallizing up to 800 km (almost 500 miles) below the surface. 

When gobs of magma erupt from volcanoes, they take diamonds and other minerals with them. It is common for diamonds to be found embedded in magma that has hardened into a substance known as kimberlite. Known as much for their toughness as they are for their beauty, diamonds make it through being carried by magma rivers and belched out. 

The idea that a diamond is forever extends far beyond wedding vows—their hardness means they will probably last through the apocalypse, and some of the strongest tools are made from diamond. Fox, for her part, is ecstatic over her find, and looking forward to her own forever.

“Having never seen an actual diamond in my hands, I didn't know for sure, but it was the most ‘diamond-y diamond' I had seen,” she said in a recent park press release. When she realized what she was holding was an actual diamond, she “got on [her] knees and cried, then started laughing.”

Elizabeth Rayne is a creature who writes. Her work has appeared in Popular Mechanics, Ars Technica, SYFY WIRE, Space.com, Live Science, Den of Geek, Forbidden Futures and Collective Tales. She lurks right outside New York City with her parrot, Lestat. When not writing, she can be found drawing, playing the piano or shapeshifting.

Staphylococcus aureus is capable of infecting every organ system in the body and developing resistance to every available antibiotic used to treat it, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (commonly referred to as MRSA). This pathogen is characterized by the sudden emergence of virulent new clones and an array of mechanisms to circumvent the immune system and antibiotics. Furthermore, despite the development of new antibiotics and a growing body of high-quality data to inform their use, S. aureus continues to be a leading bacterial cause of death worldwide. In this Review, we provide an overview of the basic research on the complex interplay between S. aureus, the host and antibiotics. We also provide an update on the contemporary clinical studies on the treatment and prevention of S. aureus.

The fossilized chompers are evidence of a previously unknown hominin that coexisted with the earliest humans 2.8 million years ago.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The famed Australopithecus Lucy may have a cousin. A new discovery of fossilized teeth in an Ethiopian field has researchers theorizing that they came from a new species of Australopithecus. They dated the teeth to the same period as the oldest known specimens of the genus Homo, found in the same field, upending some traditional theories of human evolution. 

“This new research shows that the image many of us have in our minds of an ape to a Neanderthal to a modern human is not correct—evolution doesn't work like that,” Kaye Reed, Arizona State University paleoecologist, said in a statement. “Here we have two hominin species that are together.” 

The Ledi-Geraru Research Project—led by scientists at ASU, but encompassing an international team—continues to study the field in Africa, which is the same site that previously revealed the oldest member of the genus Homo and the earliest Oldowan stone tools ever found. 

Researchers discovered 13 of the Australopithecus teeth in the field that also gave us a Homo jaw, which has been dated to 2.8 million years ago. In a new study on the find, published in the journal Nature, lead author Brian Villmoare wrote that the teeth were found in sediment dated to between 2.6 million and 2.8 million years old. 

“We know what the teeth and mandible of the earliest Homo look like, but that's it,” Villmoare wrote. “This emphasizes the critical importance of finding additional fossils to understand the differences between Australopithecus and Homo, and potentially how they were able to overlap in the fossil record at the same location.” 

The team has been able to date these fossils by analyzing signs of volcanic and tectonic activity, including the presence of feldspar crystal within ash. “We can date the eruptions that were happening on the landscape when they're deposited,” Christopher Campisano, an ASU geologist, said in a statement. “And we know that these fossils are interbed between those eruptions, so we can date units above and below the fossils. We are dating the volcanic ash of the eruptions that were happening while they were on the landscape.” 

That volcanic information is important to understanding species of the time, as the landscape changed drastically with each volcanic event. The team's next step is examining tooth enamel to understand what members of this species was eating. They can then compare their findings about this Australopithecus specimen to what is already known about early Homo species, hoping to determine just how closely linked the two were. 

“Whenever you have an exciting discovery, if you're a paleontologist, you always know that you need more information,” Reed said. “You need more fossils. More fossils will help us tell the story of what happened to our ancestors a long time ago.”

The cell-type-level epigenomic landscape of human subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) is not well characterized. Here, we elucidate the epigenomic landscape across SAT cell types using snm3C-seq. We find that SAT CG methylation (mCG) displays pronounced hypermethylation in myeloid cells and hypomethylation in adipocytes and adipose stem and progenitor cells, driving nearly half of the 705,063 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Moreover, TET1 and DNMT3A are identified as plausible regulators of the cell-type-level mCG profiles. Both global mCG profiles and chromosomal compartmentalization reflect SAT cell-type lineage. Notably, adipocytes display more short-range chromosomal interactions, forming complex local 3D genomic structures that regulate transcriptional functions, including adipogenesis. Furthermore, adipocyte DMRs and A compartments are enriched for abdominal obesity genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants and polygenic risk, while myeloid A compartments are enriched for inflammation. Together, we characterize the SAT single-cell-level epigenomic landscape and link GWAS variants and partitioned polygenic risk of abdominal obesity and inflammation to the SAT epigenome.

The global prevalence of abdominal obesity, defined as an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in the abdominal region, has been increasing at an alarming rate over the past few decades1,2. Abdominal obesity is a known predictor of all-cause mortality, probably because of its increased risk of cardiometabolic disease (CMD) and other adverse pathological conditions3. The risks related to abdominal obesity are thought to be partly mediated through obesity-induced low-grade inflammation at the tissue and cell-type level4. This has stimulated research interest in investigating the molecular origin of abdominal obesity and related co-morbidities by focusing on SAT, the key fat depot in expanding and buffering against obesity.

SAT is highly heterogeneous and comprises an array of cell types5. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) enables the discovery of cell-type-level gene expression patterns in SAT6,7. However, this modality is limited to gene expression, even though SAT function is also influenced by epigenomic processes, such as cytosine DNA methylation at CpG sites (mCG)8, and chromatin conformation9. Previous studies in other tissues have shown that cell-type-level dynamic mCG in gene regulatory regions and gene bodies affect the expression of genes10. Furthermore, gene regulatory mechanisms need proper chromatin conformation, which is organized into compartments, domains and loops11. However, the cell-type-level epigenomic landscape underlying the extensive heterogeneity in SAT is poorly understood in humans, which also hinders genetic risk assessment of abdominal obesity, the functional basis of which probably includes specific cell-type-level epigenomic sites.

Single-nucleus methyl-3C sequencing (snm3C-seq) has emerged as a powerful and innovative platform to study DNA methylation and chromatin conformation at cell-type resolution12. Recent studies identified cell-type-level epigenomic signatures in various complex tissues in humans, such as oocytes13, prefrontal12 and frontal cortex14,15, and other diverse brain regions10. Using a similar approach, previous studies have also comprehensively assessed the epigenomes of mouse brain cell types16,17,18. However, cell-type-level epigenomic signatures in the human key fat depot SAT have been poorly studied. To address this important biomedical knowledge gap, we determined cell-type-level DNA methylation, chromatin conformation and gene expression signatures in SAT, assessed the involvement of methylation pathway genes in SAT cell-type-level dynamic methylation patterns, identified cell-type-level hypomethylated region-associated transcription factor (TF) binding motifs and investigated the contribution of variants in SAT cell-type-level epigenomic sites to polygenic risk of abdominal obesity and a related inflammatory marker, blood C-reactive protein (CRP).

To investigate the cell-type-level epigenomic landscape of human SAT, we profiled DNA methylation, chromatin conformation and gene expression on nuclei isolated from SAT biopsies from Finnish females (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 1.1). We used snm3C-seq to simultaneously profile single-cell-level DNA methylation and chromatin conformation of nuclei isolated from five SAT biopsies (see Methods). A total of 6,652 nuclei passed our quality control (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Note 1.2). We independently identified seven main cell types, including adipocytes, adipose stem and progenitor cells (ASPCs), perivascular, endothelial, myeloid, lymphoid and mast cells, using the global mCG of non-overlapping 5 kb bins and the intrachromosomal contacts among non-overlapping 100 kb bins (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Notably, when analyzing the two modalities jointly to derive the de novo snm3C-seq annotation, we discovered a group of nuclei (n = 63 nuclei), present in all five samples (constituting the remaining 0.8 ± 0.6%), that demonstrated inconsistent cell-type annotations between the two modalities (that is, categorized as perivascular cells by mCG and as adipocytes by chromatin conformation) (Fig. 2b). We labeled them as a transitional cell-type cluster to highlight their potential developmental stage, observed using the two different omic profiles (Fig. 2a,b).

Subsequently, we used the cell-type-level SAT expression data (d) to determine whether methylation pathway genes contribute to the observed differences in methylation patterns in SAT cell types and longitudinally cluster with adipogenesis pathway genes (e), identify cell-type-level TF binding motifs associated with hypomethylated regions in SAT cell types (f) and test the contribution of variants in cell-type-level DMRs and A and B compartments to the genetic risk of abdominal obesity (g).

The dashed line highlights the group of cells annotated as adipocytes.

We next investigated whether SAT snm3C-seq data can be integrated with SAT snRNA-seq data. First, we applied snRNA-seq on nuclei isolated from the same five SAT samples and three additional SAT samples from the Tilkka cohort to obtain 29,423 SAT nuclei (see Methods) and annotated them with matching cell-type resolution (Supplementary Note 1.3, Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1c). Similar to previous brain results15, we observed strong and consistent correlations between gene body mCG hypomethylation and RNA expression across the identified cell types (Fig. 2c). This correlation enabled us to integrate and co-embed the snm3C-seq and snRNA-seq cells in the shared canonical component space19 (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Fig. 4). Overall, these independently performed modality-specific annotations achieved a ≥0.94 overlap score across all cell-type pairs, in which a higher score indicates better integrated cells in the co-embedding space (see Methods) (Fig. 2e). Comparison between the snm3C-seq de novo annotation and its RNA-derived counterpart resulted in an adjusted Rand index of 0.975 and ≥0.95 confusion fraction (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Unique cell-type marker genes by these two modalities are shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Taken together, the observed cell-type epigenome profiles, identified using snm3C-seq, exhibit strong concordance with those derived from the snRNA-seq transcriptome; however, at the same time, they carry distinct modality-specific information. For example, the expression of a key adipocyte marker gene, GPAM, coincides with demethylation of the gene in the co-embedding space, which may allow for the recruitment of relevant proteins; for example, TFs (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 2a–f). In summary, mCG and chromatin conformation profiles generated by snm3C-seq robustly recapitulated epigenomic profiles of known major SAT cell types while also uncovering a subtle transition cluster, supporting the differentiation of human adipocytes through a previously less well-characterized route from the perivascular progenitors to adipocytes (Supplementary Note 1.4, Fig. 2, Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6).

Highly expressed SAT cell-type marker genes, revealed by each modality, may elucidate how epigenomic regulation is involved in biological processes and pathways. For both gene body mCG and gene expression, we identified modality-specific and modality-shared marker genes across all SAT cell types (Supplementary Note 1.5 and Extended Data Fig. 3a) and subsequently in shared and non-shared biological processes (Extended Data Fig. 3b) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enriched among adipocyte marker genes (Extended Data Fig. 3c). In adipocytes, for instance, although only 77 marker genes (21% of mCG and 9% of gene expression markers) are present in both modalities, the majority of biological processes (63% of the pathways identified from mCG and 65% from gene expression) and KEGG pathways (65% of the pathways from both mCG and gene expression) are shared (Supplementary Note 1.6). Focusing on genes involved in the well-characterized PPAR signaling pathway, we observed that six genes, ACSL1, ADIPOQ, LPL, PCK1, PLIN1 and PLIN4, are hypomethylated in adipocytes and the transition cell type, while being hypermethylated in the rest of the cell types. Correspondingly, their transcriptomic profiles reveal that they are predominantly expressed only in adipocytes, with minimal expression in other SAT cell types (Fig. 3a). Similarly, fat cell differentiation genes ADIPOQ, LPL, LEP, TCF7L2, AKT2 and SREBF1 are hypomethylated and predominantly expressed in adipocytes compared to the other SAT cell types (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Additionally, modality-shared adipocyte marker genes encode TFs, encompassing both known and less-known regulators critical to SAT (Supplementary Note 1.7 and Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). Collectively, these findings suggest a coordinated regulation of key pathways, biological processes and TFs through both transcriptional and epigenomic mechanisms.

To delineate the patterns of cell-type-level DNA methylation in SAT, we identified genome-wide DMRs in eight SAT cell types (adipocytes, ASPCs, transition, perivascular, endothelial, myeloid, lymphoid and mast cells) using methylpy20,21 (see Methods). Overall, 15.4% of the CG sites are differentially methylated across the SAT cell types, with a total of 705,063 CG DMRs covering 5.39% of the genome. These DMRs have a mean (±s.d.) length of 220 ± 152 bp and consist of an average of 4.5 ± 5.5 differentially methylated sites (DMSs). The large numbers of DMRs we identified in SAT cell types support distinct cell-type-level methylation patterns.

We observed striking genome-wide differences in the number and abundance of hypomethylated and hypermethylated regions among the SAT cell types (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 3). In particular, of the total DMRs, 56.3% (n = 396,758; −log10P = 129 using one-tailed t-test; see Methods) and 50.6% (n = 356,844; −log10P = 104, one-tailed t-test) are hypomethylated in adipocytes and ASPCs, contrasting with only 14.6% (n = 102,756) in myeloid cells. Conversely, we observed that up to 73.0% of the DMRs demonstrate a hypermethylation pattern in the myeloid cells (n = 514,434; −log10P = 163, one-tailed t-test) versus merely 14.2% in adipocytes and 21.4% in ASPCs. Jointly investigating the differential methylation states across all cell types revealed that 47.3% of the DMRs exhibit opposing profiles between adipocytes, ASPCs and those of the myeloid cells. Taken together, our finding suggests that the widespread repression of regulatory activity in myeloid cells is typically associated with heightened regulatory activity in adipocytes and ASPCs.

To investigate the relevance of cell-type-level hypomethylated regions in gene regulation, we performed TF binding motif enrichment analysis using cell-type-level hypomethylated regions. We identified several cell-type-level TFs (Supplementary Note 1.8, Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 4), suggesting that these TFs might either bind to the DNA in a cell-type-specific manner or regulate cell-type-level differential methylation patterns. We then sought to validate the cell-type-level TFs that we identified using HOMER22 (Fig. 3c) by analyzing external chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data from ENCODE23 (see Methods). As only immune cell ChIP-seq data are available among the SAT cell types, we focused on validating myeloid-specific TFs (Fig. 3c). As expected, binding peaks for the TFs IRF4 and MEF2B in GM12878 demonstrate 3.5-fold and 2.8-fold enrichments compared to the matching genomic background (empirical P < 0.001 for both TFs, −log10P = 1,618 and 1,860 using one-tailed hypergeometric test, respectively) (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 5). For CEBPG binding peaks in K562, we observed a 2.2-fold enrichment (empirical P < 0.001, −log10P = 647 using one-tailed hypergeometric test) (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 5). Together, these TF enrichments using ENCODE ChIP-seq data in a relevant cell line independently validated our de novo TF results obtained using HOMER (Fig. 3c).

Tight packaging of DNA inside the nucleus leads to physical contacts between genomic regions, which affects the gene expression machinery24. We observed substantial differences in the distribution of closely and distantly located interaction contacts at various genomic distances across the cells profiled by snm3C-seq (see Methods). In pairwise comparisons with other cell types, adipocytes harbor significantly higher proportions of short-range interactions (100 kb to 2 Mb) compared to long-range interactions (10–100 Mb), with the exception of the transition cell type (−log10P > 91; one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Note 1.9). This observation is in line with all cell-level clustering analyses using chromatin conformation information at various resolutions, which indicate that the transition cell type shares more similarity with adipocytes (Figs. 2b and 4c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b).

a,b, Frequency of contacts per cell against genomic distance (y axis in log scale), grouped by cell types (a) and ordered by the median short-range to long-range interaction ratios (b). Dashed lines in a mark short-range and long-range contacts. The center of the box in b represents the median; the bounds of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles and the whiskers show the minimum and maximum values within 1.5 times the interquartile range. Statistical significance was evaluated based on pairwise one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for a higher short-range interaction ratio in adipocytes. Asterisks (***) indicate unadjusted −log10P > 50. Specifically, unadjusted −log10P = 197, 116, 221, 258, 128 and 91 for ASPCs, perivascular, endothelial, myeloid, lymphoid and mast cells; n = 63, 1,212, 1,814, 482, 1,206, 1,387, 316 and 172 for transition, adipocytes, ASPCs, perivascular, endothelial, myeloid, lymphoid and mast cells, respectively. c,d, UMAP visualization of low-dimensional embeddings of cells using domains (c) and loops (d) as features, colored by the snm3C-seq annotation; adjusted Rand index (ARI) evaluates the clustering concordance against snm3C-seq annotation. e, Heatmap visualization of the normalized interaction contact map on chromosome 12 and its corresponding compartment scores. f, Upset plot (left) visualizing a subset of the differential 100 kb bins and their corresponding percentages; horizontal stacked bar plot (right) showing the marginal A compartment enrichment of differential 100 kb bins. The vertical dotted line separates cell-type-level A compartment flips, B compartment flips and differential bins detected within homogeneous A or B compartments. g, Dendrogram of the five most abundant SAT cell types constructed with compartment scores on differential 100 kb bins. h, Similar to g, except on all annotated SAT cell types, constructed with mCG fractions across DMRs.

In addition, the observed differences in the ratio of short-range to long-range interactions between ASPCs and adipocytes (one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum −log10P > 197) could suggest a link between the contact distances and functionally important genomic regions in adipogenesis. Given that ASPCs develop into adipocytes, we speculate that this change may reflect the unilocular lipid droplet formation in adipocytes that makes them larger than ASPCs.

Chromatin compartments, which connect stretches of the genome that are tens of megabases apart, reflect how cells arrange their chromosomal structures in three-dimensional space at the highest level25. We started our investigation of aggregated SAT cell-type-level genome spatial topology by calculating the compartment scores on the pseudobulk contact matrices for the five most abundant cell types (adipocytes, ASPCs, endothelial, perivascular and myeloid cells) at 100 kb resolution. Based on the sign of the compartment scores, we partitioned the genome into either the active A compartment regions or the more repressive B compartment regions. The correlation matrices derived from the normalized interaction contact maps revealed visually distinct cell-type-level plaid patterns. For example, on chromosome 6 (Extended Data Fig. 6c) and chromosome 12 (Fig. 4e), endothelial and myeloid cells harbor more intricate structures, indicated by the frequent compartment switches, whereas adipocytes, ASPCs and perivascular cells tend to have longer stretches of region being annotated as the same compartment (Supplementary Note 1.10 and Extended Data Fig. 6d).

Upon a closer inspection, a total of 11,571 100 kb bins, spanning 44.3% of the genome, are statistically differentially conformed among the five cell types at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1 cutoff. The empirical FDR is estimated to be ≤0.02 (see Methods). Although each cell type has its own distinct pattern of chromosomal compartments, differential 100 kb bins consistently demonstrate at least a 1.36-fold enrichment landing in the active A compartments compared to the genome-wide background (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 6e and Supplementary Table 6). Interestingly, across all investigated SAT cell types, the two leading predominant compartment combinations are the homogeneous A and B. These combinations account for 18.8% and 9.7% of the total differentially conformed regions (8.3% and 4.3% of the genome), suggesting significant heterogeneity within each compartment stratification (that is, A and B). These are followed by combinations driven by myeloid and endothelial cells, either through cell-type-level compartment flips (A→B or B→A) or coordinated flips involving both cell types (Supplementary Note 1.10 and Extended Data Fig. 6e–g). Given that we observed similar distinct mCG patterns for endothelial and myeloid cells, we aimed to confirm whether the lineage dendrogram constructed from differential 100 kb bins would mirror the developmental trajectory inferred from DMRs. Indeed, hierarchical clustering consistently grouped endothelial and myeloid cells, characterized by pronounced hypomethylation and frequent compartmental switches, into a distinct branch in both modalities (Fig. 4g,h), in line with a previous report showing that myeloid progenitors also give rise to vascular endothelial cells26.

In addition to compartmentalization, the genome maintains its finer spatial structure by forming interaction domains and cohesion-mediated chromatin loops. Analyzing snapshots of the 3D genome at 25 kb and 10 kb resolution allowed us to delineate these regional features at both cell and aggregated cell-type resolution. In addition to the transition cell type, adipocytes showcase an accumulation of significantly denser interaction domains (an average of 4,120 per cell, compared to 3,574 in others; −log10P > 45, pairwise one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test), while spanning a much shorter distance (median of 679,121 bp per cell, compared to 783,213 bp in others; Extended Data Fig. 7a–c). Interestingly, the number of detected domains is highly correlated with the ratio of short-range to long-range interactions (Pearson's correlation coefficient, 0.76; Extended Data Fig. 7d). This observation reinforces the idea that regional contacts are necessary to support the more intricate local 3D structures. Both features correlate with the general transcriptomic activity in the matching snRNA-seq data, in which adipocytes show a 1.5-fold increase in the total number of unique molecular identifiers (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). Overlapping cell-type pseudobulk insulation scores with boundary probability, calculated as the fraction of cells with a boundary detected in a given cell type, identified a total of 1,791 differential boundaries (see Methods). Regarding chromatin loops, we detected a median of 47,837 and 5,797 cell-type-level loop pixels and merged loop summits, respectively. Adipocytes demonstrate a similar trend of having more loop summits (n = 8,852) and a relatively shorter median loop length (230,000 bp, compared to others 290,000 bp; Extended Data Fig. 7g,h). Along with the clustering results derived from regional interaction features (for example, insulation scores, domains and loops), which show highly concordant annotations (Fig. 4c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b), we conclude that granular 3D genomic features also exhibit significant heterogeneity across SAT cell types.

The 3D topology of a cell also influences its transcriptomic dynamics with cell-type specificity. As expected, genes expressed in a cell tend to localize in its active A compartment, exhibiting ≥2.24-fold enrichment relative to the B compartments across the five most abundant cell types. These ratios increase when restricted to the set of cell-type-level unique marker genes. Perivascular cells, in particular, exhibit a staggering 13-fold A/B ratio, leading to 92.8% of the unique marker genes landing in the A compartments (Supplementary Table 7). We next focused on ASPCs, a cell type that undergoes active differentiation into adipocytes, and systematically evaluated how compartment flipping affects the downstream expression. On a global scale, 23.4% of the differentially conformed regions change from the ASPC A compartments to adipocyte B, while 27.5% convert from the B compartments to A. Residing within these topologically interesting regions are some key cell-type marker genes crucial for adipogenesis (Supplementary Note 1.11). For example, ADIPOQ is located in an interaction domain unique to adipocytes with a pronounced demethylation pattern around its gene body, probably facilitating additional TFs to bind and activate it functionally. The adjacent differential boundary marks a stretch of the genome, encapsulating 1 Mb upstream and downstream of ADIPOQ, that transitions from the inactive B compartments in ASPCs to the active A compartments in adipocytes (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Other strong gene expression de novo adipocyte marker genes, including TENM3, CSMD1 and PCDH9, also land within differential domains specific to adipocytes; additionally, CSMD1 and PCDH9 have cell-type-level loop domains near the transcription start sites (Extended Data Fig. 8b and Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). Together, our findings suggest that chromosome conformation, ranging from mega-base compartmentalization to kilo-base loop formation, reflects a higher level of carefully balanced coordination among the SAT cell types, influencing both their epigenetic regulation profiles and trickling down to their transcriptional activities.

DNA methylation involves the covalent addition of a methyl group to DNA, a process facilitated by DNA methyltransferase enzymes, such as DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A) and DNA methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B)27. Conversely, DNA demethylation comprises the removal of this methyl group from the DNA by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family proteins, specifically, TET1, TET2 and TET3 (Fig. 5a). Among the demethylase genes, TET1 is preferentially expressed in adipocytes (−log10P > 300; two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. 5b), in line with our observation that adipocytes have significantly more hypomethylated (56.3%) than hypermethylated regions (14.2%) (Fig. 5c,d). Among the DNA methyltransferases, our cell-type-level SAT snRNA-seq data show that DNMT3A is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, with minimal or no expression in adipocytes (−log10P = 136; two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. 5b). Consistent with our DNMT3A expression results, 73.0% of DMRs are hypermethylated in the myeloid cells while only 14.2% are hypermethylated in adipocytes (Fig. 5c). In addition, the expression of a methylation maintenance gene, DNMT1, is significantly lower in adipocytes than other SAT cell types (−log10P = 170; two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Expression of other methylation (DNMT3B and UHRF1) and demethylation genes (TET2, TET3 and TDG), shown in Extended Data Fig. 9a,b, suggest that TET1 and DNMT3A are the most important genes that contribute to the observed adipocyte hypomethylation and myeloid hypermethylation patterns, indicating their potential mechanistic role in cell-type-level DNA methylation signatures in SAT. The SAT bulk RNA-seq dataset further revealed that bulk expression of DNMT3A is negatively associated with insulin sensitivity using the Matsuda Index, whereas bulk expression of TET1 is positively correlated with the Matsuda Index (Supplementary Note 1.12 and Supplementary Table 8). In addition, we observed that TET1 is temporally co-expressed with known adipogenesis genes across human primary preadipocyte differentiation (Supplementary Note 1.13, Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Table 9). Taken together, the cell-type-level expression patterns of DNMT3A in myeloid cells and TET1 in adipocytes suggest that their association signals with CMD traits we observed in the SAT bulk expression may largely originate from their high expression in these two specific cell types.

Asterisk (*) indicates statistical significance from a paired one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test, comparing the median cluster expression across n = 5 samples, showing higher expression in ASPCs than in adipocytes (unadjusted P = 0.031). The center of the bar represents the median, and the error bars represent the highest and lowest expression across n = 5 samples. f, Longitudinal expression of TET1 is plotted across the 14-day SAT preadipocyte differentiation. The shaded ribbon behind the trajectory of TET1 reflects the mean and standard deviation of the genes that clustered into similar trajectory patterns as TET1 using DPGP.

We next explored the genetic contributions to key CMDs relevant to SAT from variants residing in the cell-type-level compartments and DMRs. Specifically, we assessed abdominal obesity using waist-hip-ratio adjusted for body mass index (WHRadjBMI) as its well-established proxy28,29, body mass index (BMI), CRP and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in the UK Biobank (UKB)30,31.

We first evaluated the partitioned polygenic risk of variants landing in cell-type-level compartments and DMRs (see Methods). Among the four traits, we highlight WHRadjBMI. All WHRadjBMI polygenic risk scores (PRSs) built from variants in the cell-type-level A compartments are significant (PR2 < 0.05) and enriched predictors (Pperm10,000 < 0.05), explaining ≥80% of variance in WHRadjBMI captured by the full genome (Fig. 6a, Extended Data Fig. 10a,b and Supplementary Table 10). Conversely, we observed no PRS enrichment from the B compartments. We also observed enrichment of the WHRadjBMI polygenic risk from variants in cell-type-level DMRs and strong genetic contributions to CMDs from the target eGenes of the SAT cis-expression quantitative trait locus variants, residing in these cell-type-level DMRs using HuGE scoring32 (Supplementary Note 1.14, Fig. 6b and Supplementary Tables 11 and 12). Additionally, we found that PRSs constructed from the A compartments and the hypomethylated regions of myeloid cells are enriched predictors of CRP, suggesting a low-grade inflammatory role for this immune cell type (Supplementary Note 1.14, Fig. 6c and Supplementary Tables 10 and 11).

a,b, Lollipop plots depict the incremental variance explained of each cell-type-level PRS for abdominal obesity (using WHRadjBMI as a proxy) from the (a) A and B compartments and (b) hypomethylated and hypermethylated regions. Each lollipop represents a WHRadjBMI PRS, in which dot size corresponds to the incremental variance explained of the PRS. Significant enrichment of incremental variance explained was determined empirically by comparing to n = 10,000 permutated PRSs (see Methods). The gray vertical dashed line indicates the significance cutoff based on unadjusted one-tailed permutation P values (that is, Pperm10,000 < 0.05). Bars and lollipops corresponding to cell types with significantly enriched PRSs are colored by cell type, whereas those without are outlined in gray without a filling. c, Summary table visualizing the overall PRS and GWAS enrichment results across four key cardiometabolic traits (that is, WHRadjBMI, MASLD, BMI and CRP), stratified by cell-type-level hypomethylated regions and A compartments. Orange indicates nominal significance (P < 0.05) on the one-tailed permutation P values for PRSs and the one-tailed hypergeometric P values for GWAS enrichment. The bolded black border highlights the following consistently significant cell-type-cardiometabolic trait pair: adipocyte–WHRadjBMI.

Next, we examined the cell-type-level compartments and DMRs for overrepresentation of independent GWAS variants for the four outcomes. We observed that all five cell-type-level A compartments are enriched for both WHRadjBMI and CRP GWAS variants (Fig. 6c, Extended Data Fig. 10c and Supplementary Table 13). Adipocyte A compartments are additionally enriched for BMI and MASLD GWAS variants. For DMRs, we observed enrichment of WHRadjBMI GWAS variants in adipocyte and myeloid hypomethylated and in ASPC and perivascular hypermethylated regions, as well as strong genetic contributions to obesity-related outcomes from their adjacent genes using HuGE scoring (Supplementary Note 1.14, Fig. 6c and Supplementary Table 14).

Overall, our results highlight the SAT cell-type-level methylation and spatial conformation profiles as important contexts underlying the genetic risk of CMDs, with the hypomethylated regions and the active A compartments of adipocytes giving the strongest signal for abdominal obesity risk and the A compartments of myeloid cells more indicative of inflammation risk.

Delineating the cell-type-level epigenomic landscape in human SAT is crucial for understanding its regulatory mechanisms and impact on obesity risk. Our data revealed a highly dynamic reciprocal interplay between the SAT cell-type-level epigenomes, particularly between adipocytes and myeloid cells. We further integrated the differential epigenomic sites with variant-level data in the UKB, thus uncovering their significant contributions to the genetic risks of CMDs, most notably abdominal obesity. Finally, we elucidated the potential role of specific methylation and demethylation pathway genes in the cell-type-level differential methylation of human SAT.

Focusing on bulk methylome profiles, previous studies have reported differential DNA methylation patterns at the tissue level in SAT and their association with obesity33,34. However, underlying non-captured cell-type-level methylation patterns and composition often confound tissue-level analyses35. Our SAT cell-type-level methylation profiles and DMRs could serve as reference panels and provide informative features for computationally decomposing the heterogeneous SAT mixtures36,37,38, a critical step for reducing false discoveries in tissue-level studies and facilitating cell-type-specific biomarker identification36,39,40,41,42. The cell-type composition itself could also hold substantial clinical implications. For example, previous research using transcriptome profiling of perigonadal adipose tissue in mice and immunohistochemistry of human SAT has suggested that the accumulation of myeloid cells, particularly macrophages, correlates with increased adiposity43.

Among the identified cell-type-level 3D genome structures in SAT, adipocytes showcase a distinct regional topology, with a 1.51-fold enrichment in relative short-range interactions, a 1.15-fold increase in the number of domains and a 1.72-fold increase in overall transcriptomic activity. Similar patterns have been observed in other human solid tissues, and notably, these types of differences in the non-neuronal cells in the brain have been linked to larger nuclear size10,44,45. The presence of the key adipocyte marker gene and adipokine ADIPOQ in a genomic region differentially conformed between ASPCs and adipocytes while heavily demethylated in adipocytes further supports the idea that epigenomic structures reorganize during cell differentiation46, ultimately regulating downstream, regional and cell-type-level gene expression.

In our cell-type-level investigations of methylation pathway genes, we found notably high expression of TET1 in adipocytes and DNMT3A in myeloid cells, supporting a tissue and cell-type-level reciprocal coordination and cross-talk between TET1 expression and hypomethylation in adipocytes and DNMT3A expression and hypermethylation in myeloid cells. A previous study showed that TET1 is an important DNA demethylase in adipose bulk tissue47. An earlier study reported the involvement of TET1 in adipocytokine promoter hypomethylation in adipocytes48. Furthermore, prior studies have also demonstrated that both TET1 and DNMT3A compete to regulate epigenetic mechanisms49. Although previous studies have investigated TET1 (refs. 47,50,51) and DNMT3A52,53 in adipose bulk tissue level or some of the SAT cell types, we investigated their expression at the single-cell level in all main SAT cell types from the human SAT biopsies, thus providing more granular information about these key methylation genes.

Abdominal obesity is highly polygenic54. Previous studies have successfully built predictive genome-wide PRSs for abdominal obesity55,56 and shown that a high genetic predisposition to abdominal obesity predicts the regain of abdominal obesity following weight loss54. However, less is known about the characteristics of specific genomic regions that contribute most to the polygenic risk of abdominal obesity, which could ultimately improve individual disease risk assessment. By constructing the partitioned PRSs and examining the presence of the independent strongest GWAS variants for abdominal obesity based on the two epigenomic modalities, we discovered that the GWAS variants landing in both the hypomethylated regions and those in the active A compartments of adipocytes show robust associations for abdominal obesity.

Our study has some limitations. First, even though snm3C-seq reveals both intrachromosomal and inter-chromosomal interactions, we have only presented extensive analyses of the former. Although we recognize the potential interest in inter-chromosomal interactions, single-cell 3D genome data currently remains relatively sparse and does not yet support robust and reliable identification of inter-chromosomal interactions10,12,16,17. Second, generating snm3C-seq data in frozen human solid tissues remains time-consuming and expensive, requiring relatively large biopsies compared to other single-cell omics platforms. As a result, this study only includes Finnish females without obesity. Inclusion of males and individuals with obesity would help elucidate potential sex-specific epigenomic landscapes and differences across the various BMI categories. Similarly, larger sets of samples from additional populations are also warranted. Third, inclusion of visceral adipose tissue data into future studies would uncover cell-type-level methylation and chromatin conformation patterns in this other metabolically important adipose depot as well as their differences compared to SAT. Nevertheless, taken together, our study provides a valuable insight into the cell-type-level epigenomes in human SAT to be followed up in future studies.

The Tilkka study was approved by the Helsinki University Hospital Ethics Committee (approval no. HUS/1039/2019). The UKB study was approved by the North West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee (approval no. 21/NW/0157). The Finnish METabolic Syndrome In Men (METSIM) study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Northern Savo Hospital District (approval no. 171/2004). All participants provided written informed consent. All research conformed to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. No compensation was provided to the participants.

Eight Finnish females without obesity underwent abdominal SAT liposuction at Tilkka Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. We performed snRNA-seq on all eight SAT biopsies and snm3C-seq on five SAT biopsies. The mean age (±s.d.) for the snRNA-seq cohort was 44.5 ± 6.03 years, and for the snm3C-seq cohort, the mean age was 44.4 ± 4.78 years.

For our GWAS enrichment and PRS analyses, we used genotype and phenotype data from 391,701 unrelated individuals (54.0% female; mean age, 56.9 ± 8.0 years) of European origin from the UKB30,31. Data for UKB were collected across 22 assessment centers30,31. Genotype data were obtained using either the Applied Biosystems UK BiLEVE Axiom Array or Applied Biosystems UKB Axiom Array and imputed with the Haplotype Reference Consortium and the merged UK10K and 1000 Genomes phase 3 reference panels30,31. Data from UKB were accessed under application 33934.

Unrelated men (n = 335; mean age, 54.1 ± 4.9 years) from the METSIM cohort57 underwent SAT biopsies for bulk RNA-seq. These METSIM participants were recruited from the University of Eastern Finland and Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.

We performed in situ chromatin conformation capture using an Arima Genomics Arima-HiC Kit45 with the following modification: the amount of Triton-X 100 in the NIBT buffer was increased to 1% to account for the large amount of fat in adipose tissue. Fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting and library preparation were performed using the snmC-seq3 workflow (https://www.protocols.io/view/snm3c-seq3-kqdg3x6ezg25). The snmC-seq3 libraries of human SAT were sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument with S4 flow cells, generating 150 bp paired-end reads. The sequencing reads of snm3C-seq were mapped using Taurus-MH12 (https://github.com/luogenomics/Taurus-MH).

We filtered the cells profiled by snm3C-seq based on the following metrics10,12: (1) estimated non-conversion rate of mCCC% < 0.015; (2) global mCG% > 0.5; (3) global mCH% < 0.15; (4) total number of interaction contacts >100,000 and < 500,000; and (5) at least one intra-chromosome contact present in each autosome after filtering out reads with either end mapped to the ENCODE blacklist regions58 (Supplementary Fig. 1a).

We genotyped the DNAs from the Tilkka participants using the Infinium Global Screening Array-24 (v.1) (Illumina). In our quality control, we used PLINK (v.1.9)59 to remove individuals with missingness of >2%; unmapped, strand-ambiguous and monomorphic single nucleotide polymorphisms; and variants with missingness of >2% and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium P < 10−6. In addition, we imputed biological sex using the ‘–sex-check' function in PLINK (v.1.9)59 and confirmed that they matched the reported sex for all individuals.

We used the HRC reference panel (v.r1.1 2016)60 to perform genotype imputation on the Michigan imputation server. Before imputation, we removed duplicate variants as well as variants with allele mismatch with the HRC reference panel, and we matched strand flips and allele switches to the panel before haplotype phasing using Eagle (v.2.4)61. To perform the genotype imputation, we used minimac4 (ref. 62) and performed quality control on the data by removing single nucleotide polymorphisms with an imputation score R2 < 0.3 and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium P < 10−6.

We performed SAT snRNA-seq experiments (Supplementary Note 2.1) on the snap-frozen SAT biopsies from the Tilkka participants. We measured the concentration and quality of nuclei, separately for each sample, using a Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter after staining with trypan blue and Hoechst dyes. To construct the libraries, we used the Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit (v.3.1) (10× Genomics) and analyzed the quality of cDNA and gene expression using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. We sequenced the libraries from each participant together on an Illumina NovaSeq S4 with a target sequencing depth of 600 million read pairs. Processing of the SAT snRNA-seq data from the Tilkka cohort is described in Supplementary Note 2.2.

We aligned the raw snm3C-seq reads against the GRCh38 human genome reference and represented the mCG profiles of each cell by 5 kb bins across autosomal chromosomes. In brief, per cell and for each 5 kb bin, we calculated a hypomethylation score. Bins that overlapped with the ENCODE blacklist regions were excluded from the clustering analysis. Next, we performed latent semantic indexing to obtain the mCG profile embedding (Supplementary Note 2.3). For the chromosome conformation modality, we imputed the contact matrix of each cell at 100 kb resolution using scHicluster63 (v.1.3.5) with pad = 1 and used singular value decomposition to project all intra-chromosome contacts between 100 kb and 10 Mb that land in autosomal chromosomes to a low-dimensional space (Supplementary Note 2.3).

We annotated the clusters de novo by leveraging the negative correlation between mCG and transcriptional activity10,15,16 and the known SAT marker genes, reported previously64. Specifically, we aligned the snm3C-seq data to GENCODE (v.33) annotations and calculated the average mCG fractions of the gene body (Supplementary Note 2.4).

We then tested for de novo gene body hypomethylation patterns across all protein-coding genes for each snm3C-seq cluster, defined using both the global mCG and chromatin conformation embeddings. To identify top cluster markers, we adapted criteria similar to those used for CH methylation in the brain16, applying them to mCG in SAT. In more detail, we required a hypomethylation difference of ≥0.15 in the average normalized fraction compared to other clusters, a Benjamini–Hochberg-adjusted Wilcoxon rank-sum test P value of ≤0.01 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of ≥0.75 for distinguishing cells within the cluster from those outside it. Next, we leveraged the existing snRNA atlas of SAT cells for annotation64 (Supplementary Note 2.4).

For modality-specific analysis of snm3C-seq cells (that is, those independently identified within the global mCG or chromatin conformation profiles), we performed separate clustering, visualization and annotation similarly. The final annotations for each modality-specific cluster were determined by identifying the most common snm3C-seq cell-type labels among its constituent cells (Fig. 2b). We categorized the group of cells that clustered with adipocytes if using only the chromosome conformation information and with perivascular cells if using only the mCG profiles as the ‘transition' cluster.

We integrated all remaining high-quality droplets from all snRNA-seq data with reciprocal principal components analysis (rPCA) implemented in Seurat (v.4.3.0)65 and clustered integrated data with a standard Louvain algorithm, using parameters of the first 30 principal components and a resolution of 0.5. We annotated each cluster with its cell type using SingleR (v.1.8.1)66, using a previously published single-cell atlas of human SAT as a ref. 64.

We aligned the snm3C-seq cells as the query and snRNA-seq cells as the refs. 18,67 under the canonical correlation analysis framework in Seurat (v.4.1.0)19. To capture the shared variance between modalities, we started by reversing the sign of the normalized gene body mCG fractions. In more detail, given that a decrease in gene body methylation is typically associated with increased transcriptional activity, we began by reversing the sign of the normalized gene body mCG fractions for all snm3C-seq nuclei to correct for the mismatch in directionality between the two modalities. As a result, in the adjusted mCG fraction matrix, cell-type marker genes show higher gene body methylation values in their respective cell types than other cell types, aligning with the patterns observed in the snRNA-seq data. These adjusted gene body methylation values serve as a proxy for the transcriptional activity of the snm3C-seq nuclei, which we then co-embedded with those from the snRNA-seq nuclei (Supplementary Note 2.5). Cells profiled by both technologies were merged on their imputed expression profiles, projected to low-dimensional space with PCA and visualized by uniform manifold approximation and projection (constructed on the top ten principal components). We evaluated the concordance score and the confusion matrix between each de novo snm3C-seq and the snRNA-seq cell-type cluster pair in the shared canonical correlation analysis co-embedding space (Supplementary Note 2.6). We also performed adipogenesis trajectory analysis using SAT snRNA-seq data (Supplementary Note 2.7).

We excluded the following genes from differential testing of the cell-type marker genes: genes that overlap with the ENCODE blacklisted regions; smaller genes (≤200 bp) mostly covered by other genes (overlap region of ≥90% of the gene length)16; and genes with a shallow coverage, constantly methylated or un-methylated, defined as those without ≥10 methylated or un-methylated counts in ≥10 cells belonging to the cell type under investigation. Cell-type-level differentially methylated genes were determined de novo by performing a Wilcoxon rank-sum test on the normalized gene body mCG fractions of the snm3C-seq cells in a one-vs-rest way. We retained genes that had a Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P value of <0.05 and at the same time exhibited a hypomethylation difference of ≥0.1 in terms of the average normalized fraction compared to the other cell types16. For transcriptomics, we first filtered for the set of expressed genes in SAT, defined as those with ≥3 counts in ≥3 cells68. We used the ‘FindAllMarkers' function in Seurat under default parameters except restricting to positive marker genes with ≥25% non-zero expression in either the tested cell type or the other ones69,70,71. Subsequently, we filtered out genes with Bonferroni-adjusted P ≥ 0.05. To obtain unique marker genes from both snm3C-seq and snRNA-seq, we removed genes identified as marker genes for more than one cell type.

To identify cell-type-level biological processes and functional pathways enriched among the cell-type marker genes in mCG and gene expression modalities, we used the web-based tool WebGestalt 2024 (ref. 72), which identifies the overrepresentation of gene sets in Gene Ontology biological processes and KEGG pathways. For each SAT cell type, we used the unique cell-type marker genes as the input, with only the genes expressed within that cell type as the reference for the enrichment analysis. Biological processes and KEGG pathways with FDR < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

To obtain the cell-type-level mCG profiles, we aggregated the single-cell-level number of CG methylated counts and total coverage based on the snm3C-seq joint annotation and further merged reads mapped to adjacent CpGs in +/− strands. We then used MethylPy20,21, implemented in the ALLCools package, to detect genomic regions that display distinct mCG patterns across various cell types. DMSs on autosomes were tested across all eight annotated cell types using default parameters. For all DMSs, we assigned one of the three states per cell type—hypomethylated, neutral or hypermethylated—based on whether the fitted residual (that is, the normalized deviation away from the mean methylation level) fell below the 0.4, between the 0.4 and 0.6 or above the 0.6 quantile of its chromosome-wide background, respectively16. Nearby DMSs (within 250 bp) with Pearson correlations of >0.8 for the methylation fractions across the cell types were merged into DMRs. Differential methylation states were assigned to each DMR based on the average of those of the DMSs it encompasses. DMRs containing only one DMS or without any hypermethylation or hypomethylation state assignment, along with DMRs or DMSs overlapping ENCODE blacklist regions, were excluded from downstream analyses. We further evaluated cell-type preferential DMR patterns, adjusting for variability in statistical power owing to differences in coverage across cell types (Supplementary Note 2.8).

We performed TF binding motif enrichment analysis using the motif discovery tool HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment) (v.4.11.1)22. For each SAT main cell type, we used the hypomethylated regions as input data for motif enrichment analysis with the HOMER function ‘findMotifsGenome.pl'. TF binding motifs with P < 1 × 10−12 were considered statistically significant. Circular visualization of cell-type-level TF binding motif enrichment results was prepared using the circlize package (v.0.4.16)73 in R. We further validated cell-type-level TFs by confirming the overrepresentation of ChIP-seq peaks overlapping DMRs (Supplementary Note 2.9), using external data from ENCODE23.

Based on the snm3C-seq joint annotation, we merged scHicluster imputed single-cell-level contact matrices at 100 kb resolution per chromosome to form the cell-type-level pseudobulk conformation profiles for the five most abundant cell types (adipocytes, ASPCs, endothelial, perivascular and myeloid cells) as well as a cell-type aggregated version (Supplementary Note 2.10). Cell-type-level pseudobulk conformation profiles were then normalized by the distance between the contacts and converted to correlation matrices by dcHiC (v.2.1)46. For all five cell types, we fitted PCA on the resulting matrices per chromosome and selected the appropriate leading principal component as the compartment scores (Supplementary Note 2.11). Finally, we tested for genomic bins that demonstrated large deviations from the cell-type average under a multivariate normal distribution measured by the Mahalanobis distance using the covariance matrix learned with outlier bins removed. Bins with FDR-corrected P < 0.1 were labeled as differentially conformed regions46. Empirically, we observed FDR < 0.02 when repeating the same analysis but only on a null set of cell-type-level contact maps, obtained by arbitrarily shuffling the annotation of the cells before merging to the pseudobulk level (that is, a scenario in which any differential compartment detected is false-positive by construction), indicating a conservative calibration of the testing result by dcHiC.

For interaction domains, we used scHiCluster (v.1.3.5)63 with pad =2 to impute the contact matrix of each cell per autosomal chromosome at a 25 kb resolution, restricted to contacts within 10 Mb. We detected domains for each cell using TopDom (v.0.0.2)74, calculated the insulation scores across all 25 kb genomic bins with a window size of ten bins using the imputed contact profiles and visualized with uniform manifold approximation and projection (Supplementary Note 2.12). Cell-type-level domain boundary probabilities were calculated as the fraction of cells with a detected domain boundary in a given 25 kb bin across all cells belonging to the specified cell type. Differential domain boundaries were evaluated per bin based on the following criteria45: a z-score-transformed chi-squared statistic of >1.960 (97.5th percentile of standard normal distribution); differences between the maximum and minimum cell-type boundary probabilities of >0.05; detection as a local boundary peak (maximum); simultaneous detection as a local insulation score valley (minimum); and FDR < 0.001.

To analyze chromosomal looping, we used scHiCluster (v.1.3.5)63 with pad = 2, window_size = 30,000,000 and step_size = 10,000,000 to impute a contact matrix of each cell per autosomal chromosome at a 10 kb resolution, restricted to contacts within 10 Mb. Loop pixels were detected from cell-type pseudobulk imputed contact profiles based on enrichment relative to both its global and local backgrounds. We aggregated nearby loop pixels passing an empirical FDR of 0.1 to loop summits (Supplementary Note 2.12).

We assessed associations between DNMT3A and TET1 SAT bulk expression and key CMD traits, including WHRadjBMI, BMI, serum triglyceride levels, Matsuda Index and fat mass (Supplementary Note 2.13). Using six-time-point preadipocyte differentiation data (Supplementary Note 2.14), we also analyzed longitudinal co-expression patterns of adipogenesis genes and their methylation regulators (Supplementary Notes 2.15 and 2.16).

To assess the contributions of the SAT cell-type-level DMRs and cell-type-level compartments on the genetic risk for cardiometabolic traits, we constructed partitioned PRSs from variants landing in each set of cell-type-level DMRs and compartments for BMI, WHRadjBMI, CRP and MASLD in the UKB30,31, using a previously published imputed MASLD status75.

We first generated GWAS summary statistics for each trait with a 50% base group (n = 195,863) by applying a rank-based inverse-normal transform to each trait and used the linear-mixed model approach of BOLT-LMM (v.2.3.6)76, including age, age2, sex, the top 20 genetic principal components, testing center and genotyping array as covariates. Variants with a minor allele frequency of <1% and INFO < 0.8 were removed from the summary statistics. We then partitioned the remaining 50% into a 30% target and 20% validation groups for developing and applying the PRS model, respectively. Variants with a minor allele frequency of <1% and INFO < 0.8 were removed from the GWAS summary statistics, and the variants missing in >1% of subjects, with a minor allele frequency of <1% or violating Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, as well as individuals with >1% missing genotypes or extreme heterozygosity, were removed from the target and validation genotype data77.

To compute the PRS for each outcome, we first generated independent marker sets by performing linkage disequilibrium clumping on all variants passing quality control in the genome using PLINK (v.1.9)78, with a linkage disequilibrium R2 threshold of 0.2 and a window size of 250 kb. We then used the 30% test set (n = 115,120) to empirically identify the optimal P value cut point at the genome-wide level. In brief, we applied the PLINK78 ‘–score' functionality to separately compute aggregated scores from subsets of the genome-wide clumped variants passing a P value threshold from 5 × 10−8 to 0.5, using effect sizes and P values from the GWAS summary statistics. After identifying the best thresholding cutoff in the 30% test set (0.05 for WHRadjBMI and CRP, 0.3 for BMI and 0.2 for MASLD), we computed regional PRSs in the 20% validation set (n = 76,758), consisting of the clumped and thresholded variants landing within the DMRs or compartments. Variance explained (R2) by each PRS was calculated by adjusting each trait for age, age2, the top 20 genetic principal components, testing center, genotyping array and sex, applying a rank-based inverse-normal transform and then regressing the PRS on the adjusted trait. We assessed the statistical significance of the variance explained by each PRS by comparing it to those of 10,000 permuted PRSs constructed from randomly selected variant sets with matching size and genomic background (that is, genome-wide clumped and thresholded). We also assessed overrepresentation of GWAS variants (Supplementary Note 2.17), their cis-expression quantitative trait locus effects and relevance to CMDs (Supplementary Note 2.18).

No statistical method was used to predetermine the sample size of the snm3C-seq cohort; however, our sample sizes and number of cells profiled are similar to those reported in previous snm3C-seq publications12. No samples were excluded from the Tilkka cohort. In the UKB and METSIM cohorts, related individuals were excluded. As this is an observational study, no randomization was performed. Data collection and analysis were performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. Results obtained from SAT snm3C-seq and snRNA-seq were not replicated owing to the unique nature of these datasets. Results reported from the UKB GWAS analyses were not replicated because of the unprecedentedly large sample size of the cohort. Correlations observed with the METSIM bulk RNA-seq data were not replicated because of the unique refined phenotype profiles of the METSIM cohort. Statistical significance was assessed using empirical permutation or non-parametric tests when possible. Assumed data distributions for other analyses (binomial, hypergeometric, multivariate normal) were not formally tested. Owing to the large sample size (for example, genomic bins, ChIP-seq peaks), individual data points were not visualized.

a, Dimension reduction of cells (n = 29,423) profiled by snRNA-seq and visualized with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). b, The total number of cells profiled by snm3C-seq and snRNA-seq stratified by the SAT cell-types. c, Co-embedding of snm3C-seq gene body mCG and snRNA-seq gene expression, visualized with UMAP, highlighting the transition cell-type in red and other SAT cell-types in grey. d, Confusion matrix comparing the concordance between the de novo snm3C-seq annotations (row) and the snRNA-seq-derived annotations (column). The confusion fraction is calculated as the multi-class confusion matrix normalized by the cell counts per row. ASPC, adipose stem and progenitor cell.

a-f, Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) visualization of the gene body mCG ratio, normalized per cell (left) and log-transformed counts per million normalized gene expression (right) for perivascular marker gene NOTCH3 (a), ASPC marker gene COL5A1 (b), endothelial cell marker gene EGFL7 (c), lymphoid cell marker gene CD2 (d), mast cell marker gene SLC18A2 (e), and myeloid cell marker gene CSF1R (f). The dashed line highlights the group of cells annotated as the corresponding cell-type. g, Gene body hypo-methylation of adipocyte marker genes (left 10 columns) and perivascular cell marker genes (right 10 columns) across adipocytes, perivascular cells, and the transition cell-type. Dot colors represent the average gene body mCG ratio normalized per cell. h, Dimension reduction of cells profiled by snm3C-seq and restricted to adipocytes, perivascular cells, and the transition cell-type, using exclusively the 5-kb bin mCG profiles and visualized with UMAP. ASPC, adipose stem and progenitor cell.

a, Venn diagrams showing the number of shared and modality-specific unique SAT cell-type marker genes between the gene body mCG and gene expression modalities. b-c, Dot plots showing significantly enriched biological processes (b) and KEGG functional pathways (c) using unique adipocyte marker genes in gene body mCG and gene expression modalities, evaluated using WebGestalt (see Methods). P values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Statistical significance was determined as FDR < 0.05. The size of the dot represents the enrichment ratio for biological processes (b) and KEGG functional pathways (c), while the color of the dot indicates FDR. d, Dot plots of fat cell differentiation biological process genes that are shared adipocyte marker genes between the mCG and gene expression modalities, showing their average gene body mCG (left) and average gene expression profiles (right) across the SAT cell-types. Dot size (right) represents the percentage of cells where the gene is expressed. e-f, Dot plots of (e) adipocyte marker genes encoding both known and less known TFs that are shared between the gene body mCG and gene expression modalities and (f) adipocyte marker genes encoding both known and less known SAT TFs that are unique to gene body mCG, showing their gene body mCG (left) and gene expression profiles (right). The color of the dot represents the mean percentage of mCG (red is high) and the average expression of a gene. ASPC, adipose stem and progenitor cell; and FDR, false discovery rate.

We show the top five cell-type level TF binding motifs (sorted by P) that are enriched among the hypo-methylated regions of the SAT cell-types. Statistical significance was determined using HOMER (binomial test) on each cell-type separately (see Methods).

Reproductive timing matters when it comes to aging and age-related disease. In a study now online at eLife¸ Buck researchers determine that girls who go through puberty (the onset of menstruation) before the age of 11 or women who give birth before the age of 21 have double the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart failure and obesity and quadruple the risk of developing severe metabolic disorders. The study also reveals that later puberty and childbirth are genetically associated with longer lifespan, lower frailty, slower epigenetic aging and reduced risk of age-related diseases, including type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's.

Buck professor Pankaj Kapahi, PhD, senior author of the study says the public health implications of the research are significant. "Even though women are routinely asked about their menstrual and childbirth history when they receive medical care, this information has rarely factored into the care they receive outside of OB/GYN," he says. "These risk factors, whether positive or negative, clearly have significant influence on a variety of age-related diseases and should be considered in the larger context of overall health."

The research was based on one of the most comprehensive analyses to date, using regression analysis on nearly 200,000 women in the UK Biobank to confirm genetic associations. "We identified 126 genetic markers that mediate the effects of early puberty and childbirth on aging," said postdoctoral fellow Yifan Xiang, MD, who led the research. "Many of these markers are involved in well-known longevity pathways, such as IGF-1, growth hormone, AMPK and mTOR signaling, key regulators of metabolism and aging."

Genetic associations for antagonistic pleiotropy in humans

Evolution is based on natural selection acting on traits early in life to encourage reproduction and survival of the species. The antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging suggests that traits beneficial in the young can have negative effects later in life. "Our study provides some of the strongest human evidence for this theory," Kapahi says. "We show that genetic factors favoring early reproduction come with the significant cost later in life including accelerated aging and disease. It makes sense that the very factors that help enhance survival of the offspring may lead to detrimental consequences for the mother."

The role of BMI in aging and disease risk

Kapahi says the study highlights the role of Body Mass Index (BMI) as a critical mediator of this process, finding that early reproductive events contribute to a higher BMI, which in turn increases the risk of metabolic disease. "One can envisage that enhancing the ability to absorb nutrients would benefit the offspring but if nutrients are plentiful then it can enhance the risk of obesity and diabetes."

Implications for public health and basic science

Kapahi says understanding the long-term impact of reproductive timing allows for the development of personalized healthcare strategies that could help mitigate the risks associated with early puberty and early childbirth, adding that lifestyle modifications, metabolic screenings and tailored dietary recommendations could improve long-term health in women. He says taking reproductive timing into account is currently relevant based on research that shows the age at which girls in the US begin menstruating has dropped by about three months per decade since the 1970s. No specific causes for the phenomena have been identified, but research suggests obesity may play a role.

While updated research guidelines call for the use of both sexes in preclinical research in mice, Kapahi says this current study still challenges traditional experimental design, noting that most disease models use virgin female mice, which may not accurately represent real-world aging patterns.

"If evolution has shaped us to prioritize early reproduction at the cost of aging, how can we leverage this knowledge to extend healthspan in modern society? Kapahi asks. "While we cannot change our genetic inheritance, understanding these genetic tradeoffs empowers us to make informed choices about health, lifestyle and medical care." The study also identifies several genetic pathways that can be manipulated to optimize health for mothers as well as her offspring Kapahi says.

Other Buck researchers involved in the study include: Vineeta Tanwar, Parminder Singh, and Lizellen La Follette.

A new study delving into the genetic drivers of a rare and aggressive childhood cancer called Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (MPNST) has revealed metabolic frailties in the cancer cells that might be exploited to improved treatments for patients.

MPNST is a rare and deadly childhood cancer, which mainly affects teenagers and young adults. These tumors grow quickly, spread easily, and don't respond well to current treatments. Metastasis is the leading cause of death in MPNST and there currently are no targeted treatments for metastatic disease.

The study, led by University of Iowa researchers Eric Taylor, PhD, professor of molecular physiology and biophysics, and Rebecca Dodd, PhD, associate professor of internal medicine, identifies a specific metabolic pathway that is critical for MPNST cells' survival and growth, which could potentially be targeted with future therapies.

Targeting cancer metabolism to slow tumor progression 

To better understand these tumors, the UI researchers used gene editing to create new research models that closely match the cancer-driving mutations found in patients. Using these models, they then applied state-of-the-art genomic and metabolomic tools to map the metabolic pathways that fuel tumor growth in MPNST.

The study, published in Science Advances, found that these cancers rely on a key metabolic pathway to help them survive oxidative stress and drive tumor growth. This pathway, known as the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP), metabolizes sugar to produce a critical antioxidant molecule that the cancer cells require to combat oxidative stress. When the researchers blocked the PPP, the tumors grew more slowly and were more vulnerable to chemotherapy.

"This is the first time this specific metabolic pathway has been linked to MPNST tumor growth, making it a completely new target for therapy in this cancer type," Dodd says. "It opens the door to treatment strategies that haven't been explored before and could lead to more effective treatments and better outcomes for patients who urgently need new options."

The highly collaborative study combined Dodd's expertise in cancer biology with Taylor's expertise in metabolism. The lead author was UI graduate student Gavin McGivney, PhD, from Bayard in Guthrie County, Iowa, who was co-mentored by Dodd and Taylor. McGivney graduated from the UI Cancer Biology graduate program in 2024, and is now a postdoctoral scholar at University of Chicago. Dodd and Taylor are both members of UI Health Care Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Taylor is a member of the UI Fraternal Order of Eagles Diabetes Research Center.

In addition to Dodd, Taylor, and McGivney, the research team also included UI researchers in the Departments of Internal Medicine, Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, and Radiation Oncology at the UI Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine. Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and the University of Toronto, were also part of the team.

The research was funded in part by grants from the Children's Tumor Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the American Heart Association, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the American Cancer Society through Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center.

A look into the throat of an active galaxy reveals a ring-shaped magnetic field that may explain extreme gamma radiation and neutrinos.

Key Points

Located billions of light-years away, the blazar PKS 1424+240 had long baffled astronomers. It stood out as the brightest known neutrino-emitting blazar in the sky -- as identified by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory -- and was also glowing in very high-energy gamma rays ob-served by ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. Yet, oddly, its radio jet appeared to move sluggishly, contradicting expectations that only the fastest jets can power such intense high-energy emissions.

Now, thanks to 15 years of ultra-precise radio observations from the Very Long Baseline Ar-ray (VLBA), researchers have stitched together a deep image of this jet at unparalleled resolution.

"When we reconstructed the image, it looked absolutely stunning," says Yuri Kovalev, lead author of the study and Principal Investigator of the ERC-funded MuSES project at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR). "We have never seen anything quite like it -- a near-perfect toroidal magnetic field with a jet, pointing straight at us."

Because the jet is aligned almost exactly in the direction of Earth, its high-energy emission is dramatically amplified by the effects of special relativity. "This alignment causes a boost in brightness by a factor of 30 or more," explains Jack Livingston, a co-author at MPIfR. "At the same time, the jet appears to move slowly due to projection effects -- a classic optical illusion."

This head-on geometry allowed scientists to peer directly into the heart of the blazar's jet -- an extremely rare opportunity. Polarized radio signals helped the team map out the structure of the jet's magnetic field, revealing its likely helical or toroidal shape. This structure plays a key role in launching and collimating the plasma flow, and may be essential for accelerating particles to extreme energies.

"Solving this puzzle confirms that active galactic nuclei with supermassive black holes are not only powerful accelerators of electrons, but also of protons -- the origin of the observed high-energy neutrinos," concludes Kovalev.

The discovery is a triumph for the MOJAVE program, a decades-long effort to monitor relativistic jets in active galaxies using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Scientists employ the technique of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), which connects radio telescopes across the globe to form a virtual telescope the size of the Earth. This provides the highest resolution available in astronomy, allowing them to study the fine details of distant cosmic jets.

"When we started MOJAVE, the idea of one day directly connecting distant black hole jets to cosmic neutrinos felt like science fiction. Today, our observations are making it real," says Anton Zensus, Director at MPIfR and co-founder of the program.

This result strengthens the link between relativistic jets, high-energy neutrinos, and the role of magnetic fields in shaping cosmic accelerators -- marking a milestone in multimessenger astronomy.

Background Information

A blazar is a type of active galactic nucleus powered by a supermassive black hole that launches a jet of plasma moving at nearly the speed of light. What makes a blazar special is its orientation: one of its jets is pointed within about 10 degrees of Earth. This alignment makes blazars appear bright across the electromagnetic spectrum and allows scientists to study extreme physical processes -- including the acceleration of particles to energies far beyond those achieved in human-made accelerators.

The VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array) is an array of ten antennas, at locations across the continental United States and in Hawaii and St Croix, which operates in the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) mode. Spacings between the antennas vary up to approximately ten thousand kilometers, providing angular resolution on the sky as fine as 50 micro-arcseconds.

MOJAVE (Monitoring Of Jets in Active galactic nuclei with VLBA Experiments) is a long-term program to monitor radio brightness and polarization variations in jets associated with active galaxies visible in the northern sky. The observations are made with the Very Long Baseline Array, which enables us to make full polarization images with an angular resolution better than 1 milliarcsecond (the apparent separation of your car's headlights, as seen by an astronaut on the Moon). We are using these data to better understand the complex evolution and magnetic field structures of jets on light-year scales, close to where they originate in the active nucleus, and how this activity is correlated with a high energy electromagnetic and neutrino emission.

MuSES, which stands for Multi-messenger Studies of Energetic Sources, is a pioneering initiative in astrophysics. It is dedicated to the study of Active Galactic Nuclei, which are among the most powerful particle accelerators known in the cosmos. These celestial bodies harness the gravitational energy of matter accreted by supermassive black holes and convert it into electromagnetic and kinetic energy, resulting in the production of highly relativistic electrons and protons. The acceleration of protons and its relation to neutrino production is not well understood, posing a formidable challenge to researchers. MuSES aims to address these fundamental questions by exploiting recent advances in multi-messenger astronomy.

The Made by Google 2025 event is finally happening, notably before Apple's hardware event is expected to take place in September. 

On Wednesday, the tech giant debuted its Pixel 10 series, a new foldable, the Pixel Watch 4, the second generation of the cost-friendly A-Series earbuds, generative AI capabilities with Gemini, and more. 

Google already dropped several AI-related updates at its developer conference in May, but the company demonstrated more Gemini features during the Pixel 10 event. In a recent YouTube video promoting the new devices, Google even seemed to poke fun at Apple's failed promises with Apple Intelligence advancements on the iPhone. 

Gemini Live received an upgrade this year, so now when you ask questions, you can share your camera, and the assistant can follow along and guide you. For instance, sharing an image of your room with the AI and getting interior design ideas. 

Taking photos on the Pixel 10 also got a boost. A new feature called “Camera Coach,” for example, lets Gemini give you real-time tips for taking better photos. The AI is able to see what's going on and suggest the best angles and lighting for your shot. 

In addition, there's a new conversational photo editing tool, where you tell Gemini what you want to tweak in a photo, such as increasing the brightness, removing objects, or changing the background.

The standard Pixel 10 phone underwent significant changes, particularly with the addition of a dedicated telephoto lens, a feature that was previously exclusive to the Pro models. Google released a teaser for the Pixel 10 prior to Wednesday's event. 

The company says the new 5x telephoto lens is its best zoom quality, and the 100x Pro Res Zoom allows for high-quality closeups. 

Additionally, all phones in the lineup are powered by a new Tensor G5 processor, ushering in the Gemini era and enhancing performance and power efficiency compared to the Tensor G4 chip.

Aside from these updates, there weren't many obvious changes. The basic design of the phones remains similar to that of the Pixel 9 series. The displays are also staying the same, with the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro featuring a 6.3-inch display, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL with a larger 6.8-inch display.

The Pro models also get improved camera and video quality, along with battery size, which allows for faster charging and finally addresses the longevity gap between Pixel and flagship phones from Apple and Samsung.

Notably, the Pixel 10 devices have magnetic technology built into them thanks to “PixelSnap,” the company's version of “MagSafe.” Google released a line of magnetic accessories to pair with the lineup, including a new $40 Pixelsnap charger that supports Qi2 wireless charging. The company also launched a $50 phone case with a magnetic ring in the center and a $30 ring stand for hands-free use.

As for Google's latest foldable, it has a larger cover display, measuring at around 6.4 inches, alongside an 8-inch main screen. Google also enhanced the strength of the hinge, and the bezels are thinner for a sleek appearance.

Another exciting addition is an IP68 rating, a first for the device. This means it can stand up to both dust and water, whereas the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has zero dust protection.

Like the other Pixel 10 phones, the Pro Fold is powered by the new G5 chip and includes the latest Gemini AI features. The camera system also received improvements, potentially featuring a 48-megapixel ultra-wide lens and a telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. The phone also saw an improvement in battery life.

The Pixel 10 Pro Fold costs $1,799 and is available in Moonstone and Jade colors.

The tech giant is coming for Apple's Journal app with Pixel Journal, a new journaling app for Pixel 10 devices. With the app, you can write entries, add photos, locations, and activities, as well as lock entries for privacy. The app also includes AI features, such as prompt suggestions to spark inspiration.

Wearables will also get their time to shine at Google's event, with the Pixel Watch 4 getting a thicker design, a longer battery life, and smaller bezels. The smartwatch also introduced its own AI capabilities, such as the ability to access Gemini by lifting your wrist. 

The Pixel Buds 2a offer a much-needed upgrade from the first generation of the A-Series earbuds, coming with active noise cancellation and fun new colors: Hazel and Iris. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 introduced a new Gemini feature for answering calls with gestures and comes in a new Moonstone color.

Google announced a new AI personal health coach for the Fitbit fitness tracking app. 

This feature allows users to create customized workout routines by discussing their goals, preferences, and available equipment. The AI coach generates a personalized fitness plan with workout suggestions and adjusts plans in real-time based on user data to help achieve fitness goals. 

The AI trainer also acts as a sleep coach, providing insights into how to improve your sleep quality. 

A preview of the AI coach will be available in October. It will be integrated into the redesigned Fitbit app and will work with the latest Fitbit trackers, smartwatches, and Pixel Watches.

FieldAI, a robotics startup backed by Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and others, raised $405 million in recent funding rounds as the California-based company aims to deploy its “software brain” in a variety of robots across diverse environments.

The investment, which came in consecutive Series A and A1 rounds, values the 2-year-old startup at $2 billion according to reports by Axios and CNBC on Wednesday.

Gates Frontier, an investment arm of the Microsoft co-founder, previously backed FieldAI. Bezos Expeditions, the investment office for the Amazon founder, joined the latest oversubscribed round along with NVentures (NVIDIA's venture capital arm), BHP Ventures, Canaan Partners, Emerson Collective, Intel Capital, Khosla Ventures, Prysm, Temasek, and others.

FieldAI builds the intelligence that powers humanoid robots and other embodiments, including quadrupeds, wheeled robots and passenger-scale vehicles. The company says its platform — called Field Foundation Models — differs from conventional vision or language models retrofitted for robotics. FFMs are designed to grapple with uncertainty, risk, and the physical constraints of the real world and safely navigate and work in dynamic, unstructured environments without prior maps, GPS, or predefined paths.

FieldAI attaches its system to third-party robot hardware, and they can work autonomously across industries including construction, energy, manufacturing, urban delivery and inspection.

The acceleration of robotics is evident at companies like Amazon, where the tech giant has deployed more than 1 million robots across its fulfillment network, with the goal of making warehouse work safer and more efficient. 

Amazon has invested in Salem, Ore.-based Agility Robotics through its Industrial Innovation Fund, a billion-dollar venture capital fund that backs different forms of supply chain technology. Agility — known for its Digit bipedal humanoid warehouse robot, was raising $400 million in new funding earlier this year, according to reports.

Last year, Amazon hired three of the founders from Covariant, a Bay Area startup that develops AI for advanced warehouse robotics systems.

Bezos Expeditions previously joined a $400 million funding round for Physical Intelligence, a robot startup in San Francisco that is also backed by OpenAI.

FieldAI is led by veterans in robotic AI from DeepMind, Google Brain, Tesla Autopilot, NASA JPL, SpaceX, Zoox, Cruise, Amazon, DARPA, TRI, and others.

“With a deep understanding of the resilience and robustness required to deploy robotic AI in complex real-world conditions, we have taken a fundamentally different approach,” founder and CEO Ali Agha said in a statement. “Rather than attempting to shoehorn large language and vision models into robotics — only to address their hallucinations and limitations as an afterthought — we have designed intrinsically risk-aware architectures from the ground up.”

Fitbit's smartphone app has undergone several redesigns over the past two years, and now there's another big one coming in October, timed to the launch of the newly announced Pixel Watch 4. Launching as an opt-in review (an open beta), the design centers on Google's AI-powered Personal Health Coach, built with Gemini.

The entire app has been rebuilt from the ground up with the new AI coaching feature. Andy Abramson, director of product management at Google, says the redesign also offers easier app navigation, better data visualization, improved syncing between wearable devices, and (finally) a dark mode. Those are all purportedly common user suggestions from existing Fitbit customers.

This Personal Health Coach feature is available only to Fitbit Premium subscribers. The idea behind the assistant—which doesn't quite have a personality or even a name—is to let users ask anything and everything about health and fitness and receive personalized guidance thanks to the 24/7 health data collected by your Fitbit wearable or Pixel Watch. During the onboarding, the coach will ask you questions so it can better understand your preferences and equipment, but this is a conversation that will continually evolve.

When the coach presents your data with insights, like your sleep score from the night before or the data from your most recent workout, you can start a conversation, and that data will be incorporated into the coach's responses. That conversation could then include tailoring the workouts for the week if your sleep score wasn't great. If you're just not feeling up to it or are under the weather, just tell the coach, and it'll make tweaks to the workout plan and even follow up about how you're feeling after some time.

These conversations resemble the chat window for when you talk to Gemini, and the responses can be verbose. Rishi Chandra, vice president for Health at Google, says the company had to balance a fine line between responses that were too short and weren't insightful, and extremely lengthy responses. Right now, you can only type to the Coach, but the experience is still in a preview state. Chandra says the company is exploring multimodal interactions—think sending a video of your hotel gym equipment and asking for workout recommendations—and potentially incorporating Gemini Live for a more real-time conversation experience.

Much of the new Fitbit app experience also centers around customization. The Focus Metric at the top of the home page, which shows you your performance for the day, can be customized to show whatever data you prefer. Likewise, if the Coach serves you a workout plan for the week, just start a conversation to make any adjustments. The Coach also looks at your performance on a weekly basis rather than a single day, giving users more flexibility in hitting their goals. (That includes last year's Cardio Load feature on the Pixel Watch.)

The Coach will be able to tap into your historical Fitbit data, however long it dates back. There's a Coaches Notes section that allows you to see everything you've ever told the Coach, and you can delete these at any time. Google still has to follow the data separation commitments established when it acquired Fitbit, meaning your health data cannot be used for Google Ads and is stored separately from other Google data.

Abramson says the Coach also will sometimes suggest lifestyle activities rather than specific workouts, like if you've indicated that you like to kayak, and that Fitbit is working to pull more data from other third-party apps via the Health Connect platform. That way, you'll ideally be able to incorporate your Strava data, for example, and still have it count in your Fitbit app. (The new Fitbit app will finally add support for Apple's HealthKit platform as well.)

The app also features new sleep algorithms, with more details around your sleep duration and sleep stages. The coach will spot patterns over a week and will offer up insights on improving your sleep quality. It'll even tack on an extra half hour to your sleep schedule based on your workout performance if it thinks you need the extra recovery time.

Trust will play a big role in the new AI-powered experience. Google's own AI Overviews on Search can hallucinate and deliver flat-out wrong answers. How can you trust the same platform to answer health and wellness questions? Google says the Coach is being developed with “leading industry experts” and through scientific research—the company published a paper in Nature last week about a personal health large language model for sleep and fitness coaching. There's also a partnership with NBA star Stephen Curry and his performance team for more grounded results, and Google says it's working closely with its Consumer Health Advisory Panel.

We'll have to wait and see just how well the spruced-up AI-fication of your health will turn out to be. We've tried several versions of AI-powered health coaches with other fitness trackers with mixed results (Garmin, Whoop, and Oura all have them, for example), but Fitbit's partnerships and peer-reviewed research make this an attractive proposition. Fitbit Premium users can sign up now to be notified when the preview is available.

T-Mobile subscribers who buy one of the phones in Google's newly announced Pixel 10 lineup will be able to explore a new frontier in mass-market mobile connectivity: satellite access to data-dependent apps, including Google Maps.

Google worked with Bellevue, Wash.-based T-Mobile to equip Pixel 10 devices with the software upgrades required to transmit application data directly through SpaceX's Starlink satellite network in low Earth orbit. Pixel 10 users will be able to use Google Maps, Messages and Find Hubs in areas where traditional mobile coverage isn't available, thanks to T-Mobile's T-Satellite service.

T-Satellite went into operation last month for text messaging, location sharing and emergency alerts, and the service is being extended to UScellular customers in the wake of T-Mobile's acquisition of UScellular. The official launch for T-Satellite data service is scheduled.for Oct. 1. But Omar Tazi, T-Mobile's executive vice president and chief product and digital officer, said in a blog posting that “this capability is far too important to hold back.”

“If your phone supports T-Satellite data, you can use it even prior to the official data launch this fall,” Tazi said. The Pixel 10, which is due to be available Aug. 28, is the first such device to make it onto the list.

Tazi hinted that further announcements may be in the offing. “If you don't have a Pixel 10, your time is coming soon,” he said. For what it's worth, Apple is expected to hold its launch event for iPhone 17 next month.

Google launched its Pixel 10 family of phones — Pixel 10, the Pixel 10 Pro, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL — on Wednesday at the company's Made by Google event. All of the phones are powered by the company's new Tensor G5 processor. The most noticeable change in hardware with this iteration is that Google has opted for a triple camera setup for the first time for the base Pixel 10 model. On the other hand, the Pro models mostly got iterative updates in terms of processor and camera sensors.

The Pixel 9 had a pair of wide and ultra-wide sensors. The Pixel 10 gets a new telephoto lens, which enables 5x optical zoom and 20x digital zoom through Super Res Zoom. The base model has a 48-megapixel wide sensor, Quad phase detection per pixel — with faster and better focus in low light — and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide sensor.

The Pro phones have a new 50-megapixel wide sensor with optical stabilization and Super Res Zoom (up to 20x) for video. The pair also has a 50-megapixel telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom and increased 100x Super Res digital zoom.

Screen sizes for all phones remain the same. Both the Pixel 10 and the Pixel 10 Pro have a 6.3-inch display, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL has a 6.8-inch display. Google said all devices have a new “actua” display, which allows them to go up to 3,300 nits of brightness on the Pros and 3,000 nits on the Pixel 10. 

All Pixels are powered by Google's new Tensor G5 chip, coupled with the Titan M2 security chip and a new image processing unit. Google said that the new chip bumps up CPU performance by 34% and TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) by 60% over the previous gen chip, allowing for faster and new kinds of AI features.

Google introduced Gemini as a default assistant last year with the Pixel 9, along with features like Pixel Studio for AI-powered image generation and a new screenshot app.

This year, the company has upgraded Gemini Live to allow for visual overlays while using video to ask questions. This means the assistant can guide you with direction and signs by highlighting certain parts of a screen.

Google is also debuting a new feature called Magic Cue, which can surface contextual information from across the app. For instance, if you are on a call with an airline, it can surface your flight details from email or get your restaurant reservation details while chatting to a friend.

The company is also adding a Gemini-powered camera coach that would guide you to take better photos from the camera interface by making suggestions about framing and composition. Additionally, Google is adding features like real-time translation for calls, transcripts for missed or declined calls through call screening, Notebook LM integration with the screenshot app, and recorder.

The Pixel 10 and the Pixel 10 Pro have similar prices of $799 and $999, respectively, to the previous generation of devices. However, the Pixel 10 Pro XL now starts at $1,199 instead of $1,099, with base storage bumped up to 256GB.

Google's annual ‘Made by Google' Pixel hardware drop is here, and it's not all about new phones. This year Google's Pixel Buds A-series (the cheaper line of Pixel wireless earbuds) is getting an update with some features that should make them a lot more appealing to anyone looking to save a little bit of money on non-pro earbuds.

The biggest addition in the Pixel Buds 2a is active noise cancellation (ANC), which is very much not a cutting-edge feature at this point, but maybe one of the most critical capabilities of any pair of wireless earbuds in the year of our lord 2025. It's hard to believe that any pair of wireless earbuds would dare exist without the option to listen with ANC at this point, but it's still a notable improvement over the last generation, which came out all the way back in 2021.

Google says there should also be some sound quality improvements to the Buds 2a thanks to the addition of a new Tensor A1 chip, including more bass, but it's hard to say how drastic the improvement is until we hear for ourselves. Notably, Google also says the Tensor A1 will lead to significant battery life gains gen-over-gen. Specifically, Google says you can now get 7 hours of playback with ANC activated, which is a solid amount of time—most wireless earbuds in this price range get between 6 and 6.5 hours typically.

One thing I love to see here is that Google made the battery replaceable on its case, which is surprisingly a rare thing in the world of wireless audio. Batteries are often the first thing to bite the dust on any gadget, so being able to replace the battery when it inevitably goes kaput is a big win for longevity—especially if you're not in the market for a new pair of wireless earbuds in the first place.

Naturally, given Google's emphasis on AI, there are some Gemini tie-ins here. With the Pixel Buds 2a, you'll be able to summon Gemini as a voice assistant on your Pixel phone to do stuff like summarize your messages. Again, not a novel feature by any means. but nice to have. Speaking of nice to have, the Pixel Buds 2a will also be the smallest and lightest A-series buds yet thanks to a notable redesign. Oh, and these wireless earbuds will come in two new colors: Iris and Hazel.

It's not all about the Buds 2a; the Pixel Buds 2 Pro will get a minor update with a new color, Moonstone, and Google says a software update dropping next month will bring improvements to various features on the buds. The Moonstone version of the Pixel Buds 2 Pro can be preordered today for $229 and will be in stores starting August 28.

As for the Pixel Buds 2a, there's nothing groundbreaking on paper, but they seem fairly solid based on what we know. The biggest question will be how the new Tensor A1 chip affects sound. There are a lot of wireless earbuds in the $130-150 range, so Google has a lot of competition to that end. If you're dying to hear the improvement for yourself, you can preorder the Pixel Buds 2a right now or wait until October 9, when they hit shelves officially.

Google's messaging with its Pixel 10 family—the Pixel 10, 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold—is simple: the physical designs of the phones are taking a backseat this year, and Gemini and AI are doing the driving and navigating. That's why, other than some new colors, the whole Pixel 10 lineup looks so similar compared to the Pixel 9 series.

To be fair, there are hardware upgrades to the Pixel 10, but most of them are under-the-hood improvements for stuff like performance and battery life—it's a spec bump year for Google. So let's start there.

See Pixel 10 Pro at Amazon

See Pixel 10 Pro Fold at Amazon

The first thing that caught my eye about the Pixel 10 was the “Indigo” blue color, and that was intentional by Google, I'm told. Since these are the 10th-generation Pixels, Google said it wanted to give a nod to the original “Really Blue” Pixel. I like the color a lot, though I didn't have the new “Blue Shadow” Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 on hand to compare the shade of blue. Either way, blue is definitely in this year—unless you're Apple, orange will apparently be the iPhone 17 Pro's new special color. The Pixel 10 also comes in “Frost” (pastel purple), “Lemongrass” (yellow), and “Obsidian” (black).

In my hand, the Pixel 10 feels almost identical to the Pixel 9. It's still a matte aluminum frame with a glass screen and glossy glass back. But, wait, what's that inside the pill-shaped camera bar? Yes, that's a third camera lens—a 10.8-megapixel telephoto with 5x optical zoom. It's the first time that a regular Pixel has three cameras. But there's a small catch—the main and ultrawide cameras are getting small downgrades. The main camera has 48 megapixels (down from 50 megapixels on the Pixel 9), and the ultrawide is only 13 megapixels (down from 48 megapixels). The image sensors are also smaller, which may mean worse low-light performance. However, it's possible that improved software and AI processing can make up for the hardware downgrades.

The 6.3-inch LTPO OLED display is the same size as before, but it is brighter (up to 2,000 nits for HDR and up to 3,000 nits for peak brightness), so visibility outdoors should be better. Additionally, Google increased the battery life to “up to 30+ hours” and “up to 100-hour battery life” when the “Extreme Battery Saver” mode is turned on. On the topic of the battery, the Pixel 10 supports Qi2 wireless charging. Google is also introducing a new MagSafe-like magnetic charging puck called Pixelsnap. This works exactly like MagSafe charging pucks for iPhone, with the magnets attaching to the Pixel 10 securely. There will be a few Pixelsnap accessories, including a stand and cases.

To nobody's surprise, there's a new Tensor G5 chip, with a 35% faster CPU, powering everything. The Pixel 10 comes with 12GB of RAM standard and two storage options (128GB and 256GB). And for the first time on any Pixel phone, there's built-in Satellite SOS, which works more or less the same as it does on newer iPhones.

See Pixel 10 at Amazon

The Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL are similarly internal hardware upgrades compared to the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL. You can spot the difference between the Pixel 10 Pro/10 Pro XL and the regular Pixel 10 by their polished aluminum frames (read: fingerprint magnets) and matte glass back. The Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL also have their own special colors. There's a gray “Moonstone” color that has shades of purple under specific lighting, and the “Jade” is a lime-ish colored green-yellow. Of course, if you're boring, you can always get “Porcelain” (white) and “Obsidian” (black). It's a bummer there's no “Indigo” blue for the Pixel 10 Pros.

Both phones have the same 6.3-inch and 6.8-inch LTPO OLED screens, but they're even brighter than the Pixel 10 (up to 2,200 nits for HDR and up to 3,300 nits for peak brightness). Aside from that, the Pixel 10 Pros have pretty much the same upgrades as the Pixel 10, including longer battery life with Pixelsnap support, the Tensor G5 chip,  and Satellite SOS. These are “Pro” phones, so you do get more RAM (16GB) and additional storage capacities to choose from (128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB). The potential game-changers are in the AI and Gemini features, which I'll get to in a minute.

Last in the Pixel 10 family is the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Google's third-gen book-style foldable. There's not much to say about the foldable except that it isn't a threat to the thinner and lighter Galaxy Z Fold 7. Google has polished up the rough edges (i.e., there's a new gearless hinge that Google says is twice as durable as the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold), and the cover screen is a teensy bit larger at 6.4 inches, which also means the 8-inch foldable screen is also a smidge larger. Just like the screens on the other Pixel 10 phones, both the cover and folding displays on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold are brighter. The cover screen can reach up to 2,000 nits for HDR and up to 3,000 nits for peak brightness, and the folding display maxes out at 1,800 nits for HDR content and 3,000 nits for peak brightness.

Google also says the folding screen is more durable. How durable? Well, first, it's finally IP68 rated for dust and water resistance, which makes it as durable as non-folding flagship phones. And apparently, it can handle 10 years of folding with the new gearless hinge. Also, with two layers of “anti-impact film,” the Pixel 10 Pro Fold should be more protected if dropped. Of course, I wasn't able to test out this improved durability, but I appreciate that Google has bolstered the design cause foldables are fragile as hell.

Again, the upgrades to the Pixel 10 and 10 Pro/10 Pro XL were also applied to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. There's a larger 5,015mAh battery (up from 4,650mAh) with Qi2 wireless charging and Pixelsnap compatibility, a faster Tensor G5 chip, and Satellite SOS. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes with 16GB of RAM and 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage, and you can get it in two colors (Moonstone or Jade).

If you've been paying attention to the world of consumer tech, you'll already know that phone hardware has matured to the point where it's now all about what kind of AI features tech companies can shove in there to make new phones worth buying. Everybody's trying to figure this out, not just Google.

On the Pixel 10 family of phones, Google is going all-in on AI and Gemini. All Pixel 10 Pro phones (10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold) come with a free year of Google AI Pro—a $250/month subscription that gets you the best of what Google's AI has to offer, including access to Veo 3, the video generator that's taken the world by storm since its debut at I/O.

As you can tell from the mild hardware refresh, the Pixel 10 phones are just vehicles for Gemini, and some of the new AI features that Google has come up with seem genuinely useful. “Magic Cue” is on-device “personalized intelligence” that helps you surface relevant information within apps and then suggests quick actions to take. For example, say you're calling up a restaurant to make a reservation; Magic Cue could show relevant info like directions to the place or opening and closing hours. The idea is to use AI to anticipate what you may want to do or know. Magic Cue feels like the start of agentic and ambient computing, where we spend less time interacting nonstop inside of apps, and AI gives us a helping hand.

I also demoed a new Gemini-powered version for Google Translate, which uses on-device language processing to essentially deepfake your voice into another language. It worked fast, and hearing myself speaking in German with what sounded like my intonations was both impressive and eerie. This felt like the breakthrough that Google Translate has been working toward to make real-time translation even more frictionless with a phone between two people.

Other AI and Gemini features that I saw were located within the Pixel 10's camera app. “Camera Coach” uses Gemini models to show a row of thumbnails with suggestions on how to improve a shot you've taken. It offers up basic suggestions like using the rule of thirds by reframing certain subjects to the left or right and foreground or background, telling you to switch cameras or modes—basically, it's photography for dummies. I won't get much out of it, but I could see it being helpful to regular people who want to take more interesting photos. There's also a new “Auto Best Take” that automatically merges similar photos into one “best” photo and an enhanced “Add Me” feature that ‘photoshops' the photographer into a group shot using pseudo augmented reality.

The one Gemini-powered camera feature that I'm most interested in trying in depth is “Pro Res Zoom” for the Pixel 10 Pros. The Pixel 10 (and older Pixel phones) has regular Super Res Zoom, which uses machine learning to sharpen and enhance detail for zoomed-in photos. Pro Res Zoom uses AI and Gemini models to basically generate new detail. In one demo, the difference in detail between Pro Res Zoom on a Pixel 10 Pro and Super Res Zoom on a Pixel 10 was night and day, especially at even higher magnifications like 100x zoom for the Pixel 10 Pros. But how much detail is real and how much is fake during generation? In my limited demo, we zoomed in on a water tower, and Pro Res Zoom generated wood textures for its exterior. But on text, like signs, it's clear AI still has a way to go. Text did look clearer and more legible, but still a little garbled, like an alien language at times. That being said, Pro Res Zoom does create sharper photos compared to Super Res Zoom. The question of what a photo really is anymore is only going to get muddier.

I'm a realist, and as much as I want foldable phones to be cheaper, I know it'll be a long road to that day, or it may never even come. I also know that regular bar-style smartphones only have so much room for improvement, and so transplanting AI into them and eking out small improvements to the displays, battery life, and the cameras is just how things are gonna be for the foreseeable future. I'll need to spend real time with the Pixel 10 phones once I get review units to try, but for now, the hardware is fine. The real test will be how useful the AI and Gemini features are.

Preorders for the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL start today, Aug. 20, with devices available on Aug. 28. Preorders for the 10 Pro Fold start Aug. 20, and availability on Oct. 9.

The Pixel 10 starts at $799 with 128GB of storage. The Pixel 10 Pro starts at $999 for 128GB of storage, and the Pixel 10 Pro starts at $1,199 with 256GB of storage (the new base instead of 128GB). The Pixel 10 Pro Fold starts at $1,799 for 256GB of storage.

Somehow it's been 40 years since Stuart Gordon‘s H.G. Lovecraft-inspired Re-Animator hit theaters, boasting an instant-classic performance by Jeffrey Combs as Dr. Herbert West, Miskatonic University's most unhinged medical student turned mad scientist. There's splatter, there's gore, there's body horror, and there's the most distressing severed head scene in the history of cinema. To mark the monumental anniversary of one of the most beloved cult classics ever, Re-Animator is returning to theaters, with a bonus.

Presented by the American Genre Film Archive and Mutant, these special screenings will showcase the Ignite Film and Eagle Rock Pictures' 4K restoration of Gordon's film, ensuring that every gross moment and Combs facial expression will look better than it ever has before. And even fans who are like, “I've seen it already 50 times” (you know who you are) will want to take note, because attending a screening will be the only way to get your mitts on Mutant's limited-edition screenprinted poster by Phantom City Creative—or Rucking Fotton's glow-in-the-dark commemorative t-shirt.

Here's a look at the goods. First, the 18 x 24 poster, which costs $45. If you love it and can't make it to a screening, Mutant will have a standard edition colorway online starting October 23. But if you want this exact slab of greeny goodness, you've gotta leave the house.

Ditto for this t-shirt, which is only available at screenings. It's $35 and made in collaboration with Rucking Fotten.

At its Made by Google event on Wednesday, Google unveiled its new Pixel Watch 4. The smartwatch features a domed display, support for standalone Satellite Communication, enhanced health and fitness tracking, and more.

The 41mm Pixel Watch 4 starts at $349 for Wi-Fi and $449 for LTE, while the 45mm version starts at $399 for Wi-Fi and $499 for LTE.

The watch features an Actua 360 display that's physically curved to deliver a 10% larger active area and an edgeless appearance with 16% smaller bezels. Plus, it has a 50% brighter 3,000 nit display.

The LTE versions of Pixel Watch 4 come with standalone emergency satellite communications that connect users to emergency services through a series of geo-stationary satellites to dispatch help to users, even when they're off the grid. The feature is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 Wearable Platform, Google notes.

In addition, users can now simply raise their wrist to access Gemini, getting rid of the need to press a button or say “Hey Google.” The tech giant says this will allow users to get help or answers when they're doing things like carrying groceries or walking their dog. The watch also comes with added on-device AI capabilities, such as Smart Replies, which offer AI-powered responses tailored to your conversation.

Google also announced that the watch has 25% longer battery life than its predecessor, with 30 hours on the 41mm and 40 hours on the 45mm. Google also noted that the Pixel Watch 4 comes with an all-new fast charging dock that they can rest their watch on.

Pixel Watch 4 is water-resistant up to 50 meters, and for the first time ever, it's serviceable with a replaceable battery and display. 

The tech giant says the watch is more powerful under the hood, as it features Google's next-gen ML-powered co-processor that's 25% faster at half the power.

As for the advanced health and fitness tracking, Google announced that the Pixel Watch 4 is 18% more accurate at classifying complete sleep cycles and can track time spent in each stage of sleep. Plus, with a new Skin Temperature sensor, the watch can help detect changes in your well-being.

Additionally, the Pixel Watch 4's new dual-frequency GPS allows for more accurate route tracking even in tough environments, like a downtown city run or a tree-dense hike. 

Google notes that in instances where you have forgotten to start a workout on your watch, it will use AI to automatically detect and classify your activity. Plus, Google has added new exercise options, including basketball and pickleball. 

Google also announced that it's introducing a personal AI health coach that gives users access to fitness and sleep coaching based on metrics from your Pixel Watch. The idea behind the feature is to give users a 24/7 AI-powered health coach on their wrist that offers them on-demand guidance tailored to their goals. Users will be able to ask questions like, “Is this cold plunge actually good for me?” or “What's the best way to fight jet lag?”

The tech giant is launching a preview of the health coach for users who use any Fitbit device or Pixel Watch in the U.S. this October.

Pixel Watch 4 is available for preorder today and on shelves starting October 9.

Google's first Pixel Watch was fashionably late to the wrist computing party, arriving in 2022 when the market was already quite mature. And while the smartwatch has since cemented its place among top-tier wearables, it has one red flag: It isn't repairable.

For the past three generations, Google has been replacing broken Pixel Watches instead of repairing them. “Watches and wearables are still fairly nascent," a spokesperson explained at a 2024 Climate Week panel when asked why the watch wasn't repairable. Meanwhile, Apple recently celebrated the 10th anniversary of its Apple Watch.

The good news is that repairability is one of the top improvements Google has made to the new Pixel Watch 4, which was announced today alongside the Pixel 10 phones. The Pixel Watch 4 retains its domed glass design but can be disassembled with a screwdriver, and it uses largely the same-size screws throughout its construction. A customer won't void the one-year warranty if the watch is disassembled for screen or battery repairs, and Google will sell replacements for those components at iFixit.

There are several other small improvements to the smartwatch, like longer battery life and a new gesture that lets you talk to Gemini by raising your wrist. The Pixel Watch 4 starts at $349 for the 41-mm Bluetooth model, while the 45-mm variant is $399. (The versions with LTE connectivity cost $100 more, respectively.) You can preorder it now, but unlike the Pixel 10 phones that are available this month, the watch won't be available until October 9.

Google invited me to its Mountain View, California, offices to take an exclusive look at a teardown of the Pixel Watch 4. (Google paid for a portion of my travel expenses to see its research facility.) Junyong Park, an industrial designer who worked on the device, began disassembling it, manicured nails and all. Park says it was a “tremendous collaboration” between the design and engineering teams. “We're pretty proud of how this turned out.”

There are two T2 screws located under the watch band pocket—unscrew those, and you can access the internals of the Pixel Watch 4, no need to fuss with any adhesives. At this stage, the Biosensor Hub, which houses the heart rate monitor and other sensors on the back of the watch, is still connected. Google intentionally made it so that this connector doesn't need to be removed for battery replacements. Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, which has partnered with Google to sell the spare parts for the watch, says these kinds of connectors can be fragile, so it's always better if the device's design lets you replace components without having to unplug them.

To remove the battery, remove the haptic motor with the T2 head on a Torx screwdriver. Two more screws hold the battery, but once they're out, you can disconnect the battery from the board and be done. You'll notice that Google used T2 screws throughout that entire process. This is intentional, as you can use the same Torx screwdriver for battery replacements, reducing the number of tools needed for repairs. (A Torx screwdriver is commonly used in electronics repairs and is included in the repair kits sold by iFixit.)

To replace the display, you'll need to unplug the Biosensor Hub. Then disconnect the battery brackets, unplug the display connector, and unscrew the four screws that hold the glass to the housing. (These are a mix of T2 and T5 screws.) Overall, it looked fairly simple, and it took Park less than 13 minutes to remove these components while talking about the process and answering my questions.

Francis Hoe, senior product manager for the Pixel Watch, says the Pixel Watch 4 should still maintain the IP68 water-resistance rating after servicing. A silicone O-ring helps create a seal when the two halves of the watch are placed back together. Hoe, who has been the product lead since the Pixel Watch 2, says Google always wanted to make its smartwatch repairable. “It has taken us a little bit longer to get to this place—it required a lot of change internally in the product; those types of big architecture changes take multiple years.”

The design changes in the Pixel Watch 4 are a big step forward for smartwatch repairability. While you can replace some components in an Apple Watch or Galaxy Watch, they're not as easy to repair yourself. Apple's Self Service Repair program doesn't cover the Apple Watch, and on iFixit's repairability rankings, the Apple Watch Series 10 scored a paltry 3/10. (The Pixel Watch 3 earned a 4/10.) Samsung tells WIRED that user repair is supported on its Galaxy Watches (the Galaxy Watch Ultra earned a respectable 7/10 on iFixit), but this doesn't include the battery due to safety reasons.

“Smartwatches ought to be a mature product at this point,” Wiens says, though he notes that challenges around serviceability are harder on a smartwatch compared to a smartphone due to its smaller size. Repairability “should be possible; it's just a matter of will,” Wiens says. “It's going to be more challenging. It's going to be easier and lower cost to make it less repairable.”

That echoes what Anna-Katrina Shedletsky says. Now the CEO of Instrumental, Shedletsky spent six years at Apple and was one of the product design leads on the original Apple Watch. She says the priority at the time of the Apple Watch's debut was to design something people would actually want to wear, not repairability. Other concerns took priority too, like water resistance and figuring out the intricacies of where to place the Wi-Fi antenna on the metal frame of the watch.

“I think we did a pretty good job—it's much harder to make than a phone, but it had much lower return rates," Shedletsky says. “It's really hard to get all the stuff in there that you need; most of the stuff that you'd require for repairability requires extra space.” She also noted that the square shape of the Apple Watch made it more challenging to seal. “There's a reason most watches are round, because you can make a better seal that way. You couldn't use an O-ring on a design like this; it wouldn't work.”

What else is new with the Pixel Watch 4? While it may win points for repairability, Google's latest wearable isn't earning any plaudits for environmental impact: For the third time in four generations, Google is changing the charger. The smartwatch now charges on its side, allowing it to rest sideways, like a clock. It's not just for show—charging is faster, too, going from 0 to 50 percent in 15 minutes. There aren't many third-party chargers for the Pixel Watch at the moment, but Google says we'll see more options with the latest generation.

The design is largely the same, except the Actua 360 display is domed for the first time, resting under the domed glass. It slightly improves the visibility of the watch face at various angles, and it looks spectacular. The bezels are 15 percent slimmer, meaning you get 10 percent more screen, and that screen can hit 3,000 nits of brightness, making it 50 percent brighter than the Pixel Watch 3. The watch's haptic engine is stronger, so you can feel more precisely when there's a notification or alert, and the clearer custom speaker should make it easier to hear answers from the Gemini voice assistant.

Speaking of, one of the new capabilities on the watch is a gesture to activate Gemini. Just raise your wrist, and Gemini will wake up and listen, eliminating the need to say a hotword or press a button. The company had to train the algorithms to differentiate between a wrist raise to check the time and a wrist raise to speak to Gemini. (There are settings to turn off this feature or adjust the sensitivity.)

The Pixel Watch 4 also has a redesigned smart reply system, utilizing a new on-device Gemini small language model optimized for the smartwatch. These smart replies aren't personalized to you, but they'll show up more consistently as reply options when you receive a message. Google says they generate 80 percent of the time, whereas the previous quick replies only showed up 20 percent of the time.

You'll see a performance boost thanks to the new dual-chip architecture—Qualcomm's Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 paired with a machine-learning microprocessor—delivering more processing at half the power. That also means 25 percent longer battery life, bumping Google's claim up to 40 hours of run time for the 45-mm watch and 30 hours for the 41-mm model.

Google says the Pixel Watch 4 is the first smartwatch with SOS satellite communications, allowing you to connect to emergency services directly via the watch instead of a phone. Several smartphones have this capability, including Pixel phones, but this may prove useful for folks who tend to leave the phone at home when going on a run.

As for health features, Google focused on upgrading sleep tracking this year. It says the watch is more accurate at classifying your complete sleep cycle, precisely detecting when your body is in REM, light, or deep sleep. A new skin temperature sensor can detect when your temps veer out of your usual range, which could help you identify if you're under the weather. It maintains many of the same features as before, including Cardio Load, Loss of Pulse Detection (which became available in the US earlier this year on the Pixel Watch 3), Fall Detection, and Car Crash Detection.

Fitness-wise, you can stream cycling workouts to your phone, turning it into a bike computer of sorts, and the new dual-frequency GPS radio allows for more accurate route tracking. There's a new “AI-powered activity recognition system,” meaning if you forgot to track a workout, the watch will still track your activity in the background and give you credit for it—it classifies the activity and will send a summary afterward with your cardio load, calories burned, and other metrics.

In October, Google will introduce a redesigned Fitbit smartphone app with a new AI Health Coach, powered by Gemini. Google says you'll be able to “ask virtually any health and fitness question,” and this is available for older Pixel Watches and Fitbit devices. It'll launch as a preview—sort of like a beta—and is only available in the US at the start for Fitbit Premium subscribers. Google says this health and fitness coach is built with “leading industry experts and through scientific research,” though keep in mind it was just over a year ago that Google's AI Overviews recommended adding glue to pizza sauce.

Seattle-area startup TeamSense, a software platform used by employers for absence reporting and employee communications, is raising fresh investment. 

The company recently raised $19.5 million, according to a new filing with the SEC. 

TeamSense CEO Sheila Stafford declined to comment when reached by GeekWire. 

TeamSense originally spun out of a joint innovation studio managed by Seattle-based Pioneer Square Labs and Fortive, the Everett, Wash.-based industrial giant. 

The company launched in 2020 and built software to help employers track COVID-19 symptoms at the workplace.

The product has evolved into a text-based system designed to manage employee attendance in real-time. 

TeamSense's customers include manufacturing and logistics companies. The startup has around 30 employees, according to LinkedIn.

Fortive acquired TeamSense in 2021. The company has operated independently since 2022; Fortive remains a minority investor.

TeamSense raised $4 million in 2023 from Bonfire Ventures and Operator Collective.

Stafford previously held leadership roles at Fluke, Whirlpool, and GM.

Next-gen battery materials manufacturer Group14 Technologies today announced $463 million of new funding. The Woodinville, Wash.-based company has raised more than $1 billion from investors. 

The new cash comes as Group14 is forging a path forward despite significant federal cuts for clean tech support, ongoing tariff uncertainties, and projections for a slowing electric vehicle market. The company last month laid off an undisclosed number of workers and is delaying by more than a year the start of production at its flagship battery materials plant in Eastern Washington's Moses Lake. 

“This raise is powerful validation that, despite a tough macro environment, investors are doubling down on Group14's role in shaping the future of energy storage,” said Group14 CEO Rick Luebbe in a statement. “Their continued support underscores their conviction in our technology and recognition of the global demand for silicon batteries we're already seeing.” 

The company also disclosed that it is buying out SK Inc.'s 75% share of a jointly-owned battery materials factory in South Korea, making Group14 the sole owner. SK Inc., an investment holding company, also led the Series D round that was disclosed today. 

The deal puts Group14 in “full control of its primary manufacturing base in Asia, strategically located near the world's largest battery manufacturers,” the company said in a statement.

Group14 has developed a silicon anode technology used in lithium ion batteries that holds more power and requires less time for recharging than traditional graphite anode batteries. The product, called SCC55, is suitable for use in EVs, consumer electronics and utility-scale batteries that can help meet power demand for data centers.

The company previously raised $649 million from investors, bringing its new total to $1.11 billion. Group14 broke ground on its Battery Active Materials-2, or BAM-2, facility in Moses Lake in April 2023 and aimed to start manufacturing by late 2024. Its new start date is early 2026. 

The South Korea factory, BAM-3, has been producing anode material since last September, which it's shipping to customers for testing. Group14 reports that 150 customers have signed up for its product. That includes the automaker Porsche, which has invested in the company and plans to use the silicon technology in some of its electric vehicles. 

The new funding will help Group14 “accelerate and ramp-up production” at its two manufacturing sites, a spokesperson said by email. The company has about 400 employees worldwide. 

It was smoother sailing for Group14 and its competitors under the Biden administration, which prioritized the transition to clean power and worked to rebuild U.S. battery production, which is currently dominated by China. The Trump administration has reversed course, emphasizing fossil fuel use and cutting tax breaks for batteries, wind, solar and EVs.

In May, OneD Battery Sciences reportedly pulled the plug on its pilot plant in Moses Lake, while Sila is commissioning its battery materials facility in the same town and plans to start production this year.

Group14 received a $100 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy in 2022 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act to help construct the BAM2 facility. In September it was awarded a $200 million DOE grant to build a Moses Lake plant that would produce silane gas, an essential ingredient for manufacturing silicon battery materials. 

“With over 90% of anode-grade graphite coming from China, the vulnerability is clear,” Luebbe said. “Our silicon battery material gives manufacturers a high-performance alternative that helps derisk the supply chain. Every tonne of SCC55 displaces five tonnes of Chinese graphite with a homegrown solution.”

Less than 24 hours after issuing a response to reports of a Windows 11 SSD issue that is affecting a number of different drives, Phison has been forced to release a staunch rebuttal against a circulated document the company says has been falsely created and circulated amongst its customers.

On Tuesday, we reported that a Microsoft security update for Windows 11 appears to be causing SSD failures following heavy file transfers. While drives sporting Phison NAND controllers are amongst the drives affected, Phison's tech is not solely impacted, as was erroneously reported elsewhere. In a statement to Tom's Hardware, Phison confirmed it is aware of the issue and is investigating.

In the meantime, Phison says it has recently become aware of a "falsified document" that has been passed off as having originated from within the company, and has reportedly been circulated to various customers. "We wish to state unequivocally that the document in question—reproduced below—is neither an official nor unofficial communication from Phison," the company told Tom's Hardware.

Specifically, the document includes false claims regarding the aforementioned storage and data issues pertaining to the August 12 Microsoft Windows Security Updates. Pulling no punches, Phison says it is addressing the circulation of the falsified document through "appropriate legal processes."

The fake document, pictured below, bears the title "Phison SSD Controller Issues Summary" and claims to include a table of affected controller models relating to the issue. As per Phison, none of this information is official. There is no information available as to the source of the fictitious document.

Phison further reiterated that its only official statement to the media and customers on the matter was the one reported on August 19, enclosed below.

The Asus ROG Xbox Ally is a mouthful of a name for a device, and yet I can't stop saying the name—like I'm casting a spell—as we slide further toward the end of the year. At Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, Microsoft and Asus are giving players a chance to wrap their mitts around the strange Xbox controller-like grips of the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X. While the companies will tell you when you'll eventually be able to pick one off a store shelf, they're not quite ready to tell you how much it'll cost.

Both the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X are slated for release on Oct. 16 in the U.S., Europe, and other markets in Asia. We won't know how much it will cost and when we can preorder one until sometime “in the coming weeks,” Asus said in a press release. Gamescom attendees will be first to try out the new Xbox-ified version of Windows 11, which should make it easier than Microsoft's regular ol' OS to launch games on both the Xbox app and through third-party launchers like Steam and Epic Games Store. The handheld effectively dual boots into the base version of Windows 11 if you need to access all the apps you can't from the new Xbox menu. Microsoft is also working on a “Handheld Compatibility Program” akin to Valve's Steam Deck Verified badges. Xbox will label whether a game is “handheld optimized,” which means it works with the default controller layout, or “mostly compatible,” which will require a few adjustments.

The ROG Xbox Ally is the lower-end starter handheld compared to the beefier specs of the Xbox Ally X. The one in white comes packed with an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor. Based on specs alone, the chip seems closest in power to a Steam Deck. It's a 4-core, 8-thread chip based on AMD's Zen 2 microarchitecture, which the chipmaker launched back in 2019. It's running on eight RDNA 2 GPU cores, which should be enough for the vast majority of smaller games and a fair few AAA titles on lower graphics settings. It still comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of built-in storage.

The Xbox Ally X is the one that comes packed with AMD's Ryzen Z2 Extreme. That APU, or accelerated processing unit, sports 8 cores and 16 threads based on AMD's latest Zen 5 CPU architecture. The chip is packed with 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores—though not the latest RDNA 4—alongside 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Just like the Asus ROG Ally X from 2024, it contains an 80Wh battery that should enhance overall playtime, depending on your performance settings. Microsoft also hinted the Xbox Ally X will make use of Microsoft's Automatic Super Resolution for on-device AI upscaling to enhance performance. Both the Xbox Ally and Ally X contain a 7-inch LCD display. Microsoft said either handheld should receive future updates that will allow for faster launching and better battery life, as well as “enhancements to the docking experience” that suggest the Xbox Ally will work better connected to a monitor or TV.

There are a few reasons you should be concerned that neither Microsoft nor Asus wants to drop the bombshell that is pricing. We caught a hint of supposed Xbox Ally prices for European customers back in July. The Xbox Ally was set at 600 euros, or $700, while the Xbox Ally X demanded 900 euros, or $1,050. Those are similar prices to today's ROG Ally and ROG Ally X in the EU, so these leaks may not be equivalent to what U.S. customers can expect to pay. Tariffs have already caused havoc on PC supply chains and led to manufacturers raising prices. Without any official notice, Asus raised prices on its ROG Ally X from $900 to $1,000 a few months after President Donald Trump announced sweeping global tariffs.

Optimists will look at the delayed pricing and hope Microsoft is working out a way to subsidize what will be its first new gaming hardware in years, even if it's simply sporting the Xbox brand name. If the Xbox Ally X is truly as pricey as other handheld PCs, it would make it a premium product that only the most ardent PC gamers would be willing to fork over their funds for. It will need to compete with upcoming handhelds like the Lenovo Legion Go 2 that sports a better OLED display compared to the Ally's LCD. The Xbox Ally needs to be, at the very least, as cheap as a baseline Steam Deck OLED at $550 or the $600 Lenovo Legion Go S if Asus and Xbox want any chance of staking a claim in the still-nascent handheld scene.

"We'll get equity in return for it; get a good return for the American taxpayer, instead of just giving grants away"

U.S Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has confirmed in an interview that the White House is in talks with Intel to acquire a 10% stake in the company. Lutnick confirmed this in a live interview with CNBC, saying that the government wants the grants given to the company under the CHIPS Act to be converted into equity. Secretary Lutnick also reiterated that the U.S. must manufacture its own chips domestically.

“America should get the benefit of the bargain; that is exactly Donald Trump's perspective, which is, ‘Why are we giving a company worth $100 billion this kind of money? What are (sic) in it for the American taxpayer?' And the answer Donald Trump has is, ‘We should get an equity stake for our money,'” Lutnick said. “So, we'll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden Administration. We'll get equity in return for it; get a good return for the American taxpayer, instead of just giving grants away. Donald Trump views [that] we should get benefits for the economics that we put out.”

Lutnick also highlighted the perceived security risks of relying on foreign chip production. "For national security, we must manufacture our own chips domestically," he said in the interview. "We cannot rely on Taiwan, which is 9,500 miles from the United States and only 80 miles from China. 99% of leading-edge chips should not be made in Taiwan. This is why we negotiated with South Korea and Japan to expand our chip manufacturing capacity at home."

Intel has endured a tough run since July 2024, when it released a disastrous quarterly report that resulted in a massive drop in stock price, followed by rounds of layoffs that continue to bite more than a year later. Since then, new CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been trying to turn the company around after Pat Gelsinger's surprise resignation. However, Tan is also under scrutiny after Cadence admitted to exporting chip design tools to Chinese entities that have been banned by the U.S. while he was at the helm.

President Trump went so far as to say Tan must resign because of conflicting interests. Nevertheless, the Intel CEO went to the White House to meet with the president, where the two discussed the future of the embattled American chipmaker. It was a couple of days after this meeting that reports started to surface that Trump was considering trying to secure a 10% U.S. stake in the company.

At the moment, Intel has only received $2.2 billion of the promised $7.86 billion under the CHIPS Act. It's unclear if the government will release the remaining balance in one fell swoop if it gets the 10% equity stake, but a move like that would benefit the cash-strapped company, possibly allowing it to speed up the construction of its Ohio fab. Aside from that, Lutnick says that the proposed equity stake does not come with any governance provisions, so Intel's board would still be in charge of the direction that the company is taking. This will not be a golden ticket for Intel, though, as it would still need a path to profitability, even if it gets the extra cash from Washington. We've reached out to Intel for comment on this latest development.

Although this move would be beneficial for Intel in the short term, a few experts are raising red flags, including one cited in the interview who said that it is “corporate statism and it rarely does end well.” Reuters also reported that Lutnick wants to expand this move — the exchange of cash grants for equity stake — to other CHIPS Act beneficiaries. This will certainly be something that companies will be wary of, as it adds several layers of complexity to the deals.

Whatever the case, a 10% non-voting, non-governance equity share for a huge inflow of capital would certainly be good news for Intel. And when you pair that with Softbank's $2 billion purchase of Intel stock, the chipmaker is certainly getting a lot of resources to help it move forward. Now, it just needs to find customers for its 14A node.

Opening the day for a faster, brighter, and more vibrant gaming experience

Asus has announced a trio of OLED gaming monitors designed explicitly for hardcore gamers at Gamescom. The ROG Swift OLED PG27AQWP-W and ROG Strix OLED XG27AQWMG are new additions to the company's OLED lineup, while the ROG Strix OLED XG27AQDMG Gen 2 is the much-awaited refresh to the original ROG Strix OLED XG27AQDMG.

Notably, only the ROG Swift OLED PG27AQWP-W and ROG Strix OLED XG27AQWMG are equipped with what Asus calls Tandem OLED technology, which promises a 15% increase in peak brightness, a 25% expansion in color volume, and a 60% extension in lifespan compared to previous-generation WOLED monitors.

The Neo Proximity Sensor is also present on all three monitors. This tech determines whether the user is present and switches to a black screen to prevent panel burn-in when the user isn't in front of the monitor.

The ROG Swift OLED PG27AQWP-W features a 26.5-inch display with a native refresh rate of 540 Hz at 1440p (2560 x 1440). However, if you're willing to sacrifice resolution for a higher refresh rate, this gaming monitor can do a blistering 720 Hz at 720p (1280 x 720).

The PG27AQWP-W's other impressive attributes include a 0.03 ms GTG (gray-to-gray) response time, VESA DisplayHDR 500 True Black certification, and a 99.5% DCI-P3 gamut.

The PG27AQWP-W comes with DisplayPort 2.1a outputs with UHBR20 support for 80 Gbps of bandwidth, as well as HDMI 2.1 ports. This monitor also has a nifty semi-transparent back panel that shows off the guts inside.

Meanwhile, the ROG Strix OLED XG27AQWMG positions itself as a more affordable OLED with slightly toned-down specifications. It still maintains the 26.5-inch panel with a 1440p (2560 x 1440) resolution. However, the refresh rate has been limited to 280 Hz.

The XG27AQWMG's other specifications, such as the 0.03 ms GTG response time, VESA DisplayHDR 500 True Black, and 99.5% DCI-P3 gamut, remain unchanged compared to its fancier stablemate.

The outputs on the XG27AQWMG differ slightly from those on the more expensive PG27AQWP-W. For instance, Asus has downgraded the DisplayPort 2.1a output to a DisplayPort 1.4 (DSC) on the XG27AQWMG. The HDMI 2.1 ports are still present and accompanied by a useful USB hub.

Last but not least, Asus unveiled the new ROG Strix OLED XG27AQDMG Gen 2, a follow-up to the original XG27AQDMG. The latest variant sports a 26.5-inch WOLED display. It features a 1440p (2560 x 1440) resolution, a 240 Hz refresh rate, and a response time of 0.03 ms GTG.

Unlike the other two monitors, the XG27AQDMG Gen 2 does not feature Asus Tandem OLED technology, but it keeps the TrueBlack Glossy coating. Asus positions it as a monitor for gaming, as well as graphic design or video production, with a VESA DisplayHDR 400 True Black rating, a 99% DCI-P3 gamut, true 10-bit color, and a Delta E < 2 calibration from the factory.

Display outputs on the XG27AQDMG Gen 2 include DisplayPort 1.4 (DSC) outputs, HDMI 2.1 ports, and a USB Hub.

Asus hasn't revealed the pricing or the availability for the PG27AQWP-W, XG27AQWMG, or XG27AQDMG Gen 2.

AI is a powerful tool, but only if used correctly. | The study shows that AI tools must adjust to the organization's processes for it to work effectively.

Many companies are rushing to implement various AI tools into their operation, but most of these pilot programs fail, according to an MIT study. Fortune reported that 95% do not hit their target performance, not because the AI models weren't working as intended, but because generic AI tools, like ChatGPT, do not adapt to the workflows that have already been established in the corporate environment.

As per the report, the study's findings purportedly demonstrate that only "about 5% of AI pilot programs achieve rapid revenue acceleration." It says "the vast majority stall," and deliver "little to no measurable impact" on profit and loss. The findings are based on 150 interviews, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public deployments of AI.

The remaining 5% differs from all the rest because they focus on one thing and do it well. “Some large companies' pilots and younger startups are really excelling with generative AI,” MIT researcher and lead author Aditya Challapally told the publication. “It's because they pick one pain point, execute well, and partner smartly with companies who use their tools.”

One more issue that many organizations that use AI face is setting the wrong priorities for the use of these tools. The research reveals that AI works best in back-office automation — basically taking over administrative and repetitive tasks that many corporations tend to outsource. However, over half of the money spent on AI projects reportedly focuses on sales and marketing, departments that arguably need a human touch, especially as most buyers are still humans, not machines.

MIT says that two out of three projects that use specialized AI providers are successful, while only a third of in-house AI tools deliver expected results. Despite this, many organizations working in highly regulated fields, like finance and healthcare, prefer building their own AI programs. They likely do this to reduce regulatory risk, which can be especially damaging if an AI leaks private information — something that has happened in the past.

The research project also touched on AI's effect on the workforce. While there haven't been widespread layoffs because of AI yet, MIT reports that companies aren't replacing positions that have become vacant when a staff member leaves. This was most prevalent in customer support and administrative positions — entry-level jobs that have usually been outsourced. This could be the harbinger of what several CEOs, including Anthropic's Dario Amodei and Ford's Jim Farley, are warning about: that AI might wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs in five years.

Protesters took over part of Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., campus for more than an hour Tuesday — escalating their efforts to pressure the company to stop providing technology to the Israeli government and military.

Members of the No Azure for Apartheid group, which includes current and former Microsoft employees, allege that the company's technology is being used in the surveillance, starvation and killing of Palestinians in Gaza.

Microsoft has said it complies with its human rights commitments, and that its contracts with Israel's Ministry of Defense are standard commercial agreements, governed by its terms of service and AI Code of Conduct. 

The protesters created what they called a “Liberated Zone” in the plaza of the company's East Campus, in front of the Microsoft sign, pitching tents and setting up a “negotiations table” with a banner that read, “Microsoft Execs, Come to the Table.” The space was filled with shrouds symbolizing the dead in Gaza, and a large plate reading, “Stop Starving Gaza.”

“Regardless of your beliefs, regardless of whether or not your work today actually supports Israel, know that Microsoft's money does include blood money,” said one of the speakers at the protest, Julius Shan, a software engineer who said he has worked at Microsoft for nearly five years.

A smattering of Microsoft employees looked on from the periphery as security guards and police arrived. One employee who was watching nearby said he empathized with the message but not the approach.

“This isn't going to change anything,” said the employee, who did not give his name. “It's just going to annoy the people that are here.”

Initially, the protesters appeared to be preparing for an extended encampment, reminiscent of student-led protests at universities during the 2023-24 academic year. 

In a press release shortly after the action began, the group said it was renaming the plaza “The Martyred Palestinian Children's Plaza,” and offered interviews at the “Anas Al-Sharif Media Tent,” named after a Palestinian journalist killed in Gaza last week.

However, the group took down the encampment and moved to a nearby public sidewalk after City of Redmond Police told them they were trespassing on private property and would be subject to arrest. 

Microsoft has not issued a public statement about the latest protest. The company has said in past statements that it does not permit its technology to be used for unlawful surveillance or human rights abuses. 

Earlier this year, Microsoft said internal and external reviews found no violations. However, the company acknowledged its limited visibility into how its technology is deployed on private or on-premises systems

Microsoft announced on Aug. 15 that it is launching a formal review into allegations that its Azure cloud services were used by the Israeli military for mass surveillance of Palestinians. The company said it hired the law firm Covington & Burling LLP to lead the review, and pledged to make the findings of the review public once the process is complete.

That move came after reports earlier this month in The Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call cited sources alleging that the Israeli Defense Forces stored data from widespread phone monitoring of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank on Microsoft servers. 

At the time of the initial report by the Guardian, the company explained that its work with an Israeli intelligence unit focused on cybersecurity and that it was not aware of any civilian surveillance. 

The encampment Tuesday was part of a broader escalation by the group, which has spent much of the past year staging protests inside and outside company events, including Microsoft's 50th anniversary event in Redmond earlier this year, where protesters interrupted executives inside the event.

Earlier this month, the group staged a loud protest outside the home of Teresa Hutson, corporate vice president of Microsoft's Trusted Technology Group — pouring red paint on the sidewalk symbolizing blood, and accusing her of being complicit in killing children in Gaza, according to video clips from the protest.

The group's latest action comes amid reports of a growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and increasing concerns about famine. Hamas has agreed to a proposed 60-day cease-fire with phased hostage releases. Israeli officials today demanded the release of all hostages and said they were not interested in partial deals, according to the BBC.

Fewer than half of all adolescents with major depressive episode (MDE) received mental health care in the US in 2022, with the odds of specialist treatment being even lower among marginalized groups, according to a new study published this week in the open-access journal PLOS Mental Health by Su Chen Tan and colleagues at University of Tennessee, USA.

The prevalence of adolescent depression has increased following the COVID-19 pandemic and is often under-treated. Depression experienced during adolescence can be linked to more severe social and psychological consequences compared to depression that begins in adulthood. Early recognition and interventions are necessary to prevent long-lasting negative educational, health, and social outcomes.

In the new study, researchers analyzed data from 12–17-year-olds as part of the the 2022 U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Of the 11,969 respondents, 2,283 (19.2%) met the diagnostic criteria for MDE.

Of those with MDE, 47.5% had reported receiving some form of treatment, 39.1% had received specialist clinician treatment, 30.5% received school-based services, and 25.0% received prescription services. In addition to the low levels of mental health service use. there were also significant sociodemographic disparities. Adolescents in rural areas had significantly lower odds of receiving specialist treatment compared to their urban counterparts (AOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47-0.87). In addition, females had greater odds and Black adolescents significantly lower odds of utilizing any mental health treatment relative to males and non-Hispanic White adolescents, respectively (Females: AOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.11-2.28; Black: AOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.22-0.59).

"Addressing the disparities in mental health treatment revealed by this study is crucial for ensuring a more inclusive and equitable mental health support system for all adolescents," the authors say.

Stanford Medicine scientists investigating the neurological underpinnings of autism spectrum disorder have found that hyperactivity in a specific brain region could drive behaviors commonly associated with the disorder.

Using a mouse model of the disease, the researchers identified the reticular thalamic nucleus - which serves as a gatekeeper of sensory information between the thalamus and cortex - as a potential target for treatments.

Moreover, they were able to reverse symptoms similar to those of autism - including susceptibility to seizures, heightened sensitivity to stimulus, increased motor activity, repetitive behaviors and decreased social interactions - by giving the mice drugs that suppressed this area of the brain.

The same drugs are being studied for the treatment of epilepsy, highlighting where the processes underlying autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy may overlap in the brain and why they often occur in the same patients.

The findings will be published Aug. 20 in Science Advances. The senior author of the study is John Huguenard, PhD, professor of neurology and neurological sciences. The lead author is Sung-Soo Jang, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in neurology and neurological sciences.

The neural circuitry connecting the thalamus and cortex has been implicated in autism in both humans and animal models, but the role of the reticular thalamic nucleus was not clear.

In the new study, the researchers recorded the neural activity of this brain region in mice while observing the animals' behavior. In mice that had been genetically modified to model autism (Cntnap2 knockout mice), the reticular thalamic nucleus showed elevated activity when the animals encountered stimuli like light or an air puff as well as during social interactions. The brain region also showed bursts of spontaneous activity, causing seizures.

Epilepsy is much more prevalent in people with autism than in the general population - 30% versus 1% - though the mechanisms are not well understood. Recognizing this connection, the researchers tested an experimental seizure drug, Z944, and found that it reversed behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model.

With a different experimental treatment that genetically modifies neurons to respond to designer drugs, known as DREADD-based neuromodulation, the researchers could suppress overactivity in the reticular thalamic nucleus and reverse behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model. They could even induce these behavioral deficits in normal mice by ramping up activity in the reticular thalamic nucleus.

The new findings highlight the reticular thalamic nucleus as a novel target for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders.

In Guatemalan communities, a recent visit to a health clinic or hospital - not antibiotic use - is the strongest predictor of carrying bacteria resistant to critical antibiotics, according to a new study led by Washington State University.

Previous research in Guatemala's Western Highlands found nearly 46% of residents were colonized in the gastrointestinal tract with bacteria known as extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (ESCrE). These bacteria, often E. coli, can render the commonly used and important antibiotic ceftriaxone ineffective, complicating care for infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections. The new study, published in Scientific Reports, examined 951 residents from the same region to identify factors linked to ESCrE colonization.

By identifying the most important risk factors for carrying these resistant bacteria, we can begin to target interventions where they will have the most impact. This knowledge is critical not only for protecting communities in Guatemala but also for addressing the global threat posed by antibiotic resistance."

Dr. Brooke Ramay, study's lead author and an assistant research professor in the WSU College of Veterinary Medicine's Paul G. Allen School for Global Health

While most studies on antimicrobial resistance have focused on infection and mortality, this research examined colonization - when bacteria live in or on a person without causing illness.

"We're colonized with all types of bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria," Ramay said. "Being colonized isn't necessarily harmful, but it means you can carry and spread these bacteria to others in the community or in health care facilities. And when these bacteria get into the wrong place - your bloodstream, urinary tract or other vulnerable sites, for example - they can cause serious infections."

While the study doesn't prove that health care visits cause colonization, it's likely that exposure to hospitals and clinics increases the chance of picking up resistant bacteria through contact with surfaces, medical equipment, water or staff. It's also possible that people who need medical care already have health conditions like chronic illness, diarrhea or malnutrition that make them more vulnerable to colonization.

"People who had reported going to a health care facility or a hospital for treatment for any type of illness had a much higher risk of being colonized in the gastrointestinal tract with these bacteria," Ramay said. "This could be due to exposure to the health care environment facilitating transmission. Alternatively, this might be because inflammatory processes occurring in the gut of sick individuals make it easier for these bacteria to colonize. We are exploring this further in ongoing studies."

The study also found urban residents and households without trash pickup were roughly twice as likely to carry the bacteria compared to rural residents or those with waste services. People using piped or well water were about 1.5 times more likely to be colonized than those using bottled water, possibly due to bacterial biofilms in water infrastructure or contamination during storage.

Contrary to common assumptions, the study found no significant link between colonization and self-reported antibiotic use.

"We've seen this in other projects as well," she said. "In Guatemala, we observe significant effects of antibiotic use on antibiotic resistance in environments with improved hygiene. In households with poor hygiene, transmission factors play a much greater role in colonization risk."

The research was completed in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and University del Valle de Guatemala as part of the broader Antimicrobial Resistance in Communities and Hospitals (ARCH) study partnership, which has research projects in six countries. ARCH studies have shown a wide range of ESCrE prevalence, ranging from 34 to 52 percent in Kenya, 29 percent in Chile, 72 percent in India, 24 to 26 percent in Botswana, 78 percent in Bangladesh and 46 percent in Guatemala. WSU is leading the ARCH efforts in both Guatemala and Kenya.

While resistant bacteria remain rare in the U.S., global travel and trade could mean they are just a flight away.

"These bacteria and the resistance genes they carry do not respect borders," Ramay said. "By understanding and addressing colonization risk factors abroad, we can help slow their spread everywhere."

A study analyzes the negative effects of stress on the brains of male and female rats and concludes that acute stress induces anxiety-like behaviors, especially in males, while chronic stress is more associated with depressive symptoms. Understanding these differences may help develop more effective approaches to preventing and treating mental disorders such as anxiety and depression.

It is well established that stress can increase susceptibility to various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, which are highly prevalent worldwide and represent a significant economic burden and public health issue in our society. The World Health Organization estimated that in 2019, around 970 million people globally - one in eight - suffered from a mental disorder.Evidence also points to sex differences in the prevalence of and responses to stress. In fact, while women account for two-thirds of patients with stress-related disorders, another indicator shows that more than two-thirds of suicide victims are men.Although stress is a part of life and, in small doses, can even be beneficial, excessive exposure, whether acute or chronic, can have profound negative effects, especially on the brain, potentially leading to cerebrovascular diseases. One of the most sensitive targets of excessive stress is the blood-brain barrier, a structure that protects the brain from potentially harmful substances.However, despite evidence suggesting that different types of stress can compromise its integrity and trigger neuroinflammatory responses associated with various neurological conditions, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood.In the article "Distinct behavioral and neurovascular signatures induced by acute and chronic stress in rats", published in September in the scientific journal Behavioural Brain Research, a research team from the University of Coimbra, Portugal, led by Ana Paula Silva, sought to clarify this issue by analysing the effects of acute and chronic stress in rodents.With support from the BIAL Foundation, the researchers used open field and forced swimming tests to assess locomotor activity and anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in male and female Wistar rats.The results showed that acute stress induces anxiety-like behaviors, especially in males, while chronic stress is more associated with depressive symptoms. Additionally, changes were observed in key proteins of the blood-brain barrier, with significant sex differences.The research confirmed that acute stress and so-called chronic mild unpredictable stress induce distinct behavioral and biochemical profiles, highlighting the importance of differentiating stress types and considering biological variables, such as sex, in neuroscience research.

Our study shows how important it is to understand the differences between types of stress to better grasp the causes of mental disorders like anxiety and depression, and to find more effective ways to prevent and treat these issues."

Despite improvements in medical and surgical management strategies, brain abscess continues to cause disability and mortality in affected individuals. The long-term predictors of survival in individuals with brain abscess are not well understood. Researchers have now addressed this knowledge gap using a retrospective cohort study based on patients from Thailand. They have identified key predictors of long-term survival in patients and created a dynamic nomogram that can aid individualized prognostication for each patient.

Brain abscess (BA) is a serious medical condition caused by localized infections in the brain. Usually, patients with BA have infection in the parenchyma—brain tissue that performs much of the organ's vital functions. There have been significant advancements in the clinical management of BA, including medical and surgical approaches. However, the condition still leads to functional disability and mortality in patients, suggesting an urgent need to improve the standard of care.

Improving the accuracy of prognostication is a crucial step in improving health outcomes of patients with BA. Although certain prognostic factors for BA have been identified, the predictors of long-term survival in patients with BA remain poorly understood. In a recent study published in Chinese Neurosurgical Journal, researchers explored predictors of long-term survival in BA patients and developed a dynamic nomogram for prognostication tailored to individuals. Further, they developed a dynamic nomogram for predicting long-term survival in patients with BA.

"This is a retrospective cohort study of individuals who had a BA that required either pathological confirmation by a pathologist or neuroimaging plus intraoperative purulent findings at a tertiary care hospital in southern Thailand between January 2014 and August 2024" explains Dr. Thara Tunthanathip, Assistant Professor at Prince of Songkla University, the lead author of the study.

The study involved a retrospective cohort analysis involving 205 patients at a tertiary care hospital in Southern Thailand. The researchers comprehensively evaluated various demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging factors to assess their predictive value for long-term survival in BA patients. They identified several independent predictors of long-term survival such as age, Karnofsky performance status, hemoculture results, preoperative coagulopathy, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, bandemia, and occipital location of BA. Furthermore, they estimated the 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year survival probabilities for these patients.

"The 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year survival probabilities were 0.77, 0.73, and 0.69, respectively", notes Dr. Tunthanathip. "In the present study, the observed 5-year survival probability was 69%, indicating a case fatality rate that remains comparatively high. Prior systematic reviews and metanalyses have documented a broad spectrum of mortality rates in individuals with BA, often ranging from 10 to 40%."

The predictors of long-term survival identified in the study hold significant potential to inform treatment decisions. The dynamic "nomogram"—a graphical tool used to predict disease progression—offers a user-friendly way of estimating long-term survival in these patients. Researchers have validated this nomogram using several distinct statistical techniques, confirming its robustness.

"The dynamic nomogram revealed strong predictive performance, with a C-index of 0.855
for apparent validation and 0.701 for validation with testing data. Calibration plots and receiver operating characteristic analysis further supported its reliability", Dr. Tunthanathip. "The model provides an interactive tool for individualized risk assessment and facilitating clinical decision-making", he explains further.

In the clinical setting, the predictive model created through this study may facilitate more accurate prognostication, thereby facilitating better treatment decisions and improving treatment outcomes for individuals with BA. With sufficient adaptation, the predictive model and dynamic nomogram can be applied to a wider population of BA patients.

"Future research should focus on external validation and further refinement of the model to ensure its generalizability across diverse populations", Dr. Tunthanathip concludes.

Kerry Dooley Young

 August 20, 2025  

The good news about cancer is that there are increasing numbers of people who are surviving after treatment, in some cases due to newer medicines and, in others, due to screening detecting the disease earlier.

As of January 1, about 18.6 million people in the US had a history of oncologic treatment, a figure expected to exceed 22 million by 2035, researchers at the American Cancer Society estimated in a new report. While the estimate excludes most in situ carcinoma and basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, it still shows how primary care clinicians will likely face increasing demands to help patients manage the aftermath of their cancer treatment.

Some cancers appear to be showing up more in younger people, perhaps in part due to sedentary lifestyles and poor diet. Research found excess body weight may play a role in global increases seen in early-onset breast, pancreatic, colorectal, and kidney cancers.

And treatments for cancer have been undergoing radical changes. Older chemotherapies that stop fast-growing cells, such as cancerous ones, remain widely used, but many new kinds of drugs have been introduced, sometimes only with emerging data available on their safety and benefits.

These include immune checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, and new forms of monoclonal antibodies.

“It's an exploding field” of treatments, said Kimberly S. Peairs, MD, the vice chair for clinical affairs at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore.

Yet there has not been much focus in US medicine in general on what happens when patients cycle back to being seen primarily by their primary care clinicians after treatment.

Peairs in 2015 founded the Primary Care for Cancer Survivors Program, which has served as a model for physicians elsewhere seeking to help bridge gaps that might otherwise happen in patient care.

For example, Ilana Yurkiewicz, MD, of Stanford University School of Medicine sought advice from Peairs when she sought to create a more unified approach to caring for patients who have had cancer treatments.

Yurkiewicz has worked closely with Natasha Steele, MD, a Stanford colleague who is a former lymphoma patient. In an interview with Medscape Medical News, Steele noted how patients can face a jarring change at the end of treatment. They transition from relying heavily on oncologists' expertise during their life-threatening illness to needing to resume participation in managing aspects of their own care.

“During cancer treatment, patients have to put their lives in the hands of their oncologists and trust they are safe,” Steele said. “But survivorship is a paradigm shift where we're really trying to empower patients with information and skills to manage some of their health risks longitudinally, and this can be challenging for a lot of reasons.”

For primary care clinicians, the changes in treatment and outcomes are allowing them to participate in one of the most rapidly advancing fields of medicine. For example, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) updated its guidelines 241 times last year. Clinicians in primary care can also rely on many tools like UptoDate and continuing medical education courses to aid with this challenge.

Physicians can help patients adjust to their “new normal” life after cancer treatment, Peairs said.

“We're not asking primary care people to be oncologists,” she said.

Below are three tips for primary care clinicians based on interviews with physicians who have significant expertise in oncology and in the emerging field known as survivorship.

Primary care clinicians can help get important messages through to patients who may struggle to keep track of follow-up care, said Kathleen N. Mueller, MD, the system director for integrative medicine and cancer survivorship for Nuvance Health, a seven-hospital health system in Connecticut and southeastern New York. Muller also serves on the board of directors of the American Academy of Family Physicians.

“When you're undergoing treatment for cancer, it's really difficult to process information,” Mueller said. “It is an overwhelming diagnosis.”

In many cases, people did not suspect they had cancer before their diagnosis.

“Now, all of a sudden, they're thinking about their mortality,” she said. “They may not get all the information that's communicated to them. So they might miss the fact that they're supposed to get, for example, a mammogram every 6 months with an MRI.”

A key to success with these talks about preventing recurrence is finding a way to make sure patients hear the message, such as by discussing different steps at different visits, said Crystal S. Denlinger, MD, the chief executive officer of NCCN.

“It's less about having an exact knowledge and more about knowing where to go to get the knowledge you need,” Denlinger said. “You don't need to tackle it all at every visit. During one visit, you could ask somebody about how physically active they are and then talk about the fact that physical activity can lower the rate of development of cancer, and for certain cancers, could actually lower the rate of recurrence.”

Another visit could be an opportunity to discuss nutrition.

“Maybe you ask them about their diet and how much processed food they're eating, how many fruits and vegetables they're eating,” Denlinger said. “You don't have to tackle the whole mountain. Start with a few steps.”

Denlinger also said it's important to acknowledge the good habits patients already have, such as getting enough physical activity.

Steele said she works to provide a “safe space” where patients can talk about what they are going through.

“After cancer treatment, a lot of people don't feel like the person they were before cancer,” Steele said, adding that this can be distressing for them.

“The way I approach this with my patients is I try to normalize the challenges and the trauma of cancer and give them the skills to figure out how to use parts of the experience in a meaningful way,” she said.

Primary care clinicians have a chief role in helping patients with concerns about recurrence and the challenges of managing life after cancer treatment, Denlinger said.

Anxiety is likely to crop up “in those quiet moments” after the most challenging phases of cancer treatment are done, Denlinger said.

After diagnosis, patients often shift into a “I've got to fight the cancer” mindset, needed to help them focus and get through treatments. The demands of cancer care, along with the attendant disruptions to home and family life, can provide some degree of distraction.

After treatment, patients disconnect with their constant oncology engagement, she said.

“Now they're returning back to the life that they had before they had cancer,” Denlinger said. “This may be a time where primary care providers are an important resource to address some of this post-treatment anxiety, as they're sort of processing all the things that they've been through. Fear of recurrence is real, and it needs to continue to be assessed.”

Peairs and her colleagues at Johns Hopkins published a 2020 paper about the first 4 years of the Johns Hopkins Primary Care for Cancer Survivors Program. This paper included results from a survey of patients that found many sought help with emotional needs. These included fear of recurrence, reported by 64.2%; the challenge of living with uncertainty, 62.5%; and managing difficult emotions: anger, anxiety, and depression (53.1%).

People may also have concerns about what their diagnosis means for their family members, Mueller said. For example, a woman diagnosed with breast cancer may be worried about her daughter's risk. Family physicians often build relationships with their patients over many years, and in many cases, know something about their relatives, giving them insights that oncologists couldn't be expected to have, Mueller said.

“It's the longitudinal, consistent relationship that we have,” she said.

It's important to check for changes in both your patients' family history and the guidelines for screening, Denlinger said. For example, a history done several years ago may not reflect recent diagnoses of cancer in a patient's family. There also are newer genetic tests, such as those for pancreatic cancer risks, that may be suitable for patients, she said.

Epidemiological studies have revealed a strong correlation between red meat consumption and the development of inflammatory bowel disease. In a new study published in Molecular Nutrition and Food Research that was conducted in mice, red meat consumption caused an imbalance of bacteria in the intestinal microbiota. 

Investigators fed mice various kinds of red meat including pork, beef, and mutton for two weeks, and then they induced inflammation in the colon. Intake of these three red meat diets exacerbated colonic inflammation. Analyses revealed an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and infiltration of immune cells in the colon of mice fed red meat diets. 

These diets led to a marked decrease in the relative abundance of Streptococcus, Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, and Lactococcus bacterial strains, coupled with an increase in Clostridium and Mucispirillum. 

This study contributes to improving food innervation approaches for inflammatory bowel disease treatment and indicates a close crosstalk among diet, gut microbiota, and intestinal immunity."

Researchers have shown that there is strong evidence that e-cigarette use may act as a gateway to cigarette smoking and other health issues in young people.

A review of reviews has revealed that there is a consistent link between e-cigarette use and later cigarette smoking, as well as potential links between vaping and a range of health issues, including asthma, mental health concerns, and drug use.

Researchers, from the University of York and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), argue that more research is needed to determine whether there is a direct cause and effect, but the consistency of the findings between the studies conducted so far provide a strong case for precautionary policies, such as restricting youth access to e-cigarettes and strengthening public education efforts.

Our previous reviews have shown that commonly used marketing strategies for e-cigarettes on social media networks resulted in more young people vaping, and this new review looks at what happens when vaping is a regular practice. 

The consistency in the evidence is striking. Across multiple studies, young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke in the future. These findings support stronger public health measures to protect teens from the risks associated with vaping."

Su Golder, Associate Professor in Health Science, University of York

Researchers not only showed an increased smoking risk, but that young people who once vaped, may go on to smoke more frequently and intensely. The review also found that vaping in young people often is followed by alcohol and marijuana use.

A number of studies showed links between e-cigarette use and asthma, coughing, and airway irritation, and experts highlighted that the associated risk of depression and suicidal thoughts in teens, needed more research to better inform on the mental health risks of vaping.

Many young people report signs of nicotine dependence, including cravings and difficulty quitting, but despite concerns about nicotine's effects on the adolescent brain, very few reviews have examined this issue.

Dr Greg Hartwell, Clinical Assistant Professor at the London School of Hygiene Tropical Medicine, said: "Our review provides the most comprehensive picture to date on the range of risks vaping poses to young people. In particular, we found consistent evidence around transitions to smoking which of course, in turn, opens the door to the multitude of harms that conventional cigarettes bring."

Researchers are also calling for urgent, longitudinal research into e-cigarettes and areas such as brain development, cardiovascular impacts, oral health, and dual use of e-cigarettes and tobacco.

The research is published in the journal Tobacco Control.

Teaching about periods in schools is still too focused on basic biological facts with insufficient information around how menstruation can affect a woman's mood and wellbeing, problems associated with menstrual bleeding and the impact on physical and academic performance, concludes a new study by UCL (University College London) researchers.

The survey and focus group-based research, published in the academic journal Women's Health, also suggests that periods should be taught amongst mixed sex groups as well as single sex at both primary and secondary schools, something which some schools don't currently do.

Sex (also known as relationships) education has been compulsory in English primary and secondary schools since 2020, and earlier this year was updated to include topics such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and heavy menstrual bleeding. Sex education, including on periods, is also compulsory in Welsh schools, but isn't in Scotland.

But, the researchers say, for many pupils in Britain, that amounts to just two lessons about periods in their whole school career, one in primary school and one in secondary school.

Now the academics behind the UCL study are calling for lessons on periods in British schools to be much more comprehensive.

Professor Joyce Harper (UCL Institute for Women's Health) said: "Educating pupils about periods may now be compulsory in schools in England and Wales, but we know that for many of them that still only amounts to two lessons in their entire school career.

"Our survey suggests that those lessons are still very much concerned with the basic biological facts around menstruation – what we and the women who participated in our study are calling for is that lessons on menstruation need to be much more comprehensive, and cover everything from what effect periods can have on a girl or woman's well-being and academic and sporting performance, to what abnormal bleeding looks like.

"Our focus groups were also of the view that boys need to be part of that education. It was agreed that classes should not be segregated by gender, believing mixed sessions are crucial for boys' education.

"Although some saw value in single-sex classes to allow students to speak more freely, they still felt mixed sessions were essential to improve overall understanding.

"They suggested this could help boys understand and support their friends and future partners through menopause.

"Through work with the International Reproductive Health Education Collaboration and Wellbeing of Women, we are providing teachers with resources to support teaching about menstruation."

Fifty-five women took part in the study divided into two groups based on age: 26 women aged 18 to 25 and 29 women aged 26 to 40. Five focus groups were conducted for each group.

They were recruited via the researchers' social media accounts and on that basis the scientists believe they were mostly living in the UK. Many were educated before the topic on menstruation became mandatory in English and Welsh schools.

As part of the survey each participant was asked the following questions: how do you feel about having a period?; how does your period affect your well-being?; how do you manage your period and menstrual cycle, and what support do you need (e.g. food, exercise, period trackers, work)? Do you talk to your friends or partner?; and how could we improve education around menstruation, and how was your education at school?

One participant pointed to a serious lack of education around periods:

"The priority should be to teach the practical application of these hormonal changes; how might we expect these changes to affect our mood, social battery, physical performance and academic performance throughout the month."

In their report, the researchers said that menstruation continues to be "highly stigmatised" and that a "lack of education and normalisation of difficult periods restricts individuals from seeking help".

Co-author Caroline Musulin (UCL Institute for Women's Health), who conducted the 18-25-year-old study group, said: "Many women endure menstrual problems longer than they should due to the inability to speak openly about uncertainties, fears of being dismissed by healthcare professionals, the view that it's 'just' a painful period or feelings of shame.

"Stigma, secrecy, and the expectation to 'cope' with painful periods contribute to the systemic dismissal of menstrual discomfort.

"Strict behavioural expectations to conceal menstruation and resource limitations contribute to negative experiences, where dissatisfaction with menstrual practices and management environments exist, along with feelings of disgust if participants feel they have failed to manage their menstruation discreetly."

Co-author Dr. Natania Yeshitila (UCL Institute for Women's Health) who conducted the 26-40- year-old study group, said: "The participants felt very strongly that this was missing from the education they had received.

"Many believed normal physiological processes, like vaginal discharge, were abnormal. The lack of education on how external factors, such as stress and contraceptive methods, can impact menstrual cycles was another point of confusion."

The recruitment via social media and word of mouth may have introduced sampling bias by attracting people of a similar demographic to the researchers.

Also, the study only included cisgender women and further studies need to be conducted on gender-diverse individuals, the researchers said.

Scientists at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Munich, Germany, use 4 PIPETBOY GENIUS serological pipet controllers from INTEGRA Biosciences to streamline their cell culture workflows. These ergonomic devices support fast and precise serological pipetting, while the aliquoting function makes repetitive tasks more comfortable for users.

The department at the Institute of Biochemistry has around 35 staff, with one-third of them working across 2 cell culture labs, handling a variety of mammalian and stem cell lines. The department recently acquired 4 PIPETBOY GENIUS serological pipet controllers to further enhance the accuracy, precision and speed of its liquid handling workflows. Albert Ries, a laboratory technician at the institute, explained the benefits of the new repeat dispense function, which works in combination with INTEGRA serological pipets:

We really appreciate the repeat dispensing function, which we've found incredibly useful; it's so convenient to simply press a button and dispense multiple aliquots from a single aspiration. We don't have to read the volume every time, and filling wells is fast and accurate. Of the many pipetting aids I worked with, PIPETBOY GENIUS controllers are the most sensitive to variations in finger pressure, giving us extremely fine control over dispensing speeds and liquid flow. This is very helpful for avoiding damage to delicate cell monolayers or loss of valuable reagents and unwanted mixing between neighboring wells due to spill-over when filling small multiwell plates."

Albert Ries, Laboratory Technician, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry

Ergonomics is also a priority for Albert and his team: "We often spend hours at the bench pipetting, so having equipment that makes the process more comfortable and efficient is essential for reducing our mental and physical fatigue. The PIPETBOY GENIUS is incredibly light, and I'm impressed that INTEGRA managed to fit all its advanced features into such a compact design. The company's engineers really took the time to talk with people who work with cell cultures and observe what we actually need. It has significantly improved our workflow and become popular across the cell culture labs. I'd recommend it to anyone in the field," Albert concluded.

Scientists say rising climate disasters could act as hidden childhood traumas, reshaping brain development and fueling mental health crises without urgent global action.

Researchers in Australia and Nepal warn that extreme climatic and weather events (ECEs) pose serious, long-term mental health risks to children by causing toxic stress driven by neglect, family separation, poverty, and displacement. Their perspective article is published in the journal Communications Medicine.

Although direct neurobiological evidence remains limited, emerging evidence, such as the Generation R study, shows links between extreme temperatures, reduced brain connectivity, and impaired white matter development, and parallels with research on childhood trauma show that repeated ECEs elevate risks to mental health and disrupt development.

Water scarcity isn't just physical: Beyond causing disease, ECEs like droughts create profound psychological distress linked to distrust of water sources and reliance on expensive or unsafe alternatives, adding another layer of toxic stress.

ECEs such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, floods, and storms are increasing in frequency and severity due to climate change. Beyond causing immediate harm like malnutrition, injury, and disease, they also act as traumatic stressors that disrupt children's sense of security and stability.

These events can trigger post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, and even contribute to long-term physical conditions such as cardiovascular disease. Between 1990 and 2023, an average of 364 ECEs occurred annually, affecting 400 million people and displacing 26 million, with children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) disproportionately impacted due to limited resources.

Traditionally, research on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), harmful or traumatic events occurring within the family, such as parental instability, abuse, and neglect, has focused on family-based trauma. However, newer frameworks like TRACEs (Traumatic and Adverse Childhood Experiences), which include both family and broader societal trauma, expand this to include community- and society-level adversities.

Still, environmental stressors like ECEs remain underrepresented, despite their ability to produce toxic stress responses similar to ACEs, particularly during sensitive developmental stages.

The authors introduce environmentally driven ACEs (E-ACEs), emphasizing their distinct impact on children's lifelong mental and physical health. Recognizing E-ACEs underscores the urgent need for resilience-building interventions specific to the growing threat of climate-related events.

Displacement hits hardest where resources are scarce: Over 383 million people displaced by climate disasters from 2008-2023 came specifically from low- and middle-income countries – regions least equipped to support affected children.

E-ACEs describe the stress children endure from direct exposure to repeated or intense climate and weather events or from indirect consequences like displacement, poverty, family separation, and violence. Evidence, though still limited, suggests that such experiences can disrupt neurodevelopment.

For example, studies link high temperatures and early exposure to extreme weather with changes in brain connectivity and impaired white matter growth. These disruptions may parallel the neurobiological effects of traditional ACEs, which are known to alter brain development, immune function, and stress regulation.

ECEs can overwhelm children's sense of safety, triggering toxic stress responses that increase risks of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and behavioral problems.

Indirect pathways, including food insecurity, unstable caregiving, and loss of livelihoods, may further amplify biological effects by dysregulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and heightening inflammation, with evidence pointing to elevated cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-2 that are linked to long-term vulnerability to mental disorders and chronic diseases.

Repeated exposure shows cumulative, dose-response effects, with risks escalating alongside the number and severity of ECEs, patterns similar to those found in ACE research. Protective factors, such as strong family support, can buffer these outcomes.

However, most existing evidence comes from high-income countries, leaving major gaps in understanding E-ACEs in LMICs. Case studies, such as urban displacement into Dhaka's overcrowded slums, highlight how climate refugees face compounded risks, including neglect, violence, and lack of access to education and healthcare.

Inflammation could be a hidden long-term culprit: Research suggests chronic stress from E-ACEs might persistently elevate inflammatory markers (like IL-6), potentially damaging developing brains and setting the stage for adult physical illnesses.

The authors argue that strengthening resilience, defined as the ability to adapt and recover from adversity, is central to protecting children from E-ACEs. Resilience must go beyond individual traits like coping skills and self-control, since climate-related stressors are often systemic and prolonged. Instead, multi-level approaches that combine family, community, and institutional support are recommended.

At the family and community level, strong social ties, supportive parenting, stable caregiving, and peer networks can buffer children from the psychological toll of repeated climate shocks. When these supports are compromised, alternative structures such as schools, community organizations, religious groups, non-governmental organizations, and government child protection services become vital.

Programs that integrate mental health care, social support, and economic recovery, such as microfinancing, vocational training, and sustainable agriculture, can reduce both stressors and vulnerability. Schools can also foster resilience through trauma-informed teaching, social-emotional learning, and climate education.

Community-based mental health programs demonstrate the effectiveness of layered, culturally grounded psychosocial care that involves local leaders, health workers, and digital tools. Examples include India's NIMHANS psychosocial care model, which mobilizes local leaders, health workers, and volunteers, and the COPEWELL resilience framework in the US that integrates health systems, social capital, and emergency response planning. However, the authors caution that frameworks like COPEWELL remain largely untested in LMICs and will require local adaptation before they can be scaled.

However, most initiatives remain short-term and underfunded. The authors emphasize the need for transformational resilience by building systems that adapt and grow stronger against future crises, particularly in LMICs.

Most resilience programs aren't built for chronic climate stress: Existing support often focuses on short-term disaster recovery, lacking strategies for the persistent "overwhelming toxic stress" caused by repeated ECEs compounding ACEs.

With ECEs becoming more frequent and severe, the authors warn that these events could increasingly act as E-ACEs, disrupting brain development, stress regulation, and immune function, with long-term risks for mental and physical health.

In LMICs, rising displacement and urban poverty may further amplify these adversities. However, children and communities with strong social networks and access to resources show greater resilience, highlighting the importance of investing in family and community support, trauma-informed mental health services, and resilience-building interventions.

The authors stress that addressing E-ACEs requires coordinated action across local, national, and global levels, with wealthier nations playing a key role in supporting vulnerable populations.

A new study from the University of Alabama at Birmingham reveals that an antibody originally designed to fight dengue virus may also block the spread of Zika virus in vulnerable areas of the body - including the reproductive organs. The findings, published today in the Journal of Virology, offer new hope in the fight against a virus that has affected more than 80 countries since 2007 and poses serious risks to pregnant women and their babies.

What makes Zika especially dangerous is its ability to hide in protected areas of the body, including the brain, eyes and reproductive organs, where it can linger undetected. Even more troubling, Zika can be passed through sex or from a pregnant mother to her baby, potentially leading to severe birth defects.

In this new study, led by J. Victor Garcia, Ph.D., and Angela Wahl, Ph.D., in the Department of Microbiology at UAB, scientists tested the effectiveness of the C10 dengue virus antibody using a novel preclinical in vivo model. They found that a single dose of C10 administered before Zika virus exposure:

Our work lays the foundation for deploying passive immunization strategies in high-risk populations. This could be a game-changer in outbreak response, especially in regions where Zika is endemic or resurging."

Researchers evaluated the antiviral compound DFMA (7-deaza-2'-C-methyladenosine), which significantly reduced viremia and prolonged survival in a preclinical model.

"This study provides compelling evidence that antibody-based therapies can be used to reduce systemic infection and target the very tissues where Zika hides and causes the most damage," Wahl said. "This is especially important for protecting pregnant individuals and preventing sexual transmission during future outbreaks."

Currently, there are no approved treatments for Zika virus. This research marks a significant step toward developing effective countermeasures against future outbreaks.

Other collaborating institutions in this study include the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Emory University.

Funding for this study was provided by the National Institutes of Health grant AI106695 (R.S.B.).

Researchers at the University of Missouri are on a mission to help patients recover from hip surgery with less pain, and they may have found an innovative solution: using the patient's own cartilage cells.

Molly Jones, a Mizzou medical student, contributed to a recent Mizzou study aimed at helping those with a hip issue known as femoral acetabular impingement (FAI). Those with FAI have a bony bump called a CAM lesion that constantly scrapes and grinds into the hip socket, causing pain and joint problems.

Currently, doctors remove the CAM lesion - which is covered in cartilage - from the hip through surgery, and the cartilage is typically thrown away. But at Mizzou, Jones and her team are asking whether that cartilage, once removed, can be grown in a lab and eventually reimplanted into the patient's hip to aid in healing.

In the study, the research team collected cartilage removed during hip surgeries. They discovered that cartilage cells, or chondrocytes, can be cultured and expanded in the lab, opening the door to future clinical applications.

This scientific breakthrough could one day enable surgeons to return lab-grown cartilage to the hip joint, potentially reducing pain and accelerating post-operative recovery. The research symbolizes Mizzou's pursuit of cutting-edge, next-generation medicine.

It's exciting to be a part of innovative medical research that can help doctors treat pain and ultimately improve the quality of life for people struggling with FAI. As a former college golfer who has had wrist surgery, I have always been interested in the anatomy of bones and joints. This research furthers my interest in orthopaedic surgery."

Molly Jones, a Mizzou medical student

Jones is currently completing her clinical training in Springfield, Missouri, as part of her third year at Mizzou's School of Medicine. The study was conducted in the Thompson Regenerative Orthopaedic Lab at the Missouri Orthopaedic Institute on Mizzou's campus, in partnership with Steven DeFroda, an orthopaedic surgeon in the School of Medicine.

"The faculty at Mizzou are very collaborative and support students interested in research," Jones said. "It makes me proud to be at Mizzou, and I'm excited about where this research can go moving forward."

"Viability of chondrocytes harvested during treatment of hip femoroacetabular impingement" was published in Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery.

Wrexham are eyeing a move for Rennes star Jordan James after a disappointing start to their Championship 2025-26 campaign. The Red Dragons spent heavily in the transfer market in the summer to rebuild their squad, but lost their opening two matches against Southampton and West Brom. Thus, the Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney-owned side are now preparing to make further additions to bolster their team.

ATLANTA (Aug. 20, 2025) – U.S. Soccer will celebrate the contributions of U.S. Men's National Team legend Michael Bradley in a pregame ceremony ahead of USA-Korea Republic, presented by Haleon, on Saturday, Sept. 6, at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, N.J. (5 p.m. ET on TNT, Telemundo, HBO Max, Universo, and Peacock). Fans can purchase tickets for the game here.

Bradley, who retired from professional soccer in 2023, compiled 151 international caps which stands as third most in USMNT history behind Cobi Jones and Landon Donovan. His 141 career starts (141) ranks second, one behind Donovan, and he's tied for third all-time in appearances in World Cup Qualifying (40). He captained the U.S. team a total of 48 times.

The 2015 U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year is a two-time Concacaf Gold Cup champion (2007, 2017), earning the 2017 Concacaf Gold Cup Golden Ball, the award presented to the best player in the tournament. He also made the Concacaf Men's Best XI in 2015, 2017 and 2019.

As part of the initiative to acknowledge outstanding achievement throughout the Federation, U.S. Soccer is formally honoring senior Men's and Women's National Team players upon their retirement from professional soccer who earned at least 100 caps and appeared on the roster of two world championships, which includes World Cups and Olympic Games. This recognition is given to players retiring in 2019 and after.

A native of Princeton, N.J., Bradley was part of the USA squads at the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, serving as a starting central midfielder in both tournaments. At the 2010 World Cup, Bradley scored the equalizer in group play against Slovenia, which brought the U.S. back from a 2-0 deficit. Overall, Bradley played with the USMNT from 2006-2019 and recorded 17 international goals. In addition, his 23 career assists ranks second all-time only behind Landon Donovan. The 2007 U.S. Soccer Young Male Player of the Year was a member of the 2008 U.S. Men's Olympic Team.

Along with a stellar international career, Bradley had great success in Major League Soccer and Europe. Bradley started his career in the MLS when he was drafted by the MetroStars in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. Then in 2006, he became the youngest MLS player to be sold when he was transferred to Dutch club Heerenveen. In January 2008, Bradley broke the record for the most goals scored in a single season by an American soccer player playing in a European first division with 18. 

Bradley moved to Bundesliga side Borussia Mönchengladbach, then was sent to Aston Villa on loan, making one FA Cup appearance. He then joined Italian Serie A club Chievo, and then AS Roma in 2012. In January 2014, Roma sold Bradley to Toronto FC in MLS. Bradley made over 250 appearances with Toronto FC, winning the MLS Cup and Supporters Shield as captain in 2017. 

Bradley is now the head coach of the Red Bulls II, and this ceremony will take place at the Red Bulls' home stadium.

Less than a year away from the start of the tournament, FIFA has announced the official ticket sale date… and it's sooner than you think.







 Sofia Delpueche -  Staff Writer				•
August 20, 2025


Every four years, the top national teams from a select group of countries faces off in an unprecedented sporting battle, competing for the ultimate prize in one of the world's most popular sports: soccer. In less than a year, on June 11, 2026, the United States, Canada, and Mexico will host the tournament, which this time will feature 48 teams, 104 matches, and 16 host cities.

The official ticket sale date for the different matches is set for September 10, 2025. But there's an important detail. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, the first phase is open only to Visa credit cardholders, called the “Visa Presale Draw.” From Sept. 10 to Sept. 19, Visa cardholders can enter the lottery for the chance to buy World Cup match tickets. It's the first of several release phases.

To enter the ticket lottery, applicants must first create a “FIFA ID” at FIFA.com/tickets. The application form will be available during the 10-day window from September 10 to 19. Winners will be selected in a random draw, with notifications starting September 30. 

Those selected will receive an assigned date and time in October to purchase tickets, subject to availability. It's not yet clear which matches will be available in this round, but FIFA says more details on the presale will be released in the coming weeks.

According to the specialized media outlet Marca, once the draw stage is over, the remaining tickets will go on sale on a first-come, first-served basis, where speed and punctuality will be key. It is advisable to log in a few minutes before the official start, as tickets sell out quickly due to global demand.

Subsequently, the official resale phase will open, managed directly by FIFA, allowing fans to purchase tickets that have been returned by other buyers in a secure environment. In all phases, a FIFA ID is still required, and only verified payment methods, such as international credit or debit cards, will be accepted.

Italy's national football team are due to play Israel in two World Cup qualifiers ahead of the 2026 tournament.

The Italian Football Coaches' Association (AIAC) is pushing for Israel to be suspended from international competition over the war on Gaza.

Ahead of Italy's crucial World Cup qualifiers against Israel in the next two months, the AIAC says “Israel must stop. Football must also take action.”

The AIAC has written a formal letter to the Italian football federation, to be forwarded to European and world football's governing bodies, calling for Israel to be suspended.

“The AIAC Board of Directors unanimously believes that, given the daily massacres, which have also resulted in hundreds of deaths among managers, coaches, and athletes … it is legitimate, necessary, indeed a duty, to place at the centre of federation talks the request, to be submitted to UEFA and FIFA, for the temporary exclusion of Israel from sporting competitions,” the letter concludes.

“Because the pain of the past cannot cloud anyone's conscience and humanity.”

Italy is set to play Israel on neutral turf in Debrecen, Hungary on September 8, before hosting the return match in Udine on October 14.

“We could just focus on playing, looking the other way. But we believe that is not right,” AIAC vice president Giancarlo Camolese said.

The Azzurri also played Israel in Udine last October in a Nations League match that saw protests before and during the game and intense security measures, including snipers on the roof of the stadium.

Since then, the situation has continued to deteriorate, with the Palestinian death toll from the 22-month war passing 62,000 earlier this month.

“The world is in flames. Many people like the Palestinians are suffering,” AIAC vice president Francesco Perondi said. “Indifference is unacceptable.”

German tabloid Bild recently reported that Bundesliga 2 football side Fortuna Dusseldorf pulled out of signing Israel international striker Shon Weissman in response to fan anger about his social media posts on the Gaza war.

The Israel FA have released a statement after Norway announced it would donate profits from the upcoming 2026 World Cup qualifier between the two nations to 'a humanitarian cause' in Gaza.

The two nations will face off in Oslo on October 11.

Norway are currently top of Group H having won all four of their games, with Israel in second on six points from three matches.

With Italy three points further back in third but with two games in hand on Norway, the outcome of the match could prove pivotal in deciding who will qualify automatically for the World Cup.

Norway's successes so far include a 3-0 win over Italy in June, and a 4-2 win away against Israel in March.

In the build-up to tickets going on sale for the fixture, the Norwegian Football Federation has announced that it will donate all of the profits to a 'humanitarian cause' in the Palestinian territory of Gaza.

Over 80,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023, including 17,000 children, as per the Gaza health ministry.

The situation in the territory has been described as increasingly dire, and the United Nations have stressed that Gaza has hit two out of the three famine thresholds for food consumption and acute malnutrition.

Advert

It has urged for significantly more humanitarian aid to be allowed to enter Gaza, describing the current crisis as 'a disaster unfolding in front of our eyes'.

Now, Norwegian FA president Lise Klaveness has stated: "Neither we nor other organisations can have an indifferent attitude to the humanitarian suffering and the disproportionate attacks that the civilian population in Gaza has been subjected to for a long time.

"Israel is part of FIFA's and UEFA's competitions and we must deal with that. But we want to give the profits to a humanitarian organisation that saves lives in Gaza every day and that contributes with active emergency aid on the ground."

In December, Klaveness called for 'an immediate halt to the disproportionate attacks on innocent civilians in Gaza'. 

Advert

The Israel FA has now released a scathing statement on the matter to The Telegraph.

The statement reads: "We do not usually advise associations regarding the use of match revenue, even if it is obtained thanks to a match against our proud national team, but we will deviate from our custom this time.

"It would be nice if some of the amount were directed to try to finding a condemnation by the Norwegian FA of the October 7 massacre that claimed the lives of hundreds of Israeli citizens and children, or action in favour of the release of 50 hostages - and please, make sure that the money is not transferred to terrorist organisations or to whale hunting.

"We are also aiming to gain three points."

While the 2026 World Cup qualifiers are only just getting underway in Europe, they have almost reached their completion in Asia.

Palestine - most of whose squad now play domestic football outside of the nation - made it to the third round but finished fifth in their six-team group over 10 matches, with the bottom two teams unable to progress further in the competition.

They drew 1-1 to Oman in their final fixture via a controversial injury-time penalty, which knocked them out and sent Oman through. The Palestine FA called the penalty decision 'clearly unfair'.

                  The one placed inside the Oval Office is the third version of the FIFA Club World Cup trophy in “recognition of the 2025 tournament's exceptional hosts”, FIFA told BBC Sport.

When the White House posted a picture of USA President Donald Trump inside the Oval Office, football fans were quick to notice the FIFA Club World Cup trophy.

The FIFA Club World Cup, whose inaugural edition was held in the United States earlier in July, saw Chelsea win the trophy after beating Paris Saint-Germain in the final.

So, the main question that has arisen is why the trophy, won by Enzo Maresca's Chelsea, is in the Oval Office instead of Stamford Bridge -- Chelsea's home stadium?

After the FIFA Club World Cup final in July, President Trump said that he was told that he could keep the trophy in recognition of the United States hosting the month-long tournament.

“I said, ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy?' [They said] ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one',” Trump said in an interview with DAZN.

“And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.”



                            Chelsea's Reece James holds the trophy as he celebrates with teammates and US President Donald Trump after Chelsea won against Paris St Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup final, at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on July 13, 2025.

Amidst all the confusion, FIFA has cleared the air.

World football's governing body has said that there are three Club World Cup trophies in existence. The original engraved version is placed in FIFA's headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, as is the custom with all FIFA trophies - including the World Cup.

One replica of the Club World Cup trophy is with Chelsea, which the champion paraded after its pre-season friendly match against AC Milan.

The one placed inside the Oval Office is the third version of the FIFA Club World Cup trophy in “recognition of the 2025 tournament's exceptional hosts”, FIFA told BBC Sport.

Chelsea fans have claimed they have spotted Noni Madueke's missing Club World Cup medal in the White House, as Donald Trump hosted European leaders this week.

The US president hosted Ukraine peace talks on Monday, with British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer joining French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb around the Resolute Desk.

They were joined by by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Amid the seriousness of the talks, football fans saw the lighter side by initially pointing out the presence of the FIFA Club World Cup trophy in the background.

The US hosted the tournament last month with Chelsea emerging as the winners by beating reigning European champions PSG 3-0 in the final.

Trump later revealed that the Blues had received a replica of the trophy, with the real one residing in the Oval Office.

Having spotted the trophy, fans have now speculated that they have been able to see a winner's medal next to the trophy.

Footage from the trophy presentation showed that Trump had received a medal from FIFA President Gianni Infantino, after the US president had distributed the honours to the Chelsea squad.

Trump had been seen holding onto the medal, before placing it into his pocket after making his way off the stage.

Fans had speculated at the time the spare medal had initially belonged to England winger Madueke, who had initially been part of Chelsea's squad at the tournament.

Madueke had flown home during the competition to complete a £52million move to Arsenal and had therefore not been part of the trophy presentation.

Chelsea defender Marc Cucurella recently contributed to the theory when asked about Madueke's medal.

'He [Trump] put it in his pocket,' the Spaniard stated. 'He has it there in the White House, very well placed.'

Having seen an item located next to the World Cup Club trophy in the White House, fans have now claimed it is the medal that should have been presented to Madueke.

'That's Madueke's medal,' one fan wrote, after highlighting the gold object next to the trophy.

'Zoom the club world cup trophy and you go see Madueke's medal there,' another wrote.

'Noni's medal is trapped in the White House,' added a third.

'Madueke's world cup medal just casually on display in Trump's office is frying me,' another added.

Daily Mail Sport, however, recently revealed that Madueke was expected to be mailed a Club World Cup's winners' medal.

Trump's overall involvement in the Club World Cup ceremony came as a surprise to Chelsea players as they celebrated winning the tournament last month.

As the players danced around at the MetLife Stadium, Trump continued to stand among them clapping and smiling, much to the confusion of just about everybody - especially Cole Palmer. 

Cucurella recently revealed his surprise, telling Spanish journalist Gerard Romero: 'We had been told that, as a rule, Donald Trump would come to present us with the trophy and that we couldn't lift it until he left.

'And of course, we were all there waiting for him to leave, but the guy didn't want to leave, and on top of that, we looked at him and he said, "Get him up, I'll stay here, and so on."

'And I wondered who would say anything to him, you know... I was scared s***less!'

Trump had been given VIP treatment as he soaked up the action alongside First Lady Melania and FIFA President Gianni Infantino during the final at the MetLife Stadium.

But Trump's crowning moment came after the final whistle when he took centre stage as the trophy was given to Chelsea.

It was anticipated that Trump would step aside after giving the trophy to Chelsea captain James - as is customary. 

However, to the bewilderment of many Chelsea players, Trump remained on stage for the entire trophy lift.

Palmer had been visibly confused with the England star spotted saying 'What's he doing?' to his team-mates. 

Speaking afterwards, the England star was honest but slightly more measured than his facial contortions had suggested. 

'I knew he was going to be here but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy so I was a bit confused, yeah,' he said.

Trump had earlier presented Palmer with the golden ball award with the 23-year-old midfielder looking as equally baffled during that presentation.

After presenting medals to both the victors and losers, the Trump was front and centre as the Blues hoisted the trophy.

Following his presentation of the trophy to Chelsea, he was asked to leave the stage by Infantino but bizarrely chose to stay put.

Refusing to play or train can often help a wantaway footballer force through a transfer - but it doesn't always work out that way...

Newcastle ace Alexander Isak trying to force through a move to Liverpool has unquestionably been the story of the 2025 summer transfer window, and it's still unclear whether the forward will be at St. James' Park, Anfield or still sitting at home when the transfer window closes on September 1.

The Swede refused to go on the Magpies' pre-season tour of Asia, preferring instead to train alone in San Sebastian, while he played no part in his team's Premier League opener against Aston Villa last weekend. He also upped the ante on Monday by accusing his employers of breaking promises and arguing that a parting of the ways is now the best - and only - option for everyone involved.

Newcastle, though, have shown little sign of softening their stance that Isak is not for sale - particularly as they've already failed to sign so many potential replacements. But, as GOAL outlines below, when it comes to players going on strike, one can never be quite sure how things are going to pan out...

When the White House posted a picture of US President Donald Trump meeting with world leaders in the Oval Office at the White House this week, eagle-eyed football fans spotted an unlikely piece of silverware in pride of place.

The Club World Cup trophy, which Chelsea beat Paris St-Germain to win in July in New Jersey, can be seen on display, external in the president's office in Washington DC.

The image led many on social media to question why 'Chelsea's trophy' resides in one of the most important offices in the world weeks after Enzo Maresca's side lifted it at Metlife Stadium.

Following the final in July, President Trump said he was told he could keep the trophy in recognition of the United States hosting the month-long tournament.

"I said, 'When are you going to pick up the trophy?' [They said] 'We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one'," he said in an interview with DAZN.

"And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now."

But, according to Fifa, that is not quite the case. There are in fact three Club World Cup trophies in existence.

The original engraved version is in Zurich, Switzerland, at Fifa's headquarters, as is the custom with all Fifa trophies - including the World Cup.

One replica belongs to Chelsea and the holders paraded it during a pre-season friendly against AC Milan.

It is the third version that lives in the Oval Office in "recognition of the 2025 tournament's exceptional hosts", Fifa told BBC Sport.

The Club World Cup, which was held across 11 cities in the US, was called the "world's most successful club competition" by organisers.

But it also came under criticism for its low attendances - there were more than a million empty seats during the tournament - and for the weather conditions and quality of the pitches in the US.

In an unusual incident, Trump presented Chelsea with the trophy but remained on stage after the presentation and celebrated with the players, who said they were "a bit confused".

Following the Blues' triumph, Trump presented the trophy to Chelsea captain Reece James before being invited to move aside by Fifa president Gianni Infantino.

But Trump remained alongside James and goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, and applauded as James lifted the trophy, staying in position for a few seconds before he and Infantino left at the rear of the stage.

The United States, along with Canada and Mexico, will jointly host the 2026 men's World Cup next summer.

Here's what you need to know for the first ticket release window.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is nine months away, and until now the only way to get tickets was through expensive hospitality packages. 

That changes Sept. 10, when the first lottery round of tickets will be made available to the public  — with one  catch. The first phase, called the “Visa Presale Draw,” is open only to Visa cardholders. 

From Sept. 10 to Sept. 19, Visa cardholders can enter the lottery for the chance to buy World Cup match tickets. It's the first of several release phases ahead of the 2026 World Cup's opening match on June 11 in Mexico City.

Next year's World Cup will take place in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, including in Philadelphia, where six matches will be played.

“Excitement for the FIFA World Cup 26 is building fast, and Sept. 10 is a date every football fan should have marked in their calendar,” said FIFA chief business officer Romy Gai. “A ticket to the FIFA World Cup isn't just a ticket — it's a gateway to the most inclusive and spectacular tournament in our history."

To enter the ticket lottery, applicants must first create a FIFA ID at FIFA.com/tickets. The application form will be available during the 10-day window from Sept. 10 to 19.



Winners will be selected in a random draw, with notifications starting Sept. 30. Those selected will receive an assigned date and time in October to purchase tickets, subject to availability.

It's not yet clear which matches will be up for grabs in this round — for example, whether Philadelphia fans will be able to buy tickets for games at the Linc. FIFA says more details on the presale will be released in the coming weeks.

“Excitement for the FIFA World Cup 26 is building fast, and Sept. 10 is a date every football fan should have marked in their calendar,” said FIFA chief business officer Romy Gai. “A ticket to the FIFA World Cup isn't just a ticket — it's a gateway to the most inclusive and spectacular tournament in our history."

To enter the ticket lottery, applicants must first create a FIFA ID at FIFA.com/tickets. The application form will be available during the 10-day window from Sept. 10 to 19.



Winners will be selected in a random draw, with notifications starting Sept. 30. Those selected will receive an assigned date and time in October to purchase tickets, subject to availability.

It's not yet clear which matches will be up for grabs in this round — for example, whether Philadelphia fans will be able to buy tickets for games at the Linc. FIFA says more details on the presale will be released in the coming weeks.

Real Madrid will slash their asking price for Arsenal target Rodrygo in the final weeks of the summer transfer window.

The Brazil international's future came under intense scrutiny during the latter stages of last season. 

While reports have suggested the winger is open to staying at the club, his lack of game time has fuelled talk Real could cash in before the end of the month.

Rodrygo started just one of Real's six matches at the Club World Cup, managing a combined total of 92 minutes across the entire competition.

Los Blancos opened their La Liga campaign with a 1-0 win over Osasuna on Tuesday night with the winger again an unused substitute.

Explaining Rodrygo's latest absence, Xabi Alonso said: ‘Nothing's happening. The World Cup was a different context because of the competition. Today it's just a game.

‘What counts is this season. I'm counting on him; there's no need to read too far into the future. If he's still the same in three months, I'll be able to answer.'

Arsenal are huge admirers of Rodrygo and reached out to his representatives in June to discuss a possible move.

The Gunners have since signed Noni Madueke and Viktor Gyokeres in attack but still want to sign a left winger. Mikel Arteta's side also look set to miss out on Eberechi Eze, who is now close to sealing a move to their north London rivals Tottenham.

Real are asking for €100million (£86m) for the 24-year-old with no formal offers put forward at this stage.

But Spanish football expert Guillem Balague reports the club could settle for a smaller fee towards the end of the summer transfer window.

That fee could be as little as €60m to €70m (£51m to £60m) – a relative bargain for a player who has been key to Real's recent successes.

Manchester City have also been among the sides interested in signing the Brazilian this summer as a possible replacement for Savinho.

The 21-year-old only arrived in Manchester but has been the subject of interest from Tottenham. City however are determined to keep the youngster, effectively ending their interest in his countryman Rodrygo.

The Colorado Rapids aren't flinching in the midst of a wild summer transfer window.

The club is in advanced talks to sign U.S. Men's National Team midfielder Paxten Aaronson from Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt, a source told The Denver Post on Tuesday.

The source added that while a transfer fee isn't finalized, it could be a club record that surpasses current Rapids forward Rafael Navarro's $3.5 million mark. Whatever the number turns out to be, most of the funds will come from the club-record $8 million sale of Djordje Mihailovic earlier this month to Toronto.

Aaronson, 21, started his career as a Philadelphia Union product before moving on to Frankfurt, where he went on loan to multiple Dutch clubs to get playing time. He impressed in the Eredivisie, particularly as a member of Utrecht last season, where he scored eight goals and provided four assists in 33 matches.

Last Sunday, he scored as a late sub in a 5-0 rout of Engers in the first round of the German domestic cup DFB-Pokal.

Aaronson returned to Frankfurt after his loan, seemingly ready to make the step toward regular minutes in the Bundesliga, but instead may end up back in the MLS. It's unclear what type of roster slot he'd occupy, but it's possible he'd take the Designated Player slot Mihailovic vacated.

Aaronson is on the brink of good minutes with the USMNT, too. He appeared in two Concacaf Gold Cup matches, including a start with his brother, Brendan, in a group stage loss to Switzerland. That makes the move a bit puzzling, given the drop-off in competition and quality from the Bundesliga to the MLS.

Should the move be finalized and made official, not only will the Rapids have broken inbound and outbound transfer fee records, but they will also exit a turbulent transfer window with a new face of the franchise.

The window started with the departure of center back Chidozie Awaziem, who was the Rapids' best defender at the time. Multiple players went out on loan, then another DP (Kévin Cabral) was waived by the club. The biggest bombshell was Mihailovic's surprise transfer request, which the Rapids complied with and received a major paycheck in return.

Colorado may have made up for Mihailovic's departure with inbound moves, though. The Rapids brought in two solid center backs: Noah Cobb, a young player who has started and impressed in three matches; and Rob Holding, a Premier League-level player who fell out with his former coach at Crystal Palace. On the back line, they traded for Orlando City left back Rafael Santos to provide depth and instigate competition with Sam Vines for the role.

Offensively, they brought Colombian winger Alexis Manyoma on a one-year loan from Argentinian club Estudiantes. And now they are on the verge of adding Aaronson.

The Rapids are in the midst of a playoff push. In just two matches, they've jumped from 10th to seventh in the Western Conference and still have one of the easiest schedules in the league to finish out the campaign.

Holding and Manyoma have yet to debut for the club, and may still have to wait while their P-1 Visa applications are processed and granted. Should the deal for Aaronson go through, that will be three big pieces to integrate in just two months. Time will tell, but the future of life post-Mihailovic may not be so grim for the Rapids after all.

Parks, Recreation and Culture director Luis Ruiz giving a presentation to the Lawrence City Commissioners about raising the Transient Guest Tax on Aug. 19. Commissioners voted 4-1 to raise the TGT from 6% to 8% ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

City commissioners voted Tuesday night to increase the guest tax on hotel or short-term overnight stays in Lawrence by 2 percentage points to capitalize on an increase in visitors expected next summer for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The commission voted 4-1 to increase the transient guest tax from 6% to 8%. The item needed a supermajority of at least four commissioners to pass; Commissioner Amber Sellers was the lone no vote. 

The transient guest tax provides revenue to fund tourism-related initiatives, but Luis Ruiz, the director for the city's Parks, Recreation and Culture department, told commissioners the transient guest tax fund was currently “structurally imbalanced.” In a presentation to the commission, he said that if the tax weren't increased ahead of 2026, the fund would be operating in a deficit by 2027. 

At an increased rate of 8%, however, the city projected that the guest tax fund would receive just under $940,000 in additional tax money and grow its balance.

Part of that growth would come from hundreds of thousands of visitors coming to the Kansas City region for the 2026 World Cup. Six matches will be held in the KC area between June 16 and July 11, including a quarterfinal contest, and there is a possibility that Lawrence could be selected as a base camp for one of the 48 national teams. It's estimated that 600,000 visitors will visit the region during the World Cup.

Ruiz also said that Lawrence's guest tax was lower than those of other cities in the region. Cities such as Overland Park and Mission have a guest tax of 9%, while Shawnee, Merriam, Lenexa, Leawood and Kansas City, Kansas, all are at 8% — and Ruiz said Kansas City, Kansas, was moving to increase its rate during the World Cup to 10%. 

“This is an opportunity to grow without going outside the boundaries of what is common in the marketplace,” Ruiz said. 

Ruiz said that many city leaders have been working with leaders across the region since last October on how Lawrence could capitalize on the increase in visitors from the World Cup, but that there were no funds allocated to help programs aimed at increasing tourism. Ruiz said raising the guest tax could provide “fuel” to execute the plans.

Commissioner Lisa Larsen asked Ruiz how the guest tax fund got out of balance in the first place. Ruiz said some projections in previous budgets were too high, and that when the fund had a larger balance, some of the money was used for things that weren't as related to increasing tourism. Larsen asked Ruiz how the city would make sure that this doesn't happen again; Ruiz said the city would work to ensure that the guest tax dollars went to programs that generated revenue and provided a good return on investment. He said the last large-scale review of how the guest tax money was spent — and what return the city got on it — probably happened in 2010, the last time the tax was raised.

Several people in the hotel industry in Lawrence spoke during the public comment period, calling for more transparency about how the guest tax funds are allocated. Kim Anspach, the executive director for Explore Lawrence, said more transparency around the guest tax would build trust. 

Anspach said tourism is “one of Lawrence's strongest economic engines,” bringing nearly $300 million into the Lawrence economy in the past year. She said the World Cup is a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” for the city in the short term that can set up the city's tourism sector for the long term. And she said it was equally important to put the guest tax fund in a good position so “it can continue to attract visitors and grow the local economy.” 

Sellers asked whether it would be possible to raise the guest tax only on short-term rental units such as Airbnb properties. Randy Larkin, the deputy city attorney, and Rachelle Mathews, the city's finance director, said it would likely be more difficult to make that a possibility. Anspach said that out of the $2.2 million in guest tax money the city collected last year, about $300,000 came from those types of units.

Sellers also felt it would be better to first increase the guest tax to 7.5% instead of 8%, partly because Ruiz said a rate of 7.5% would still get the guest tax fund out of its deficit. Although the rest of the commissioners said they were happy with increasing the tax to 8%, they agreed to another suggestion from Sellers to add in language to re-evaluate the rate in three years.

In other business: 

• Commissioners approved on final reading multiple items to create financial incentives for KU's Gateway project.

As the Journal-World reported, the commission approved on Aug. 12 a major package of financial incentives worth around $94.6 million for the second phase of the project, which would build a hotel that connects to the conference center, new parking, new student housing and space for businesses. Those incentives included creating multiple new taxing districts and entering a development agreement with the university.

The second reading for these items was initially on the commissioners' consent agenda for Tuesday, which is usually approved with one vote, but Sellers asked to pull the items for a separate discussion and vote. 

The items that the commissioners adopted on second and final reading will create new taxing districts — a Tax Increment Financing district and a STAR Bond district — and allow a special sales tax area on campus. The first two items needed a supermajority to pass, and they were approved 5-0 and 4-1, respectively. Sellers was the lone no vote. The special sales tax area passed 3-2, with Sellers and Larsen voting no.

• Commissioners approved a rezoning request that will allow a 33-unit apartment complex to be built on a vacant lot on McDonald Drive.

As part of its consent agenda, the commission unanimously approved the request to rezone 1.32 acres of land at 515 McDonald Drive from a mixed-use district to a high-density residential district. The Planning Commission voted 6-2 in July to recommend the rezoning, as the Journal-World reported, citing the need for more housing in Lawrence.

As the Journal-World reported, longtime Lawrence developer Doug Compton and Lawrence-based Adams Architects had filed plans for a two-building apartment complex on the 1.32-acre site, which once housed a hotel until that building was destroyed by a fire in 2018.

U.S. Open

Begins

live

Updated 3m ago

A star-studded and revamped U.S. Open mixed doubles has reached the semifinals, with the final also tonight in New York.

Four pairs remain in contention for the $1 million top prize after the opening matches at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

It's Świątek/Ruud (3) vs. Pegula/Draper in the first semi on Arthur Ashe — before champions Errani/Vavassori vs. Collins/Harrison.

As teed up by Michael, here are the last 10 winners of the U.S. Open men's singles title…

Who goes to the top of this list in little more than a fortnight's time? Let us know your thoughts with an email to: live@theathletic.com

Alongside this re-formatted mixed doubles, the men's and women's singles qualification tournaments are also taking place during Fan Week, which runs until Thursday.

It is then a few days off before the U.S. Open gets fully underway on Sunday. Who will add their name — possibly not for the first time — to the recent roll call of singles winners?

Yes, I'm looking at you Carlos Alcaraz... 

Lastly from us and the iconic bronze plaques on the Court of Champions, is one of the most decorated players the sport has ever seen. 

Known for her powerful left-handed serve, prowess around the net and her aggression on the court, Martina Navratilova was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2000. 

As her dedication outside Arthur Ashe Stadium reads:

💬 “With fiery determination and an unrelenting attack, Martina climbed the game's highest peaks by amassing an incredible 15 U.S. Open championships including four singles titles. 

“The Czech-born champ's stirring on-court achievements raised the sport to new heights. 

“Becoming a U.S. citizen, Martina went on a remarkable run reaching five consecutive U.S. Open singles finals and her Open Era achievements may never be surpassed.”

The winner of 22 grand slam titles — the most in the Open Era before another legend in Serena Williams — Steffi Graf is one of the most dominant players in tennis history.

As proof, she is the only player to win all four Grand Slams and an Olympic gold medal in the same year, doing so in 1988. As it states on Graf's bronze plaque:

💬 “Powerfully athletic, ‘Steffi' brought an explosive presence to women's tennis — equally commanding and intimidating, her game was built upon remarkable speed and a forehand that vanquished opponents with its power and consistency. 

“The German won her first U.S. Open singles title in 1988 at the age of 19, finishing the rare Grand Slam. Her five U.S. Open singles titles stretched over nine years. She was also a singles finalist on three occasions.”

Still a familiar face in New York City, John McEnroe's tennis career was defined by his flair for the dramatic and a sense of style that was equally dazzling. 

While he accumulated a Hall of Fame resume, McEnroe seemed to take his play to another level every time he came back to New York for the U.S. Open, winning four singles titles... 

💬 “Combining a velvet touch with blast-furnace style, New York's ‘Johnny Mac' electrified his hometown courts with ferocity and fire. 

“McEnroe was driven to exceed, his volleys as fierce and unyielding as his personality; his swooping left-handed serve deceptively oppressive. 

“A master at singles as well as doubles, McEnroe won three consecutive U.S. Open singles titles, 1979-80-81, becoming the first man to do so since Bill Tilden in the 1920s. He also won four U.S. Open titles in doubles to complement his four singles titles.”

Known for his powerful ball-striking ability, Pete Sampras is tied for the second-most men's U.S. Open singles wins ever (five). He is also one of the most dominant players ever on grass, winning seven Wimbledon titles....

💬 “With quiet confidence, unfailing courage and unparalleled commitment to excellence, Pete Sampras rewrote the record books and redefined the word ‘champion.' 

“His ascent to greatness lifted this event — and the sport of tennis — to new heights of energy and intensity. 

“Armed with an enormous serve, explosive forehand and exquisite net game, Sampras was a competitor of singular brilliance — and a champion of exceptional class. He will long be recalled as one of the greatest to ever play the sport.”

After all, this entire complex is named after her…

Billie Jean King is one of the most decorated players to play the sport, earning 39 Grand Slam titles during her playing career, including four U.S. Open singles titles.

Off the court, she is known for her advocacy regarding equal pay in women's sports and for LGBTQ+ rights. King's plaque says: 

💬 “An effervescent and unrelenting fighter for women's tournament rights, ‘Billie Jean' was universally revered throughout the sporting community. 

“Her stellar play and inner fire endeared her to the New York crowds — and the world — lifting her star and the status of this event.”

A civil rights pioneer and a superstar on the court, Althea Gibson is one of the most consequential figures in tennis history. 

She was the first Black player to win a Grand Slam, capturing the French Open crown in 1956, setting the stage for others like Arthur Ashe and Serena Williams. 

As Gibson's bronze plaque states:

💬 “In a career measured in milestones, Althea conquered society's most oppressive constraints to capture tennis' most prestigious titles. A true pioneer, she broke barriers as she rose from the streets of Harlem while battling ignorance and prejudice with grace, courage and dignity. 

“The first African-American to compete at the U.S. Championships and Wimbledon, Gibson won 11 career Grand Slam titles — including two U.S. nationals singles crowns. 

“Her unrelenting desire to achieve made her a champion and an icon.”

Never shy in terms of speaking out against racial injustice both in the United States and abroad, Arthur Ashe is as well-known for his civil rights advocacy as he is for his tennis. 

On the court, he had an ability to combine immense shotmaking with strategic excellence. Ashe became the first Black man to win a Grand Slam when he won the U.S. Open in 1968, and the first to win a Wimbledon singles title in 1975.

Ashe's bronze plaque reads:

💬 “His name synonymous with integrity, dignity and class, Arthur Ashe was a champion of extraordinary talent and a man of singular grace. The first winner of this event in the Open Era, he also was the first Black man to claim a major title. 

“One of tennis' greatest ambassadors, Ashe used his celebrity to raise the profile of his sport and of countless causes. 

“The man for whom the U.S. Open's grandest stage is named will forever be recalled as a champion of the sport and the epitome of the power of fortitude and courage.”

As you enter the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center through the Champions entry and head toward Arthur Ashe Stadium, it is almost impossible to miss the corridor of bronze plaques commemorating the greats who captivated fans across the globe with their performances on these ocean blue courts in Flushing Meadows. 

The introductory plaque reads:

💬 “The U.S. Open Court of Champions celebrates the legacy of the greatest singles champions in the history of the U.S. Open and U.S. Championships. 

“Each defines the essence of talent and character required to win at tennis' ultimate proving grounds. 

“Inductees, selected by fans and media from around the world, represent the tournament's all-time greatest — the best of the best — whose electrifying performances have contributed to making the U.S. Open one of the world's top sporting events.”

Let us take you through those iconic names and memories next...

A new partnership between the ATP Tour and TikTok illustrates how tennis wants to embrace a younger, more casual audience as well as hardcore fans.

But can a sport of order, especially when it comes to media rights, accept the chaos at the heart of what makes the social media platform so compelling?

You can take in our deeper dive below.

ATP Tour partners with TikTok, but can tennis embrace the irreverence that the platform loves?

Did you know, in addition to her historic tennis career, Gibson became the first Black woman to ever join the LPGA tour in 1960?

As I mentioned earlier, anyone competing at the 2025 U.S. Open mixed doubles is going to walk away with a bit of cash. 

This year's Grand Slam in Queens is already set to be the first tennis event to reach $90 million in prize money — which is a whopping 20 percent increase on the previous high set by the U.S. Open 12 months ago. 

The winner of the men's and women's singles will each take home $5 million. As for this revamped mixed doubles championship, here is what the pairs are playing for today (all figures per team)…

Those who lost their first match yesterday took home $20,000 and it was $100,000 if their mixed doubles ended after two matches

So even players who lost their opening draw on Tuesday got to walk away with $10,000 in their pocket. As for today, the stakes are clearly far higher.

There's a nice backstory to the Świątek/Ruud partnership. 

The Norwegian sent Świątek a message of support after she fought back tears during a heavy defeat against Coco Gauff at the Madrid Open, telling her that she inspires so many.

Since then, she has risen back to world No. 2 and won Wimbledon for the first time. 

She's also a French Open doubles finalist, so knows a bit about the court at these dimensions.

Iga Świątek won the Cincinnati Open final against Jasmine Paolini on Monday. Less than 12 hours later, she was back on Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York playing mixed doubles with Casper Ruud. 

The short turnaround didn't bother the current Wimbledon champion. The pair defeated the American duo of Frances Tiafoe and Madison Keys 4-1, 4-2. 

Then in the quarterfinal, Świątek/Ruud trounced Caty McNally and Lorenzo Musetti 4-1, 4-2. Ruud was very complimentary of Świątek after the match too:

💬 “Everyone should show appreciation to Iga because she got to her hotel 12 hours ago, 2:30 am… Thank you so much Iga.”

Casper Ruud was supposed to be at the golf course ahead of competing in the U.S. Open. Instead, he's in the mixed doubles semifinal alongside Iga Świątek. 

Ruud, the world No. 12, is a past finalist at the U.S. Open in 2022. He lost in four sets to Carlos Alcaraz, as the Spaniard took his first slam. 

This year Ruud won the Madrid Open, his first ATP Masters 1000 title. The Norwegian outlasted Jack Draper in three sets to secure the title.

Ruud has 13 ATP Tour titles to his name. Will he add a mixed doubles championship? 

Iga Świątek retained her place within the top tier of women's tennis with a dominant 6-0, 6-0 victory in the women's singles final at Wimbledon to win her first title at SW19 and shake off a rough start to 2025. 

She also added a Cincinnati Open to her trophy case with a straight-set win against Jasmine Paolini. 

Less than 12 hours after winning in Cincinnati, Świątek rattled off two wins in the mixed doubles championship to advance to the semifinals. 

A U.S. Open singles victory may not get her closer to a career Grand Slam since she already won the event in 2022...

But it would further secure Świątek as a force to be reckoned with after some shine came off her star in back-to-back Grand Slam semifinal defeats in Australia and at Roland Garros to begin 2025.

For various reasons — illness, injury, their playing partner dropping out, focusing on another event — plenty of players have pulled out of the mixed doubles event.

Late last week Emma Navarro, Paula Badosa and Tommy Paul all withdrew from the U.S. Open mixed doubles championship — leaving Jannik Sinner, Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula briefly without a playing partner.

Pegula and Draper pivoted by pairing together, while Sinner joined doubles specialist Kateřina Siniaková... before Sinner then pulled out due to the illness which forced him to end his Cincinnati Open final against Carlos Alcaraz early.

Arthur Fils is out too.

No playing partner was found for Siniaková so they were replaced by Americans Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison. More on them later...

Tennis

U.S. Open

Begins

LIVE

11m ago

Coco Gauff has split with a key coach on the eve of the U.S. Open.

Gauff, the world No. 3, has parted ways with grip expert Matt Daly, who she hired at the end of last year's U.S. Open to strengthen her serve and forehand, two of the most important shots in tennis.

She has now brought on Gavin MacMillan, a biomechanics specialist who helped rescue world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka's serve. MacMillan was on court with Gauff during practice at the Billie Jean King Tennis Center Wednesday, alongside her longtime coach Jean-Christophe Faurel. Gauff hit on Arthur Ashe Stadium with Elina Svitolina, before doing serve practice with MacMillan and Faurel as rain fell on the outside practice courts in New York.

A representative for Gauff confirmed the change, first reported by ESPN. MacMillan was not immediately available for comment.

After a period of upturn in late 2024 and early 2025, Gauff's serving troubles have returned. She hit 42 double faults in three matches during the WTA 1000 Canadian Open in Montreal, one rung below a Grand Slam. In one match against Danielle Collins, Gauff double-faulted away almost a set's worth of points. She won that match, through the tenacity and ability to get every ball back that is one of the bedrocks of her game. But it was clear to her that her prospects were limited as long as she could not consistently land a quality first or second serve.

After losing to Victoria Mboko in Canada, she then hit 16 double faults in a quarterfinal defeat to Jasmine Paolini at the Cincinnati Open.

Gauff has consulted with Andy Roddick, who has tried to get her to adjust her toss. She worked with Daly, who is a grip specialist, who altered how she held the racket. MacMillan will likely pursue a more substantial breakdown of the motion, but whether or not Gauff can make those changes in real time as she tries to get through the draw of the year's final Grand Slam is another question.

Jason Stacy, one of Sabalenka's lead coaches, brought in MacMillan in summer 2022 to fix a serve that was producing more than 20 double faults in matches. He got immediate results, as Sabalenka's double faults plummeted and she reached the semifinals of that year's U.S. Open. She has since gone on to win three majors on her route to the top ranking in women's tennis.

Gauff has also proven deft at adapting to new ideas in the past. She won the U.S. Open in 2023 less than two months after she brought on Brad Gilbert. She won the China Open in Beijing and the WTA Tour Finals in Riyadh just weeks after bringing on Daly last year. But strings of double faults have defined the tougher moments of her career.

It was last year's U.S. Open exit to compatriot Emma Navarro, which also featured a string of double faults, that led Gauff to say that she didn't want to lose that way any longer. She fired coach Brad Gilbert, with whom she had won the title in New York in 2023, and brought in Daly. The partnership seemed to work, but the results have not held of late.

The U.S. Open singles main draws begin Sunday Aug. 24.

The much-hyped pairing of Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu was bounced in the first round of the new U.S. Open mixed doubles event on Tuesday.

Alcaraz, the No. 2 men's player in the world, and Raducanu, the 35th-ranked women's player, are both former U.S. Open singles champions. Yet they lost 4-2, 4-2 against the top-seeded team of Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula in a match that lasted less than one hour.

The mixed-doubles event has drawn criticism this year for a new format that prioritizes singles stars over teams that specialize in doubles play.

Instead of a 32-team field, there were only 16 teams in the tournament this year. Half the field was determined by players' singles rankings, while the remaining eight teams were selected by the U.S. Tennis Association. 

A post shared by @emmaraducanu

The prize money is also significantly higher, with the winners taking home $1 million compared to only $200,000 last year. The gameplay and timing of the tournament were also changed, with sets being played to only four games, and the two-day event taking place before the singles as something of a tune-up.

“It would be like if, at the Olympics, they didn't let the actual high jumpers participate, and instead had basketball players compete in the high jump because it's more ‘interesting,” Sara Errani, who won the doubles event with Andrea Vavassori last year, told the Associated Press earlier this week. “If you want to do that, I guess you can, but you can't award them medals. You can't have a Grand Slam doubles (trophy) and not let doubles players take part. ... You're excluding them from their sport. It's dishonest.”

British player Joe Salisbury told the AP the decision to include singles stars "does bring a bit more attention to it."

"But I'm not sure it's good for the doubles event, because it's not really a proper event. It's just a two-day exhibition."

The mixed-doubled tournament will conclude on Wednesday.

The singles draw of the U.S. Open will begin on Aug. 24.

Tracy Compton was over-the-moon to lift silverware at Wimbledon after an unforgettable experience at SW19.

Compton, 57, who lives in Sutton, featured in the national finals at Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, which is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition and is delivered by Vodafone in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club.

Thousands of players took part in the qualifying stages this year, leading to county and regional finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on Wimbledon's Aorangi Courts last week.

Compton won the women's B1 Visually Impaired tennis finals during the tournament and revealed it was an experience she will never forget.

She said: "It's a dream come true to come and win at Wimbledon.

"It's a case of third time lucky for me. The first time I came, I finished third, then second and now I have finally won.

"I'm a little bit surprised and speechless really, I can't quite believe it.

"It was a really good match and I held my nerve on my serves to get a resounding win which I'm thrilled about."

This year's tournament delivered over 10,000 playing opportunities with thousands of singles and doubles players taking part at 800 venues, leading to county and area finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on the All England Club's Aorangi Courts from 3 – 9 August 2025.

The competition aims to broaden playing opportunities and to inspire people of all ages and abilities to play tennis and follow in the footsteps of their tennis heroes by competing for a chance to play on Wimbledon's iconic courts.

In addition to 14 and under singles, 18 and under doubles and adult doubles draws, the categories also included wheelchair (adult and juniors), learning disability and visually impaired competitions. The national finals also saw the return of popular para-standing and deaf tennis exhibition matches held during the week.

World No.1 wheelchair doubles partners and Vodafone ambassadors Alfie Hewett OBE and Gordon Reid OBE were in attendance to cheer on the players at SW19 and offer their experience and advice.

“We would have loved to have had something like this when we were younger and playing,” said Hewett.

“Play your Way to Wimbledon is a massive event for someone to pick up a racket for the first time or start playing again if they haven't for a while.

“It's about being active at grassroots level, making friends and new tennis partners and that is the beauty of events like this.”

Reid added: “We want tennis to be available and accessible to everybody and get as many people as possible enjoying the sport.

“This event encapsulates that perfectly and we're proud to be a part of it.”

Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition. It is delivered by Vodafone, in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club, forming part of Vodafone's ongoing commitment to supporting grassroots tennis in the UK and making the sport more accessible for players of all ages and abilities.

This article is part of a series reported and written by students at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville as an assignment for a course offered by the School of Journalism and Media. During the course, Sports Communication in the U.K., students traveled to Great Britain to learn about the country's sports history, culture, and professional communication practices.

LONDON — In 1877, Major Lockhart Wingfield invited 22 amateurs to the London suburb of Wimbledon to play the first Gentlemen's Singles tournament at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. 

In the 147 years since that first competition, players have been required to wear all white: no bright colors or flashy designs. Wimbledon has also adhered to a strict code of conduct, with players punished for misbehavior such as yelling, breaking rackets or seeking assistance from coaches during a match.

Even the crowd must sit in solemn reverence as a serve is initiated and the point is completed. In 2023, a man seated in the crowd was embarrassingly called out by the umpire for popping a champagne bottle while a player was serving – the umpire halted the match and initiated a parent-like rebuke. The goal is to keep the focus on the game and the players; no distractions. 

But how can a player focus on the game if she has to worry about the reaction to her decision to wear – gasp! – a pink bra? Over the years, Wimbledon has been synonymous with strawberries and cream, all-white athletic gear, floppy hats and outdated ideas. The all-white dress code was established to prevent players from showing sweat, something that was seen as improper in the Victorian Era. In 2015, these rules compelled the tournament's organizers to force Aussie Nick Kyrgios to turn his Wimbledon-branded headband inside out because it was too colorful. 

Wimbledon also is the only major tennis tournament that has stayed true to the lawn tennis that jump-started the modern game. The tournament's 100% ryegrass courts make the ball move faster, lower, and more unpredictably across the uneven surface, very different from the modern clay courts that are slower and bouncier. If it's raining, it's time to get off the court because the match is suspended. If it's 9 p.m., most courts at Wimbledon don't have lights, and the tournament has an 11 p.m. curfew because the local neighborhood demands it. 

The perception of Wimbledon is quintessentially British: posh, quiet, snobby and elite. Look no further than the royal box that is constructed each year on Centre Court, where the tournament's finals are played, just so that the royal family can remind everyone what it means to be born lucky.  

All of this, and Wimbledon is still considered the most prestigious tennis tournament in the world, even more so than the Australian, French, and U.S. Opens, the other three legs of the tennis grand slams, which each boast the same winnings (around $2.7 million per winner) with half as many rules. 

How does one move forward while standing still? John, a long-time tour guide at Wimbledon and London native who requested we not fully identify him to protect (we used an alias for his first name) his status as a Wimbledon employee, answered the cries of thousands of fans who want to feel included in this seemingly unreachable sport.

“We've got players from over 90 countries … we are very respectful of all colors," John said. "We have a diversity program within the club as well. So, you know, we really kind of think about (inclusion) quite carefully because we are on the world stage.” 

Scott Shannon, an American lifelong fan of tennis, echoes this call for acceptance. “Growing up, (my family) did not have the opportunity to watch many professional tennis tournaments; however, Wimbledon was an event at our house, and we learned the game by watching.”

He may have never picked up a racket or stepped onto a lawn tennis court in his small town in South Carolina, but the game was real to him. “I love the traditions that make Wimbledon what it is," Shannon said. "The grass courts, especially. There are certain traditions in sports that make a tournament or venue special.” 

But tradition at Wimbledon does not preclude the tournament from selling some seats in the front row at Centre Court for a relatively affordable 30 British pounds or about $40. “That money goes to the community,” John said. “Any money that we make over and above the usual income that comes in, we support hundreds of charities within the area. We work very closely with food programs as well.”

For Scott, the allure of Wimbledon remains in its traditions. "I see Wimbledon as a microcosm of England. They reserve a place for the royals and the wealthy while also providing an experience for all.”

The allure, he said, remains in its traditions; “I think tradition has to do with identity. Wimbledon is the standard against which all other tournaments are measured.” 

In recent years, the All England Club has shown a willingness to stretch the boundaries of its traditions. Now, female players can wear darker undergarments to conceal menstruation. Additionally, despite tradition, Wimbledon pays its men's and women's tournament winners equally. And while tradition previously might have meant waiting seven years to include women, or over 70 years to include Black players, it also means providing the platform for Serena Williams to dominate the world stage and inspire younger women like Coco Gauff to follow in her footsteps. 

Standing still doesn't mean never moving. A 147-year-old tree planted firmly in its roots will not walk forward, but it will sway and bend in the blowing wind. Wimbledon will not step forward, but it has and will sway and bend with the changing winds of time.

U.S. Open

Begins

LIVE

3m ago

The Athletic has live coverage of the U.S. Open tennis tournament's new mixed doubles format.

Jannik Sinner has withdrawn from the U.S. Open mixed doubles, which begins Aug. 19 in New York. The men's world No. 1 in singles retired after five games of his Cincinnati Open final against Carlos Alcaraz due to illness, and will recover before preparing for the U.S. Open singles.

Sinner was going to partner Kateřina Siniaková, probably the greatest active doubles player on earth, in a compelling alliance of the two tennis disciplines.

Siniaková, an 11-time Grand Slam doubles champion and a gold medalist at the 2024 Paris Olympics, never received a new partner. The official draw and order of play were updated Tuesday morning, but Sinner and Siniaková's place was occupied by “Qualifier / Qualifier” as of 9:12 a.m., less than two hours before the start of the event.

Americans Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison then took the pair's spot as first alternate, owing to their combined singles ranking.

Alcaraz traveled from Mason, Ohio to partner Emma Raducanu, while Iga Świątek, who won the WTA 1000 title with victory over Jasmine Paolini, also arrived on time to partner Norway's Casper Ruud.

The new mixed doubles event, which will be played over two days and feature short sets, an array of singles stars and a $1 million prize, begins at 11 a.m. Aug. 19. The semifinals and finals will be played Aug. 20, starting at 7 p.m. The teams, prior to the confirmation of Sinner and Siniaková's replacement, are as follows:

DIRECT ENTRIES

Jessica Pegula / Jack Draper
Iga Świątek / Casper Ruud
Elena Rybakina / Taylor Fritz
Amanda Anisimova / Holger Rune
Belinda Bencic / Alexander Zverev
Mirra Andreeva / Daniil Medvedev
Madison Keys / Frances Tiafoe
Karolina Muchová / Andrey Rublev
Danielle Collins / Christian Harrison

WILD CARDS

Emma Raducanu / Carlos Alcaraz
Olga Danilović / Novak Djokovic
Taylor Townsend / Ben Shelton
Sara Errani / Andrea Vavassori
Venus Williams / Reilly Opelka
Naomi Osaka / Gael Monfils
Caty McNally / Lorenzo Musetti

Analysis from Charlie Eccleshare, tennis writer

In Jannik Sinner and Kateřina Siniaková, the U.S. Open had unwittingly stumbled upon a fascinating mixed doubles pairing. How would the men's world No. 1 in singles mesh with arguably the world's greatest active doubles player, and holder of 11 Grand Slam titles across the women's and mixed disciplines?

Sinner was originally paired with WTA singles world No. 11 Emma Navarro, but, having struggled for form of late, she pulled out of the event to play the Monterrey Open to try and get some matches in ahead of the U.S. Open.

Sinner's withdrawal, and the end of his partnership with Siniaková before it had begun, is perhaps a fitting conclusion to his involvement in the competition. When Sinner was asked at Wimbledon about how his partnership with Navarro had come about, he could have tried to play it straight and trot out some line like: “Yeah, look, I've always admired Emma as a player and I really can't wait to play the mixed doubles event with her in New York.”

Instead he started laughing and told the truth: “It was very unexpected, to be honest. I just met her yesterday for the first time. We never talked. We never texted to each other.” He explained that with other pairs partnered up, the U.S. Open had suggested her as one of a few options.

Fast forward nearly two months, and Sinner's withdrawal is not a major surprise. Especially with tennis' scheduling being such that the mixed doubles event begins less than 24 hours after the Cincinnati Open final.

Now the U.S. Open has been left to scramble for a replacement for Sinner, and has lost arguably its most interesting pair in the process. There was always likely to be a degree of chopping and changing, and some has happened already with other partnerships, but this will no doubt provide more fuel for those who are sceptical about the seriousness of this event.

ATP and Palmes today unveil their first collaboration: a limited-edition capsule of tennis apparel and accessories. The partnership marks a new chapter for ATP as it re-enters the fashion and lifestyle space, building on a history of co-branded collections with leading sportswear brands.

The collection features t-shirts, polo tops, tennis shorts, caps and a tote bag, combining Palmes' progressive approach to tennis culture with the global recognition of the ATP brand.

The ATP + Palmes collection will debut on Palmes.co and at Palmes' Copenhagen flagship store, alongside a brick-and-mortar launch at Gem Home in New York's NoLita neighbourhood. The New York pop-up will offer the collection for sale alongside a curated display of archival tennis books and antiques, and will be open to the public from Wednesday, 20 August through to Sunday, 24 August.

Following the initial release, the collection will be available globally from Tuesday, August 26th through selected premium retailers such as END, FWRD, Ounass, Kapok, Care Of Carl and Illum.

ATP VP Licensing & Retail Joan Carrera López said: “Tennis and fashion have an iconic shared history. We're proud to put the ATP brand – and some incredible products – into the hands of fans around the world. This is part of a bigger journey for us in the fashion and lifestyle space, and we're energised to be collaborating on it with Palmes.”

Founder of Palmes Nikolaj Hansson added: “I founded Palmes four years ago from a desire to bring a progressive feeling to tennis, expanding the appeal of the sport and its surrounding culture by blending my ideas around tennis and fashion with references to other creative disciplines, be it art, design, architecture or the like. Being tennis fanatics at heart, it is a dream come true to collaborate with an institution as iconic as ATP, presenting our shared love of tennis through a forward-thinking lens.”

This collaboration forms part of a broader strategy to elevate ATP's cultural resonance through partnerships with forward-thinking brands. Alongside fashion – where the ATP maintains a long-standing partnership with Lacoste – ATP is also investing in content, tech and licensing. This includes its Gen Z-focused collaboration with Overtime and the rollout of new digital products designed to elevate the fan experience.

FRANK SHIELDS was the original tennis badboy.

With film star good lucks and a nonchalance that once saw him skip a Wimbledon final, Shields left a huge imprint on the sport during the 1930s.

A New Yorker through and through, Shields reached the final of his home tournament at the US Championships, which would later become known as the US Open, in 1930.

The following year, Shields reached the Wimbledon final but did not take to Centre Court for the final, supposedly due to an "ankle injury".

As reported by the Telegraph, however, cultural critic Jeffrey Hart once claimed of the 1931 showpiece: "This was a murky episode, in which legend has it that Shields was busy investigating the attributes of a matched pair of French countesses.

"The truth is probably that he had a badly twisted leg from his previous match with [Jean] Borotra – though the explanations are not mutually exclusive."

Shields went on to marry three times, with all three of his wives being wealthy heiresses.

His second was a Spanish princess, Marina Torlonia di Civitella-Cesi, with whom he had two children.

In total he had five children with two different women, and among his grandchildren is American actress and socialite Brooke Shields - who would go on to marry Andre Agassi in 1997, their marriage lasting two years.

The vast majority of Shields' successes, at least on the tennis court, came in the 1930s, when he peaked at No2 in the world.

Much has been made of this year's controversially revamped US Open mixed doubles event, which saw Carlos Alcaraz partner Emma Raducanu at Flushing Meadows.

But in 1950, a grizzled veteran by this point, Shields partnered Hollywood A-lister Ginger Rogers in the mixed event at the US Open.

Rogers, an Academy Award-winning actress more used to recreational matches at country clubs than Grand Slam tennis, partnered Shields - although the glamorous pair were eliminated in round one at Forest Hills.

Per the Telegraph, Budge Patty, who reached world No1 that year, believed that Shields' motives for partnering Rogers went beyond mere forehands and backhands.

Patty said: "There was only one reason why Frank would have been playing with her."

Shields enjoyed a taste of the high life alongside Rogers, but couldn't match her exploits on the silver screen.

The tennis lothario did attempt a career in cinema, appearing in several films during the 1930s, albeit with little commercial success.

Fred Astaire he was not.

Shields went on to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1964, but while his quality was not in doubt, his reliability often was.

In 1933 he was not selected at all for the Davis Cup, despite being the No1-ranked American at the time.

And two years on from missing the Wimbledon final, Shields went AWOL after the 1933 French Open.

Amazingly he was later discovered at sea, armed with nothing but the tuxedo on his back.

Hart wrote of the episode: "He had accompanied some friends on the boat train to Le Havre, a party all the way, and woke up at sea on the Warren Harding with no money, only his tuxedo."



Shields struggled with alcohol in his latter years and he eventually died in 1975 aged 65, sadly succumbing to a third heart attack.

His legacy is a complex one, but Shields will forever remain one of the most intriguing stars in American tennis history.

Jannik Sinner has claimed three hardcourt Grand Slam titles – two at the Australian Open and one at the US Open. The player with the most hardcourt Grand Slam singles titles is none other than Novak Djokovic, whose tally is 14 (10 Australian Open and four US Open trophies).

In the recently concluded Cincinnati Masters, Sinner failed to defend his title as he suffered from an illness and which forced him to give a walkover to Carlos Alcaraz after trailing 0-5 in the first set. It also ended his 26-match winning streak on hardcourts that started from the Shanghai Masters last year. Following the final, Jack Sock, on the Nothing Major podcast, gave his opinion on whether Sinner could surpass Djokovic and win the most number of Majors on hardcourts.

I don't think we would be surprised, honestly. I think it shows how good he is that the stats are getting lost in all the results because he is literally in every final and is winning and playing for every title and tournament that he plays in. The fact that it's like he's now accumulated 26 hard-court wins in a row, it wouldn't surprise me at all. It's gotten to the point that if it's not Sinner and Alcaraz in the final, then it's a surprising tournament.

It was Sinner who stopped Djokovic from reaching the finals of two Grand Slam events this season. In the semifinals of the French Open and Wimbledon, Sinner knocked out the 24-time Grand Slam champion in straight sets, and now leads 6-4 in the head-to-head matchups.

And I think Sinner is the better player at the moment. I don't know about 16 hardcourt Majors, but I think he is going to dominate for a long time.

Due to the illness, the World No.1 couldn't participate in the US Open mixed doubles he was scheduled to play alongside Katerina Siniakova. But Djokovic played his match, along with Olga Danilovic. They lost in their first match against the Russian team of Daniil Medvedev and Mirra Andreeva.

In singles, Djokovic will continue his hunt for his historic 25th Grand Slam title. The last Major he lifted was the 2023 US Open by beating Casper Ruud. Since that win, the Serb has made a Grand Slam final only once, in last year's Wimbledon which he lost to Alcaraz.

The main draw of the US Open singles is scheduled to start on August 24, so Jannik Sinner has an ample amount of time to recover from the illness before starting his title defense. And this is why former player from America, Ryan Harrison, is not worried about the four-time Grand Slam champion.

Not much. I think hearing that he has seven days to respond. Whatever he is dealing with, he will be straight to the doctor's office. From that camp, it's not something that I would be overly worried about.

Last year at Flushing Meadows, Sinner spoiled Taylor Fritz‘s hope to end the American men's title drought in singles with a straight-set win. If he fails to defend his title, he could drop to the second position on the rankings table as he currently has 11,480 points, while World No.2 has 9,590.

The 24-year-old has far this season, played five finals and clinched two titles, both in Grand Slam events. He breezed past Alexander Zverev to defend his Australian Open title. After losing the French Open final to Alcaraz following five tough sets, he took his revenge on the five-time Grand Slam champion with a four-set win at Wimbledon.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are leading a new era of Grand Slam supremacy, having combined to win the past seven major titles — a streak that already ranks among the longest in the Open Era.

Their run, which began at the 2024 Australian Open, now sits fourth on the all-time list for consecutive majors shared by two players. Victory for either at the upcoming US Open would not only extend that streak, but also secure a second consecutive calendar-year Grand Slam shutout, ensuring that, for the second year running, no other player has lifted a major trophy.

Consistency across all stages has been the hallmark of Sinner and Alcaraz's rise, with both men contesting major finals on each of the three surfaces. Sinner has captured the past three hard-court majors, while Alcaraz saved three championship points against the Italian in a five-set epic to successfully defend his Roland Garros title earlier this year.

A month later, Sinner snapped a five-match tour-level losing streak against Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final to earn his first major title on a natural surface. “I'm just really happy to be building such a great rivalry against Jannik,” Alcaraz said earlier this month. “Jannik and I, I think we've done great things in tennis already in such a short period. I just let the people talk about our rivalry or the things that we have done for the tennis history books.”

 Longest streaks of consecutive Grand Slam titles won by two players in Open Era



From 2005 to 2007, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal won 11 consecutive majors between them before Novak Djokovic broke through at the 2008 Australian Open. That victory marked the beginning of an era where the ‘Big Three' shared many of the sport's longest streaks, including two nine-major runs by Nadal and Djokovic together between 2010-2012 and from 2018-2020.

Earlier runs in history have also left their mark. Between the 2015 Australian Open and 2016 Roland Garros, Djokovic shared six majors with Stan Wawrinka, winning five of them himself. In the 1990s, Sergi Bruguera and Pete Sampras held a six-major streak between them.

Many of these streaks have been defined by contrasting playing styles: Federer and Nadal's battles became classics for their blend of speed, precision, and endurance, while other pairings brought diverse approaches to succeed across multiple surfaces and continents.



Now, Sinner and Alcaraz, the top two players in the PIF ATP Rankings, are carving their own place in this lineage — not just through the numbers, but through the completeness of their games and their ability to adapt to every surface. Their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry, which Alcaraz leads 9-5, has been defined by tight contests, momentum swings, and shared moments of brilliance.

Their five-hour, 29-minute final at Roland Garros was the longest in the tournament's history and the second-longest final at any major, and it went down as an instant classic. If one of them can lift the trophy in New York, it would underline just how airtight their grip on majors has become, adding another chapter to a run that is already redefining the balance of power in men's tennis.

Sinner saw his Cincinnati title defence come to an end in the final when he was forced to retire against Alcaraz after just 23 minutes, but he arrives at the US Open with a 31-4 tour-level record in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

The reigning Nitto ATP Finals champion, Sinner trails Alcaraz 1,890 points in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, and their thrilling battle for Year-End No. 1 is testament to the dominance both are establishing at the top of the game.

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

All eight ATP Winston-Salem round of 16 matches will be completed on Wednesday. Sebastian Korda and former Wimbledon semifinalist Roberto Bautista Agut's contests are among those predicted in this article. We here at LWOT predict the rest of the action, including Lorenzo Sonego vs Jaume Munar, in a separate article.

Head-to-head: First meeting

No. 4 seed Diallo has not played a match yet in Winston-Salem after receiving a walkover in the round of 32. Medjedovic's powerful tennis can trouble most players when it clicks. The Canadian is a more consistent performer, but I feel Medjedovic could edge this. He impressed in the first two rounds and is capable of taking time away from Diallo and not letting him settle.

Prediction: Medjedovic in 3

Head-to-head: First meeting

Stefanos Tsitsipas's poor display should not detract from how well Bu played in his 6-3 6-2 victory. Navone's level was not far behind in a crushing 6-2 6-2 success over Marcos Giron. Despite that strong performance from the Argentine, Bu is a slight favorite to win. The intensity of his hitting from the match against Tsitsipas would probably be too much for Navone to handle on a hard court.

Prediction: Bu in 2

Head-to-head: Bautista Agut 3-2 Fucsovics

Fucsovics knocked out the No. 2 seed Tallon Griekspoor in the previous round. Bautista Agut presents a different type of challenge. Despite being 37, he retains the ability to stifle opponents with his relentless consistency. The Spaniard has lost half a step in speed, but his exceptional tennis IQ and more reliable level make him the favorite against Fucsovics.

Prediction: Bautista Agut in 3

Head-to-head: First meeting

This will be Korda's second match since the French Open after being sidelined by a severe injury. Understandably, he was quite rusty in his first match back. Although that will likely remain the case in the round of 16, Korda should still have enough to progress. No part of Majchrzak's game is superior to last year's Citi DC Open champion.

Prediction: Korda in 2

Draper, who will also launch a signature line with Vuori, spoke about his growing passion for personal style:“For me, style is about how you carry yourself, what you wear, and owning who you are without hesitation,” Draper said. “As I've grown up, I've really embraced style as a form of self-expression, and whether it's shaving my head or trying something bold, I just go for it.“That's why collaborating with Vuori is so exciting. It's a chance to create something innovative, performance-driven, and authentic, with no compromises.”

Doubles world No. 1 Taylor Townsend continues to showcase her own line, which she launched during Roland Garros. Townsend has been designing and producing her own skirts, cropped tops, and warmup pieces—two of which debuted during her mixed doubles campaign with Shelton.“I'm just taking things into my own hands,” Townsend told Tennis Channel in May. “I've had so much success and done so many things—but I'm No. 2 in the world in doubles and I still don't have a clothing sponsor. So I was like, why not take it into my own hands and do my own thing?”Read More: Paris Style Guide: Taylor Townsend wore her own apparel line during Roland Garros return

Noisy night matches

New York's spectators don't like to watch games in silence and the courts more often resemble a football stadium.

Equal prize money pioneers

In 1973, both the male and female champion were awarded the same prize and other tournaments followed suit years later.

Top singles names and unlikely pairings share the stage in a made-for-primetime mixed-doubles tournament with a million-dollar stakes. Here are the results from Day 1.

Watching some of the great singles players in mixed doubles ahead of the US Open main singles draws was an unprecedented treat.

Perhaps Wednesday's best point came when Emma Raducanu somehow tracked down a thunderous overhead from Jack Draper -- and Carlos Alcaraz eventually finished with an improbable around-the-net winner.

But more than anything, the results of the first day before big, supportive crowds in Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong Stadiums underlined just how special those “doubles specialists” are.

Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori look like the favorites heading into Thursday night's semifinals and finals. Maybe it's because they are the most fluent team, the only pure doubles specialists in the field -- as well as the defending US Open mixed champions and winners of the title earlier this year at Roland Garros.

“Tactics in doubles are very important,” Vavassori said. “There are many very strong players here, but we often play together, we also talk off the court, and this is important.

“We also play for all the doubles players who cannot compete at the mixed doubles tournament here. We try to do our best.”

In 12 matches, four went to a second-set tiebreak -- but not one went to a third set.

The Thursday semifinals and finals are scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET.

Here are the results from Tuesday's matches:

No. 1 Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper def. Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu 4-2, 4-2

The skinny: The 50-minute match was decided by superior net play, from both Draper and Pegula -- who has played the doubles quarterfinals at all four majors. They won 24 of 34 service points and were not broken. They converted their fifth match point on Pegula's serve with a winner from Draper.

No. 3 Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud def. Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe, 4-1, 4-2

The skinny: Swiatek looked fresh, considering she stepped off the court in Cincinnati 16 hours earlier. She and Ruud needed only 39 minutes to dispatch the Americans, who had five double faults and were broken twice.

Mirra Andreeva and Daniil Medvedev def. Olga Danilovic and Novak Djokovic, 4-2, 5-3

The skinny: Danilovic and Djokovic were up 3-1 in the second set before the winners came back to take the last four games. The winners saved two of three break points and hit a combined 10 winners, against only six unforced errors.

Caty McNally and Lorenzo Musetti def. Naomi Osaka and Gael Monfils 5-3, 4-2

The skinny: There were some awkward moments -- Musetti, aggressively running down a lob, almost knocked McNally off her feet -- but the makeshift team prevailed comfortably. When Paolini withdrew, McNally stepped in to become Musetti's partner.

Pegula and Draper def. Andreeva and Medvedev, 4-1, 4-1

The skinny: This was the most one-sided of Wednesday's matches, with the winners taking 36 of 62 points. They forged 10 break-point opportunities and converted three.

No. 3 Swiatek and Ruud def. McNally and Musetti, 4-1, 4-2

The skinny: This one required only 46 minutes, while the winners saved both break opportunities against them. “Even though we haven't played together, we had good communication on the court,” Swiatek said in her on-court interview.

Wednesday's semifinals: Pegula and Draper vs. Swiatek and Ruud (7 p.m. ET)

Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori def. No. 2 Elena Rybakina and Taylor Fritz, 4-2, 4-2

The skinny: This match underlined the diverse skill set that the best doubles teams bring to the party. Rybakina and Fritz were seeded No. 2 based on their Top 10 singles prowess, but all those big serves (seven aces) weren't enough to prevail. Errani is a six-time Grand Slam doubles champion, and Vavassori has played in three major finals. They might be the best volleyers in the field.

Taylor Townsend and Ben Shelton def. No. 4 Amanda Anisimova and Holger Rune, 4-2, 5-4 (2)

The skinny: Taylor Townsend is the No. 1 doubles player in the PIF WTA Rankings -- and she looked like it in this one. The Americans won 50 of 85 points and converted three of their four break points. “Pretty easy for me -- I'm just along for the ride,” Shelton said afterward. “I just do what she says.”

Karolina Muchova and Andrey Rublev def. Venus Williams and Reilly Opelka, 4-2, 5-4 (4)

The skinny: The Americans had 11 aces, but Muchova and Rublev took better care of their serves, winning 23 of 28 first-serve points and a remarkable 10 of 14 seconds. They also saved both break points against them and finished with seven more winners than unforced errors.

Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison def. Belinda Bencic and Alexander Zverev, 4-0, 5-3

The skinny: The last team into the draw when Jannik Sinner withdrew with an illness, Collins and Harrison produced the only perfect set of the 16 played in the first round. The match was over in 42 minutes, as the American team converted three of five break-point opportunities and won 39 of 64 points.

Errani and Vavassori def. Muchova and Rublev, 4-1, 5-4 (4)

The skinny: Of all the early matches played, the Italians displayed the best teamwork. Errani and Vavassori hit a combined 18 winners, against only six unforced errors. It's not a coincidence that this is the only team in the field that consists of two pure doubles specialists.

Collins and Harrison def. Townsend and Shelton, 4-1, 5-4 (2)

The skinny: This might have been the upset of the day. In an all-American contest, the winners needed only 46 minutes to take down Townsend, the WTA Tour's No. 1 doubles player and Shelton, the ATP Tour's No. 6 singles player. Collins and Harrison were not broken and had the edge in points, 42-35.

Wednesday's semifinals: Errani and Vavassori vs. Collins and Harrison (following Pegula and Draper vs. Swiatek and Ruud)

Collins and partner Christian Harrison brought their good luck charm after reaching the semifinals.ByDavid KanePublished Aug 19, 2025 copy_link

NEW YORK—The 2025 US Open celebrated its first doubles trio after Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison eased into the semifinals of its revamped mixed tournament, Collins' dog Quincy serving as the guest of honor in their post-match press conference.“I've had him since he was eight weeks old,” Collins explained as Quincy patrolled the rows of Interview Room 1. “He's five and a half now. He's still my baby. I don't believe it when people tell me with dog years it's like, seven for every year. I cannot grasp the fact that he's technically like a 35-year-old man. It's just not true. I don't believe it!“Quincy is a dignified gentleman,” Collins added later. “He's a sophisticated gentleman and that's how I'd like for you to refer to him. He's so sophisticated!”A noted animal lover—and owner of her very own chicken farm—Collins and Harrison were certainly all class on the doubles court on Tuesday. Making the most of their position as last-minute alternates following the withdrawal of ATP world No. 1 Jannik Sinner, the all-American duo won back-to-back mixed doubles matches to book their spot in Wednesday's championship evening.

“I feel like we kind of were predicting we were going to get in,” said Collins, who cut an evening short with a friend to get a good night's sleep on Monday. “We were talking about just the whole element of, if somebody pulled out, we'd get in. We were prepared for the most part.”All the same, the news that they had indeed replaced Sinner and partner Katerina Siniakova Tuesday morning did take some time to sink in.“[Christian] told me twice, and it didn't register,” Collins said with a laugh. “At some point I was like, ‘Wait, when are we going to get in?' He was like, ‘I literally just told you we got in twice.'“We took a picture, first official picture, getting in the tournament,” explained Harrison. “We're hitting, warming up. Next changeover she's like, ‘Are we in yet?' I'm like, ‘That's literally why we took the picture!'”Collins is likely playing her final tournament of the season after prolonging her career by an extra year, having previously announced she would hang up her racquets in 2024. Following that announcement, the American played some of the best tennis of her career, winning back-to-back titles at the Miami Open and Credit One Charleston Open. But a few things remained on her tennis bucket list, one of which was a mixed doubles berth with Harrison.

I think that's the coolest concept ever. How many tournaments offer people to be able to come out here and watch tennis for free? I think that's so good for our sport, having that kind of hospitality for our fans. I was just over the moon. Danielle Collins on the revamped US Open mixed doubles tournament

“I feel like we probably talked about this so many times, like starting at 15,” said Collins, who previously played mixed doubles with Harrison's elder brother Ryan.“She was always supportive of me when I didn't play for many years,” added Harrison. “She was always killing it. I always looked up to players like her that was around our group, especially Danielle, because she was always doing so well. I know how hard she works and how hard she competes, everything she brings day in, day out…This was the first time there was a possibility, [so] I think I asked her right away.”Primarily a singles competitor, Collins has expressed an interest in playing more doubles but for scheduling and health issues, making the Fan Week and Fast Four format ideal elements for the former world No. 7.“What an amazing concept,” hailed Collins, who will face defending champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori on Wednesday. “When we got in today, a couple friends were like, ‘We're going to try to make it to the match.' I was like to my team, ‘Do we need to get tickets?'“When they told me it's just open, people can come out, I think that's the coolest concept ever. How many tournaments offer people to be able to come out here and watch tennis for free? I think that's so good for our sport, having that kind of hospitality for our fans.

The US Open fans aren't the only ones enjoying a top-tier experience. Quincy has been getting star treatment since arriving at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.“I have to say, the US Open has been hooking him up,” Collins revealed. “He got a wonderful scarf as a welcome gift. He got a YETI dog bowl. What else? He's been eating salmon and sweet potatoes. The chefs upstairs have been making him nice meals. He had bacon and eggs for breakfast today.“What is it going to be tonight, surf and turf?” she said, asking Quincy from the seats. “We're getting spoiled here and so is Quincy.”It's safe to assume Quincy will make his very own Arthur Ashe Stadium debut should Collins and Harrison clinch the mixed doubles title on Wednesday.

Worlds collided for Hallmark Channel fans when beloved actor Tyler Hynes posted evidence on August 20, 2025, that he'd just stepped back in time — visiting the set of Hallmark's hit series “When Calls The Heart.” 

Hynes is currently in Vancouver filming the third movie in the “Three Wise Men” franchise, but took a break from the action while members of the network's communications and events team were in town to visit Hallmark stars as they film various projects. 

When they headed to the fictional town of Hope Valley, set in nearby Langley, Hynes tagged along and even reunited with series lead Erin Krakow, his co-star in the upcoming holiday flick “Christmas Above the Clouds.” Seeing Hynes in his modern-day attire — including a racing jacket, Adidas pants and sunglasses — and Krakow in her 1920s-inspired frock sent fans into a frenzy.

Hynes posted a photo of himself with Krakow, accompanied by a video montage from his visit to the Hope Valley set, where the cast is filming season 13 of “When Calls The Heart.”

The video, with Johnny Cash's “The Man Comes Around” playing in the background, started with Hynes walking through the fictional town and jokingly declaring, “There's a new sheriff in town!” 

He could then be seen warmly embracing Krakow, comparing their outfits, and even dancing together, prompting Hynes' “Three Wise Men” co-star Paul Campbell to quip in the comment section, “I'm getting Back To The Future 3 vibes here.”

Hallmark Channel's social media team also commented, “This looks like a mirage… Tyler Hynes in Hope Valley?!”

Fans were beside themselves with glee over the sight of Hynes in Hope Valley, including one who wrote, “Wish come true for so many people, especially the Hynies and Hearties✨🥾🤍”

Another wrote, “TYLER HYNES! My heart is so full” while someone else chimed in, “OMGEEEE YAYYY!! My fav show too”

On August 19, Hallmark's PR and event team also posted a series of brief videos and photos from their visit to Vancouver, including shots of B.J. Britt, Hynes' co-star in “The Groomsmen” movies, on a break from filming a new Christmas movie. 

With People magazine executive editor Breanne Heldman in tow, the team also visited Andrew Walker and Ali Liebert on the set of the “Three Wisest Men” movie; snapped pics with WCTH stars Andrea Brooks, Ben Rosenbaum, and Kevin McGarry; and caught up with “Hannah Swensen Mysteries” star Victor Webster. 

In a video Britt shared to his Instagram Stories, he and Hynes — who've become dear friends — climbed on the hood of the PR and event team's car, laughing and begging them not to leave.

	The outspoken musician and activist Tom Morello has assembled a diverse array of artists for a playlist in protest of President Donald Trump and his Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)'s attacks on immigrants. Trump's administration is looking to ramp up its widespread detention and deportation of immigrants, utilizing tens of billions of dollars in funds from his “Big Beautiful Bill.” Morello has been a longtime critic of Trump.


	Getting straight to the point with its title, “Fuck ICE,” the 65 songs Morello curated feature tracks politically critical of several eras and include a diverse lineup of genres, celebrating diversity in the face of an increasingly authoritarian movement. “A rocking little soundtrack to enjoy while you drive those bastards out of your neighborhood,” Morello captioned a post on Instagram where he shared the photos of some of the artists appearing on “Fuck ICE.”

Raymond Boodarian wore suicide prevention gear and stared unresponsively into space during a court hearing on Wednesday (Aug. 20).

	Rachel Scharf



The man accused of killing longtime American Idol music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband at their Encino home last month will undergo a mental health review to determine whether he's competent enough to face criminal charges for the murders.


	Raymond Boodarian, a 22-year-old man charged with shooting Kaye and her husband Thomas Deluca during a robbery gone wrong in July, appeared in a Los Angeles courthouse on Wednesday (Aug. 20) for what was supposed to be his initial hearing on murder and burglary charges.


	But Judge Martin L. Herscovitz suspended the criminal prosecution after Boodarian was repeatedly unresponsive in court. He sat outside the public's view in what defense attorney Nancy Kolocotronis described as a “suicide gown” — a protective garment worn by inmates considered at high risk for self-harm.

	“The record will reflect he's staring into space and not responding to the court's questions,” said Judge Herscovitz. “Due to this behavior, the court entertains a doubt as to defendant's mental competency.”


	The judge ordered Boodarian to appear in mental health court on Sept. 3 for a competency review.


	In such proceedings, mental health experts review a defendant's state and determine whether they're well enough to defend themselves at trial. If the answer is yes, Boodarian's criminal prosecution could resume. If it's no, he could be sent to a mental health institution or another treatment program instead.


	Kolocotronis declined to comment following the hearing, though she stated in court that Boodarian has “severe mental health issues.” Lead prosecutor Hilary Williams did not have any comment as she left court and spoke with the victims' family.


	Kaye and Deluca, both 70, were found dead from gunshot wounds during a welfare check on their Encino house on July 14. Investigators determined that the couple was shot during a “violent struggle” when they arrived home on July 10 and discovered an intruder inside the house.


	Boodarian was arrested on July 15 and charged with two counts of murder and one count of first-degree residential burglary. He remains in custody and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if found guilty.


	Kaye worked as a music supervisor on American Idol for 15 seasons. A spokesperson for the show said in July that they were “devastated” to hear of the deaths, adding, “Robin has been a cornerstone of the Idol family since 2009 and was truly loved and respected by all who came in contact with her.”

	“Broken Lizard has been part of the Searchlight family for over two decades, and we couldn't be more thrilled for another entry in the Super Troopers saga,” said Searchlight President Matthew Greenfield. “Super Troopers has a way of making the absurd feel inevitable, and we can't wait to bring audiences along on another adventure with these characters who leave a trail of joy and laughter, wherever their patrols may take them.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Added Chandrasekhar, “Broken Lizard is excited to help bring the theatrical comedy back. To America, we say, ‘It's mustache-growing time!'”


Super Troopers was released by then Fox Searchlight in 2001 after being acquired at Sundance Film Festival. Following its debut, the film then went on to win the Audience Award at the South by Southwest Film Festival. A sequel was later released in 2018. Both were directed by Chandrasekhar and written by and starring the entire Broken Lizard group. Combined the movies have grossed $55M at the global box office off a combined thrifty production cost that's under $15M (before P&A). 


	Chandrasekhar, Heffernan, Lemme, Soter and Stolhanske's Broken Lizard troupe has teamed with Searchlight on not just the Super Troopers franchise, but Club Dread and Quasi. Other film credits include Beerfest and The Slammin' Salmon. Heffernan and Lemme are also the creators and stars of TruTV's hit comedy Tacoma FD.












	Creative Executive Apolline Berty, VP of Production Richard Ruiz, and Creative Executive Daniel Yu are overseeing the project for Searchlight Pictures, reporting to Co-Heads of Film Production & Development DanTram Nguyen and Katie Goodson-Thomas.


	Faxon wrote such Searchlight Pictures movies as The Way Way Back and The Descendants, for which he won an Academy Award for adapted screenplay. Crawford's credits include The Boys and Gossip Girl as well as movies What to Expect When You're Expecting and The Covenant. Dismukes has been nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for his work on Saturday Night Live. 


	Chandrasekhar and Heffernan are represented by UTA, Lemme by the Gotham Group, Soter by Paradigm and Echo Lake Entertainment. Cox is represented by Conway van Gelder Grant, Paradigm Talent Agency and Insight Entertainment; and Coughlan by SBD Partners and CAA/Underground. Crawford is represented by CAA and Untitled Entertainment; Dismukes by WME and Cara Masline.

	A quarter mile from the White House, the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in downtown Washington was once Abraham Lincoln's place of worship. A black hitching pole where he would tie up the family carriage is still here. Lincoln would come here most Sundays during the Civil War, burying his face in his hands and praying for guidance. 


Donald Trump has never been seen here, but the dozen or so homeless people around the church are about to endure his presidential reality. It's just after 10 a.m. on Friday. A woman is stone asleep on the blazing cement while a couple of men in T-shirts share a cigarette. There are exactly two tents, some shopping bags and a couple of carts. A volunteer's phone blares out an inspirational sermon from a Christian station.


Free.


You are laying down the weight.


You are reclaiming the energy that was once trapped in resentment and placing it back in your hands where it always belonged.


You are becoming the one who turns pain into power, hurt into healing and betrayal into a bridge to deeper peace.












	Not today. A volunteer with long braids named Jakia works the half-asleep crowd and approaches an old man. The church has a center that offers showers for the poor and Jakia urges the man to clean himself.“Don't make me go Jackie Chan on your ass. Get in there and wash your booty.”


	The man mumbles to himself but doesn't move. He looks up in time to see and hear the sirens of six police cars bursting the dope-sick silence. The operation is part of a series of raids on D.C.'s homeless encampments overseen by federal law enforcement as part of Trump's edict to reclaim a city that he already rules with a dictator's prerogative. 


	Trump said one of his desires was to take back the city from “drugged out maniacs and homeless people.” There are no maniacs here, just American citizens who have lost their way. Jakia walks around telling the homeless to store any belongings they want to keep inside the church. Some comprehend, and Temitope Ibijemdou, a 35-year-old man, deftly takes down his tent in seconds. (“I've had some practice,” he tells me.) Ibijemdou then helps a sick friend into the church. Meanwhile, the old man mumbles to Jakia that the police are just doing their job. She shoots him a look.

	











	“It's not their job. They took an oath to protect and serve. You can't protect and serve by preying on other people, especially poor people.”

	The desultory process goes on for a few minutes, before an anguished voice cuts through the morning.“The police can suck my cock, Trump can suck my cock.”It's hard to tell the unwell man's age. He could be 30, he could be 50. He's here every morning, goes on a rant and then gets quiet. Jakia explains to the police that the man needs help from D.C. mental health services. No one seems inclined to make a call. She mutters that taking homeless people's possessions while not providing mental health assistance or relocation services is beyond cruel.


	Ibijemdou comes over and asks if he can tell me something.


	“I've been sick for a long time, but I'm not sick anymore. I need work.”His eyes tear up.


	“Who can help me?”


	He wipes the sweat from his forehead and flashes a sad and cynical smile.


	“But it's not about that, is it?”

	No it's not.


	DONALD TRUMP'S D.C. TAKEOVER IS the usual Trumpian blend of idiocy, cruelty, and bullshit. Just look at its creation myth. In the early hours of August 3, a 19-year-old was attacked by a group of D.C. teenagers near Washington D.C.'s U Street bar scene as he tried to prevent a friend's car from being stolen. Beyond that, the details were murky and the lamentable event — I've been mugged in D.C., it's not a life highlight — would have been quickly forgotten except for one thing. The beat-up kid was Edward Coristine, aka “Big Balls,” an Elon Musk hire for his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Coristine is too young to legally drink, but is old enough to wipe out a federal employee's career with a key stroke. 


	A week later, Trump vowed to avenge Big Balls by launching a hostile takeover of the capitol in order to “take our capital back from violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals.” He wasn't referring to his Cabinet.


	I arrived in Washington two days after Trump's announcement. I make contact with housing activists who send me texts as federal law enforcement hover while the local police clear out homeless encampments. “They're at MLK Library.” “Police are at Washington Circle Park.” “Cops are tearing down tents near the Kennedy Center.”


	At first it seems like I am being pranked. I get to the hot spot and there are two tents. At the MLK Library, there is just a News Nation crew and two confused men stepping into a homeless shelter van. In two days, I see maybe a dozen tents total at four different spots. As context, I was in Los Angeles in June for the protests against raids and arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). There are more tents on Silver Lake Boulevard under the 101 than I see in all of Trump's Washington.


	“Mayor Bowser has been clearing them out for years,” activist Jesse Rabinowitz tells me on a bench in Washington Circle Park. He's with the National Homelessness Law Center. He points to his right and then to his left. 


	“This park is half on federal property, so we have both federal and local police to clear out just a few people.”

	











	Russia had its Potemkin Village, now the United States has a Potemkin police state. Washington, D.C. has chronically dealt with crime issues — the city says violent crime is currently down after a post-pandemic spike, the Trump administration is suing the city claiming they cooked the books — but the Trump Surge isn't concerned about murders and knifings in poor and desperate D.C. wards, no matter what the administration proclaims. No, this is a pretend thug's idea of a takeover. Armored vehicles appear and then vanish around Union Station. There are night club patrols where U.S. Marshals film journalists filming them.


	It is all optics. Unless you are brown-skinned. Then you can be slung off your scooter in affluent Foggy Bottom on a Sunday morning and bashed to the ground by anonymous Feds in masks and riot gear. 


	An onlooker screamed at the Feds. 


	“You're ruining our city.” 


	The fed gave the game away.


	“The liberals already ruined it.”


	It's not clear which of the dystopian alphabet soup of agencies this man represents — could be ICE, FBI, HSI, or the U.S. Marshals. Across the city, his colleagues emphasize a DGAF approach to public service when they film themselves ripping down a pro-immigrant sign in Mount Pleasant, home to many El Salvadoran and Venezuelan immigrants. The feds film it. All that was left behind is a dildo whose origin is not clear.


	I think back to President Lincoln's hitching post over on New York Avenue. And I think that The Great Emancipator would never stop throwing up if he came back to our nation's capitol.


	WASHINGTON IN AUGUST GIVES OFF a bleak heat that leaves you unmotivated and hopeless. Everyone who can flee has already left for somewhere with a breeze. Congress closed up early rather than deal with Trump's Jeffrey Epstein fiasco, and Trump is in Alaska rolling out the red carpet for a despot. All that remains are locals and those without choices. Even Mayor Muriel Bowser split for a quick trip to Martha's Vineyard, lifting a page from L.A. Mayor Karen Bass' crisis manual.


	Everyone is exhausted. The city's initial response to Trump sending in troops is tepid and resigned as if the president has the city in a sleeper hold. On Saturday morning, I stop outside the apartment building of Sean Dunn, aka the Justice Department apparatchik who flung a Subway sandwich at federal law officials in protest of the Trump occupation.


	Dunn had offered to surrender to authorities, but instead the feds decided to swat him with a half-dozen vehicles and more than 10 cops. I want to see if Dunn's neighborhood in Northwest Washington is a drug crossroads or an antifa hot spot warranting such a show of force. Nope, Dunn's building is within a block or so of the Embassy of India and the always delicious Bagels Etc. (Just remember it's cash-only.)

	











	I hear noise up the street and head to Dupont Circle. Saturday at 1 p.m. in August is a quixotic time to hold a rally in D.C. but that's what the Refuse Fascism organizers have chosen to do. I listen to their fairly undefined plan to topple Trump which starts with a massive rally on … November 5, or 81 days later. This announcement of civil action in 11 weeks causes a few in the crowd of 600 to groan as if they have just been kicked in the balls. 


	Maybe Trump has finally ground down the opposition. Even the signs looked recycled, there's one “No Kings” sign — the organization had no presence in D.C. this week — and a couple featuring Princess Leia with a catchphrase of “Well behaved women rarely defeat empires.” Up front, an old man in a David Crosby T-shirt beats on a bongo drum as activist Sam Goldman tries to rally the crowd. She yells into a bullhorn.


	“The Trump fascist regime is shredding the rule of law, making a mockery of due process, illegitimately deploying the military on U.S. soil, disappearing immigrants and other brown-skinned citizens into brutal concentration camps,” shouts Goldman. “He is aggressively resurrecting genocidal white supremacy.” She pauses for breath. “Reversing the gains, not only of the 1950s and 1960s, but even of the Civil War and resurrection.”


	She catches her mistake.


	“Reconstruction.”


	Everyone understands, it does seem like Trump has been fucking up lives since JC rolled back the stone. Water is passed out to the sweltering crowd. Some warily eye a mysterious U-Haul truck parked on the dead grass about 40 yards away. Could be set-up materials for a later event, could be 12 Homeland Security officers waiting for the moment to emerge and start cuffing people. Paranoia runs deep.


	Eventually, the protesters start marching down Connecticut Avenue toward the White House. We are escorted expertly by D.C. police on bikes who deftly ride ahead closing off traffic. I don't see any federal law enforcement until we approach the National Mall and nearby federal buildings. And that's the thing. Federals, mostly Park Police, already patrol these heavily touristed areas because of their public land status. Trump's crackdown is duplicative and duplicitous, at least for this area.

	











	The protesters eventually reach Constitution Avenue and come across a solitary National Guard vehicle with four soldiers loitering about. The protesters and the media see them simultaneously. The soldiers and their ride are instantly engulfed by cameras and bullhorns screaming, “Go home!” 


	For a moment, I can see one of the soldiers and his eyes are full of fear. In a role reversal, the National Guard are rescued by D.C. police who form a protective ring around them. The situation doesn't escalate, but I wonder what would have happened if someone threw a water bottle. And then I remember a conversation I had with an activist the day before about why there were not more public protests.


	“I don't want to be the guy known for organizing the rally where people got their heads bashed in or killed,” he said. “We don't know how they would react.” The man grimaced. “And that means Trump has already won.”


	I work my way back up to Dupont Circle. The protesters have been replaced by two opera singers performing “The Flower Duet” from Lakmé. The beauty provides relief from the roadblocks and masked law enforcement goons taking down immigrants. I remember as I walk back toward my car that Lakmé ends with a hopeful young woman dying by suicide when she realizes that her soldier values the army over her love.


	PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED THAT THE FEDS would be in all neighborhoods at all times. I do not see it. On Friday night, I trawl up and down Marion Berry Boulevard and Minnesota Avenue SE, a significant crime district in the Anacostia neighborhood on the other side of the Potomac. I see Bambi and two fawns prancing a couple of blocks away on Hillcrest Drive, but no SUVs with government plates or masked officers in their trademark vests with no badge visible. Maybe their presence would have prevented a shooting on Minnesota Avenue, 24 hours later.


	On Saturday evening, there's a triple stabbing on the 900 block of H Street NE in the H Street Corridor, less than a mile from Union Station. I head over in my car expecting to see some of the federal enforcement that Trump promised. Instead it's just two squad cars. I ask a woman walking her dog if she has seen the feds. She stands in front of a wall freshly covered with poster art of a protester throwing a Subway sandwich like it is a Molotov cocktail.


	“No, they don't come down here,” she says.


	I head west on H Street and I do see action a few blocks closer to Union Station. A dozen cop cars close off an intersection, their red cherries bursting up the night. I look to park, but a reporter friend on the sidewalk shakes her head.


	“It's a bar fight.”

	











	I circle back and park at Union Station. I check my watch and it's 8:45 p.m. I've got 15 minutes to score some crappy pizza from the station's Sbarro before it closes. I can see the military vehicles that have been parked on and off on the grass in front of the station heading out to destinations unknown. 


	Near the Uber line, a guy with a Satire Team Six badge is doing some improv while a bearded man plays a guitar and painfully sings folk songs. A few U.S. Marshals mill about, wincing as a single female protester screams into a bullhorn. She is a common sight at D.C. protests and dreaded by reporters and cops alike. She eventually wanders off and all that remains is two white dudes arguing, one screaming about occupiers while the other shouts “thank you for your service” at law enforcement.


	It's all a bit tedious. Later, I learn something that takes it from boring to absurd. At about the same time, 8:49 p.m., a radio conversation went down between a National Guard dispatcher and a Guard soldier at Union Station who announced the Guard is moving out.


“Main, this is Dragon main. We will update the information shortly. We're just getting [out of] that area due to a growing demonstration, repeat, current movement due to growing demonstration at Union Station.”


	There is no growing demonstration. Did the National Guard retreat because of Annoying Bullhorn Person? The timing lines up. 


	I go inside, but the Sbarro is already closed. Fuck. I jump back into my car and make a rapid food decision and head up to Butterworth's, a French bistro trendy with the Trump crowd according to a roughly 63,000 word story in The New York Times. Steve Bannon has a corner table. I park and peer inside at a Victorian era couch that would not be out of place in the waiting area of a chain of British-themed pubs attached to Holiday Inns. It looks too sad so I decided not to drop a hundred dollars on a meal. I head back to my hotel.


	Two days later, Donald Trump boasts, “People that haven't gone out to dinner in Washington, D.C., in two years, are going out to dinner, and the restaurants, the last two days, were busier than they've been in a long time.” 


	Everyone knows this is a lie but few complain. What's the point? The anesthesia is working. 


	THE FAKE ARMIES OF THE NIGHT mobilize not far from where Big Balls fell. It's 10 p.m. on a weekend night and the heat is not yet dead in the U Street Corridor, D.C.'s party district. Bars and nightclubs stretch for blocks where frats boys with backward baseball caps blend with girls from Howard University in midriff tops teetering precariously in high heels. I've posted up at Solly's Tavern, a cozy dive bar, with vodka on the rocks while a couple other reporters alternate between hydration and dehydration, toggling between PBRs and water bottles. A longtime U Street observer guesses the crowd on the street is maybe half of what you would expect on a weekend night. Trump's purge is killing his beloved capitalism. 


	The president's task force has become entrenched in just 100 hours. Eventually, around 10 officers walk past Solly's. I follow as they proudly walk past a hundred pairs of eyes that glare down at them with scorn. Eventually, a bantam-sized officer with a receding hairline pulls out his phone and begins filming the reporters trailing behind him. The caravan of cops stops and a woman asks the officer why he is filming her. He shrugs and offers a shit-eating smile. The woman is not amused.

	











	“What's your badge number?”


	The cop smiles and shakes his head.


	“We're on the streets of Washington, D.C., to keep the citizens as safe as possible on a mandate handed down from the president. We're gonna keep the city streets safe from murderers, rapists, and robbers.”


	A gathering crowd grumbles. The woman asks a relevant question.


	“So where are the murderers and robbers?”


	“We've made over a hundred arrests,” says the smug cop.


	He's just parroting a line that White House officials will cite repeatedly: 212 arrests made in high-crime areas and 68 guns pulled off the street. Alas, it's Trump who has maintained in his jihad against a Labor Department statistician that officials can make stats say whatever they like. The number of guns seized is not appreciably higher than what the D.C. police seizes in an average week and those guns seized are being replaced by new guns as the Trump administration “streamlines” the gun purchasing process in the city and U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro admitted that folks caught carrying rifles in the city would no longer face felony prosecution.


	Back on the street, the cop gives a wave and moves on. It's time for Paul Blart without a Segway to patrol the other side of the street.


	ON A USUAL SUNDAY MORNING, the Salvadoran vendors outside of the Target in the immigrant heavy neighborhood of Columbia are out hawking fruit and T-shirts. But not today. Instead, black SUVs creep by. 


	For Salvadorans of a certain vintage, it brings back memories of Archbishop Óscar Romero. The bishop gave a sermon in 1980 urging soldiers to obey God's law and not the commands of the government's right-wing death squads. The next day, Romero was shot dead by his own government while saying Mass in San Salvador. A shrine to the now venerated Romero is near the altar in The Shrine Of The Sacred Heart, a Catholic church a few blocks away. 


	I stop in for a Spanish language Mass and it's a typical American church scene. A grandmother says the rosary while her daughter tries to distract a toddler with a Daffy Duck keychain. A tired father dozes off and gets jabbed in the ribs by his giggling wife. The only difference between here and a Rockwell painting is paperwork and the shade of their skin.

	











	After Mass, I talk to an older woman holding hands with her husband. They tell me that church attendance has actually increased because of Trump's return.


	“We need this now, more than ever,” says the woman.


	We chat for a minute and then say goodbye. A young man in a green shirt adroitly picks up that I'm a reporter, my vulture eyes scanning the parishioners for someone else to talk with.


	He is kind, but direct.


	“I know you mean well, but people are scared. Let them leave in peace.”


	Of course he is right. I kneel, cross myself, and head for my car.


	EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT IS HAPPENING, but everyone wants to see it for themselves. I'm no different, but driving around the city trying to find an active checkpoint or an arrest in progress is like catching water in a net. But then on Monday night I get a tip and head to Benning Road in Northeast Washington. A man is arrested in front of a Ross Dress For Less store. Nearby, a Chick-fil-A parking lot usually filled with immigrant delivery guys on mopeds is deserted. 


	I arrive right after the man has been tackled by a woman cop who adds to his humiliation by calling him a coño, Spanish for pussy. A few citizens approach the woman who wears a mask up to her eyes and has no identifying information on her fatigues.


	“Show your face, sweetie,” says one woman. A larger male cop steps in between the cop and the crowd, which is standing at a respectful distance. The woman grins.


	“Ooh, you're gonna protect her! Knight in shining armor. The fascists unite.”


	She pauses for a second and shakes her head before finishing.


	“Goofy as hell. Goofy as hell.”

	











	And it will get worse. More National Guardsmen are arriving by the day, all from red states. The administration rolls back an earlier proclamation and announces that now the Guard will be armed, a prescription for violence as rural Guardsmen are dropped into a strange land with itchy trigger fingers. 


	I see the screws tightening. Ten minutes after the first arrest, I find another roadblock a mile away on Florida Avenue near Union Market, a shopping center featuring a Warby Parker and a Trader Joe's. Another delivery guy has been rolled up. 


	This time the sidewalks fill up immediately with white, Black, and brown residents. The weather has turned cooler and the fury of D.C. residents is increasing. They shout at the cops.


	“Traitors!”


	“Get out of our city!”


	“This is our country!”

EXCLUSIVE: In a highly competitive situation, New Regency has landed Fixation, an erotic thriller spec from Wednesday scribes Erika Vazquez & Siena Butterfield, Deadline has learned. Pic will be produced alongside Emmy winner Bruna Papandrea's Made Up Stories, with Papandrea producing for the company, along with Steve Hutensky, Jeanne Snow, and Claudia Park.


	While not much is known about the film's plot, we're told it centers on a couple's therapist who is drawn into a dangerous triangle of lust, lies, and manipulation. 


	This marks the second collaboration between Papandrea and New Regency, following their partnership on David Fincher's Academy Award–nominated Gone Girl. It also represents the second collaboration between Papandrea and New Regency's Nirokhi Raychaudhuri, who previously served as creative executive at Netflix on the thriller Luckiest Girl Alive starring Mila Kunis.

	











	Word of the project comes at a time when the erotic thriller genre has really swung back into relevance, with projects like Fair Play and Babygirl. Other upcoming examples include the M3GAN spin-off SOULM8TE, Gregg Araki's I Want Your Sex starring Olivia Wilde and Cooper Hoffman, and a Basic Instinct reboot at Amazon MGM Studios, to name just a few.

	Meeting as freshman-year roommates at Tufts University, Vazquez and Butterfield have previously written for Netflix's Wednesday as well as CSI: Vegas. The duo is represented by Gersh, Kaplan/Perrone Entertainment, and Ginsburg Daniels Kallis.


	Founded in 2017 by Papandrea and Hutensky, Made Up Stories' credits include Luckiest Girl Alive; Nine Perfect Strangers, Hulu's most watched original series upon debut; The Lost Flowers Of Alice Hart, the most successful Australian Amazon Original launch globally; Strife, Binge's biggest original series launch; The Undoing, HBO's most watched series of 2020; Anatomy of a Scandal; Pieces of Her; and The Dry, one of the highest-grossing Australian films of all time.


	In the past six months, Made Up Stories has launched the second seasons of Nine Perfect Strangers and Strife, in addition to the new series The Last Anniversary. Upcoming, they're also producing Peacock's The Good Daughter, in their second collaboration with bestselling author Karin Slaughter. 

	











	Recently, New Regency has also acquired “They're Still Here,” a thriller short story from Stephen Herman, installing Colin Greten as VP of Film and Tesha Crawford as EVP, Head of International Television. Upcoming on the feature side, the studio also has Blood Meridian, based on Pulitzer Prize-winning author Cormac McCarthy's novel, written by Oscar winner John Logan and directed by John Hillcoat; Watch Dogs, an adaptation of Ubisoft's best-selling video game franchise starring Tom Blyth and Sophie Wilde; and Psycho Killer, written by Andrew Kevin Walker and starring Georgina Campbell, among other projects.

Days after he granted the embattled rapper another big win in court, a federal judge has offered up his reasons for doing so.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



A federal judge has issued a detailed ruling explaining why he sided with Sean “Diddy” Combs and dismissed a $60 million civil sexual assault lawsuit filed by “Making the Band 2” contestant Sara Rivers.


	The initial decision tossing the case – which came six weeks after Diddy was largely acquitted on federal criminal charges – was another big win for the embattled rapper. But it was issued without any explanation of the judge's reasoning.

	In a 28-page opinion issued late Tuesday, Judge Jed Rakoff laid out his reason: That Rivers had filed her case far too late. He said the lawsuit – claiming sexual harassment and groping during the filming of the 2000s MTV reality show – was clearly filed years after the statutes of limitations had expired.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“It is important to remember the many positive purposes served by statutes of limitations,” the judge wrote. “They promote justice by preventing surprises through plaintiffs' revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.”


	Judge Rakoff said Rivers had invoked a “hodgepodge” of arguments for why the time limits should be lifted on her case, including that she was afraid of retaliation from Combs and his business empire. But the judge said that wasn't enough.


	“While Rivers does allege that she experienced a general fear of retaliation preventing her from speaking out against Combs, general claims of psychological stress cannot give rise to duress tolling,” the judge said, referring to the technical term for such a delay.


	The judge pointed to a recent ruling in a separate case filed against Diddy by an Atlanta man named DeWitt Gilmore, who sued over claims that he was assaulted outside a nightclub by Diddy and his entourage in 1996. In that case, a judge ruled that a “culture of intimidation” by Combs was not enough to explain the decades-long delay. “The same reasoning applies here with at least equal force,” Rakoff wrote.


	Rivers, who became a member of hip-hop group Da Band, sued Combs in earlier this year, claiming he had cornered her in a recording studio and “ran his left hand across her breasts.” She also claimed that he later blackballed her in the music industry in retaliation for rebuffing his advances.


	The case was one of dozens of civil lawsuits filed against Combs over the past two years alongside his blockbuster federal criminal case. Following a two-month trial, Diddy was acquitted last month on the most serious charges of racketeering (RICO) and sex-trafficking in that case, though he was found guilty on two lesser counts of interstate prostitution.


	Many of the other civil lawsuits remain pending, and Combs still faces sentencing on the convictions in October, where he could be sentenced to several years in prison.


	In Tuesday's decision, Judge Rakoff also explained why he had dismissed most of Rivers' claims permanently, saying that the case was not “a close question” that could be fixed by her lawyers: “The vast majority of the conduct … took place over twenty years ago, whereas the most generous limitations period applicable to any of Rivers' claims is ten years,” the judge wrote.


	But he also explained in detail why he had deferred ruling on the accusation that Combs violated New York City's Gender Motivated Violence Protection Act, citing pending appeals cases on key questions about how that law functions.


	“Ruling on what this Court considers to be a close question arising under the New York Constitution risks ruling at odds with the [the future appellate] decision and delaying resolution of the action further,” Rakoff wrote.

	In every young man's life, there comes a time when he must learn what Pearl Jam's name means. For Oscar-nominated actor Austin Butler, that time was during a Nineties trivia drinking game with his Caught Stealing co-star Zoë Kravitz.


	“It's jizz, dude,” Kravitz bluntly explains in a new video for Rolling Stone. (Though as the game's moderator, RS film critic David Fear, points out, legend also has it that “Pearl Jam” was a hallucinogenic, peyote-laced concoction Eddie Vedder's great-grandmother used to make.)


	This Pearl Jam/jizz/peyote digression occurs after an opening Nineties trivia question about grunge frontmen. The game itself is inspired by Darren Aronofsky's upcoming film, Caught Stealing, a crime thriller centered around a burned-out ex-baseball player (Butler) who winds up embroiled in the criminal underworld of Nineties New York City.


	In between questions about Nineties cultural touchstones like Friends, Space Jam, Beavis and Butthead, the Spice Girls, and Sir-Mix-A-Lot — during which Kravitz racks up a lot of points and Butler downs a lot of shots — the pair also discusses working on Caught Stealing. They chat about the Nineties artists they listened to on set (Portishead, Massive Attack, Bjök, Radiohead, Alanis Morissette); Butler recalls some role prep he did as a bartender; and both he and Kravitz rave about working with co-star Bad Bunny. 

	











	“He surprised me with how funny he was,” Butler says. “He was prepared. He was also game for anything.”

	











	“And he takes risks,” Kravitz adds. “He made some real character choices, which is brave.”

	Elsewhere, the two also share some of their most formative New York City memories. Kravitz remembers sneaking out of her high school during lunch to go smoke weed in Central Park, as well as visiting the storied punk shops on St. Marks Place back “when St. Marks was not Pinkberry,” she quips.


	And Butler remembers moving to NYC right before Hurricane Sandy and talks about what it was like watching his neighborhood come together while living without power for two weeks after the storm. “Actually feeling the energy of New York and how it comes together around these events, that the community bands together,” he says. “It was beautiful to see people feeding other people. Restaurants had to cook their food because they didn't have refrigerators that were working. We were having barbecues out on the street, and I felt welcomed into New York at that time.”

There's lots of tension — professional and otherwise — in the latest preview for the Apple series starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, which is set to return Sept. 17.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


Jennifer Aniston makes it clear in the new trailer for the return of The Morning Show: TMS (the morning show within The Morning Show) is embarking on a reset.


	As has been the habit of the Emmy-winning Apple TV+ series starring Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, each season of the media drama tends to blow everything up in its finale and hopes to start anew when it returns. This time, the morning show and parent company at the center of the series has given Aniston's Alex Levy a major seat at the table after she pulled off the season three finale merger coup with their rival morning show network to create “UBN” (UBA and NBN combined).

	But a magazine cover early on in the new trailer asks the big question looming over Levy's success as the company's new, female top executive: “New Paradigm or Glass Cliff?” reads the headline.


No pressure, Alex! Still, she sounds confident as she plans to introduce a “different company and a different culture” with allies including executive Stella (Greta Lee) and news boss Mia (Karen Pittman). But savvy newcomer Celine Dumont, played by Oscar winner Marion Cotillard, arrives on the scene to play devil's advocate.


	“Nice idea,” she says of the “female utopia” that Alex's company now claims to be. “But it's not sexy.”

	











Boyd Holbrook also joins the cast as a new podcaster and antagonist-turned-paramour to Alex, per the trailer (below), but the biggest revelation is that Witherspoon's Bradley Jackson is not in jail. The mega cliffhanger from the season three finale was Bradley turning herself into the FBI for her role in a Jan. 6 attack cover-up involving her brother Hal (James Tupper). Since the new fourth season time jumps nearly two years after the events of season three to the spring of 2024, viewers will have to wait to find out if she ended up serving any time.


	Now, Bradley is back to doing journalism as she begins to investigate a dangerous UBA cover-up with the help of another ex-colleague, Chip (Mark Duplass). Other former colleagues return in the trailer, including Jon Hamm‘s exiled tech boss, Paul, and the former CEO of the company Cory, played by Billy Crudup. First look photos also show Bradley returning behind The Morning Show desk (above), echoing the trailer's theme about second chances.


	“To get what you want, you need to burn the house down,” says Cotillard's Celine amid all the tension — sexual, professional and otherwise — as several characters take on Alex to get what they want. The footage ends with Alex saying someone is setting her up, and the FBI entering the building. “You can't clean a house if you're about to blow it up,” Alex argues to Bradley, the friends and former co-anchors once again coming at each other from opposing sides of a moral argument.

	











	Meanwhile, longtime will-they-won't-they pair Bradley and Cory are also briefly seen cozying up.


	“Everybody has to face what they have to face,” showrunner Charlotte Stoudt told The Hollywood Reporter after season three's finale. “There is accountability, but it's not bleak. Even when you have to be accountable for something, life can go on.”


	Here's the official season four logline: “The Morning Show opens in spring 2024, almost two years after the events of season three. With the UBA-NBN merger complete, the newsroom must grapple with newfound responsibility, hidden motives and the elusive nature of truth in a polarized America. In a world rife with deepfakes, conspiracy theories and corporate cover-ups — who can you trust? And how can you know what's actually real?”


	The ensemble cast includes Aniston, Witherspoon, Crudup, Duplass, Nestor Carbonell, Pittman, Lee, Nicole Beharie and Hamm, welcoming Aaron Pierre, William Jackson Harper, Holbrook, Cotillard and Jeremy Irons.


	The Media Res-produced drama is executive produced by showrunner Stoudt, director Mimi Leder, Michael Ellenberg and Lindsey Springer through Media Res, Witherspoon and Lauren Neustadter for Hello Sunshine, Aniston and Kristin Hahn for Echo Films, along with Zander Lehmann and Micah Schraft.


	The 10-episode season returns Sept. 17 on Apple TV+ with one episode, followed by a weekly Friday release through Nov. 19.

Madonna celebrated her 67th birthday in spectacular fashion by fulfilling a longtime dream to attend the historic Palio di Siena horse race in Italy, surrounded by her children and boyfriend Akeem Morris during an unforgettable Tuscan getaway.

The Queen of Pop marked her special day on August 16 by experiencing one of Italy's most treasured traditions, sharing the moments with her family while staying at a luxurious 16th-century villa in the heart of Tuscany's wine country.

Madonna's birthday celebration centered around attending the legendary Palio di Siena, a horse race that has entertained audiences since medieval times. The event held special significance for the singer, who had long hoped to witness this particular tradition on her birthday.

“My Dream for many years has been to watch the Palio horse race in Sienna that takes place on my birthday, August 16, since 1482!!” Madonna shared on Instagram, in a reel of the spectacular celebration. “There are no words to describe the excitement, the suspense, and the Pageantry!! A truly sacred ritual to witness thousands of people hushed to a silence before the race begins!”

The singer was clearly moved by the experience, describing the race as “impossible to describe” while expressing gratitude for the opportunity to witness such a meaningful cultural event. She concluded her heartfelt message by stating, “Dreams do come true.”

Madonna watched the historic race from a balcony overlooking the track, accompanied by her children, including daughter Lourdes, 28, son Rocco, 25, and her adopted twin daughters Stella and Estere, 12. Her boyfriend, Akeem Morris, 28, also joined the family celebration.

The Palio di Siena has taken place in the Tuscan city twice yearly since the 17th century, with the first formal race organized in 1633. The event represents centuries of Italian tradition and pageantry, making Madonna's attendance particularly meaningful given her deep appreciation for Italian culture.

A post shared by Madonna (@madonna)

Following the horse race, Madonna and her family retreated to Villa Il Palagio, Sting and Trudie Styler's exclusive 16th-century Tuscan estate. The luxury property sits on 900 acres of picturesque vineyards and is available for private rental, reportedly costing £18,000 for two nights, according to the Daily Mail.

The celebration included a VIP dinner and fireworks display at the stunning villa. A source told the Daily Mail: “Everyone turned out to support Madonna and she had an amazing trip. She loves to celebrate her birthday in Italy and this was one of the best yet. She's been friends with Sting for years so I'm sure he will have sorted her out mates rates for his huge estate.”

One of the celebration's most talked-about elements was Madonna's birthday cake, which featured a pink Labubu doll design complete with her iconic conical bra look. The cake included the playful message “Happy birthday Madudu.” 

Swedish fashion designer Bea Åkerlund documented parts of the celebration on Instagram, sharing glimpses of the fireworks and festivities at the magnificent estate.

The birthday celebration comes just months after Madonna honored her father, Silvio Ciccone's, 94th birthday with a touching tribute. “He has survived many wars and many losses in his life, and he still has a sense of humor and a strong desire to get out of bed every morning and make the most of his day,” she wrote.

Celebrity friends, including Andy Cohen, who wrote “Happy birthday Queen,” Katy Perry, who added “MY QUEEN,” and Justin Trudeau, Former Prime Minister of Canada, who added, “Happy happy birthday,” joined in wishing Madonna well on social media.

Who doesn't love a scathing showbiz satire? Netflix India is gearing up for “The Ba***ds of Bollywood,” a series in which the new and old blood of the world's biggest film industry face off in spectacular fashion.

The trailer introduces Aasmaan Singh (Lakshya), a newcomer with no industry ties who has quickly become one of its biggest stars — but doesn't care for that label. There are lots of stars, he says in the trailer, but only one Aasmaan (his name means sky). If anything could bring this hero crashing back down to Earth, it's a budding romance with the daughter of Bollywood's biggest name, Ajay Talwar (Bobby Deol), and all the friends and enemies that come with that territory.

“The Ba***ds of Bollywood” marks the writing and directing debut of Aryan Khan, who knows a thing or two about the industry's inner workings and growing up with a mega-famous parent as son of global superstar Shah Rukh Khan (who narrates the first few lines of the trailer). The series was first announced in November of 2024 and, according to Netflix, “blends self-aware humor with a high-stakes narrative — and promises a host of wicked cameos, blockbuster thrills and an unforgettable ride into the world of Indian cinema.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“It's a complete Bollywood entertainer,” Netflix's VP of India Content Monika Shergill said of the series. “The drama is epic, the music is super charged, the comedy is self-aware and refreshing, and the characters are larger than life.” 

The trailer reveals cameos from Salman Khan, Karan Johar, and Ranveer Singh, most likely as themselves — which sets a high bar for any unannounced guest stars. Gauri Khan's Red Chillies Entertainment will executive produce the series. Additional cast includes Sahher Bambba, Raghav Juyal, Gautami Kapoor, Mona Singh, Manish Chaudhari, Manoj Pahwa, Vijayant Kohli, and Anya Singh. Aryan Khan himself introduced the teaser a few days prior, beginning with an SRK monologue from the film “Mohabbatein” and then quickly shifting into the more irreverent tone of this forthcoming show.

“Aadat daal lo,” he said of the shift — get used to it. This is definitely not his father's Netflix series.

“The Ba***ds of Bollywood” starts streaming Thursday, September 18 on Netflix. Watch the full trailer below.

Mo Chara appeared in a London court for the latest hearing in the case.

	Thomas Smith



Kneecap's Mo Chara appeared in a London court on Wednesday (Aug. 20) for the latest hearing relating to an alleged terror offense.


	In May, the MC (born Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh) was charged for allegedly showing support for militant organizations Hamas and Hezbollah – both of which are proscribed as terror groups by U.K. law – in resurfaced videos from a past concert. The video appeared to show Chara shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah” and displaying a Hezbollah flag at a show in London in November 2024.


	Speaking on their social platforms, the group called the charge “a carnival of distraction” from what they see as the real issue at hand: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people. It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes.” The group have said they will fight the charge and claimed that “we will win.”

	Ó hAnnaidh appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday (Aug. 20) for the latest hearing alongside his bandmates Móglaí Bap (Naoise Ó Cairealláin) and DJ Próvaí (JJ Ó Dochartaigh) and the band's manager, according the BBC and other outlets. The 27-year-old artist first appeared in court in June, and was granted unconditional bail.

	During Wednesday's proceedings, Ó hAnnaidh spoke to confirm his name and address. He is yet to enter a plea in relation to the charges. 


	The court heard three hours of legal arguments related to the charge. Ó hAnnaidh's defense team are seeking to throw the case out, citing an error in the way the charge against him was brought by London's Metropolitan Police.


Brenda Campbell KC, representing the defendant, told the court the Attorney General had not given permission for the case to be brought against Ó hAnnaidh when police informed him he was to face a terror charge on May 21, and was outside the six month time limit for prosecution.


	Prosecutor Michael Bisgrove said that permission was not required until the defendant's first court appearance which took place on June 18.


	Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring said he will issue a ruling on the matter in the coming weeks; the case has been adjourned until Sept.r 26, when he will decide whether Ó hAnnaidh will stand trial. The defendant remains free on unconditional bail.


	Supporters of the band were present outside the courts to show solidarity and wave Palestinian flags and banners. Ó hAnnaidh was mobbed by fans and media as he entered the court, with chants of “Free Mo Chara” breaking out.


	In April 2025, the group ended their Coachella sets with a message that stated: “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people. It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes. F–k Israel; free Palestine.” A number of industry names including Sharon Osbourne called for them to be removed from the bill and their work visas to be revoked.


	The band were subsequently removed from a number of festivals, including TRSNMT in Glasgow, Scotland, and were banned from entering Hungary to perform at Sziget Festival. They did, however, perform at Glastonbury Festival in late June and drew a huge crowd, and recently appeared at Green Man Festival in Wales this past weekend.


	The Northern Irish hip-hop trio released their breakthrough album Fine Art in 2024 alongside a self-titled biopic which saw critical acclaim, and was nominated for an Academy Award as well as winning a BAFTA prize.

Gavin Adcock is the singer and songwriter behind streaming hits like “A Cigarette” and “Need To,” and the new album Own Worst Enemy, but the country artist is also an unabashed provocateur. In a new interview on Rolling Stone's Nashville Now podcast, Adcock took aim at Zach Bryan, whom he recently called out for the way Bryan responded to a teenage fan on social media. “You're not entitled after someone plays two and a half hours to a picture or a hello,” Bryan wrote, adding the acronym “GOMD.”


	“It wasn't about not wanting to sign autographs after a show, it's like letting a 14-year-old kid rant, without saying, ‘get off my dick.' You're bigger than that,” says Adock, who went on to say he feels like Bryan isn't the public persona he projects.

A post shared by Rolling Stone (@rollingstone)


	“I think that Zach Bryan puts on a big mask in his day-to-day life and sometimes he can't help but rip it off and show his true colors,” Adcock says. “I don't know if Zach Bryan's really that great of a person.”

	











	Adcock, a Georgia native, hasn't been shy about courting controversy since signing with Warner Music Nashville last year. In June, he made headlines for declaring onstage that Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter album, the Grammy winner for Best Country Album, isn't his definition of country music. A month later, he chose to insert himself into the Bryan dust-up. And just after this interview was recorded, Adcock called out Charley Crockett, after the Dollar a Day singer-songwriter posted his thoughts about authenticity in country music.

	











	“I wouldn't say Zach Bryan is my buddy. I ain't his buddy, he ain't my buddy. I ain't met the guy,” he tells Nashville Now. “I don't need him.”

	Adcock's new album Own Worst Enemy dropped last week. In a bit of fortuitous timing, he stepped in for Ella Langley to open two shows for Morgan Wallen that same weekend in Cleveland. He says Wallen is a template for the type of career he'd like to have: “Morgan's the best right now. You go after the best.”

	The TV take of Archie Comics, Riverdale, spanned 137 episodes on the CW, and ran from 2017-2023, but Universal Pictures believes there are more Archie stories to tell on the big screen. The studio has a project in the works with Tom King adapting the 85-year old comic and Phil Lord, Christopher Miller and former 20th Century Studios film boss Emma Watts producing.


	King wrote the DC Comic Supergirl Woman of Tomorrow which was adapted into Craig Gillespie directed movie, set for release next summer. He's also a writer and EP on HBO/DC Studios' upcoming Lanterns series.

	Plot details are under wraps. However, Archie follows the high school hijinks of the cute Archie and his main squeezes, Veronica and Betty. Riverdale was steeped in a Twin Peaks-like noir and followed the underbelly of the small town where Archie and the gang lived.


	“We are longtime fans of Archie, Veronica, Betty, and the gang in all of their iterations. When we heard Tom King's take on the classic material, we instantly thought it made sense as an event movie for all audiences—both lifelong fans and a whole new generation. We're so excited to bring these beloved characters to the big screen” said Lord and Miller in a statement. 


	There was a previous feature take of Archie characters Josie and the Pussycats at Universal in 2001 which didn't do well at the box office grossing under $15M at the domestic box office.  

	











Archie Comics have sold over three billion comics and are published in dozens of languages as well as being read worldwide in English. Additionally, over 20 million copies of the hit single “Sugar, Sugar” have been sold. Archie Comics social media has over 3M followers across different channels. Archie Comics is sold in countries such as India, Philippines, Canada, Mexico, Latin America, South America, Australia, UAE, with 100 million comics sold in India in the last 50 years. Archie Comics provides a generational and shared reading experience and, as such, upwards of 4 billion Archie books have been read in households across the globe.


	SVP of Production Development Britt Hennemuth and Director of Production Development Christine Sun are overseeing the project for the studio.

	The White House has launched a TikTok account, even as the app's Chinese parent company faces a deadline next month to divest the social media platform.


	The account debuted on Tuesday and is up to almost 122,000 followers. That is a fraction of the more than 15 million to Donald Trump‘s personal account, which he has credited with helping boost his 2024 presidential campaign.


	“I am your voice,” Trump says in the initial video. Another post features compilations of Trump attacking figures ranging from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Maine Governor Janet Mills.

	White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “The Trump administration is committed to communicating the historic successes President Trump has delivered to the American people with as many audiences and platforms as possible. President Trump's message dominated TikTok during his presidential campaign, and we're excited to build upon those successes and communicate in a way no other administration has before.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Congress overwhelmingly passed a law last year that requires TikTok parent ByteDance to divest TikTok or face a ban on U.S. app stores. Multiple times, Trump has pushed back the deadline for such a sale, now to Sept. 17. Trump has said that he is working on a buyer for the app.


	When the latest extension was announced in June, TikTok issued a statement that said, “We are grateful for President Trump's leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President Vance's Office.”

	Actors love spouting life lessons. Sometimes it's  about looking within, or being thankful, or being true to the spirit of the craft. The lesson Manny Jacinto takes with him to this day? It's a lot more straightforward: “Don't throw chairs.”


	Nonsensical? Perhaps, but for Jacinto, the exhortation is literal. Born in Manila, Phillipines, but raised in British Columbia, Jacinto fell in love with showbiz when he took a dance class in college. After graduation, he began auditioning for various bit parts in Vancouver's film community, which put him in front of an unnamed but important casting director. “It was a really intense scene and whenever I audition, I'm always like, ‘What's the special way people will remember me?' Because I'm an artist,” Jacinto tells Rolling Stone, his voice mocking and amused. “It's the climax of the monologue and I throw the chair. I'm fired up and feel so great and my artist cup feels so full. And then once the cameras stop recording, the [casting director] goes ‘Never do that in my office again.'” 

	











	Now 37, Jacinto is a long way from the acting newbie who launched that seat into a Canadian wall. But as an introspective person, he can't help but note there's an element of this that he's taken with him to this new phase of his career: a drive to prove people wrong. Jacinto's gone from bit parts in ABC and CW series like The 100 and Once Upon a Time to mainstream roles like the loveable idiot Jason Mendoza in the moral-philosophy sitcom The Good Place, all while developing an extremely vocal internet fan club that feels like it would be more in line with the leading man from a summer blockbuster instead of a someone known for single-episode stints on shows like The Good Doctor and iZombie. And now, he's starring in the highly anticipated sequel Freakier Friday as Lindsay Lohan's love interest Eric, a single father and chef with a heart-melting British accent. In modern terms, that basically makes him a Disney prince — a fact that his fans are eagerly celebrating.

	But even a starring role opposite the nostalgia queen herself can't erase the facts. Jacinto is more than a pretty face, he's a proven talent with the demonstrated ability to succeed in far flung comedies and nitty gritty psychological work. But right now he's known for the almost — something that happens a lot with actors of color who have undeniable face cards but haven't been given the roles to back those features up. Jacinto was cast in 2022's Top Gun: Maverick, only to be relegated to a silent face at the corner of the screen. He made his debut in the Star Wars universe as a mysterious, lightsaber-wielding villain in The Acolyte, only to have Disney cancel the show after one season. It's a situation that could turn the most humble of actors into frosty statues of resentment. But while setbacks can be frustrating, he's using each and every one to teach him something new, and prove he's ready for the career his biggest fans think he deserves. 


	“It's this stubbornness that I've always had. You tell me that I can't do something, or you tell me that I'm not good enough for this, then I will just work my ass off to prove you wrong,” he says. “It's like, ‘Put me in, Coach.'”


	Jacinto chatted with Rolling Stone about his ache to bring back rom coms, the bliss of working with women directors, and what it takes to play a memorable leading man.


You're starring across from Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis in Freakier Friday, which is an absolutely huge film for people who still remember all the lyrics to “Take Me Away.” What's your history with the movie? I mean, I saw it just like any other kid at the mall, with my sister, my parents. I wanna say I was 15 at the time and Lindsay was everywhere. She obviously did Parent Trap and I think she was about to do Mean Girls. I was just a regular kid going to the theater, and never would have thought I'd be here. Coming into it knowing that it was a big franchise and a huge success, there is a little bit of pressure. But because [Eric] is new, I don't have those preconceived ideas of what my character should be. So I had a little bit of free reign, which is nice.

My favorite scene of yours is by far the Dirty Dancing sequence, which sees you doing everything from tango to attempting the film's very famous lift. Tell me how you brought your dancing experience to the part. I started dancing when I was in college. I'm a really late bloomer, but then I just fell in love with it. I mean, I say this over and over again, there's no way that I would be an actor if I wasn't a dancer first. Knowing your body is incredibly key for me as an actor. But also just a lot of the principles that I learned as a dancer apply very much so to acting. The idea of rehearsing and rehearsing and rehearsing and then just letting it all go on stage is the exact same concept that I use when I'm rehearsing for a scene. When the camera rolls, I just throw everything out the door and just connect and be present with the person opposite of me. 

	











Most people were introduced to you through the Good Place, where you play lovable, kind-of-smart idiot Jason Mendoza.Kind of smart? Damn!


People underestimate Jason! He was smarter than people give him credit for. But what was it like to have your first mainstream role be in a comedy that's so difficult to describe? Were you surprised that it became such a phenomenon? You come out of that and you're like, “How do I follow that up?'” It's just like, “How do I do anything else after, this experience, after working with these incredible people, after being on a sitcom that teaches you about moral philosophy?” It was peak high-concept comedy television. Like, how do you top that? The opportunities that have been afforded to me after the fact is definitely a result from being on that show. Without The Good Place, I wouldn't have been on Star Wars. Without The Good Place, I wouldn't have been on Freakier Friday. I am forever grateful for that show. It's the gift that keeps on giving. When you do it, you're just in this small bubble, and you're just seeing the lines, you're doing the scenes. At the time, it was just us hanging out saying fart jokes. You never really think that it would have such a huge worldwide impact. 


Why do you think people connected so much with Jason? He's a dummy. [Laughs.] No, I think for me personally, the quote-unquote “dumb characters” on sitcoms were the ones that I always connected with. I don't know what that means for my intelligence or moral character, but it was always the sweet dummies that I love watching. Like Joey from Friends or Andy Dwyer from Parks and Recreation, those guys were the man. It's also that [Jason] has a huge heart. He may not be intelligent, he's not book smart, but he's definitely emotionally intelligent. He wears his heart on his sleeve. And I think a lot of people can use that, especially nowadays.


Jason's romance with Janet remains the highlight of the show for me. Something that I've been curious about is how your online fandom seems desperate for you to star in romances, specifically. Do you think romantic roles have shaped your career?Yes. I'm very traditional in how I view relationships and the idea of romance. Maybe it was the movies that I watched growing up, I was like, ‘I want that for myself.'  It could also be seeing my parents so committed to one another, but there's something so special about being able to stay with a partner for decades. That's the harder choice, the harder path. I'm definitely trying to keep romance alive in [my work]. 

	











That's an admirable goal, but something that has to be difficult, considering our society and entertainment industry doesn't often give these heartthrob, leading man roles to Asian men. Well, first of all I've got to give so much credit and kudos to our [Freakier Friday] director Nisha Ganatra because she was the one who saw me in the role of Eric. She's South Asian, and she knows the stereotypes, the tropes that are unfortunately put on Asian males, but Asian people in general. So she was like, “I want to flip the script. I want to see a strong, romantic Asian husband and father figure.”  That's always been the path ever since I started acting. I think one of the greatest drives for me is to take on roles that people haven't seen before, and also to tamp down those stereotypes I unfortunately had to watch growing up as a kid. But it's with collaborators like Nisha that I'm able to find a lot of strength and actually get things done.


How do you balance this drive with the actuality of setbacks? Your lines in Top Gun got cut, The Acolyte got cancelled. What feelings came up for you? It's this stubbornness I've got, or ambition, where it's like “You can't tell me, no.” I will push through and get this done. I guess we can call it a setback, and from an outsider's perspective, it could be a setback. But with Top Gun: Maverick, like, I was able to see how Tom Cruise worked, and why he's so successful. This is why he's one of the last action movie stars, because of his work ethic, because of how he gets things done. So I try to see the positive, if anything, but also take the fuel of people not believing in me. 


While The Acolyte was cancelled, it doesn't mean that your character Quimir couldn't show up in other Star Wars properties. Would you ever reprise the role? If they'll have me, and if my lower back doesn't hurt, I'm definitely more than willing to come back.


The Sith lightsaber training really kicked your ass that bad? The training was the best. I loved it. There were days where I would be training a stunt and I would just start laughing because I was in pain, but also I was living out my dream. It was a mix of happy and painful tears. It was a lot of  physical work, and luckily, I was built up to succeed with the team around me. Even if my body wasn't cooperating, I would do anything to run it back. 


Being a successful leading man and a romantic interest is somewhat about having a pretty face, but often more about the right kind of vibe. What characteristics do you think make the best romantic lead? Obviously chemistry is key. Stepping into this role, I was more so concerned about, like, the comedy beats, because that was the thing Nisha was really bringing me in for. And then as the character developed, we found the true heart of Eric and the role that he plays within his family. It's vulnerable male characters that make for great romantic films. From all the romantic films that I can think of, whether it be Notting Hill or Love Actually, or The Notebook — it's men that are vulnerable that are the key element. 

	











You've become pretty well known for working with female directors. Is that conscious choice? And what has that experience brought out in your work? Women directors are everything that's missing in our industry.  I think that's the reason why I really connect with them because they've gone through — and still go through — that same struggle of being seen in this industry. As a person of color, you don't get a lot of opportunities, and you have to present work that's top tier. And I think with a lot of women directors, they share that exact same sentiment. No one's gonna pay attention to them unless it's a billion dollar hit or a sold out theater. And we share that struggle. We share, again, that drive, that stubbornness to prove people wrong.

	Their point of view and vision is just so much more refreshing. They're not stuck in certain ways of how to tell stories. I owe so much to a lot of women directors and women creators in this industry. Whether it be people of color or just women in general, we need a different perspective.


Do you feel like you have to combat stereotypes that romances aren't as serious or important as other film genres? I don't know. You think about the Netflix rom com, and it's available to anyone and everyone with the Netflix subscription. But the unfortunate aspect of it is that rom coms aren't necessarily on the big screen anymore, and you're not able to have that visceral experience. You're stuck at home, you have your phone, you're distracted, all these things come into play. I think romances are important. They need to be given as much thought and financial backing as some of these other projects,  or else we'll just constantly end up with these Hallmark movies of the day. I mean, nothing wrong with the Hallmark movies, my mom watches them all the time. But I think people are craving another Notebook, another The Holiday or Love Actually. And hopefully we can get back to that.

	Deadline understands that War was developed by Sky and greenlit last summer before taking it to HBO, which recently came on board.


	It reunites West and Miller, who previously starred together in a British stage adaptation of As You Like It in 2005 and have also appeared together in Burberry campaigns.


War follows two of London's most prestigious rival firms – Cathcarts and Taylor & Byrne – as they go head-to-head in the divorce case of the century. Each side is certain they'll win. But as the case spirals and loyalties fracture, reputations are on the line, and everyone's playing to win.


	It is an anthology series with a new case each season.


	Season one also stars Phoebe Fox, James McArdle, Nina Sosanya, Pip Torrens and Archie Renaux. 


	Kay is the man behind the Idris Elba-fronted plane thriller Hijack for Apple as well as Netflix's French series Lupin and Criminal. He will serve as showrunner with Ben Taylor (Catastrophe) as director. The series is produced by All3Media-owned British producer New Pictures, which was behind 2019 HBO/Sky co-pro Catherine The Great, and Kay's Observatory Pictures.


	Exec producers include Kay, Taylor, Willow Grylls, Matt Sandford, Susan Breen, Andrea Dewsbury and Megan Spanjian.

	











	It will air on HBO and HBO Max in the U.S. and stream on HBO Max in Australia, while Sky will air it in the UK, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. NBCUniversal Global TV Distribution has international sales rights.


	“I am excited to be working with Sky and HBO – two homes for bold, ambitious storytelling – and our brilliant production team. War is a legal drama full of double crossing, scandal, twists and betrayal. The kind of TV show that made me want to write TV shows,” said Kay.

Yes, it's true: IndieWire can exclusively report that Kino Lorber has acquired North American distribution rights to Israeli filmmaker Nadav Lapid's Cannes premiere “Yes,” billed by the distributor as a “biting satire set and filmed in Israel in the aftermath of October 7.” The film, which was viewed by many as being the most provocative and “dangerous” (Lapid's own words, but with plenty of asterisks) at this year's festival, was viewed by many as a tough sell. 

Enter: Kino Lorber, as the independent distributor has not only picked up the film, but is planning a theatrical release in early 2026, followed by a digital, educational, and home video release. The film marks Lapid and Kino Lorber's fourth collaboration, following the releases of “The Kindergarten Teacher,” Berlinale Golden Bear winner “Synonyms,” and Cannes Jury Prize winner “Ahed's Knee.”

Written and directed by Lapid, the film made its world premiere in Directors' Fortnight at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival and was an official selection at the Karlovy Vary, Munich, and Jerusalem film festivals. The film stars Ariel Bronz, Efrat Dor, Naama Preis, and Alexey Serebryakov.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






As David Ehrlich wrote in his very positive review of the film from Cannes, the film “is a veritable orgy of self-loathing surrender that reaffirms Lapid as the world's most visceral director on a shot-by-shot basis. In a movie that unfolds like an Ecstasy-addled cross between Pier Paolo Pasolini's ‘Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom‘ and the Jim Carrey comedy ‘Yes Man,' Lapid doubles down on the frenzied violence of his filmmaking at the same time as he fully embraces his growing appetite for submission.”

Per today's announcement from Kino Lorber, the film unfolds in “the days following October 7, [as] Y., a jazz musician, and his wife Yasmine, a dancer, resolve to say yes to everything. Y. and Yasmine sell their bodies and souls to the highest bidder, surrendering themselves and their art to Israel's social, political and military elite. Soon, Y. is entrusted with a mission of the utmost importance: to compose the music for a rousing, ruthless new national anthem. Feverishly whirling between moments of satire, sincerity, and complete submission, ‘Yes' is a visceral, blistering indictment of modern Israel, and an essential addition to post-October 7 cinema.”

At the festival, Lapid spoke at length with IndieWire, including about the film's out of competition placement and his expectations for where it might end up. “I am saying what my press agent told me to say when I am asked why the film is not in the competition,” Lapid told IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio on the Croisette beach at Cannes a day before “Yes” premiered. “More or less, everyone asks this question. What she told me to say is, ‘Maybe it's a question that should be addressed to the people who selected the film, and not to you.'”

 










Lapid, who said he is not good at being “diplomatic,” added, “Then, she told me to say that I should say, ‘I don't know. Maybe the film was too disturbing. Maybe someone was afraid.' What I can say is that the film, during its whole [production], and also when it ended, became — unwillingly — a kind of tool which measures cowardice and courage, to distinguish between the cowardly ones and the courageous ones.”

A France-Israel co-production, the film has been criticized and denounced by the Netanyahu government, with the Ministry of Culture accusing it in an interview of “opening the wounds of Israeli society” and officials condemning Lapid and demanding the film's removal from the 2025 Jerusalem Film Festival. And yet, “Yes” was recently nominated for seven Ophir Awards — the Israeli equivalent of the Oscars — including Best Actor (Ariel Bronz), Best Supporting Actress (Naama Preis), Best Director (Nadav Lapid), and Best Picture. As a Best Picture nominee, “Yes” is one of five films shortlisted to be the Israeli entry to the 98th Academy Awards.

“Nadav Lapid has delivered an exhilarating, dizzying work of cinematic art that draws and quarters all emotions around one of the greatest political and human tragedies of our time,” said Kino Lorber Chairman and CEO Richard Lorber in an official statement. “Here, he puts his own febrile psyche and masterful skills on the front lines of a conflict that tears at his own soul with no rational refuge. We couldn't be prouder to work once again with Nadav to share a truly unique filmic experience with North American audiences who have come to expect no less from him — far more than almost any other filmmaker today grappling with rage, and the guilt of resignation.”

 










Added Lapid, “‘Yes' is the most difficult and demanding film I have ever made. I am thankful for Kino Lorber's enthusiasm and for their courage, and I am anxiously anticipating the North American release. I believe the introduction of this film to North American audiences can be, now more than ever, powerful and meaningful. ‘Yes' is a film about the capacity to say ‘no' to power — a resistant film about submission.”

The deal for “Yes” was negotiated by Kino Lorber VP of Acquisitions Karoliina Dwyer and Alice Lesort for Films du Losange. “Yes” is a Les Films du Bal, Chi-Fou-Mi Prods. production in co-production with Bustan Films, AMP Filmworks, Komplizen Film, Arte France Cinéma, ZDF/Arte, Trésor Films in association with 240 Films, Cinemage 18 Developpement, ALBI Film and Television Fund. The film is produced by Judith Lou Lévy, Hugo Sélignac, and Antoine Lafon.

Jason Bateman has a list of debts as long as his hair in the new trailer for Black Rabbit, Netflix's upcoming limited crime series. Covered in blood and grime, a bearded Bateman plays Vince Friedkin, an out-of-luck gambler, whose laundry list of I.O.U.s has left him broke, on the run, and shoeless. What? He got a good number. Left with nowhere to go, he turns to his brother Jake (Jude Law), the owner of a Big Apple nightclub, the Black Rabbit.

Here's the synopsis from Netflix:

Set against the backdrop of New York City's high-pressure nightlife scene, Black Rabbit centers on two brothers who are pushed to the brink by their duty to family and their pursuit of success. Jake Friedken (Jude Law) is the charismatic owner of Black Rabbit, a restaurant and VIP lounge, poised to become the hottest spot in New York. But when his brother, Vince (Jason Bateman), returns to the business unexpectedly, trouble soon follows; opening the door to old traumas and new dangers that threaten to bring down everything they've built.

﻿

Though it looks like Bateman is back in Ozark mode—indeed, he directs the first two episodes, and his TV wife, Laura Linney, directs three and four. But this is more of a Jude Law production. Black Rabbit was created by Zach Baylin and Kate Susman, who wrote The Order, starring Law and his incredible mustache. The Aryan Nation thriller surrounding the FBI's abandoned attempts to quell the rising neo-Nazi factions growing throughout the country was one of last year's best. It was so good that Order director Justin Kurzel even popped in to direct the final two episodes of Black Rabbit. Sadly, Law did not grow out the mustache.

Black Rabbit streams on Netflix on September 18.

							By 

	David Fear



	Down these mean streets of Bakersfield, California, a woman must go, who is not herself mean, who is neither tarnished (well, a little self-admittedly tarnished) nor afraid. She is the hero; she is everything. She is Honey O'Donoghue, and as played by Margaret Qualley in Honey Don't! — a title borrowed from Carl Perkins' 1957 hit that doubles as a command usually ignored by its lead character — this private detective is the perfect example of Raymond Chandler's ideal protagonist. Only the couture and the chromosomes have changed.


	Qualley is, by far, the best thing about director Ethan Coen‘s tweaked spin on the gumshoe-mystery genre, and you can't overstate how much her performance glides the movie over an abundance of rough patches and past dead-end detours. Honey is a recognizable archetype, the sort of pulp-fiction staple honed over decades of vintage publications, dog-eared paperbacks and B-movie double features. Such white knights with hourly rates are usually male and almost always straight, and while the idea of a queer female investigator poking around a case littered with corpses and double-crosses isn't revolutionary in 2025, O'Donoghue is still an anomaly. The Substance actor never treats her as such, however. She's simply a private dick who's extremely good at what she does, who's equally susceptible to femme fatales and flirtatious women, and who doesn't like being made to play the sap. And the manner in which Qualley playfully pitches this P.I. at the perfect midpoint between screwball and hardboiled is what makes this movie work way better than it technically should.

	











	It starts, like most good noirish yarns, with a dead body. The fatality in a car wreck in the middle of the desert is a young woman who'd contacted O'Donoghue a few days before; she was, in fact, set to meet up with Honey later that afternoon. The cop on the scene, Detective Marty Metakawitch (Charlie Day) — who, let's say, isn't exactly the brightest bulb on the marquee — is ready to label it a suicide. O'Donoghue suspects foul play. Given that we've already witnessed a mysterious, scooter-driving French woman (Lera Abova) remove a ring from the victim's hand before the authorities arrive on the scene, we're siding with Honey on this.

	The jewelry with the odd symbol on it connects her would-be client to a local church known as the Four-Way Temple, run by the Reverend Drew Devlin (Chris Evans, fully ready to embrace his primo screen-douchebag era). This man of the cloth has some very peculiar ideas about sex and salvation, notably as it pertains to his fellowship with his female congregation. He's also involved in some dodgy side hustles, which leads to a lot of peripheral gunplay and tangential, ha-ha–bang-bang set pieces that feel cherry-picked from Coen's back catalog. Curdled Americana, crime, dumbasses, and ironic violence are several of the hallmarks of Ethan's past work with his brother Joel, both of whom never met a yokel or a dead-eyed psychopath they could resist poking fun at or peppering their stories with. He's continuing the tradition in his collaborations with co-writer, editor and wife Tricia Cooke — the couple were also responsible for 2024's Drive-Away Dolls, another flipped-script genre flick that also starred Qualley. Compared to that seven-car pileup of a road movie, Honey Don't is practically a whipsmart thriller.


	Coen and Cooke, who identifies as queer, have talked about both of these films being part of a loosely defined “Lesbian B-movie trilogy,” which reflects their wish to inject queer life and queer desire into top-shelf trash cinema. (A third film is in the works.) The duo's original attempt never felt like it was more of the sum of its parts, as if someone had simply thrown Coen-esque mayhem and LBGTQ+ erotica into a blender together then forgot to hit the purée button. Honey Don't‘s shaken mix of sunbaked Sapphic noir, pulp tropes turned sideways, and dark humor may still be messy, but it makes for a much more satisfying cocktail. And the idea of filtering this ideology through a private-detective story feels a lot more organic, notably when Aubrey Plaza's MG Falcone shows up. She's a cop who works at the same precinct as Metakawich, and likes the sound of O'Donghue's “clickety-clack heels.” (It's worth shouting out Peggy Schnitzer, whose impeccable costume design for Honey practically doubles as character development; clothes truly do help make the woman here.) The attraction is beyond mutual.

	That the sex scenes between the two of them don't feel overly salacious or the least bit gratuitous is a minor miracle, as well as a credit to the actors, who have a genuine chemistry with each other. Plaza also nails a postcoital speech that fills in her backstory to both Honey and the audience, as well as underlining the fact that both women are dealing with fucked-up father issues and traumatic pasts. In fact, virtually every female character is colored by the legacy of toxic males: pervy pastors, deadbeat dads, abusive boyfriends, murderous cretins. Even Marty, one of the nicer guys on display in Coen and Cooke's cockeyed crime movie, hits on Honey with an annoying relentlessness. “I like girls,” O'Donoghue repeatedly informs him. “You always say that!” he replies, with a chuckle covered in seven layers of cluelessness. Not even Day's 1000-watt congeniality can keep the barrage from bordering on disturbing.

	But back to the saving grace, the main reason to seek out Honey Don't and suffer through its lesser qualities. Qually has been consistently interesting onscreen, whether she's stealing scenes from Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood or turning blink-and-miss turns in films like Poor Things into memorable moments. In projects like the limited series Maid, she's able to inject humanity into what could have been a drama drowning in social-issue responsibility. And while she doesn't bring a deeper history to The Substance like her costar Demi Moore, that modern body-horror classic still doesn't work as well as it does without her. 


	The way that Qualley brings her star presence and her chops to Honey O'Donoghue, however, feels unique. You're used to seeing people in neo-noirs do their variations on Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall's line readings; no one has managed to fuse those icons' respective personae into one role and make it feel completely their own. It's truly a great sync-up of performer and part. Cooke has said that though and she and Coen want to keep writing things for Qualley, they have no plans to make any further Honey O'Donoghue adventures anytime soon. We hope they eventually reconsider. The last thing we need is more film franchises, but we'd happily watch a whole other trilogy devoted to this sultry, take-no-shit sleuth.

For her first feature film, filmmaker Sierra Falconer opted to combine both something comfortable (stories built around the site of many of her happiest childhood memories, Green Lake in Grand Traverse County, Michigan) and something a little more bold (spinning the story as an anthology, including four loosely connected stories).

The result is “Sunfish (& Other Stories on Green Lake),” the rare anthology film that not only earns its structure, but uses it to wonderful effect. As our David Ehrlich wrote of the film when it premiered at Sundance this year, “Where most anthologies spotlight each of their stories with the mono-focus of a slide projector, Falconer's attention drifts with the warm indifference of a roving sunbeam. Her characters don't really overlap in any literal respect, but they're so bound together by a shared sense of place — and by the emergent realization that they're all just passing through it — that it feels like they're all neatly interwoven together, especially when they struggle to connect with each other.”

After its Sundance debut, the film was picked up by Caryn Coleman's The Future of Film Is Female, and will hit theaters next month as part of the FOFIF's fledgling distribution arm. Falconer's film follows Hannah Peterson's “The Graduates,” a similarly revelatory first feature that Coleman smartly snapped up and built a bespoke distribution plan around. 

 










Per its official synopsis, the film is “a wistful, slice of life drama [that] follows the intertwined lives around Green Lake as a girl, Lu (Maren Heary) learns to sail, a boy, Jun (Jim Kaplan) fights for first chair, two sisters, Blue Jay (Tenley Kellogg) and Robin (Emily Hall) operate a bed and breakfast, and a fisherman, Finn (Dominic Bogart), is after the catch of his life.” Fellow filmmaker Joanna Hogg executive produced the film, and Falconer and Grant Ellison serve as producers. 

As Coleman explained in an official statement, “Being able to support truly independent films, like Sierra Falconer‘s stellar debut feature is exactly why we started a distribution branch at The Future of Film Is Female. ‘Sunfish' is a thoughtful, beautiful amalgam of four stories taking place simultaneously over one summer in Michigan; each monumental in their own way.”

In putting together the trailer for the film, Falconer was characteristically thoughtful about how best to sell her stories. “Approaching the trailer was difficult because of the structure of the film, it's an anthology,” Falconer told IndieWire. “I didn't want it to feel like a mini-anthology in the trailer, so what were were trying to put together was like a collage of the whole movie, and put people in the same space as much as possible. I hope people get an idea of the feeling of the lake, the tone of the film, the characters. It's not a very plot-heavy trailer, but I think the tone is very accurate to the film. I hope it makes people want to come see the movie!”

 










The Future of Film Is Female will release the film in theaters across the U.S. beginning on Friday, September 12 at the IFC Center in New York. Additional cities will be added in the following weeks, including Los Angeles and a planned tour through the Midwest.

The loud and proud Trump supporter was not happy with the Donald antagonist's latest social media troll.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been on an all-caps roll lately trolling the Trump White House. In a series of cap-locked Truth Social-like screeds, Newsom's press office account has expertly approximated the shouting out the window tone of many of Donald Trump's social missives while taking aim at the President, his administration members and Fox News supporters in satirical screeds on X.

	











	But over the weekend Newsom appeared to cross a line when he brought vocal Trump pal Kid Rock into the fray. In a clearly Photoshopped poster mimicking the iconic Uncle Sam Wants You WWI Army recruitment posters, Newsom's team threw up an image of Rock in a red, white and blue top hat and matching suit in front of the American flag with the message “Kid Rock Wants You to Support Gavin Newsom.” 


	Extending the clearly fake endorsement, Newsom's personal account added “Thanks, @KidRock!!,” in seeming appreciation of the unexpected endorsement from the rocker-turned-country-singer who labeled Trump an “American Badass” in an interview in January.


	As you might expect, Rock, 54, didn't love it. In a response post, the “Don't Tell Me How to Live” singer wrote, “The only support Gavin Newscum will ever get out of me is from DEEZ NUTZ,” repurposing one of Trump's pet nicknames for the California politician. Newsom went all-in this week on his challenge to Trump's call for off-cycle redistricting in Texas to hold on to Republican's slim House next year by asking Californians to vote on redistricting in the Golden State.

	











	The Rock AI post appeared to be a call-back to a Trump post from last year in which the former reality TV star shared a clearly cooked-up images of Taylor Swift falsely claiming that the singer had endorsed him. Trump has since repeatedly said he “hates” Swift, recently lashing out at the world's biggest pop star by claiming that he “can't stand her (HATE!)” and that she is “NO LONGER HOT.”


	Newsom didn't miss that opportunity to troll either, with the Governor's press office writing on Tuesday (Aug. 19), “I HATE KID ROCK !!!“

What happens when a white-hot movie star and a champion quarterback team up for a risky football comedy with heart? Chad Powers happens. (Just don't call it Hulu's ‘Ted Lasso'!)


							By 

	Tony Maglio



Glen Powell can do it all. He acts, he writes, he endlessly charms — but the man could not take a shotgun snap. Not well enough for Peyton and Eli Manning, at least.


	“They sent Eli and me the videos of his throwing sessions …” Peyton explains.




	“You watch [a pro QB] take a snap … his fingers are pointing up and his thumbs are down, angled toward the center, ready to catch,” continues Peyton. “With Glen, his palms were up, like he's holding a tray, about to serve a platter. Eli and I were like, ‘We've got to get that fixed. They're going to kill the show if the first snap he takes, his palms are held up flat. We cannot let up on this.' ”

	The show Powell's palms were in danger of killing is Chad Powers, a Hulu comedy about a disgraced former college quarterback — played by Powell — out for redemption. The series, co-produced by the Mannings, is adapted from a 2022 viral video in which Eli, donning prosthetics and a wig, went undercover at Penn State's annual open football tryouts. His nose and hair may have looked ridiculous, but Eli's version of Chad Powers knew exactly what to do with his hands — they have, after all, won two Super Bowls (and two Super Bowl MVP trophies).


	“If there's one note that Eli and I are going to help to make this show, it's getting his hands fixed,” Peyton says.


Chad Powers is Powell's first real TV role since playing another Chad, Chad Radwell, on the 2015 Ryan Murphy series Scream Queens. In the decade since, of course, Powell has broken out as a full-fledged movie star, first in 2022's Top Gun: Maverick, followed by Richard Linklater's Hit Man and then Anyone But You, opposite Sydney Sweeney. Last year's Twisters solidified his leading-man status. For a star with that kind of white-hot Hollywood trajectory, going back to the small screen carries some risk — even if he wasn't also a co-creator, writer and producer on the series. That's some serious (pig)skin in a pretty tough game.

	











	Powell, 36, call Powers “the hardest character” he's ever played. It probably doesn't help that it's two characters.


	The show follows former Oregon Ducks quarterback Russ Holliday eight years removed from blowing the national championship in historic fashion, dropping the ball just ahead of the goal line on the would-be winning touchdown. To get back into football, the otherwise too-toxic-to-touch Holliday goes undercover — under wig and prosthesis — as the walk-on candidate “Chad Powers” at the fictional University of South Georgia.


	When word came down that the Mannings were fielding pitches to adapt the freshly viral Chad Powers sketch, CAA rang the freshly famous Powell and Michael Waldron (Heels), a pair of clients who had never worked together but had bonded over a shared college football obsession. Unlike many of the other Chad Powers pitches out there, Powell says he and Waldron specifically didn't want to plug the Chad character into an inspirational story à la the 1993 movie Rudy.


	“What made Eli's thing so magical is the viewer knew Eli Manning was under [the disguise]. So, let's use the lie at the center of this thing, which creates inherent fun conflict over the course of the series,” Powell says. “We were like, ‘OK, we're going to Tootsie this thing. Let's Mrs. Doubtfire it, and let's see how far we can take this lie.' “


	Peyton, 49, and Eli, 44, loved the pitch, and older bro ran it up the chain at Disney's 20th Television, where Peyton's Omaha production banner has a first-look deal; it was a match made in corporate-synergy heaven, which is almost certainly the worst ring of heaven.

	











	Hulu parent Disney also owns ESPN, which it is about to relaunch in a plus, plus, plus kind of way, largely built around college and pro football. (In fact, to justify its $29.99 monthly bill, ESPN has acquired NFL Network, RedZone and NFL Films, which also just so happens to co-produce Chad Powers.)


	But all that glorious synergy is not why Chad Powers is on Hulu, according to Disney Television Group president Craig Erwich. “We expressed the most enthusiasm for it,” he says. “Are there rights that are involved that give us some firmer grasps on it? Sure. But it's not here because of some contract — it's here because they've created something really undeniable.”


	The Omaha production banner, named after the audible call made famous by Peyton (though Eli swears he used it first), has had plenty of legit success in the nonscripted sports space. It's the banner behind ESPN2's well-watched Monday Night Football alternative telecast the Manningcast as well as the hit Netflix docuseries Quarterback and Receiver. But Powers marks the first foray into scripted content for the company, and Peyton says he didn't initially grasp how adapting the one-off goof into a full scripted series was possible. “This whole [scripted] world is new to me, but I've learned very quickly. Don't ever tell me, ‘That's a bad idea. That will never work. That will never be a show,' ” he says.


	Though Powell, the Mannings and Erwich don't love discussing the parallels, Chad Powers has an obvious predecessor: Ted Lasso, itself based on a 2013 promotion for NBC's Premier League soccer coverage starring Jason Sudeikis. Both series are generously warm versions of their unlikely source material featuring fishes out of water and set in the world of “football” (one American, one British). Though each comedy is titled after the main character, they're both ensembles: for Chad Powers, that includes Perry Mattfeld as Ricky, Quentin Plair as Coach Byrd, Wynn Everett as Tricia Yeager, Frankie A. Rodriguez as Danny and Steve Zahn as Coach Jake Hudson.

	











	Also like Ted Lasso, Chad Powers totally works. Good writing, good vibes and a great leading man are just some of their (many) shared ingredients for success.


	Erwich calls the comparison “a narrow view and quite a disservice to both shows.”


	Protestations aside, Lasso became an Emmy-gobbling global hit for Apple TV+ that paved the way for it to launch an entirely new soccer streaming service in MLS Season Pass. So, there could be worse company to be in.


	***


	Two years after Eli Manning hung up his well-worn No. 10 New York Giants jersey for good in 2020, his strong right arm would be called on once more, though this time not by an NFL team one player away from contention, nor for his famous family's prestigious Manning Passing Academy. No, this time, it was purely for the laughs.


	Eli was in Happy Valley, where the Penn State Nittany Lions prowl, for an episode of his ESPN+ show Eli's Places, a spinoff of big brother's Peyton's Places, in which he travels to locations that loom large in college football lore.


	As a QB, Eli was a bit rusty. He knew that. But once he donned the Chad Powers wig and prosthetics, Eli Manning came out. He got into the character, into the competition, even into the college-issued No. 200 tryout jersey … that was a bit tight.


	“I knew I wasn't going to run a great 40 time,” he tells THR, referring to the all-out 120-foot sprint, a staple in evaluating football prospects. “I knew I wasn't going to look real good. I've got the dad bod; I was 40 years old.”

	











	But he's still a Manning, and the Mannings are QB royalty. Like Eli, Peyton has won two Super Bowls. Their dad, Archie Manning, was a very good NFL quarterback who played on terrible teams. The lineage continues at Powell's alma mater, the University of Texas, where Eli's and Peyton's nephew Arch Manning is poised to have the Longhorns ranked atop college football this season.


	To paraphrase a recently controversial American Eagle ad featuring Powell's Anyone But You co-star Sydney Sweeney, they've got good genes.


	Save head coach James Franklin, who was in on the gag, the rest of the Big Ten team's staff was shocked by what they saw out of this Powers kid, who most certainly did not look like a kid at all.


	“There was one other quarterback there trying out,” Eli recalls. “Sweet kid, not a great quarterback. And so, all these receivers trying out are coming to me.”


	“They're like, ‘Hey, Chad, I'm going to run a post … I'm going to run a post-corner, I'm going to run a comeback,” he says. “They knew I could get it to them, and it might make them look good. At that point, I'm honestly like, ‘Hey, I can maybe help some of these guys make the team!' I kind of forgot what I was there for, to play this role.”


	Powell says that “watching the original Chad Powers … one of the things that really surprised me is Eli's ability to improv. And there was a lot of weird heart in the character.”


	Powell's Chad Powers has even more of that “weird heart” than Eli's — the opportunity to flesh out a character across six written episodes (from a 15-minute segment) being a notable advantage.

	











	After Russ Holliday loses the big game, he loses his cool, punching out the father of a cancer-stricken child. The collapsing dad then inadvertently knocks the boy out of his wheelchair. Cellphone video of the incident goes more viral than the original Chad Powers and Ted Lasso skits combined.


	When we see those kinds of meltdowns, says Powell, “everybody shakes their head and goes, ‘What the heck was he thinking?' But you never live with that person afterward, right?”


	As Powell describes him, Russ Holliday is “an asshole … the worst dude on the planet.” Until he “puts on the face of a good teammate and accidentally becomes a good teammate.” Chad Powers is, he says, “basically Forrest Gump: the nicest, sweetest, most genial Southern guy you've ever seen.”


	Beyond the fake face, name, voice and hero school, Chad Powers is steeped in authenticity. Each of the fictitious South Georgia Catfish's season-one opponents are real teams: the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) Rebels, the University of Tennessee Volunteers and the University of Georgia Bulldogs.


	Beyond the ESPN rights, those are the alma maters of Eli Manning, Peyton Manning and showrunner Waldron, respectively. It's an homage, sure, but more so a pragmatic choice — those are the schools that were the easiest for producers to get permission to use.


	When dealing with colleges and athletic directors, it was “such a great hack” to have the Mannings on board, Powell says — but not so much that Powers' school itself could be real.

	











	Talks with “other colleges who will not be named” were “a nightmare,” he says. “They made it very difficult with some of their asks, even just in terms of using some of their signage and color scheme.” At the end of the day, the show “had to take a lot of liberties with it that no school would ever let us,” Powell says. “We could not afford any [outside] creative oversight.”


	***


	It turns out Powell is not just a pretty face — though he certainly is that, as Russ Holliday, if not so much as Chad Powers. But as we've seen since the advent of the sports movie, it's not easy to “act” athletic.


	When Eli is asked to critique Powell's quarterback play, Powell quickly interjects: “Eli is so impressed. He has told me he has not seen talent like this in a long time.” Eli then jokes that he knew Chad Powers would need a big budget to cover how much work Powell needed to play a convincing Division I QB.


	“I saw you throwing in Top Gun and wasn't all that impressed,” Eli tells him, referring to the “dogfight football” scene in which Navy fighter pilots portrayed by Powell, Tom Cruise, Miles Teller and others play beach football … with two balls.


	“Dogfight football” is not about the football, Powell concedes; it's about flexing muscles under a vat of baby oil. For real, though, Powell “throws it well,” Eli says. “He's an athlete.”


Chad Powers co-creator Waldron says Powell has “the best arm” of the entire production staff — minus the real football players on set, of course. To keep up with them, Powell did what any good pro does — he practiced his ass off. Producers hired Nic Shimonek, the personal quarterback coach to Kansas City Chiefs superstar Patrick Mahomes. “That's why he's such a star, he works on all those little things to make it authentic, to make it look good, to work,” says Eli.

	











	Powell's North Star for Holliday/Powers was Johnny Manziel, the Heisman Trophy-winning QB at Texas A&M whose nickname was Johnny Football. “He was so exciting to watch, and he was dynamic,” Powell says.


	Manziel, like Holliday, was “a complicated figure,” as Powell politely puts it. Drug and alcohol abuse, a domestic violence charge (that was dropped) and struggles with mental health derailed his professional career.


	“We wanted Russ Holliday to be extremely likable, but also a guy who represented a really fun, charismatic, wild character to watch that would give in to his best instincts on the football field and his worst instincts off the field,” Powell says, “and I think Johnny definitely represented that.”


	So, it was serendipitous when, six months before filming began on Chad Powers, Powell met Manziel after playing golf in the Waste Management Phoenix Open Pro-Am.


	“I went out with Johnny, and I was like, ‘This guy is such a blast,' ” says Powell, recounting their night having dinner at Mastro's before ending up at Casa Amigos, a nightclub and bar. “Anytime you catch me at the club, it's always research,” he adds with a smile.


	For Eli, the hardest part of playing Powers was creating a voice that wouldn't make him recognizable to the other walk-ons trying out — and sticking with it all day.


	Powell and Waldron wanted their Chad to have a voice that was “naturally comedic and fun,” Powell says, but one that “would also feel like a shot from the hip.” So Powell and his Hit Man dialect coach, Susanne Sulby, aggregated the “dirtiest accents from the South” and “Frankensteined” them together to get to Chad. “If you were to try to invent a character and somebody was like, ‘Hey, throw on a voice right now.' Under duress, what would you put on?” is how Powell explains his Powers voice.

	











	“The voice is really the fucking shark in Jaws,” Waldron says, explaining: “If the voice doesn't work, we're sunk.” Fortunately, it worked (unlike the mechanical shark in Jaws, which infamously didn't always).


	And then there are the prosthetics. There was “a lot of trial and error” for his Powers look, says Powell. “There are shots that I have on my phone of horrific versions gone wrong that are, like, terrifying. Where it's like, ‘What happened to this person?' This is a show that no one would watch, it's so grotesque.”


	When dealing with hair and makeup of this magnitude, a football helmet can expose more than it can hide. You can't wear a fake chin piece with a chin strap, for example, and don't get them started on wigs and helmets. The worst part: Powell could not have so much as a sip of alcohol throughout filming, as any trace in sweat would dislodge the facial prosthesis. They filmed Chad Powers in the summer and early fall in Georgia.


	“During the beginning of football season, I had to be absolutely sober, which was a first for me,” Powell says.


	***


	With the NFL regular season two weeks away, the Manning bros are about as busy as they were during their playing days. They do their own direct outreach for pre-interviews with the coaches and players for their weekly Manningcast game, and new seasons of Eli's Places and Peyton's Places are on the way. Eli has his Giants obligations (and Peyton for the Denver Broncos), including The Eli Manning Show, and he and Peyton see their appearances, sponsorship events and speaking engagements ramp up during football season.

	











	But Powell? Powell is arguably more in-demand in Hollywood right now than a good starting QB is in the NFL; his IMDb page can barely keep up with his career. Season one of the Hulu series is only a half-dozen episodes because of his busy schedule, Erwich explains — not that he's concerned about Powell's daily planner should there be a season two. “It's a quality problem that I believe everybody will be excited and incentivized to solve,” he says.


	The partnership between Powell and the Mannings will not end here. The actor will appear in other Omaha projects this fall, including on a Manningcast episode and on an Eli's Places installment in which he (as Chad Powers) meets Manning (as Chad Powers, in wig and nose, though not necessarily full makeup) so the original can “make sure the legacy of the iconic walk-on is told properly.”


	Powell's next marquee project is a remake of The Running Man, directed by Edgar Wright. And he says he and Sweeney are “still talking” about an Anyone But You sequel, though they've agreed to not make one “until it's the right idea,” which “requires patience.”


	He'll also probably get around to directing — pretty much the only Hollywood job this side of lighting he's yet to tackle. “That's something I'd love to do,” he says. “But right now, I'm getting to be in film school, I'm getting to work with [Richard] Linklater and Lee Isaac Chung and J.J. Abrams and Edgar Wright. I'm working with my heroes. And what's been really, really fun is — every set I'm on, I pick up things. Whenever that time comes, I'll be much more prepared.”

	











	One thing he is not preparing for is to be the first American 007, an outside-the-box (and kind of absurd) suggestion by some in the business, should the character ever be retooled to come from the States. (Hey, if it's good enough for the pope …)


	Powell shoots that down without hesitation. “I'm Texan. A Texan should not play James Bond,” Powell says. “My family and I joke around, I can play Jimmy Bond, but I should not be playing James Bond. Get an authentic Brit for that job. That's who belongs in that tuxedo.”


	For now, the No. 2 Catfish jersey fits him just fine.

Oscar-winning filmmaker Bill Condon is back with “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” his latest movie musical starring a global music superstar playing the subject of public adoration.

An adaptation of the Tony-winning 1993 Kander and Ebb Broadway musical, which itself is an adaptation of the 1976 novel by Manuel Puig, stars Diego Luna as political prisoner Valentín, who is thrown into a cell with window dresser Molina (newcomer Tonatiuh.) To pass time, the latter recounts the story of his favorite Hollywood musical starring screen siren Ingrid Luna (Jennifer Lopez,) therefore juxtaposing the pair's dreary reality inside a 1970s Argentinian prison with the Technicolor fantasy of Luna's melodrama “Kiss of the Spider Woman.”

The film is the first musical adaptation Condon has both written and directed since “Dreamgirls” starring Beyoncé in 2006, which earned two Oscars. It had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival 2025, sparking measurable awards buzz for its stars, especially breakout Tonatiuh (“Carry On,” “Promised Land.”)

 










“Kiss of the Spider Woman” has also been a years-long labor of love for Lopez, who fills the shoes of the late Tony winner and fellow Puerto Rican icon Chita Rivera, who originated the multi-faceted role of Aurora on Broadway. The star and executive producer first previewed the film to IndieWire in December 2024, saying, “It was my first musical, probably since [‘Selena'], if you consider ‘Selena' a musical. But this was a proper musical where I really get to play three different characters in a way. And so it was a huge project for me.”

Lopez, the first woman to simultaneously have a number-one album and a number-one film in the United States, later told IndieWire at Sundance that the musical genre itself is “where I got the idea to sing and dance and act and not just do one thing.”

In his review of “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio especially highlights how the film differs from Best Picture winner “Chicago,” which Condon wrote. “That film relied on zooms, close-ups, and harsh cuts on bodies, whereas the metafictional ‘Kiss of the Spider Woman's' musical scenes are shot stagelike, with actors like Lopez, Tonatiuh, and Luna in the frame top to toe.”

Roadside Attractions will release “Kiss of the Spider-Woman” in theaters on Friday, October 10. See the trailer below, which teases Lopez's rendition of “I Do Miracles.”

The rocker who began his career as an upholsterer asked, "would you even buy a used car from this conman?"


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Jack White has some thoughts on the gilding of the White House. The rocker who opened a bespoke upholstery shop in Detroit in the mid 1990s before launching his music career — and who has long had a keen eye for visual aesthetics — went scorched earth on Donald Trump's gold-plated makeover of the People's House in a no-holds-barred Instagram post on Tuesday (Aug. 19).

	“Look at how disgusting trump has transformed the historic White House. It's now a vulgar, gold leafed and gaudy, professional wrestler's dressing room,” White said of the makeover Trump has rolled out for the White House, which includes all-gold-everything in the Oval Office. “Can't wait for the UFC match on the front lawn too, he's almost fully achieved the movie Idiocracy,” White added in reference to Trump's plans to hold a ultimate fighting match on the White House grounds next year and the beloved 2006 Mike Judge movie satire of a world in which anti-intellectual, lowest-common-denominator dolts inherit the Earth. “Look at his disgusting taste, would you even buy a used car from this conman, let alone give him the nuclear codes?” White asked.


	In a clever side slam, White tagged Trump with a link to professional wrestling legend “Nature Boy” Ric Flair's Instagram feed in the post, in which he also took aim a the many ways the president is abrogating norms by profiting from his second tenure in office. “A gold plated trump bible would look perfect up on that mantle with a pair of trump shoes on either side wouldn't it?” White wrote. “What an embarrassment to American history. Also pictured in this photograph, a REAL leader of a nation in a black suit.” The post featured a photo of Trump meeting with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy this week in the dizzyingly filigreed Oval Office.

	











	In keeping with the wrestling metaphor, White House communications director Steven Cheung attempted his own smack down of the 12-time Grammy-winning rocker who is slated to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the White Stripes in November. “Jack White is a washed-up, has-been loser posting drivel on social media because he clearly has ample time on his hands due to his stalled career,” Cheung told The Daily Beast. “It's apparent he's been masquerading as a real artist, because he fails to appreciate, and quite frankly disrespects, the splendor and significance of the Oval Office inside of ‘The People's House.'” At press time it appeared White had not responded to Cheung's comments.


	In May, photo editor and creative consultant Emily Keegin wrote an essay in The New York Times entitled “Trump's Oval Office is a Gilded Rococo Nightmare. Help,” in which she noted that in 2017 journalist Peter York referred to Trump's shiny aesthetic as “dictator chic,” likening the former reality TV star's New York penthouse style to that of late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi's opulent, garish mansions. In the commentary, Keegin described the 14K White House redesign as, “a parade of golden objects that march across the mantel, relegating the traditional Swedish ivy to a greenhouse. Gilded Rococo wall appliqués, nearly identical to the ones at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, are stuck to the fireplace and office walls with the same level of aesthetic consideration a child gives her doll's face before covering it in nail polish.”

The metal icon was unable to perform at Ozzy's final Back to the Beginning show last month due to a previously scheduled show.

Judas Priest singer Rob Halford revealed in May that he was “gutted” to miss Ozzy Osbourne‘s final show with Black Sabbath at July's Back to the Beginning concert. Halford, who, like Ozzy, is from Birmingham, England, was, unfortunately, double-booked on July 5, slated to play a 60th anniversary show with the Scorpions in Hanover, Germany that day.


	Now, following Osbourne's death on July 22 at age 76 from a heart attack, Halford is opening up about his grief following the loss of the fellow metal icon who meant so much to him. In an interview with Talkin' Rock with Meltdown, Halford, 73, described getting a call on the day Osbourne passed and just losing it. “I just put the phone down in my hotel room… and I just curled up in a ball and bawled my eyes out for hours,” he said.

	“I just couldn't believe it. I still can't believe it now,” Halford added. “I'm still grieving like so many people.” Halford said Priest had a show the next day and he described struggling to process “all this tragedy, all this love, because I've never seen such an outpouring of love.” But just like other times when the band had to perform after losing one of their beloved musical compatriots, the show went on and Priest played a tune called “Giants in the Sky” from the band's 2024 Invincible Shield album about legends that have moved on from this world. The song features the now apropos refrain, “Homage to the legends/ Till the bitter end/ Leaving such a legacy my friends/ Giants in the sky/ You won't ever die.”




	During that show, Halford said he referenced Motorhead's Lemmy Kilmister, Ronnie James Dio, Janis Joplin, Freddie Mercury and, for that night, Ozzy. “I said to everybody, this is so much to try and comprehend and so tough. But Ozzy would say ‘Let's party. Let's rock and roll. Let's live it up, let's enjoy.' That was in his heart, his soul and his spirit. Whenever we did shows together he would always say to me, ‘Did you have a good time?,'” Halford explained.


	Halford recalled Osbourne's generosity and caring nature, as well as his musical feats with Sabbath and as a solo act. “He was the embodiment of kindness in that respect,” he said. The leather and studs rocker suggested that we should keep talking about and celebrating Ozzy and his legacy, to get through the grief by thinking about the joy and good times. And, in Priest's case, by continuing to perform Sabbath's “War Pigs” at the top of their shows.


	Osbourne died 17 days after playing his final show, where he played a solo set and a reunion gig with the original Sabbath lineup at Birmingham's Villa Park alongside fellow metal legends including Guns N' Roses, Tool, Metallica, Gojira and many more.

Non-traditional relationship structures have fully permeated the romantic zeitgeist. For better or worse, dating app profiles are replete with terms like “ethical non-monogamy,” “polycule,” “friends with benefits,” to the dismay of those simply seeking the one. Cinematically, these dynamics have long served as thematic fodder, among them Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice, many a Gregg Araki movie, and No Strings Attached and Friends With Benefits (both, oddly, released in 2011). But not until Splitsville has a film so aptly addressed the current moment as it pertains to an ever-expanding view of successful relationships. Director, actor, and co-writer Michael Angelo Covino re-teams with co-star and co-writer Kyle Marvin (resuming the same duties from their winning 2019 friendship drama The Climb), clearly finding inspiration from their longstanding connection and personal lives.

Splitsville opens with newlyweds Carey (Marvin) and Ashley (an excellent Adria Arjona) as they belt a duet while driving in their vintage hatchback. After witnessing a shocking accident (featuring a dash of lewd levity), Ashley admits to her husband that she wants out of their marriage. Unable to face this harsh truth, Carey literally runs to his best friend Paul (Covino) and his wife Julie (Dakota Johnson) for advice. They greet him with open arms (and a $20 bottle of artesian water), and Carey manages to find cold comfort in their seemingly seamless union. They are attentive, affectionate, and open with one another, the last tenet also describing their progressive attitude about fidelity. As they converse over glasses of wine, Paul and Julie divulge the specifics about their arrangement to Carey, who admires their candor but, ultimately, appears ill at ease with the revelation. 

That is, until an opportunity arises for him to sleep with Julie, who confesses that she's never actually taken advantage of her laissez-faire sexual arrangement. This is when the cracks begin to show in this supposedly enlightened couple's relationship, putting Carey in the unfortunate (yet highly entertaining) position of maneuvering both his dissolving marriage and that of Paul and Julie. Despite seeing his friend's distressing reaction to an extramarital incident, Carey decides that an open relationship might be the only thing capable of saving his marriage with Ashley, whose main gripe is that she wants to date other people. So begins an intriguing chapter that finds Carey and Ashley accommodating a revolving door of current and former lovers in their cramped studio apartment. It's unclear who truly possesses the upper-hand: Ashley, who flaunts her sexy (yet short-lived) trysts, or Carey, who just as seamlessly befriends these soon-to-be-dejected schmucks, forming an exclusive club of former dates that are practically headquartered in the apartment. 

These subtle games only grow in scope as Splitsville unfolds, played between former and current paramours as much as between Carey and Paul. Easily the best scene in the film—and perhaps its central thesis—is an extended combat scene between the two best friends that essentially distills their ever-shifting power dynamic, revealing underlying insecurities regarding their respective relationships with masculinity. To describe this sequence in specific detail would slacken the tension it so effectively garners, but trust that not an inch of an ultra-modern Hamptons estate goes undisturbed by their encounter. Marvin is particularly adept at utilizing his body (and I do mean his entire body) to yield a kinetic comedic performance, whether it be an inopportune theme park incident or simply directing drop-off traffic at the school where he teaches gym. In this sense, Aronja is a fantastic match (fans of Hit Man are already well aware of her ability to blend the silly and sexy), unafraid to tackle physical gags and emotional intensity with whip-crack precision. 

Covino and Johnson's chemistry isn't lacking, per se, but their arc becomes far too embroiled in the dissolution of their marriage and the effect this has on their son (Simon Webster), already a troublemaker who begins to act out in more concerning ways. This is when Splitsville becomes more absorbed in plotlines about bankruptcy and interpersonal betrayal, straying from its initial focus on the individual neuroses that spring from attempting to adapt to someone else's desires rather than understanding and committing to one's own. Indeed, the film is composed of chapters that reference several legal clauses inherent to divorce papers (a similar structure to The Climb), meaning that Corvino and Marvin clearly intended to also delve into the relevant particularities of such an ordeal. There are far more films about divorce than there are lampoons of 21st-century sexual liberties, so the observations made here tend to be a tad less compelling. Thankfully, though, the film climaxes with several spinning plates that crash in a delightful crescendo, with Nicolas Braun appearing as a mentalist who's capable of conjuring anything except the time of day from one of his audience members.

Compared to Johnson's other rom-com showing this summer, Materialists, Splitsville is a much more successful examination of modern love and its limitations. Even Johnson's character is given more dimension here, the tug between two men and the potential future they promise her a much more interesting exercise than Celine Song's conventional rich man/poor man dichotomy. In a bit of a ham-fisted metaphor, Julie specializes in kintsugi, a Japanese artform that utilizes gold-infused lacquer to repair cracked pottery projects, making broken things even more beautiful than when they were first crafted. But the clunkiness of this device feels at home in Covino and Marvin's story: In our real-life relationships, ensuring that no one has to read between the lines typically yields a more perfect union.

HBO Max's hit series earned 23 nominations, including for outstanding drama series and best acting, writing and directing.

	Fresh off of show creator Mike White's second stint on Survivor, HBO Max's The White Lotus has checked in to its third Emmys race with 23 nominations, including outstanding drama series. Now with one golden statuette under his belt, executive producer David Bernad catches The Hollywood Reporter up on scouting the next location for the fictional luxury resort and whether viewers can expect scenes from Survivor to be written into season four.


How does it feel to have 23 Emmy nominations?


			Related Video		







	It's our third year, and the fact that people are still enjoying the show is a huge compliment to Mike White, especially for him to reinvent the show each season. It's such a crazy task, and that he's been able to do it these past three seasons and that we've been nominated speaks to how brilliant he is. Once the nominations came out, Mike and I called each other immediately. My favorite call was to Natasha Rothwell [who plays Belinda Lindsey], who just burst into tears, and then I started crying. It's hard because obviously not everyone gets nominated — there's not an [Emmys] ensemble nomination. The length of time we were in Thailand and the dedication all the actors put into the show — it's incredible that we had eight actor nominations — but I wish everyone could have been nominated. So I feel really happy for the people who were nominated, and I feel terrible for the people who weren't nominated. But it was a great outcome, and we're super happy.

The White Lotus is the coveted role. Carrie Coon even recently told us that “everyone auditions.” Have you been surprised at who's knocking on your door? 












	Yeah, it's funny. Maybe Mike and I are both so insecure — I don't know, we should save this for our therapists — but we really don't come at it with this idea that everyone wants to be in the show. For us, it's like, “Will we be able to get anyone to do the fourth season?” And that's genuine. I think we're both oblivious, to be honest, to that. Obviously, we see the articles and we see interviews; Mike and I send those to each other every time one of those stories comes out. 


Have you and Mike talked about how he'll work his Survivor 50 experience into the new season?


	No, we haven't talked about that. Having worked with Mike for a long time, what's amazing is that when we go on these scouts for each season, so much of the experience of the scouts and who we meet and what we see then ends up somehow layered into the show. And I know what I know because I was there, and I was like, “Oh my God, I remember when we were in Sicily and that happened,” and he put it into the show. So I'm sure, even subconsciously, something Mike experienced from this past season of Survivor will end up somehow in the show. I don't know what his experiences were, but he's such a humanist and he's so aware of the world and his experiences, and I think that always informs his writing.


As you go into each season, how concerned are you about whether the next cast will be able to create that extended family feel?












	I think it's all organic, but I think with Mike as a showrunner who writes all the scripts and directs all the episodes, everyone kind of coalesces around him. That level of authorship helps create a good vibe on set with the cast and that consistency of there being just one writer they can go and talk to and have a conversation with. That really helps to ensure a great vibe and cohesion on set because you're not re-meeting new directors every episode and having to be annoyed by someone you don't get to know. They spend every day with Mike and there's a consistent relationship. 


	There's no confusion on who's running [the show]. Mike is the author of the series and the director, and so [everyone's] energies are focused on that. It removes a lot of uncertainty or potential drama.


Speaking of location scouting, the $1 million question: What can you share about where The White Lotus is going for season four?


	I think we're narrowing down where we'll end up and we're still kind of having those conversations, but I think it's starting to come into focus.


You and Mike have mentioned wanting to go to Japan. My colleagues tried to nail down where the series might head next based on Four Seasons locations, tax credits and other clues. Have you seen their list yet? 


	I think I saw that. I'm actually curious to see how accurate they are. 


Bets are on Punta Mita, Mexico; Anguilla; Australia; the Maldives; Ghana; South Africa. How hot or cold are they?












	No comment, but interesting! 


What can you reveal about this season's theme?


	Nothing yet, but I am very excited for what Mike is working on and thinking about for season four. I think it's going to speak to culture in a way that […] is going to be relevant. I don't want to say too much [other than] I know what it is and where it's going, and it's really exciting and I think people will be happy about the direction of season four.

Netflix is hosting the special two-day event in North America over the Aug. 22-24 weekend. The sing-along screenings will also play in theaters in the U.K., Australia and New Zealand.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Netflix is delivering the late-summer box office a surprise (and needed) gift.


	The streamer and theater owners, and particularly the major chains, have been at loggerheads for years over exclusive theatrical windows. Netflix has always made it clear that its subscribers are its first priority, resulting in its titles often being boycotted by the bigger circuits when they do hit theaters. But in this case, the rules are being tossed aside as cinema operators rush to be part of the KPop Demon Hunters phenomenon, which is fast on its way to becoming the most viewed movie of all time on the streamer.

	On Aug. 23 and 24, Netflix is hosting sing-along screenings of the animated feature in North America, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand. Insiders tell The Hollywood Reporter that 1,700 cinemas in the U.S. and Canada have already booked the special event, with more locations being added daily. And, as of late Tuesday, 1,000 showtimes were already sold out.

	Regal Cinemas and Cinemark Theatres — the country's two largest circuits behind AMC Theatres — are playing the sing-alongs, along with Alamo Drafthouse and numerous other circuits. So far, AMC doesn't appear to be part of the action, but that could always change.


	The movie centers on the adventures of Huntr/x, a trio comprised of K-pop superstars Rumi (Arden Cho), Mira (May Hong) and Zooey (Ji-young Yoo) who use their secret identities as badass demon hunters to protect their fans from an ever-present supernatural threat. Together, they must face their biggest enemy yet — an irresistible rival boy band of demons in disguise.

	











KPop Demon Hunters: A Sing-Along Event could provide a notable boost for an otherwise quiet weekend and land high up on the domestic chart amid new nationwide entry Honey Don't!, from director Ethan Coen, and holdovers Weapons and Freakier Friday. 


	Box office pundits say the special event screenings will generate anywhere from $5 million to north of $10 million in North America, based on advance ticket sales and the sell-out shows. Some think it could come in even higher and be one of the top earners of the weekend. However, in keeping with its longstanding policy, Netflix isn't expected to report box office grosses.


	Along with becoming a surprise hit for the streamer since debuting in June, the movie's soundtrack also made the top 10 list for the Billboard 200 chart, with “Golden” becoming a number one hit. Other songs include “How It's Done.” The original songs for KPop Demon Hunters were performed by EJAE, Audrey Nuna, REI AMI, Andrew Choi, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo, samUIL Lee, Neckwav and Lea Salonga, while Jeongyeon, Jihyo and Chaeyoung performed their own original song.


	Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans directed the animated feature for Sony Pictures Animation, based on a screenplay by Danya Jimenez, Hannah McMechan, Kang and Appelhans. The ensemble cast also includes Ahn Hyo-seop, Yunjin Kim, Joel Kim Booster and Liza Koshy, along with Daniel Dae Kim, Ken Jeong and Byung Hun Lee


	From Focus Features, Honey Don't! is tracking to open in the $3 million to $4 million range from 1,300 locations in North America. Starring Margaret Qualley, the film was directed by Coen from a script he wrote with Tricia Cooke. The story follows a small-town private investigator trying to solve a series of deaths tied to a mysterious church. Aubrey Plaza, Charlie Day, Billy Eichner and Chris Evans co-star.

Netflix is hosting the special two-day event in North America over the Aug. 22-24 weekend. The sing-along screenings will also play in theaters in the U.K., Australia and New Zealand.


							By

	Netflix is delivering the late-summer box office a surprise (and needed) gift.


	The streamer and theater owners, and particularly the major chains, have been at loggerheads for years over exclusive theatrical windows. Netflix has always made it clear that its subscribers are its first priority, resulting in its titles often being boycotted by the bigger circuits when they do hit theaters. But in this case, the rules are being tossed aside as cinema operators rush to be part of the KPop Demon Hunters phenomenon, which is fast on its way to becoming the most viewed movie of all time on the streamer.

	On Aug. 23 and 24, Netflix is hosting sing-along screenings of the animated feature in North America, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand. Insiders tell The Hollywood Reporter that 1,700 cinemas in the U.S. and Canada have already booked the special event, with more locations being added daily. And, as of late Tuesday, 1,000 showtimes were already sold out.

In a new court filing, Kevin Costner denies allegations made by stunt performer Devyn LaBella, who sued Costner for disregarding safety and union rules during the filming of an unscheduled rape scene on Horizon: An American Saga—Chapter 2. Costner claims that the allegations were designed to “embarrass and damage” the director and the Horizon movies for an “unjustified payday.” LaBella sued Costner in May, alleging that the director forced her to film an unscripted and unrehearsed rape scene without an intimacy coordinator or proper rehearsal time. Motioning to throw out the lawsuit, Costner called the accusations “patently false,” claiming that the scene in question was “one artistic shot designed to imply what was going to happen off-screen.” The scene was “not a ‘simulated rape' as Devyn falsely describes it.”

“Devyn's claims against me are absolutely false, and it is deeply disappointing to me that a woman who worked on our production would claim that I or any other of the production team would make one of our own feel uncomfortable, let alone suffer the ‘nightmare' she has invented,” Costner says in the declaration. “I can only assume that the purpose was to use this sensationalistic language to embarrass and damage me and the Horizon movies on an ongoing basis in order to gain a massive and unjustified payday. Equally as bad, having to read about and address allegations I know to be false involving the words ‘rape' and ‘assault' has been an absolute nightmare.”

Per Deadline, LaBella's claims were supported by the film's intimacy coordinator, Celeste Chaney, who agreed that the scene was “unexpectedly sprung” on the performers. Chaney also explained LaBella's assertion that Ella Hunt, for whom LaBella was doubling, left the set “visibly upset.”

“Due to a lack of communication and the lack of an intimacy coordinator on set (a contractual obligation),” Chaney wrote. “Ella Hunt was not prepared to give this performance. Visibly upset, she left set. It was at this time that Devyn LaBella, [Hunt's] stunt double, who was also not briefed or prepared for the scene, was asked to stand in to ‘line up the shot.'”

However, the film's stunt coordinator, Wade Allen, who hired and supervised LaBella, said the scene contained “no intimacy, no nudity, no sexual conduct or sexual movement of any kind.” Allen also claims, “At no point that day did [LaBella] evidence any distress or discomfort, or any concern about what she had been asked to do.”

Variety reports that LaBella's lawyer, James Vagnini, responded to Costner's declaration, claiming it was another example of powerful men avoiding responsibility for “harmful behavior.”

“This filing is continued evidence that one of Hollywood's most powerful men is trying to skirt accountability for reckless and harmful behavior,” Vagnini said. “This baseless motion is nothing but a desperate delay tactic from a panicked legal team with no real defense. The only things damaging Kevin Costner's reputation are his own reckless, harmful behavior and the offensive narrative he's spreading to cover it up.”

With the final four episodes of HGTV's recently canceled series “Bargain Block” slated to premiere on August 20, 2025, Keith Bynum penned an emotional farewell on behalf of his co-stars — partner Evan Thomas and Detroit real estate maven Shea Hicks Whitfield. 

Many HGTV fans were shocked throughout the summer of 2025, as multiple stars revealed the network had not renewed their shows. Bynum was the first, announcing in June that “Bargain Block” would not return, except for four episodes from the show's fourth season that had not yet aired. 

“Tomorrow marks the beginning of the end of Bargain Block,” he captioned a series of photos of himself, Thomas, and Hicks Whitfield in a lengthy August 19 post. “It's amazing to be part of something so wonderful and it's hard to say goodbye but I'm beyond grateful for the last five years.”

A post shared by Keith Bynum (@keithbynum_)

In his post, Bynum shared how grateful they've been for “Bargain Block” fans since the show debuted in 2021. 

“Our amazing fans have welcomed us into their homes like we were their best friends and we felt that,” he wrote. “The amount of people that come up to us and ask for a hug or a physical connection of some kind is beautiful to me. And while Evan still squirms we all can't deny how special we have felt.” 

“Getting to work with my two best friends has been a dream too,” Bynum continued. “The connection and love we have for each other is real and I'm very grateful that came thru.” 

Bynum also noted that seeing so many fans upset about the cancellation of “Bargain Block” had brought them “comfort.”

“I'm also grateful for leaving HGTV at a high point,” he wrote. “While the decision to leave was not ours, it's clear we have fans that will support us no matter what network we land on and that is a comfort. I'll admit, the anger we experienced in the last few months was tough to handle, but seeing how many of you were also angry helped us see a path forward. Out of the bad always comes some good. I love you all. I hope you love the last four episodes. It was a joyride for the most part!”

Despite being sad about “Bargain Block” going away, its trio of stars and their fans seem hopeful about the future. 

Hicks Whitfield replied to Bynum's post by writing, “It has been thee most amazing experience! Through the blood, sweat, tears, and ENDLESS Laughter we all became family… The future is bright! Love y'all 💛💛💛”

Among the hundreds of fans commenting on Bynum's post, one wrote, “Hgtv has made some horrible moves. Don't understand their thinking. Love you guys. Something better is around the corner!”

Another commented, “Hands down my favorite show in a long time! I loved the concept, helping rebuild Detroit, the history, the architecture, the designs, creativity, but most of all the love and friendship! Can't wait for the remaining episodes and whenever you land next I'll be watching!”

On August 11, Bynum shared a hopeful update on Instagram, telling fans, “I haven't been as excited about the future as I have the last few weeks. Life has an amazing way of guiding you exactly where you need to go. The more you fight it, the harder things get.” 

The first of four final episodes of the “Bargain Block” will premiere on August 20 at 8 p.m. Eastern time, and air at that time for four Wednesdays in a row, according to HGTV's schedule.

The latest online scam to target Hallmark Channel stars and their fans is the circulation of false, clickbait reports on the network's top actors, claiming they're suffering life-threatening health crises.

On August 16, 2025, beloved Hallmark actor Andrew Walker posted a screenshot in his Instagram Stories of a fabricated headline that claimed that he was “rushed” to an ICU after doctors discovered a quickly progressing cancer. 

Above the screenshot, which included a press photo of Walker, the “Jingle Bell Run” star wrote, “NOT TRUE! I'm fortunately healthy. Funny how seeing this in writing makes you appreciate your life even more. Let's all give some gratitude today for our health. ❤️”

A post shared by AW Official Fan Group (@awofans)

On August 16, the Instagram fan account @awofans, dedicated to celebrating and promoting Walker's projects, reposted his story about the false news report. 

“This is disgusting that someone would do this to Andrew,” the account administrator captioned the post. “He's not sick and he's healthy as ever! 🤡😡”

Many fans expressed their frustration, including one who wrote, “What is wrong … with people!!! Why would anyone say this!!! It's disgusting. Glad you're fine and healthy!!!💕💕💕”

Another fan commented, “That's so awful. Someone posting false info about Andrew's health. I'm sorry @awalkk35 that you have been targeted. I wish these low life's would stop already. So annoying. Stay Safe❤️”

Someone else noted they'd seen similar scams reporting false health news about other Hallmark stars, including Tyler Hynes. But he and Walker are both healthy and currently filming Hallmark's “Three Wisest Men” movie this month.  

For this story, EntertainmentNow reviewed dozens of fabricated Facebook posts from accounts purporting to be Hynes or Walker, including multiple AI-generated images of them looking sick or even in hospital beds, while supposedly informing their fans they were gravely ill.

Multiple YouTube videos have also been posted in August 2025, produced to imitate news reports that give false health and even death reports on Walker and fellow Hallmark stars Brennan Elliott, Jonathan Bennett, Nikki DeLoach, Kristoffer Polaha, and Alison Sweeney.

One YouTube video that EntertainmentNow uncovered (and reported) about Walker had over 3,300 views and many concerned comments from fans who believed he was truly sick.

According to an in-depth report by NBC News in late July, AI-generated news reports are on the rise and becoming a significant problem — not only for celebrities, but even for established news outlets to decipher fiction from fact. Google, which owns YouTube, is developing tools to identify videos made with AI, but NBC said the software is not yet sophisticated enough to help the general public.

A post shared by Hallmark Channel (@hallmarkchannel)

Hallmark Channel and its stars have tried many times to dissuade fans from getting drawn into such scams by posting warnings and links to the actors' only legitimate social media accounts.

Walker, for instance, has one official Instagram account with nearly 200,000 followers and an official Facebook fan group with over 16,000 members. 

Hynes also only manages one Instagram account with close to 200,000 followers. He provides a list of legitimate links to merchandise and events in his bio section, where he also alerts fans, “All other links are fake. Please stay safe from scammers 🙂 I don't private message anyone. 🤍” 

In an August 1 post, Hallmark reminded fans, “Our Hallmark stars will never contact you directly for any reason. To stay connected, please follow their official social handles, avoid any engagement with imposter accounts, and report any scams to Facebook/Instagram. We love & appreciate your support!”

Fans of the “Real Housewives of Orange County” are well aware of how difficult a time Tamra Judge has had lately. She has been on her own healing journey while trying to support Teddi Mellencamp through stage 4 cancer, and then Tamra jumped back into the Bravo TV mix. Outside looking in, it all seemed like a perfect storm of stressors that could easily lead to precisely the kind of meltdown that Tamra has had.

Luckily, Tamra has a great support system in place, beginning with her ride or die husband, Eddie Judge. She recently chatted with BravoTV.com about how Eddie has helped her navigate one of the toughest years of her life.

When the reality star was asked about how Eddie has handled her emotional roller coaster, Tamra said,  “My husband has been my biggest supporter, my biggest cheerleader. He loves me so much, and he just wants me to do what's right for me or what's healthy. And he's always there for me, so I can't complain.”

Season 19 of the “Real Housewives of Orange County” has been full of ongoing conflicts, and then it seems to have just ripped the band-aid off of Tamra's old feud with Gretchen Rossi.

“You guys are watching my emotional journey happen right here on The Real Housewives of Orange County. It's been definitely a difficult situation for me because I'm not really great with my emotions, but I'm trying to get through it the best that I can. Stop judging me.”

Tamra's breaking point in filming came during a cast trip to New Orleans, the last place that she had traveled to with Teddi. She was already emotional, and then a dinner loaded with conflict was the last straw. She stormed off and then ended up in a car on the phone with Eddie, asking him to book her a flight home.

“I feel not loved and not wanted, and I just don't think there's a place for me in this group,” Tamra later explained in a confessional. While she appeared to quit the series, Andy Cohen recently gave an update on Tamra's status on “Watch What Happens Live.”

When RHOC cast member Heather Dubrow joined Andy in the clubhouse on Aug. 14, 2025, and they discussed the explosive fight. Andy asked Heather, “Did you truly believe she was quitting?” Heather then replied with, “Yes and no.” Andy then confirmed that Tamra did not quit the series.

Do you think that Eddie's rock-solid support will be enough to anchor Tamra through another season on RHOC?

Lady Gaga‘s latest coffee run turned heads for more than one reason. The iconic singer lit up Malibu with some serious sparkle. The 39-year-old “Abracadabra” singer stepped out for a casual coffee run with her fiancé, Michael Polansky, on Monday, August 18, and all eyes were on her massive engagement ring.

Gaga kept her look low-key in a fitted black long-sleeved top with matching leggings, finishing the outfit with oversized black shades.

She carried a sleek black purse accented by a trendy Labubu charm.

Polansky, 46, matched her laid-back vibe in a taupe hoodie, blue athletic shorts & casual slide sandals.

Even under cloudy skies, Gaga's diamond ring stole the spotlight.

The custom design showcases an oval-cut stone set on an 18-karat white & rose gold pavé band, accented with natural pink ombré diamonds and a hidden halo of white diamonds. 

Crafted by Sofia Jewelry, the sparkler is estimated to be worth between $500,000 and $2 million, per Page Six.

Thank you Lady Gaga for your stunning performance at the opening ceremony.  It was breathtaking. 🤩🫶

Gaga revealed her engagement during the Summer Olympics in Paris in July 2024 while attending a swimming event with Polansky and French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal. 

She introduced Polansky as “my fiancé,” a moment Attal later shared on TikTok.

In an October 2024 Vogue cover story, Gaga shared that Polansky proposed while the couple were rock climbing. “I had never met anyone like Michael,” she said at the time. 

“He's so smart and so kind. And his life and my life are very different. He's a very private guy and he's not with me for any other reason than that we are right for each other.”

A post shared by Good Morning America (@goodmorningamerica)

Gaga has made it clear that marriage & family have always been her priorities. On Good Morning America earlier this year, she recalled telling Polansky on their very first date, “I wanted marriage and kids more than anything.”

While the couple hasn't revealed concrete wedding plans, Gaga admitted the ceremony could go in very different directions. “We actually talk about going to the courthouse just the two of us and ordering Chinese food,” she told Jimmy Fallon during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! last October. “But knowing me, also, it could become like a circus with unicorns.”

Pixies alumna Paz Lenchantin has announced her debut solo album. Triste was mixed by Chris Coady and features contributions from drummer Josh Freese and guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, with whom Lenchantin previously played in A Perfect Circle. It's out October 17 via her own imprint, Hideous Human Records. Watch the self-directed video for lead single “Hang Tough” below.

Lechantin sang and played bass in Pixies from 2014 to 2024, filling the role originally occupied by Kim Deal. In addition to touring with the band, she worked on the albums Head Carrier, Beneath the Eyrie, and Doggerel. “I had to make this record on my own,” Lenchantin shared of Triste in a press statement, “not to prove anything, but just to have faith that music can nurture me back. And it did.”

George Lucas built his Star Wars movies on complementary patterns. “It's like poetry, they rhyme,” Lucas famously said during the making of The Phantom Menace. “You see the echo of where it's all gonna go.” That has proven true throughout the Star Wars canon and beyond. Lucas' prequel trilogy revealed itself as an astute warning for how fascism overtakes democracy. However, the connections between galactic autocracy and modern politics became more pronounced with Andor. Sadly, that doesn't please creator Tony Gilroy.

In a new interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Gilroy reveals how “very sad for us how much it rhymes.” Gilroy says that, as a history lover who has been “consumed” by history his whole life, the show allowed him to put all that “accumulated[…]lumber down in the basement” to good use. But that was more fun in 2019. Back then, “the parallels between what was happening in the world and what was happening in the galaxy and the Empire — those were already obvious.” As he went on, it got worse. “Over the six years we've been doing the show, that little monster got on its feet and learned how to run,” he said. “When Senator Padilla was pulled out of the ICE meeting, like in the episode about the Ghorman senator being pulled out, there was a big text chain in our group, like, ‘Oh my God. It looked like the show.' It's very sad for us how much it rhymes.” So much for keeping politics out of Star Wars.

The police are going to alter an internal document after it was met with criticism on social media. It concerns an "internal guidance document" on conspiracy thinking, which references the childcare benefits scandal. Former NSC leader Pieter Omtzigt shared the contents of the document on X. 

The guidance document is intended for police officers who encounter “radicalization and extremism that can stem from conspiracy theories,” according to the police. 

The document is not a formal work instruction, the police emphasized, but a “tool to facilitate conversations.” It referenced Covid-19 and the childcare benefits scandal, among other topics, because the police say misinformation or conspiracy theories circulate about them.

The childcare benefits scandal in the Netherlands involved thousands of families being wrongly accused of fraud by the tax authorities, leading to wrongful demands for repayment, financial hardship, and in some cases, severe social consequences.

Omtzigt tweeted that the childcare benefits scandal does not belong on that list. “It was and remains a bitter reality for many people,” he wrote. The police state that including the topic does not mean they consider the scandal itself a conspiracy. “We do not doubt the suffering of those affected.”

The police do, however, acknowledge that the information “without the proper context” can be confusing. For that reason, they will revise the document. A spokesperson does not yet know what exactly will be changed.

Omtzigt shared the content of a letter that he had sent to the chief of police, Janny Knol. He wrote that the police's approach could lead to people affected by government actions being immediately labeled as conspiracy theorists, “while any mistakes in government actions go unnoticed.”

Omtzigt quit national politics in the spring. As an MP, he was closely involved in exposing the childcare benefits scandal.

Abstract

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time will increase interstellar object detection rates to one every few months, substantially elevating the probability of identifying objects with characteristics suggesting artificial origin. Despite this imminent capability, no evidence-based crisis communication framework exists for managing potential technosignature discoveries. We present the Adaptive Communication Framework (ACF), a theoretically grounded protocol that integrates crisis communication theories with the SPECtrum of Rhetoric Intelligences model to address diverse cognitive, social and emotional processing styles. Through analysis of communication failures during COVID-19, Fukushima, and asteroid 99942 Apophis (2004 MN4), we identify critical gaps in managing scientific uncertainty under public scrutiny. The ACF provides graduated protocols calibrated to the Loeb Scale for Interstellar Object Significance, offering specific messaging strategies across four rhetoric intelligence channels (Systematic, Practical, Emotional, Creative) for each evidential level group. Recognizing that Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems will mediate public understanding, the framework incorporates safeguards against synthetic media manipulation and algorithmic misinformation through pre-positioned content seeding and deepfake detection protocols. Our theoretical framework reveals that successful communication of paradigm-shifting discoveries requires simultaneous activation of multiple cognitive channels, with messages adapted to cultural contexts and uncertainty levels. This framework provides essential theoretical groundwork for ensuring humanity's potentially most transformative discovery unfolds through understanding rather than chaos.

Keywords: extraterrestrial intelligence, crisis communication, interstellar objects, scientific communication, technosignatures, public engagement

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) represents a fundamental shift in humanity's ability to detect interstellar objects (ISOs), increasing discovery rates from one per decade to potentially one every few months (Dorsey et al., 2025; Hoover et al., 2022; Siraj & Loeb, 2022). The enhanced detection capability transforms the search for extraterrestrial intelligence from passive listening to active observation of physical objects traversing the solar system. While most ISOs will prove to be natural in origin, the increased sample size raises the statistical probability of detecting objects with characteristics indicative of artificial origin.

The discovery of 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017 revealed both the scientific opportunity and communication challenge posed by anomalous ISO. Its extreme shape and unexpected non-gravitational acceleration without visible outgassing (Bialy & Loeb, 2018) generated intense scientific debate and public speculation, revealing the absence of established protocols for communicating potential technosignature discoveries. Subsequently, the scientific community was challenged by a critical gap, e.g., despite decades of SETI protocols for radio signals (Carrigan, 2006; Gertz, 2016; Lemarchand & Tarter, 1994), to our knowledge, a solid and practical concept for communicating discoveries of potentially artificial physical objects is lacking.

Public readiness for such discoveries has reached an unprecedented level. Recent surveys indicate that 65% of Americans believe that intelligent extraterrestrial life likely exists (Pew Research Center, 2021), while 58.2% of astrobiologists consider extraterrestrial intelligence probable (Vickers et al., 2025). The convergence of enhanced detection capability, public expectation, and absent communication protocols creates conditions for potential social disruption. The recently proposed Loeb Scale provides a classification system for ISO anomalies from 0 (clearly natural) to 10 (confirmed technological) but lacks accompanying communication strategies calibrated to each evidential level (Loeb, 2025a).

Here, we present the development of Adaptive Communication Framework (ACF), the first theoretically grounded protocol specifically designed for communicating ISO-related discoveries that may indicate extraterrestrial intelligence. By integrating established crisis communication theories with the SPECtrum of Rhetoric Intelligences model (Teer, 2020) and lessons from analogous communication challenges, the ACF addresses the unique challenges of managing scientific uncertainty, public psychology, and global coordination during humanity's potentially most transformative discovery.

Theoretical Foundations of Crisis Communication

Core Crisis Communication Models

Modern crisis communication theory recognizes that effective emergency messaging must simultaneously convey accurate information, maintain public trust, prevent panic, and enable appropriate response behaviors, specifically these communication processes are designed to reduce and contain harm, provide specific information to stakeholders, initiate and enhance recovery, manage image and perceptions of blame and responsibility, repair legitimacy, generate support and assistance, explain and justify actions, apologize, and promote healing, learning, and change (Seeger et al., 2003). The Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) model emphasizes “to communicate in accurate, credible, timely, and reassuring” (p.45) ways during high-uncertainty situations (Reynolds & Seeger, 2005). However, CERC was designed for terrestrial crises with certain established response protocols. Extraterrestrial intelligence discovery presents a crisis without precedent, requiring novel theoretical integration.

Weick's theory of enacted sensemaking (1988) provides a critical insight into how collective understanding forms during unprecedented events. In moments of profound uncertainty, initial actions by authorities create the very environment that people are trying to comprehend. For ISO discoveries, early scientific statements will not merely describe reality but will construct it, shaping public perception. Moreover, Weick argues that strong commitment to early interpretations during crisis situations can create “blind spots” that prevent decision-makers from recognizing critical information or alternative explanations, potentially allowing crises to escalate.

Complementing sensemaking theory, Coombs' Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT) offers an evidence-based model for managing reputational threat based on attributed responsibility levels (Coombs, 2007). For extraterrestrial intelligence discovery, the scientific community must proactively manage its perceived responsibility for information clarity and timeliness to maintain credibility throughout extended verification periods.

SCCT's theory foundation becomes particularly relevant for ISO discoveries. The theory identifies three crisis clusters: (1) victim, where the organization has minimal responsibility, (2) accidental, moderate responsibility, and (3) preventable, high responsibility. ISO discoveries uniquely span all three clusters simultaneously. Scientists can be victims of incomplete data, accidentally misinterpret observations, or be perceived as preventable withholding information. Such a multi-cluster nature requires adaptive response strategies that acknowledge varying levels of institutional responsibility as evidence evolves. For instance, initial detection (victim cluster) requires expressing concern and information sharing, while misinterpretation (accidental cluster) demands justification and corrective action, and perceived withholding (preventable cluster) necessitates apology and comprehensive disclosure.

Risk Amplification and Information Dynamics

The Social Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF) reveals how risk signals undergo transformation through social stations including media, opinion leaders, and social networks (Kasperson et al., 1988). For ISO discoveries, these amplification processes can transform measured scientific announcements into social phenomena far exceeding their initial scope, generating ripple effects across economic, religious, and political domains. The growth of social media has transformed this landscape, allowing crises to spread faster than on traditional platforms and making them more difficult to manage due to increased interactivity and a “vast spectrum for public opinion” (Apuke & Tunca, 2018).

The SARF framework's relevance to ISO communication extends beyond traditional risk scenarios. Unlike conventional hazards with bounded consequences, extraterrestrial intelligence discovery carries unbounded psychological and social implications. Kasperson et al.'s (1988) concept of “signal value”, the degree to which an event provides new information about the magnitude of risk, reaches maximum levels for ISO discoveries. Every piece of evidence, regardless of actual significance, can trigger disproportionate social responses. Digital amplification stations now include algorithm-driven social media platforms, conspiracy theory networks, and sponsored disinformation channels, each capable of transforming scientific uncertainty into social certainty within hours.

The principles of effective public health risk and crisis communication (Covello, 2003) provide essential operational guidance. A foundational concept is the necessity of building trust and credibility, which is not expected but earned through deliberate, ethical actions. This process begins by accepting and involving all stakeholders as legitimate partners early in the decision-making process, revealing respect for those affected. Effective communication requires being truthful, honest, and open, especially when information is incomplete or evolving. Rather than over-reassuring the public, the guide suggests a transparent approach that includes sharing information as soon as possible, discussing data uncertainties, and even identifying worst-case estimates to avoid perceptions of withholding information. Furthermore, messages must be delivered with clarity and compassion, using clear, non-technical language tailored to the audience and acknowledging the validity of their emotions. The guidelines also highlight the critical importance of careful and thorough planning, which involves setting clear communication objectives, pre-testing messages, and training spokespersons. Such a comprehensive approach underscores that effective crisis communication is a planned and sustained effort built on transparency and partnership.

Learning from Communication Cases

COVID-19: The Cost of Uncertainty Mismanagement

The COVID-19 pandemic exemplifies failed uncertainty communication at global scale. Initial inconsistent messaging regarding transmission mechanisms, mask efficacy, and threat severity created an information vacuum rapidly filled by an “infodemic” of misinformation (Zarocostas, 2020). The World Health Organization's January 14, 2020, tweet stating “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission” (World Health Organization, 2021) technically reflected available evidence but failed to convey uncertainty levels, undermining credibility when transmission was later confirmed (Sharma et al., 2021). Health authorities' reluctance to acknowledge evolving understanding eroded public trust when guidance changed. For ISO discoveries, where evidence will emerge gradually and interpretations will evolve, transparent uncertainty communication becomes essential to maintain credibility.

Key lessons from COVID-19 include the role of normalizing scientific uncertainty in public health communication. Research showed that acknowledging uncertainty while reinforcing its expected nature can reduce ambiguity-averse responses, including heightened risk perceptions and emotional distress (Han et al., 2021).

New Zealand's successful approach, characterized by clear uncertainty acknowledgment, consistent cross-party messaging, and regular empathetic communication, maintained public trust despite policy changes (Beattie & Priestley, 2021). Critical to New Zealand's success was establishing a unified communication strategy through the Unite Against COVID-19 campaign, which provided coordinated messaging across multiple channels and was informed by evidence-based research from experts including psychologist Sarb Johal (Beattie & Priestley, 2021). The campaign's central platform, the covid19.govt.nz website, served as a continuously updated single source of truth that competed effectively with social media misinformation. For ISO discoveries, a similar “Global ISO Status Portal” maintained by a designated international astronomical authority can provide real-time observational data, expert interpretations, and uncertainty metrics, preventing information vacuums that speculation and misinformation inevitably fill.

Fukushima: Technical Complexity and Trust Collapse

The 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster illustrates how technical complexity combined with institutional self-protection destroys trust (Funabashi & Kitazawa, 2012; Perko, 2015). Delayed radiation data release, overly technical language that obscured rather than clarified risks, and visible disconnects between government and corporate statements created perception of coverup (Funabashi & Kitazawa, 2012; Perrow, 2011). Less than 16% of media articles contained radiation units, and when used, inconsistent measurements (mSv, μSv, Bq/kg) created confusion (Perko et al., 2015). Tokyo Electric Power Company's repeated use of “unanticipated” for historically precedented tsunami heights became emblematic of obfuscation. The use of specialized terminology without translation for public understanding generated confusion that conspiracy theories exploited. The failure to use SPEEDI evacuation data and dismissal of officials who mentioned “meltdown” compounded distrust (Funabashi & Kitazawa, 2012).

For ISO communication, Fukushima teaches that technical accuracy must be balanced with public accessibility. Scientific precision cannot come at the cost of comprehension. Message architecture must layer complexity, providing immediate understanding for general audiences while offering technical depth for those seeking it. The delayed admission of core meltdowns, acknowledged only after two months despite internal awareness within hours, reveals how institutional credibility, once lost, becomes nearly impossible to restore (Funabashi & Kitazawa, 2012).

Asteroid 99942 Apophis: Managing Graduated Threat Levels

The 2004 discovery of asteroid Apophis, which reached Level 4 on the Torino Scale (Binzel, 2000; Reddy et al., 2022), provides the closest precedent to graduated ISO threat assessment. Initial calculations indicating a 2.6% Earth impact probability in 2029 (Souchay et al., 2014) required careful calibration between generating appropriate concern and preventing panic. NASA's communication strategy employed graduated disclosure synchronized with observational refinement, providing regular updates as orbital calculations improved. By gradually reducing threat level as observations refined orbital calculations, NASA revealed the viability of graduated disclosure protocols. NASA's announcement balanced urgency with measured tone.

NASA's specific messaging architecture for Apophis revealed graduated disclosure effectiveness. Initial announcement (December 23, 2004): “NASA scientists are tracking an asteroid with a 1-in-300 chance of impacting Earth in 2029” (Yeomans et al., 2004a). This factual statement avoided sensationalism while acknowledging uncertainty. December 24 update: “Nevertheless, the odds against impact are still high, about 60 to 1, meaning that there is a better than 98% chance that new data in the coming days, weeks, and months will rule out any possibility of impact in 2029” (Yeomans et al., 2004a). December 28 resolution: “Additional observations have ruled out 2029 impact” (Yeomans et al., 2004b). With each update, the agency utilized visualization tools showing probability distributions and confidence intervals, helping media and public psychologically adjust to uncertainty reduction over time.

The Apophis case reveals that people can process evolving risk assessments when they are provided clear information for understanding uncertainty reduction. The Torino Scale's 0–10 classification system (Binzel, 2000), like the proposed Loeb Scale (Loeb, 2025a), provide consistent communication across institutions while helping media convey appropriate threat levels without sensationalism.

While these historical cases, COVID-19, Fukushima, and Apophis, reveal the role of uncertainty management, technical accessibility, and graduated disclosure, they also reveal a critical gap: the absence of a unified framework that addresses how diverse populations process paradigm-shifting information through different cognitive and emotional channels. The Apophis case showed that clear classification systems and consistent messaging can work, but primarily reached audiences already attuned to scientific communication. For the unprecedented challenge of potential extraterrestrial intelligence discovery, which would affect all of humanity regardless of scientific literacy or cultural context, a more comprehensive approach is required.

The SPECtrum of Rhetoric Intelligences Framework

The SPECtrum of Rhetoric Intelligences theory (SPEC/RI; Teer, 2020), developed through analysis of effective political communication, identifies four distinct cognitive channels through which individuals process information. This framework proves essential for anomalous ISO communication to the public, as different populations will process paradigm-shifting information through distinct cognitive and emotional filters. SPEC/RI recognizes that individuals dynamically engage different processing modes which consist of context, stress level, and information type.

Systematic Intelligence Quantification (SQ)

Systematic Intelligence resonates with those seeking authority and structure. These individuals trust institutional validation, peer review, and scientific consensus. For ISO discoveries, SQ messaging emphasizes international cooperation, methodological rigor, and convergent evidence from multiple independent sources. Messages targeting SQ must maintain clear information hierarchy and cite authoritative sources consistently. Example: “The International Astronomical Union confirms that fourteen independent research teams have verified the anomalous characteristics of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS through peer-reviewed analysis”.

If ISO communications initially overemphasize SQ channels, using technical language and focusing on orbital mechanics will reach scientific audiences effectively but will fail to engage broader publics who process information differently.

Practical Intelligence Quantification (PQ)

Practical Intelligence focuses on concrete outcomes and personal relevance. PQ-oriented individuals may ask: “What does this mean for my daily life?” Effective PQ messaging for ISO discoveries must address immediate concerns about safety, economic impacts, and continuation of normal activities. These messages translate cosmic significance into comprehensible, actionable information. Example: “The object poses no threat to Earth. All essential services, from healthcare to transportation, continue operating normally.”

In case of an absence of PQ, messaging will lead to unnecessary anxiety among people. Clear statements that the object poses no threat and that daily life would continue unchanged can prevent speculation about immediate danger.

Emotional Intelligence Quantification (EQ)

Emotional Intelligence connects through narrative and human experience. Stories of scientists making discoveries, historical parallels to previous paradigm shifts, and emphasis on humanity's shared journey prove essential. EQ messaging acknowledges feelings of awe, uncertainty, and excitement while providing reassurance through human connection. Example: “Dr. Smith, who first noticed the anomaly, describes feeling ‘humbled by the possibility we might not be alone, it reminds us that we're all part of something larger'”.

Effective ISOs coverage could include profiles of discovering astronomers and their personal reactions. These human elements can create abstract concepts accessible and help publics connect emotionally with the discovery process.

Creative Intelligence Quantification (CQ)

Creative Intelligence captures attention through unexpected approaches and novel presentations. Visual representations, analogies, artistic collaborations, and even appropriate humor make complex concepts accessible. CQ elements ensure message retention and viral spread through social media channels. Example: Interactive 3D models allowing users to explore the object's trajectory or comparing its shape to familiar objects like “a cosmic pancake.”

Interactive visualizations of ISOs trajectory and artist conceptions of possible configurations reveal CQ's power to engage audiences who may otherwise ignore technical announcements. Such creative elements generated discussion and sharing far exceeding traditional scientific communications.

While the SPEC/RI framework provides essential channels for multi-audience communication, the contemporary information ecosystem introduces an unprecedented variable that fundamentally alters crisis communication dynamics. Unlike previous paradigm-shifting discoveries, any potential ISO announcement will be mediated not only through traditional channels but through billions of AI-powered interactions that can amplify, distort, or reframe scientific findings within seconds of release.

Artificial Intelligence in Crisis Communication: Opportunities and Threats

AI assistants will likely serve as primary interpreters of ISO discoveries for the public, creating unprecedented challenges. The first threat involves human vulnerability to synthetic media, with detection accuracy barely above chance levels at approximately 51% (Cooke et al., 2025). Within hours of any ISO announcement, fabricated videos of scientists making false claims or synthetic “alien messages” could circulate globally. Similar patterns emerged during COVID-19, where information from questionable and reliable sources spread at similar rates, though the volume of misinformation varied by platform (Cinelli et al., 2020), and ISO discoveries would face similar amplification dynamics.

The second threat concerns AI response accuracy. Although top models achieve hallucination rates below 5% in controlled conditions (Vectara, 2025), they reach 83% error rates under adversarial conditions (Omar et al., 2025). Millions of users asking AI assistants about ISO discoveries could receive confidently stated but incorrect interpretations, transforming scientific uncertainty into false certainty. These AI systems, trained on science fiction alongside scientific literature, may generate plausible but entirely fabricated explanations when faced with unprecedented scenarios.

Without addressing both human susceptibility to deepfakes and AI tendency to hallucinate, humanity's potentially most significant discovery risks being overwhelmed by synthetic deception and algorithmic misinformation. These AI-specific challenges and protocols must be integrated into comprehensive communication framework for ISO discoveries. The convergence of human cognitive diversity (as captured by SPEC/RI) and AI mediation creates unprecedented complexity that traditional crisis communication models cannot adequately address. We now turn to synthesizing these theoretical insights and practical challenges into a unified framework.

Theoretical Framework Development

Having examined both the lessons from analogous communication cases and the multi-channel processing model of SPEC/RI (Teer, 2020), we now describe how these features are synthesized into the Adaptive Communication Framework (ACF). The ACF development follows an established theory-building approach in management and communication sciences (Jaakkola, 2020; Whetten, 1989), integrating three analytical components:

First, we reviewed foundational crisis communication theories, including CERC, sensemaking theory, SCCT, and SARF, to identify core principles applicable to unprecedented discovery scenarios. The theoretical review focused on mechanisms of uncertainty communication, trust maintenance, and information amplification dynamics.

Second, we analyzed three analogous communication cases that share critical characteristics with potential ISO discoveries: COVID-19 pandemic (evolving scientific understanding), Fukushima nuclear disaster (technical complexity and trust dynamics), and asteroid Apophis (graduated astronomical threat). For each case, we examined official communications, documented public responses, and identified successful strategies and critical failure points.

Third, we integrated the SPEC/RI framework to address multi-channel communication needs, recognizing that different audiences process paradigm-shifting information through distinct cognitive and emotional filters. We mapped each intelligence type to specific ISO communication challenges and developed corresponding message strategies.

Our approach recognizes that effective communication of potentially paradigm-shifting discoveries requires more than information transfer. It demands careful orchestration of multiple cognitive, emotional and social channels to facilitate collective sensemaking and collective efficacy during periods of unprecedented uncertainty. This orchestration must occur simultaneously across channels to prevent any single narrative from dominating public perception. Such a theoretical synthesis produced the Adaptive Communication Framework (ACF, see Figure 1), which provides both analytical consideration of communication dynamics and prescriptive guidance for ISO discovery announcements.

Note. The Adaptive Communication Framework operationalizes multi-channel crisis communication for potential extraterrestrial intelligence discoveries. The central Loeb Scale (0–10) determines communication intensity, with color gradients indicating escalating significance: white (0, insignificant), green (1, natural), yellow (2–4, anomalous), orange (5–7, suspected technology), and red (8–10, confirmed technology). Four SPEC/RI intelligence channels (Systematic/SQ, Practical/PQ, Emotional/EQ, Creative/CQ) surround the scale, activated simultaneously at Level 4+ to prevent narrative fragmentation. Left-side AI safeguards (deep fake detection, LLM seeding, real-time adaptation) address algorithmic mediation of public understanding. The three-phase operational timeline (Pre-Detection Preparation → Active Discovery Management → Post-Confirmation Adaptation) includes bidirectional feedback loops for dynamic response adjustment. This integrated architecture ensures coordinated global communication across diverse cognitive processing styles while mitigating AI-era information threats.

The Adaptive Communication Framework

Phase 1: Pre-Detection Preparation

Effective ISO communication requires infrastructure established before discovery pressures create competitive dynamics. The preparation phase focuses on establishing authoritative structures, building public literacy, and developing cultural frameworks.

Institutional Infrastructure: The foundation involves establishing an International Committee for Extraterrestrial Communication (ICEC) under a designated international astronomical authority, paralleling the International Atomic Energy Agency's role in nuclear incidents. This ICEC role is to develop standardized protocols, credential legitimate spokespersons, and maintain rapid response capabilities for rapid activation. Committee membership must include not only scientists, AI specialists, political leaders and policy makers but also communication specialists, social psychology scientists, religious leaders, and ethicists to ensure multiple perspectives inform messaging strategies.

Public Preparation: Comprehensive FAQ databases must cover economic implications, security concerns, and daily life impacts, translated into major languages and adapted for cultural contexts. These resources provide immediate, authoritative answers that prevent speculation from filling information voids during actual discoveries. Educational initiatives must normalize ISO detection within broader astronomical education, emphasizing scientific process rather than sensational possibilities.

Cultural Engagement: Long-term public engagement through storytelling creates psychological resilience. Documentary content exploring humanity's cosmic questions, profiles of scientists conducting research, and educational materials that acknowledge both excitement and uncertainty prepare public psychology for potential discoveries. Such narratives must emphasize humanity's collective journey rather than competition or conflict frames that could generate destructive dynamics.

When potential technosignature evidence emerges, communication must balance scientific uncertainty with public information needs. The framework provides level-specific protocols calibrated to the Loeb Scale (see Loeb, 2025a):

Levels 0–3 (Natural to Anomalous): Communication remains primarily within scientific channels. Public messaging emphasizes the discovery process rather than premature conclusions. Systematic intelligence channels dominate with authoritative updates from established institutions. Practical messaging addresses the reasons for the observation's necessity. Emotional content shares the scientists' curiosity and rigorous methodology. Creative elements may include real-time data visualizations allowing public participation in the analysis.

Level 4 (Potential Technosignature Indicators): This threshold triggers enhanced communication protocols. All four intelligence channels are activated simultaneously with coordinated messaging: (1) Systematic: “International teams are conducting coordinated observations following established protocols”, (2) Practical: “No immediate action required; the object poses no threat”, (3) Emotional: “Scientists worldwide are working together, embodying humanity's collective curiosity”, and (4) Creative: Interactive trajectory models and comparison graphics engage public attention constructively.

Building on Loeb's (2025b) operational principles for responding to potential alien technology, Level 4 activation includes establishing a centralized “Global ISO Status Portal”, a single, authoritative, real-time information source accessible to all humanity. This portal aggregates all observational data, expert analyses, and uncertainty assessments in one location, preventing the information fragmentation that enables misinformation. As Loeb emphasizes, information must be shared in full among all humans, since the response affects our shared future. Features include real-time telescope feeds, expert commentary with uncertainty bounds, predictive trajectory modeling, and multi-language accessibility, ensuring no nation gains information advantage while maintaining complete transparency.

Level 4 activation simultaneously triggers AI Communication Protocol. The ICEC transmits standardized information packages to all major AI platforms, ensuring consistent responses to inevitable user queries. Automated systems must begin scanning for deepfakes across platforms, flagging suspicious content for review within minutes of upload. Social media companies receive formal requests to modify recommendation algorithms, prioritizing ICEC-verified content over unverified claims.

The Global ISO Status Portal incorporates AI capabilities for personalized information delivery based on users' SPEC/RI profiles and cultural contexts. Natural language processing enables conversational queries with blockchain-authenticated responses. This AI-enhanced infrastructure addresses a critical gap: while traditional media can be engaged through established channels, AI systems operate through opaque neural networks requiring proactive information seeding. Without pre-positioned, verified content, language models may generate unpredictable interpretations which rely on science fiction training data rather than scientific evidence, potentially fragmenting public understanding when unity is essential.

Levels 5–7 (Suspected Technology): Communication intensity escalates with predetermined triggers. Messages acknowledge increasing confidence while maintaining scientific caution. Practical intelligence becomes paramount with clear statements about threat assessment and response protocols. Emotional messaging pivots toward unity themes emphasizing humanity's shared stake in the discovery. Creative approaches may include collaborative global events or cultural celebrations of cosmic citizenship.

Levels 8–10 (Confirmed Technology): Full transparency protocols activate with immediate, simultaneous global announcement through all available channels. The message architecture follows a specific two-minute sequence repeated across multiple messengers and platforms: (1) systematic establishment of facts (30 seconds), (2) practical immediate implications (30 seconds), (3) emotional human context (30 seconds), and (4) creative future vision (30 seconds). This ensures core information reaches diverse audiences before speculation and misinformation can dominate narrative formation.

Following technosignature confirmation, humanity faces unprecedented coordination challenges. As Loeb (2025b) notes, decisions must be prompt because of the physical proximity of the visiting devices, markedly different from traditional SETI protocols assuming distant radio sources. The ACF's post-confirmation phase operationalizes Loeb's principles through three parallel tracks:

Continuous Information Flow: Systematic channels provide updates every six hours, even if stating “no change”, preventing speculation-filled voids. Scientific panels explain implications across disciplines, biology (implications for life's universality), physics (novel propulsion mechanisms), philosophy (humanity's cosmic significance), and theology (integration with religious frameworks). Following Loeb's tenth principle (Loeb, 2025b), governments maintain “continuous contact, exchanging real-time alerts” through the ICEC's secure communication network.

Practical Adaptation Infrastructure: Economic stabilization protocols must be activated, with central banks coordinating to prevent market panic while addressing the need to redirect “a substantial fraction of the 2.4 trillion dollars allocated annually to military budgets” (Loeb, 2025b) toward new defense technologies and scientific research. Mental health support systems, specifically trained for existential discovery counseling, deploy through existing healthcare infrastructure.

Collective Meaning-Making: Humanity requires practical frameworks for processing transformed cosmic status. Historical parallels (Copernican revolution, discovery of deep time, DNA structure) provide cognitive anchors that help humanity process paradigm-shifting discoveries by anchoring the unfamiliar in the familiar (Ghilani et al., 2017). Global commemoration events, simultaneous observations, cultural celebrations of cosmic citizenship, artistic collaborations, create shared experience transcending national boundaries. As Loeb emphasizes: “we are all in the same boat, and if one of us rocks the boat, all of us might be at risk of drowning” (Loeb, 2025b).

Discussion

The Adaptive Communication Framework (ACF) addresses critical challenges in managing humanity's potential encounter with evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence. Our theoretical analysis reveals several key insights and implementation challenges.

Managing Uncertainty

Unlike binary crisis announcements, ISO evidence emerges through increasing confidence levels rather than definitive moments. The framework's graduated approach allows communication to evolve with evidential certainty, preventing premature conclusions while maintaining public engagement throughout extended verification periods. The conceptual and practical framework must balance scientific rigor with public information needs, acknowledging that withholding information too long risks losing narrative control to speculation and misinformation.

Cultural and Religious Integration

Extraterrestrial intelligence confirmation intersects with fundamental belief systems differentially across cultures. While some audiences might primarily process discoveries through scientific channels, other populations may prioritize religious or philosophical interpretations. The framework's multi-channel allows culturally adapted messaging without compromising core information. Religious authorities must be engaged as partners rather than obstacles, recognizing that spiritual frameworks for understanding cosmic intelligence may provide psychological resilience for billions of people.

International Coordination Challenges

ISO discovery transcends national boundaries, requiring unprecedented international cooperation. While the proposed ICEC provides coordination mechanisms, practical implementation faces significant obstacles. Nations may attempt to implement information control for perceived advantage, institutions may compete for announcement priority, and cultural differences may generate conflicting messages. The framework must maintain core message consistency while allowing regional adaptation. Success requires pre-negotiated agreements establishing communication protocols before discovery pressure creates competitive dynamics.

Misinformation Mitigation

The digital information ecosystem guarantees that ISO-related misinformation will spread rapidly, probably outpacing official channels. The framework's pre-positioned infrastructure and platform partnerships provide some defense, but complete prevention remains impossible. Strategy must focus on rapid response and credibility maintenance rather than information control. By activating all four intelligence channels simultaneously, accurate information reaches audiences through their preferred cognitive paths, reducing susceptibility to alternative narratives. Platform partnerships with major technology companies must ensure official information receives algorithmic priority during critical announcement periods.

The conceptual-practical framework's success depends critically on coordinating thousands of independent AI systems during the crucial first hours following any official announcement. Unlike traditional media, AI outputs cannot be perfectly predicted or controlled. Even with pre-positioned information, language models may generate unexpected interpretations based on implicit training biases about extraterrestrial intelligence. Furthermore, adversarial actors could deploy AI-generated disinformation campaigns, creating thousands of plausible but false narratives targeting specific populations through personalized misinformation. These challenges require not only defensive measures but offensive capabilities to counter AI-generated disinformation with equally sophisticated corrective messaging, transforming the ACF into an active information warfare system rather than passive communication protocol.

Conclusions

As humanity enters an era of routine interstellar object detection, the probability of identifying objects with characteristics suggesting artificial origin is elevating. The Adaptive Communication Framework (ACF) provides essential theoretical and practical infrastructure for managing this potentially transformative discovery, integrating crisis communication theory with multi-channel messaging strategies to address both information dissemination and psychological adaptation needs.

The urgency of implementation cannot be overstated. Currently, humanity is not prepared for a potential threat from alien technology (Loeb, 2025b). The ACF provides the communication infrastructure necessary to transform this vulnerability into preparedness. The proposed conceptual framework establishes pre-discovery communication architecture that determines whether humanity responds with coordinated wisdom or chaotic confusion.

Immediate implementation requires five critical actions. First, establish the International Committee for Extraterrestrial Communication (ICEC), under a designated international astronomical authority. Second, develop comprehensive message templates addressing all four intelligence types for each Loeb Scale level. Third, launch public preparation programs integrating ISO education into existing astronomical outreach, beginning immediately with existing resources. Fourth, negotiate platform partnerships with major technology companies ensuring official information priority during announcement periods, with agreements finalized. Fifth, conduct annual simulation exercises, involving all stakeholder groups to refine protocols and build institutional preparedness.

The framework's strength lies not in preventing all negative outcomes but in providing structured approaches for managing inevitable complexity. By acknowledging that different individuals process paradigm-shifting information through distinct cognitive and emotional filters, the ACF ensures messages reach diverse global audiences effectively. The convergence of technological capability, public readiness, and cosmic probability makes comprehensive communication preparation essential rather than optional.

Whether the next interstellar visitor proves natural or artificial, billions of people will learn about it through AI assistants whose responses, accurate or hallucinatory, calming or inflammatory, will shape humanity's understanding. The Adaptive Communication Framework (ACF) ensures both human and artificial intelligence systems work in concert rather than opposition. Without immediate implementation including AI safeguards, humanity's most profound potential discovery risks unfolding through algorithmic chaos rather than coordinated communication. The convergence of enhanced detection capability, AI ubiquity, and absent protocols creates unprecedented vulnerability. The tools for discovery are ready; our communication infrastructure, both human and artificial, must be equally prepared when discovery arrives.

      Firstly, we really appreciate those witnesses coming forward it's very brave and noble!
    


      BUT. At this point we know many people have seen craft; it brings zero to the conversation and does nothing to move the topic forward. We need program insiders and people in authority who can open the door to the program, and stop wasting humanities time.
    


      This isnt time for catch-up, just open the door on the program, enough of UAP witness, bring in the program insiders and those in positions of power to change it, or don't do the hearing till you have them!

The director of Weapons, Zach Cregger, has revealed he didn't mess with psychic advice after declining a streaming deal. Weapons follows a mysterious case in which a group of children all run away from home on the same night. The 2025 horror opened to an impressive $44 million, and Weapons has since surpassed $150 million worldwide.

With Weapons dominating the box office and closing in on blockbuster status, Cregger has officially established himself as a force to be reckoned with and one of the few original horror storytellers capable of drawing major crowds. However, according to Cregger, the success of 2025's horror film was all due to some advice from a psychic.

In an interview with Puck, the director revealed he turned down a streaming deal for Weapons. According to Cregger, "before [he] even sent the script out," one streamer made a $5 million preemptive offer based solely on Weapons' concept, but he declined. Instead, he auctioned the script, setting a very specific debut date: 8 a.m. on Jan. 23, 2023.

Detailing his reasons why, Cregger states a psychic he met on New Year's Eve told him: "Don't do any business anything until after January 17th or 16th." While skeptical of the psychic's claims, Cregger thought, "You know what? I'm not messing around with this!" As a result, the advice led to his deal with Warner Bros. Check out Cregger's story below:

Oh my God, this is crazy. I went to Sedona, Arizona, that New Year's with some friends and stayed at this really hippy-dippy wellness retreat. We got comped to stay there, and there was a psychic who, on New Year's Eve, was giving her prognostications for the coming year. And she was just so full of s--t. She said that Vladimir Putin will be assassinated, and Donald Trump will be in prison. And she made all of these completely outlandish predictions. But she looked at me and said, "Don't do any business anything until after January 17th or 16th." And I was like, "You know what? I'm not messing around with this!"

 News about apparent studio demand for Cregger's horror is nothing new, considering it was previously reported that Jordan Peele lost the bidding war for Weapons. However, this anecdote from Cregger showcases just how enticing Weapons' concept was to buyers, especially considering the unnamed streaming studio's "aggressive" offer based solely on the concept, before the script was released.

Studios knew Weapons was going to be a hit, especially after Cregger's debut, Barbarian, a micro-budget, word-of-mouth hit, brought in a $45 million global haul. Consequently, Warner Bros. had confidence in Cregger — fast-tracking his script and giving him creative freedom — and Weapons became a critical success. Apparently, it seems Cregger was right not to disregard the psychic's advice.

 Whether you believe in psychics or not, for Cregger, the warning was very real. While he may have started his career making people laugh, the director has clearly found his niche. Weapons not only solidifies Cregger's status as a new master of horror but also shows how much power a filmmaker can have when they bet on themselves.

Cregger's story seems almost too fantastical to be true. However, with Weapons shattering box office expectations, and Cregger's upcoming Resident Evil reboot, it's clear that his instincts (and possibly that Sedona psychic) were right all along. If studios are smart, they'll give the director more leeway in future projects, as it's clear Cregger knows how to make a hit.

An unidentified flying object crashed into a cornfield and exploded in eastern Poland early Wednesday, the country's news agency PAP reported.

Local police said they received reports of the crash around 2 a.m. and found burned metal and plastic debris at the scene, near the village of Osiny. As a result of the explosion, windows were broken in some houses but nobody was injured, PAP reported.

Poland's Armed Forces Operational Command said Wednesday on social media that no violations of Polish airspace from neighboring Ukraine or Belarus were recorded overnight.

Officials initially said the explosion may have been caused by a part of an old engine with a propeller.

Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz later said the object was most likely a drone, adding that an analysis was underway to determine whether it was a military or smuggling one, PAP reported.

"I was sitting in my room at night, around midnight, maybe, and I heard something just bang," local resident Pawel Sudowski told local news website Lukow.tv. "It exploded so loudly that the whole house simply shook."

Lublin District Prosecutor Grzegorz Trusiewicz told reporters several investigators — both civilian and military — were examining the crash site.

"We have a lot of manpower, we have the army to help us. I hope that we will be able to finish the operation by the evening," Trusiewicz said.

Since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago, there have been a number of intrusions into Polish airspace, raising alarm in the European Union and NATO member state and reminding people how close the war is.

In 2023, a Russian missile went through Polish airspace near the Ukrainian border during one of Russia's barrages.

In 2022, a Ukrainian air defence missile fell on the Polish village of Przewodow, near the border, killing two people.

Earlier this year, unidentified crashed objects were found on the ground in two locations in Poland. Authorities said it was possible those objects came from a SpaceX rocket after debris entered the atmosphere over Poland.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — An unidentified flying object crashed into a cornfield and exploded in eastern Poland early Wednesday, the country's news agency PAP reported.

Local police said they received reports of the crash around 2 a.m. and found burned metal and plastic debris at the scene, near the village of Osiny. As a result of the explosion, windows were broken in some houses but nobody was injured, PAP reported.

Poland's Armed Forces Operational Command said Wednesday on social media that no violations of Polish airspace from neighboring Ukraine or Belarus were recorded overnight.

Officials initially said the explosion may have been caused by a part of an old engine with a propeller.

Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz later said the object was most likely a drone, adding that an analysis was underway to determine whether it was a military or smuggling one, PAP reported.

Lublin District Prosecutor Grzegorz Trusiewicz told reporters several investigators — both civilian and military — were examining the crash site.

“We have a lot of manpower, we have the army to help us. I hope that we will be able to finish the operation by the evening,” Trusiewicz said.

Since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago, there have been a number of intrusions into Polish airspace, raising alarm in the European Union and NATO member state and reminding people how close the war is.

The Yomiuri Shimbun

20:00 JST, August 20, 2025

The number of posts containing the Japanese word for “conspiracy theory” averaged 45,000 per day on X during the latest House of Councillors election campaign period, doubling the number posted before the campaign, The Yomiuri Shimbun has found.

The Japanese word “inbo-ron” was frequently used in connection with political party Sanseito's assertions and allegations of foreign interference in the election. Noting that the spread of unverifiable claims has fueled this trend, an expert warned that an accelerated tit-for-tat conspiracy theory exchange could exacerbate social divisions.

Conspiracy theories are claims that shadowy forces or secret organizations manipulate governments and media to control politics and the economy. On social media, they are often used to dismiss opinions that do not align with one's own beliefs.

The Yomiuri Shimbun used an analysis tool from U.S.-based firm Meltwater to extract and analyze all posts — including reposts — containing the “conspiracy theory” term from June last year to July this year.

Last year saw the Tokyo gubernatorial election, the House of Representatives election and the Hyogo gubernatorial election, with 15,000 comments containing the term posted on an average day. The number increased to over 20,000 this year and surged to 45,000 during the July upper house election campaign of July 3-19.

During the first half of the July campaign, a series of posts criticized assertions by Sanseito leader Sohei Kamiya as conspiracy theories. These assertions included “Jewish international financial capital controls the world” and “[Multinational corporations] are said to have caused the pandemic.”

Sanseito members fought back against these criticisms with such a post as, “They're still talking about conspiracy theories,” which went viral. Meanwhile, there were also posts labeling liberal arguments against nuclear power as conspiracy theories.

The period toward the end of the campaign saw an increase in posts against a personal blog that raised suspicions of foreign interference in the election. The blog claimed that Russia was spreading Japanese-language posts criticizing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's administration that would result in increasing support for Sanseito and other parties.

When both ruling and opposition parties called for an investigation of the allegation, Kamiya posted, “The claim that ‘behind the rise of the Sanseito lies Russian interference' is precisely the kind of conspiracy theory we've been talking about.” This post was shared 14,000 times.

Posts related to U.S. President Donald Trump's administration have also been prominent this year. A survey found an increase in English-language posts mentioning conspiracy theories overseas.

“Many posts sound the alarm about conspiracy theories, and that itself is a sign that unverified claims are spreading,” Osaka University of Economics Associate Prof. Masaki Hata, who has written books on conspiracy theories, said. “Politicians also tended to exploit unverified claims for their own advantage during elections.”

He said he has the impression that there has been an increase in posts alleging voting fraud, such as those claiming that “votes are being rewritten,” and that could pose a dangerous threat to democracy.

When Donald Trump recently claimed, during what was supposed to be a press conference about an EU trade deal, that wind turbines were a “con job” that “drive whales loco”, kill birds and even people, he wasn't just repeating old myths. He was tapping into a global pattern of conspiracy theories around renewable energy – particularly wind farms. (Trump calls them “windmills” – a climate denier trope.)

Like 19th century fears that telephones would spread diseases, wind farm conspiracy theories reflect deeper anxieties about change. They combine distrust of government, nostalgia for the fossil fuel era, and a resistance to confronting the complexities of the modern world.

And research shows that, once these fears are embedded in someone's worldview, no amount of fact checking is likely to shift them. 

Although we've known about climate change from carbon dioxide as probable and relatively imminent since at least the 1950s, early arguments for renewables tended to be seen more as a way of breaking the stranglehold of large fossil-fuel companies. 

The idea that fossil companies would delay access to renewable energy was nicely illustrated in a classic epidode of The Simpsons when Mr Burns builds a tower to blot out the sun over Springfield, forcing people to buy his nuclear power.

Back in the real world, similar dynamics were at play. In 2004, Australian prime minister John Howard gathered fossil fuel CEOs help him slow the growth of renewables, under the auspices of a Low Emissions Technology Advisory Group.

Meanwhile, advocates of renewables – especially wind – often found it difficult to build public support wind, in part because the existing power providers (mines, oil fields, nuclear) tend to be out of sight and out of mind.

Public opposition has also been fed by health scares, such as “wind turbine syndrome”. Labelled a “non-disease” 
and non-existent by medical experts, it continued to circulate for years.  

Academic work on the question of anti-wind farm activism is revealing a pattern: conspiracy thinking is a stronger predictor of opposition than age, gender, education or political leaning.

In Germany, the academic Kevin Winter and colleagues found that belief in conspiracies had many times more influence on wind opposition than any demographic factor. Worryingly, presenting opponents with facts was not particularly successful. 

In a more recent article, based on surveys in the US, UK and Australia which looked at people's propensity to give credence to conspiracy theories, Winter and colleagues argued that opposition is “rooted in people's worldviews”.

If you think climate change is a hoax or a beat-up by hysterical eco-doomers, you're going to be easily persuaded that wind turbines are poisoning groundwater, causing blackouts or, in Trump's words, “driving the whales loco”.

Wind farms are fertile ground for such theories. They are highly visible symbols of climate policy, and complex enough to be mysterious to non-specialists. A row of wind turbines can become a target for fears about modernity, energy security or government control.

This, say Winter and colleagues, “poses a challenge for communicators and institutions committed to accelerating the energy transition”. It's harder to take on an entire worldview than to correct a few made-up talking points.

Beneath the misinformation, often driven by money or political power, there's a deeper issue. Some people – perhaps Trump among them – don't want to deal with the fact that fossil technologies which brought prosperity and a sense of control are also causing environmental crises. And these are problems which aren't solved with the addition of more technology. It offends their sense of invulnerability, of dominance. This “anti-reflexivity”, as some academics call it, is a refusal to reflect on the costs of past successes. 

It is also bound up with identity. In some corners of the online “manosphere”, concerns over climate change are being painted as effeminate.

Many boomers, especially white heterosexual men like Trump, have felt disorientated as their world has shifted and changed around them. The clean energy transition symbolises part of this change. Perhaps this is a good way to understand why Trump is lashing out at “windmills”.

The Mianhua Library, located near the village of Mianhua, in China's Guanxi Province, is a unique library housed in a large grotto, on the side of a rock cliff.

Ever since it opened in May of this year, Mianhua Library has been going viral on Chinese social media. Libraries aren't usually very popular online, but this isn't your regular library; it's an incredible attraction not only for book lovers but also for travelers in search of stunning vistas. Nestled on the edge of a towering cliff, surrounded by lush greenery, Mianhua Library looks like something created with artificial intelligence, but it's actually a real place that anyone can visit as long as they can make the trek there.



The exterior of the library makes quite a first impression with its rock-hanging wooden walkways and balconies, but it's the inside that really takes your breath away. Mianhua Library is located inside a large grotto with thousands of books lining its irregular walls.



The library is situated in a rural area, but although it provides access to books for the local community, it is more of a tourist attraction that has already drawn in visitors from all over the country.
