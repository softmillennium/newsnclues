                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Worlds collided for Hallmark Channel fans when beloved actor Tyler Hynes posted evidence on August 20, 2025, that he'd just stepped back in time ‚Äî visiting the set of Hallmark's hit series ‚ÄúWhen Calls The Heart.‚Äù When they headed to the fictional town of Hope Valley, set in nearby Langley, Hynes tagged along and even reunited with series lead Erin Krakow, his co-star in the upcoming holiday flick ‚ÄúChristmas Above the Clouds.‚Äù Seeing Hynes in his modern-day attire ‚Äî including a racing jacket, Adidas pants and sunglasses ‚Äî and Krakow in her 1920s-inspired frock sent fans into a frenzy. Hynes posted a photo of himself with Krakow, accompanied by a video montage from his visit to the Hope Valley set, where the cast is filming season 13 of ‚ÄúWhen Calls The Heart.‚Äù He could then be seen warmly embracing Krakow, comparing their outfits, and even dancing together, prompting Hynes' ‚ÄúThree Wise Men‚Äù co-star Paul Campbell to quip in the comment section, ‚ÄúI'm getting Back To The Future 3 vibes here.‚Äù Hallmark Channel's social media team also commented, ‚ÄúThis looks like a mirage‚Ä¶ Tyler Hynes in Hope Valley? Fans were beside themselves with glee over the sight of Hynes in Hope Valley, including one who wrote, ‚ÄúWish come true for so many people, especially the Hynies and Hearties‚ú®ü•æü§ç‚Äù My heart is so full‚Äù while someone else chimed in, ‚ÄúOMGEEEE YAYYY!! On August 19, Hallmark's PR and event team also posted a series of brief videos and photos from their visit to Vancouver, including shots of B.J. With People magazine executive editor Breanne Heldman in tow, the team also visited Andrew Walker and Ali Liebert on the set of the ‚ÄúThree Wisest Men‚Äù movie; snapped pics with WCTH stars Andrea Brooks, Ben Rosenbaum, and Kevin McGarry; and caught up with ‚ÄúHannah Swensen Mysteries‚Äù star Victor Webster. In a video Britt shared to his Instagram Stories, he and Hynes ‚Äî who've become dear friends ‚Äî climbed on the hood of the PR and event team's car, laughing and begging them not to leave.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Raymond Boodarian wore suicide prevention gear and stared unresponsively into space during a court hearing on Wednesday (Aug. 20). The man accused of killing longtime American Idol music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband at their Encino home last month will undergo a mental health review to determine whether he's competent enough to face criminal charges for the murders. Raymond Boodarian, a 22-year-old man charged with shooting Kaye and her husband Thomas Deluca during a robbery gone wrong in July, appeared in a Los Angeles courthouse on Wednesday (Aug. 20) for what was supposed to be his initial hearing on murder and burglary charges. But Judge Martin L. Herscovitz suspended the criminal prosecution after Boodarian was repeatedly unresponsive in court. He sat outside the public's view in what defense attorney Nancy Kolocotronis described as a ‚Äúsuicide gown‚Äù ‚Äî a protective garment worn by inmates considered at high risk for self-harm. The judge ordered Boodarian to appear in mental health court on Sept. 3 for a competency review. In such proceedings, mental health experts review a defendant's state and determine whether they're well enough to defend themselves at trial. If the answer is yes, Boodarian's criminal prosecution could resume. If it's no, he could be sent to a mental health institution or another treatment program instead. Kolocotronis declined to comment following the hearing, though she stated in court that Boodarian has ‚Äúsevere mental health issues.‚Äù Lead prosecutor Hilary Williams did not have any comment as she left court and spoke with the victims' family. Kaye worked as a music supervisor on American Idol for 15 seasons. A spokesperson for the show said in July that they were ‚Äúdevastated‚Äù to hear of the deaths, adding, ‚ÄúRobin has been a cornerstone of the Idol family since 2009 and was truly loved and respected by all who came in contact with her.‚Äù A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A quarter mile from the White House, the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in downtown Washington was once Abraham Lincoln's place of worship. A black hitching pole where he would tie up the family carriage is still here. Lincoln would come here most Sundays during the Civil War, burying his face in his hands and praying for guidance. Donald Trump has never been seen here, but the dozen or so homeless people around the church are about to endure his presidential reality. There are exactly two tents, some shopping bags and a couple of carts. You are reclaiming the energy that was once trapped in resentment and placing it back in your hands where it always belonged. A volunteer with long braids named Jakia works the half-asleep crowd and approaches an old man. Get in there and wash your booty.‚Äù The man mumbles to himself but doesn't move. He looks up in time to see and hear the sirens of six police cars bursting the dope-sick silence. The operation is part of a series of raids on D.C.'s homeless encampments overseen by federal law enforcement as part of Trump's edict to reclaim a city that he already rules with a dictator's prerogative. Trump said one of his desires was to take back the city from ‚Äúdrugged out maniacs and homeless people.‚Äù There are no maniacs here, just American citizens who have lost their way. Jakia walks around telling the homeless to store any belongings they want to keep inside the church. Some comprehend, and Temitope Ibijemdou, a 35-year-old man, deftly takes down his tent in seconds. (‚ÄúI've had some practice,‚Äù he tells me.) Ibijemdou then helps a sick friend into the church. They took an oath to protect and serve. The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time He's here every morning, goes on a rant and then gets quiet. No one seems inclined to make a call. She mutters that taking homeless people's possessions while not providing mental health assistance or relocation services is beyond cruel. Ibijemdou comes over and asks if he can tell me something. Hear Tom Morello's ‚ÄòF-ck ICE' Playlist Featuring the White Stripes, Bruce Springsteen, Public Enemy Kid Rock Obviously Took Gavin Newsom's Fake Endorsement Bait ‚ÄòSouth Park' Takes Aim at Trump's Militarized D.C. in New Episode Teaser Trailer Trump Slams Smithsonian for Harping on ‚ÄòHow Bad Slavery Was' DONALD TRUMP'S D.C. TAKEOVER IS the usual Trumpian blend of idiocy, cruelty, and bullshit. In the early hours of August 3, a 19-year-old was attacked by a group of D.C. teenagers near Washington D.C.'s U Street bar scene as he tried to prevent a friend's car from being stolen. Beyond that, the details were murky and the lamentable event ‚Äî I've been mugged in D.C., it's not a life highlight ‚Äî would have been quickly forgotten except for one thing. The beat-up kid was Edward Coristine, aka ‚ÄúBig Balls,‚Äù an Elon Musk hire for his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Coristine is too young to legally drink, but is old enough to wipe out a federal employee's career with a key stroke. A week later, Trump vowed to avenge Big Balls by launching a hostile takeover of the capitol in order to ‚Äútake our capital back from violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals.‚Äù He wasn't referring to his Cabinet. I arrived in Washington two days after Trump's announcement. I make contact with housing activists who send me texts as federal law enforcement hover while the local police clear out homeless encampments. ‚ÄúThey're at MLK Library.‚Äù ‚ÄúPolice are at Washington Circle Park.‚Äù ‚ÄúCops are tearing down tents near the Kennedy Center.‚Äù At first it seems like I am being pranked. I get to the hot spot and there are two tents. At the MLK Library, there is just a News Nation crew and two confused men stepping into a homeless shelter van. In two days, I see maybe a dozen tents total at four different spots. As context, I was in Los Angeles in June for the protests against raids and arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). There are more tents on Silver Lake Boulevard under the 101 than I see in all of Trump's Washington. ‚ÄúMayor Bowser has been clearing them out for years,‚Äù activist Jesse Rabinowitz tells me on a bench in Washington Circle Park. ‚ÄúThis park is half on federal property, so we have both federal and local police to clear out just a few people.‚Äù Armored vehicles appear and then vanish around Union Station. Then you can be slung off your scooter in affluent Foggy Bottom on a Sunday morning and bashed to the ground by anonymous Feds in masks and riot gear. It's not clear which of the dystopian alphabet soup of agencies this man represents ‚Äî could be ICE, FBI, HSI, or the U.S. Across the city, his colleagues emphasize a DGAF approach to public service when they film themselves ripping down a pro-immigrant sign in Mount Pleasant, home to many El Salvadoran and Venezuelan immigrants. I think back to President Lincoln's hitching post over on New York Avenue. And I think that The Great Emancipator would never stop throwing up if he came back to our nation's capitol. WASHINGTON IN AUGUST GIVES OFF a bleak heat that leaves you unmotivated and hopeless. Everyone who can flee has already left for somewhere with a breeze. Congress closed up early rather than deal with Trump's Jeffrey Epstein fiasco, and Trump is in Alaska rolling out the red carpet for a despot. All that remains are locals and those without choices. Even Mayor Muriel Bowser split for a quick trip to Martha's Vineyard, lifting a page from L.A. Mayor Karen Bass' crisis manual. On Saturday morning, I stop outside the apartment building of Sean Dunn, aka the Justice Department apparatchik who flung a Subway sandwich at federal law officials in protest of the Trump occupation. I want to see if Dunn's neighborhood in Northwest Washington is a drug crossroads or an antifa hot spot warranting such a show of force. Nope, Dunn's building is within a block or so of the Embassy of India and the always delicious Bagels Etc. I hear noise up the street and head to Dupont Circle. Saturday at 1 p.m. in August is a quixotic time to hold a rally in D.C. but that's what the Refuse Fascism organizers have chosen to do. I listen to their fairly undefined plan to topple Trump which starts with a massive rally on ‚Ä¶ November 5, or 81 days later. Maybe Trump has finally ground down the opposition. Even the signs looked recycled, there's one ‚ÄúNo Kings‚Äù sign ‚Äî the organization had no presence in D.C. this week ‚Äî and a couple featuring Princess Leia with a catchphrase of ‚ÄúWell behaved women rarely defeat empires.‚Äù Up front, an old man in a David Crosby T-shirt beats on a bongo drum as activist Sam Goldman tries to rally the crowd. ‚ÄúThe Trump fascist regime is shredding the rule of law, making a mockery of due process, illegitimately deploying the military on U.S. soil, disappearing immigrants and other brown-skinned citizens into brutal concentration camps,‚Äù shouts Goldman. ‚ÄúHe is aggressively resurrecting genocidal white supremacy.‚Äù She pauses for breath. Everyone understands, it does seem like Trump has been fucking up lives since JC rolled back the stone. Water is passed out to the sweltering crowd. Some warily eye a mysterious U-Haul truck parked on the dead grass about 40 yards away. Could be set-up materials for a later event, could be 12 Homeland Security officers waiting for the moment to emerge and start cuffing people. We are escorted expertly by D.C. police on bikes who deftly ride ahead closing off traffic. I don't see any federal law enforcement until we approach the National Mall and nearby federal buildings. Federals, mostly Park Police, already patrol these heavily touristed areas because of their public land status. Trump's crackdown is duplicative and duplicitous, at least for this area. The protesters eventually reach Constitution Avenue and come across a solitary National Guard vehicle with four soldiers loitering about. In a role reversal, the National Guard are rescued by D.C. police who form a protective ring around them. The situation doesn't escalate, but I wonder what would have happened if someone threw a water bottle. And then I remember a conversation I had with an activist the day before about why there were not more public protests. ‚ÄúI don't want to be the guy known for organizing the rally where people got their heads bashed in or killed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe don't know how they would react.‚Äù The man grimaced. I work my way back up to Dupont Circle. I remember as I walk back toward my car that Lakm√© ends with a hopeful young woman dying by suicide when she realizes that her soldier values the army over her love. On Friday night, I trawl up and down Marion Berry Boulevard and Minnesota Avenue SE, a significant crime district in the Anacostia neighborhood on the other side of the Potomac. I see Bambi and two fawns prancing a couple of blocks away on Hillcrest Drive, but no SUVs with government plates or masked officers in their trademark vests with no badge visible. Maybe their presence would have prevented a shooting on Minnesota Avenue, 24 hours later. On Saturday evening, there's a triple stabbing on the 900 block of H Street NE in the H Street Corridor, less than a mile from Union Station. I head over in my car expecting to see some of the federal enforcement that Trump promised. I ask a woman walking her dog if she has seen the feds. ‚ÄúNo, they don't come down here,‚Äù she says. I head west on H Street and I do see action a few blocks closer to Union Station. A dozen cop cars close off an intersection, their red cherries bursting up the night. I look to park, but a reporter friend on the sidewalk shakes her head. I circle back and park at Union Station. I've got 15 minutes to score some crappy pizza from the station's Sbarro before it closes. She eventually wanders off and all that remains is two white dudes arguing, one screaming about occupiers while the other shouts ‚Äúthank you for your service‚Äù at law enforcement. Later, I learn something that takes it from boring to absurd. At about the same time, 8:49 p.m., a radio conversation went down between a National Guard dispatcher and a Guard soldier at Union Station who announced the Guard is moving out. We're just getting [out of] that area due to a growing demonstration, repeat, current movement due to growing demonstration at Union Station.‚Äù Did the National Guard retreat because of Annoying Bullhorn Person? I go inside, but the Sbarro is already closed. I jump back into my car and make a rapid food decision and head up to Butterworth's, a French bistro trendy with the Trump crowd according to a roughly 63,000 word story in The New York Times. I park and peer inside at a Victorian era couch that would not be out of place in the waiting area of a chain of British-themed pubs attached to Holiday Inns. Two days later, Donald Trump boasts, ‚ÄúPeople that haven't gone out to dinner in Washington, D.C., in two years, are going out to dinner, and the restaurants, the last two days, were busier than they've been in a long time.‚Äù Everyone knows this is a lie but few complain. It's 10 p.m. on a weekend night and the heat is not yet dead in the U Street Corridor, D.C.'s party district. Bars and nightclubs stretch for blocks where frats boys with backward baseball caps blend with girls from Howard University in midriff tops teetering precariously in high heels. I've posted up at Solly's Tavern, a cozy dive bar, with vodka on the rocks while a couple other reporters alternate between hydration and dehydration, toggling between PBRs and water bottles. A longtime U Street observer guesses the crowd on the street is maybe half of what you would expect on a weekend night. The president's task force has become entrenched in just 100 hours. I follow as they proudly walk past a hundred pairs of eyes that glare down at them with scorn. Eventually, a bantam-sized officer with a receding hairline pulls out his phone and begins filming the reporters trailing behind him. We're gonna keep the city streets safe from murderers, rapists, and robbers.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe've made over a hundred arrests,‚Äù says the smug cop. He's just parroting a line that White House officials will cite repeatedly: 212 arrests made in high-crime areas and 68 guns pulled off the street. Alas, it's Trump who has maintained in his jihad against a Labor Department statistician that officials can make stats say whatever they like. The next day, Romero was shot dead by his own government while saying Mass in San Salvador. A tired father dozes off and gets jabbed in the ribs by his giggling wife. The only difference between here and a Rockwell painting is paperwork and the shade of their skin. After Mass, I talk to an older woman holding hands with her husband. They tell me that church attendance has actually increased because of Trump's return. ‚ÄúWe need this now, more than ever,‚Äù says the woman. We chat for a minute and then say goodbye. ‚ÄúI know you mean well, but people are scared. I kneel, cross myself, and head for my car. I'm no different, but driving around the city trying to find an active checkpoint or an arrest in progress is like catching water in a net. But then on Monday night I get a tip and head to Benning Road in Northeast Washington. Nearby, a Chick-fil-A parking lot usually filled with immigrant delivery guys on mopeds is deserted. I arrive right after the man has been tackled by a woman cop who adds to his humiliation by calling him a co√±o, Spanish for pussy. A few citizens approach the woman who wears a mask up to her eyes and has no identifying information on her fatigues. A larger male cop steps in between the cop and the crowd, which is standing at a respectful distance. She pauses for a second and shakes her head before finishing. More National Guardsmen are arriving by the day, all from red states. The administration rolls back an earlier proclamation and announces that now the Guard will be armed, a prescription for violence as rural Guardsmen are dropped into a strange land with itchy trigger fingers. Another delivery guy has been rolled up. This time the sidewalks fill up immediately with white, Black, and brown residents.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: In a highly competitive situation, New Regency has landed Fixation, an erotic thriller spec from Wednesday scribes Erika Vazquez & Siena Butterfield, Deadline has learned. Pic will be produced alongside Emmy winner Bruna Papandrea's Made Up Stories, with Papandrea producing for the company, along with Steve Hutensky, Jeanne Snow, and Claudia Park. While not much is known about the film's plot, we're told it centers on a couple's therapist who is drawn into a dangerous triangle of lust, lies, and manipulation. This marks the second collaboration between Papandrea and New Regency, following their partnership on David Fincher's Academy Award‚Äìnominated Gone Girl. It also represents the second collaboration between Papandrea and New Regency's Nirokhi Raychaudhuri, who previously served as creative executive at Netflix on the thriller Luckiest Girl Alive starring Mila Kunis. Word of the project comes at a time when the erotic thriller genre has really swung back into relevance, with projects like Fair Play and Babygirl. Other upcoming examples include the M3GAN spin-off SOULM8TE, Gregg Araki's I Want Your Sex starring Olivia Wilde and Cooper Hoffman, and a Basic Instinct reboot at Amazon MGM Studios, to name just a few. The duo is represented by Gersh, Kaplan/Perrone Entertainment, and Ginsburg Daniels Kallis. Founded in 2017 by Papandrea and Hutensky, Made Up Stories' credits include Luckiest Girl Alive; Nine Perfect Strangers, Hulu's most watched original series upon debut; The Lost Flowers Of Alice Hart, the most successful Australian Amazon Original launch globally; Strife, Binge's biggest original series launch; The Undoing, HBO's most watched series of 2020; Anatomy of a Scandal; Pieces of Her; and The Dry, one of the highest-grossing Australian films of all time. Upcoming, they're also producing Peacock's The Good Daughter, in their second collaboration with bestselling author Karin Slaughter. Recently, New Regency has also acquired ‚ÄúThey're Still Here,‚Äù a thriller short story from Stephen Herman, installing Colin Greten as VP of Film and Tesha Crawford as EVP, Head of International Television. Upcoming on the feature side, the studio also has Blood Meridian, based on Pulitzer Prize-winning author Cormac McCarthy's novel, written by Oscar winner John Logan and directed by John Hillcoat; Watch Dogs, an adaptation of Ubisoft's best-selling video game franchise starring Tom Blyth and Sophie Wilde; and Psycho Killer, written by Andrew Kevin Walker and starring Georgina Campbell, among other projects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Days after he granted the embattled rapper another big win in court, a federal judge has offered up his reasons for doing so. But it was issued without any explanation of the judge's reasoning. Digital Marketing Agency That Reps Ken Jeong Launches Two Platforms to Make Comedians Social Media Superstars In a 28-page opinion issued late Tuesday, Judge Jed Rakoff laid out his reason: That Rivers had filed her case far too late. Judge Rakoff said Rivers had invoked a ‚Äúhodgepodge‚Äù of arguments for why the time limits should be lifted on her case, including that she was afraid of retaliation from Combs and his business empire. ‚ÄúWhile Rivers does allege that she experienced a general fear of retaliation preventing her from speaking out against Combs, general claims of psychological stress cannot give rise to duress tolling,‚Äù the judge said, referring to the technical term for such a delay. The judge pointed to a recent ruling in a separate case filed against Diddy by an Atlanta man named DeWitt Gilmore, who sued over claims that he was assaulted outside a nightclub by Diddy and his entourage in 1996. ‚ÄúThe same reasoning applies here with at least equal force,‚Äù Rakoff wrote. Rivers, who became a member of hip-hop group Da Band, sued Combs in earlier this year, claiming he had cornered her in a recording studio and ‚Äúran his left hand across her breasts.‚Äù She also claimed that he later blackballed her in the music industry in retaliation for rebuffing his advances. The case was one of dozens of civil lawsuits filed against Combs over the past two years alongside his blockbuster federal criminal case. Following a two-month trial, Diddy was acquitted last month on the most serious charges of racketeering (RICO) and sex-trafficking in that case, though he was found guilty on two lesser counts of interstate prostitution. Many of the other civil lawsuits remain pending, and Combs still faces sentencing on the convictions in October, where he could be sentenced to several years in prison. In Tuesday's decision, Judge Rakoff also explained why he had dismissed most of Rivers' claims permanently, saying that the case was not ‚Äúa close question‚Äù that could be fixed by her lawyers: ‚ÄúThe vast majority of the conduct ‚Ä¶ took place over twenty years ago, whereas the most generous limitations period applicable to any of Rivers' claims is ten years,‚Äù the judge wrote. But he also explained in detail why he had deferred ruling on the accusation that Combs violated New York City's Gender Motivated Violence Protection Act, citing pending appeals cases on key questions about how that law functions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's lots of tension ‚Äî professional and otherwise ‚Äî in the latest preview for the Apple series starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, which is set to return Sept. 17. As has been the habit of the Emmy-winning Apple TV+ series starring Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, each season of the media drama tends to blow everything up in its finale and hopes to start anew when it returns. Why Jennifer Aniston Went to Battle With Studio Execs Over Wig in 'Horrible Bosses' Jennifer Aniston Says She Was "Mourning" Matthew Perry Before His Death Due to Addiction Still, she sounds confident as she plans to introduce a ‚Äúdifferent company and a different culture‚Äù with allies including executive Stella (Greta Lee) and news boss Mia (Karen Pittman). But savvy newcomer Celine Dumont, played by Oscar winner Marion Cotillard, arrives on the scene to play devil's advocate. ‚ÄúNice idea,‚Äù she says of the ‚Äúfemale utopia‚Äù that Alex's company now claims to be. Since the new fourth season time jumps nearly two years after the events of season three to the spring of 2024, viewers will have to wait to find out if she ended up serving any time. Now, Bradley is back to doing journalism as she begins to investigate a dangerous UBA cover-up with the help of another ex-colleague, Chip (Mark Duplass). ‚ÄúYou can't clean a house if you're about to blow it up,‚Äù Alex argues to Bradley, the friends and former co-anchors once again coming at each other from opposing sides of a moral argument. Meanwhile, longtime will-they-won't-they pair Bradley and Cory are also briefly seen cozying up. Even when you have to be accountable for something, life can go on.‚Äù In a world rife with deepfakes, conspiracy theories and corporate cover-ups ‚Äî who can you trust? The ensemble cast includes Aniston, Witherspoon, Crudup, Duplass, Nestor Carbonell, Pittman, Lee, Nicole Beharie and Hamm, welcoming Aaron Pierre, William Jackson Harper, Holbrook, Cotillard and Jeremy Irons. The 10-episode season returns Sept. 17 on Apple TV+ with one episode, followed by a weekly Friday release through Nov. 19.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madonna celebrated her 67th birthday in spectacular fashion by fulfilling a longtime dream to attend the historic Palio di Siena horse race in Italy, surrounded by her children and boyfriend Akeem Morris during an unforgettable Tuscan getaway. The Queen of Pop marked her special day on August 16 by experiencing one of Italy's most treasured traditions, sharing the moments with her family while staying at a luxurious 16th-century villa in the heart of Tuscany's wine country. Madonna's birthday celebration centered around attending the legendary Palio di Siena, a horse race that has entertained audiences since medieval times. ‚ÄúMy Dream for many years has been to watch the Palio horse race in Sienna that takes place on my birthday, August 16, since 1482! !‚Äù Madonna shared on Instagram, in a reel of the spectacular celebration. She concluded her heartfelt message by stating, ‚ÄúDreams do come true.‚Äù Madonna watched the historic race from a balcony overlooking the track, accompanied by her children, including daughter Lourdes, 28, son Rocco, 25, and her adopted twin daughters Stella and Estere, 12. Her boyfriend, Akeem Morris, 28, also joined the family celebration. The luxury property sits on 900 acres of picturesque vineyards and is available for private rental, reportedly costing ¬£18,000 for two nights, according to the Daily Mail. A source told the Daily Mail: ‚ÄúEveryone turned out to support Madonna and she had an amazing trip. She loves to celebrate her birthday in Italy and this was one of the best yet. She's been friends with Sting for years so I'm sure he will have sorted her out mates rates for his huge estate.‚Äù One of the celebration's most talked-about elements was Madonna's birthday cake, which featured a pink Labubu doll design complete with her iconic conical bra look. Celebrity friends, including Andy Cohen, who wrote ‚ÄúHappy birthday Queen,‚Äù Katy Perry, who added ‚ÄúMY QUEEN,‚Äù and Justin Trudeau, Former Prime Minister of Canada, who added, ‚ÄúHappy happy birthday,‚Äù joined in wishing Madonna well on social media.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Yes, it's true: IndieWire can exclusively report that Kino Lorber has acquired North American distribution rights to Israeli filmmaker Nadav Lapid's Cannes premiere ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù billed by the distributor as a ‚Äúbiting satire set and filmed in Israel in the aftermath of October 7.‚Äù The film, which was viewed by many as being the most provocative and ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù (Lapid's own words, but with plenty of asterisks) at this year's festival, was viewed by many as a tough sell. Enter: Kino Lorber, as the independent distributor has not only picked up the film, but is planning a theatrical release in early 2026, followed by a digital, educational, and home video release. Written and directed by Lapid, the film made its world premiere in Directors' Fortnight at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival and was an official selection at the Karlovy Vary, Munich, and Jerusalem film festivals. The film stars Ariel Bronz, Efrat Dor, Naama Preis, and Alexey Serebryakov. As David Ehrlich wrote in his very positive review of the film from Cannes, the film ‚Äúis a veritable orgy of self-loathing surrender that reaffirms Lapid as the world's most visceral director on a shot-by-shot basis. Per today's announcement from Kino Lorber, the film unfolds in ‚Äúthe days following October 7, [as] Y., a jazz musician, and his wife Yasmine, a dancer, resolve to say yes to everything. Feverishly whirling between moments of satire, sincerity, and complete submission, ‚ÄòYes' is a visceral, blistering indictment of modern Israel, and an essential addition to post-October 7 cinema.‚Äù At the festival, Lapid spoke at length with IndieWire, including about the film's out of competition placement and his expectations for where it might end up. ‚ÄúI am saying what my press agent told me to say when I am asked why the film is not in the competition,‚Äù Lapid told IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio on the Croisette beach at Cannes a day before ‚ÄúYes‚Äù premiered. Lapid, who said he is not good at being ‚Äúdiplomatic,‚Äù added, ‚ÄúThen, she told me to say that I should say, ‚ÄòI don't know. What I can say is that the film, during its whole [production], and also when it ended, became ‚Äî unwillingly ‚Äî a kind of tool which measures cowardice and courage, to distinguish between the cowardly ones and the courageous ones.‚Äù ‚ÄúNadav Lapid has delivered an exhilarating, dizzying work of cinematic art that draws and quarters all emotions around one of the greatest political and human tragedies of our time,‚Äù said Kino Lorber Chairman and CEO Richard Lorber in an official statement. ‚ÄúHere, he puts his own febrile psyche and masterful skills on the front lines of a conflict that tears at his own soul with no rational refuge. We couldn't be prouder to work once again with Nadav to share a truly unique filmic experience with North American audiences who have come to expect no less from him ‚Äî far more than almost any other filmmaker today grappling with rage, and the guilt of resignation.‚Äù Added Lapid, ‚Äú‚ÄòYes' is the most difficult and demanding film I have ever made. I believe the introduction of this film to North American audiences can be, now more than ever, powerful and meaningful. ‚ÄúYes‚Äù is a Les Films du Bal, Chi-Fou-Mi Prods. The film is produced by Judith Lou L√©vy, Hugo S√©lignac, and Antoine Lafon. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jason Bateman has a list of debts as long as his hair in the new trailer for Black Rabbit, Netflix's upcoming limited crime series. Covered in blood and grime, a bearded Bateman plays Vince Friedkin, an out-of-luck gambler, whose laundry list of I.O.U.s has left him broke, on the run, and shoeless. Left with nowhere to go, he turns to his brother Jake (Jude Law), the owner of a Big Apple nightclub, the Black Rabbit. Set against the backdrop of New York City's high-pressure nightlife scene, Black Rabbit centers on two brothers who are pushed to the brink by their duty to family and their pursuit of success. Jake Friedken (Jude Law) is the charismatic owner of Black Rabbit, a restaurant and VIP lounge, poised to become the hottest spot in New York. But when his brother, Vince (Jason Bateman), returns to the business unexpectedly, trouble soon follows; opening the door to old traumas and new dangers that threaten to bring down everything they've built. Though it looks like Bateman is back in Ozark mode‚Äîindeed, he directs the first two episodes, and his TV wife, Laura Linney, directs three and four. But this is more of a Jude Law production. Black Rabbit was created by Zach Baylin and Kate Susman, who wrote The Order, starring Law and his incredible mustache. It was so good that Order director Justin Kurzel even popped in to direct the final two episodes of Black Rabbit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter (Just don't call it Hulu's ‚ÄòTed Lasso'!) Not well enough for Peyton and Eli Manning, at least. ‚ÄúThey sent Eli and me the videos of his throwing sessions ‚Ä¶‚Äù Peyton explains. ‚ÄúYou watch [a pro QB] take a snap ‚Ä¶ his fingers are pointing up and his thumbs are down, angled toward the center, ready to catch,‚Äù continues Peyton. Eli and I were like, ‚ÄòWe've got to get that fixed. Buffalo Bills Star Dion Dawkins Addresses the Biggest Debates From HBO's 'Hard Knocks' The show Powell's palms were in danger of killing is Chad Powers, a Hulu comedy about a disgraced former college quarterback ‚Äî played by Powell ‚Äî out for redemption. The series, co-produced by the Mannings, is adapted from a 2022 viral video in which Eli, donning prosthetics and a wig, went undercover at Penn State's annual open football tryouts. His nose and hair may have looked ridiculous, but Eli's version of Chad Powers knew exactly what to do with his hands ‚Äî they have, after all, won two Super Bowls (and two Super Bowl MVP trophies). ‚ÄúIf there's one note that Eli and I are going to help to make this show, it's getting his hands fixed,‚Äù Peyton says. In the decade since, of course, Powell has broken out as a full-fledged movie star, first in 2022's Top Gun: Maverick, followed by Richard Linklater's Hit Man and then Anyone But You, opposite Sydney Sweeney. For a star with that kind of white-hot Hollywood trajectory, going back to the small screen carries some risk ‚Äî even if he wasn't also a co-creator, writer and producer on the series. That's some serious (pig)skin in a pretty tough game. Powell, 36, call Powers ‚Äúthe hardest character‚Äù he's ever played. When word came down that the Mannings were fielding pitches to adapt the freshly viral Chad Powers sketch, CAA rang the freshly famous Powell and Michael Waldron (Heels), a pair of clients who had never worked together but had bonded over a shared college football obsession. Unlike many of the other Chad Powers pitches out there, Powell says he and Waldron specifically didn't want to plug the Chad character into an inspirational story √† la the 1993 movie Rudy. Peyton, 49, and Eli, 44, loved the pitch, and older bro ran it up the chain at Disney's 20th Television, where Peyton's Omaha production banner has a first-look deal; it was a match made in corporate-synergy heaven, which is almost certainly the worst ring of heaven. (In fact, to justify its $29.99 monthly bill, ESPN has acquired NFL Network, RedZone and NFL Films, which also just so happens to co-produce Chad Powers.) But all that glorious synergy is not why Chad Powers is on Hulu, according to Disney Television Group president Craig Erwich. ‚ÄúWe expressed the most enthusiasm for it,‚Äù he says. But Powers marks the first foray into scripted content for the company, and Peyton says he didn't initially grasp how adapting the one-off goof into a full scripted series was possible. ‚ÄúThis whole [scripted] world is new to me, but I've learned very quickly. Don't ever tell me, ‚ÄòThat's a bad idea. That will never be a show,' ‚Äù he says. Though Powell, the Mannings and Erwich don't love discussing the parallels, Chad Powers has an obvious predecessor: Ted Lasso, itself based on a 2013 promotion for NBC's Premier League soccer coverage starring Jason Sudeikis. Also like Ted Lasso, Chad Powers totally works. Protestations aside, Lasso became an Emmy-gobbling global hit for Apple TV+ that paved the way for it to launch an entirely new soccer streaming service in MLS Season Pass. Two years after Eli Manning hung up his well-worn No. 10 New York Giants jersey for good in 2020, his strong right arm would be called on once more, though this time not by an NFL team one player away from contention, nor for his famous family's prestigious Manning Passing Academy. No, this time, it was purely for the laughs. Eli was in Happy Valley, where the Penn State Nittany Lions prowl, for an episode of his ESPN+ show Eli's Places, a spinoff of big brother's Peyton's Places, in which he travels to locations that loom large in college football lore. But once he donned the Chad Powers wig and prosthetics, Eli Manning came out. ‚ÄúI knew I wasn't going to run a great 40 time,‚Äù he tells THR, referring to the all-out 120-foot sprint, a staple in evaluating football prospects. But he's still a Manning, and the Mannings are QB royalty. Like Eli, Peyton has won two Super Bowls. Their dad, Archie Manning, was a very good NFL quarterback who played on terrible teams. To paraphrase a recently controversial American Eagle ad featuring Powell's Anyone But You co-star Sydney Sweeney, they've got good genes. Save head coach James Franklin, who was in on the gag, the rest of the Big Ten team's staff was shocked by what they saw out of this Powers kid, who most certainly did not look like a kid at all. And so, all these receivers trying out are coming to me.‚Äù Powell says that ‚Äúwatching the original Chad Powers ‚Ä¶ one of the things that really surprised me is Eli's ability to improv. And there was a lot of weird heart in the character.‚Äù When we see those kinds of meltdowns, says Powell, ‚Äúeverybody shakes their head and goes, ‚ÄòWhat the heck was he thinking?' But you never live with that person afterward, right?‚Äù As Powell describes him, Russ Holliday is ‚Äúan asshole ‚Ä¶ the worst dude on the planet.‚Äù Until he ‚Äúputs on the face of a good teammate and accidentally becomes a good teammate.‚Äù Chad Powers is, he says, ‚Äúbasically Forrest Gump: the nicest, sweetest, most genial Southern guy you've ever seen.‚Äù Beyond the fake face, name, voice and hero school, Chad Powers is steeped in authenticity. It's an homage, sure, but more so a pragmatic choice ‚Äî those are the schools that were the easiest for producers to get permission to use. When dealing with colleges and athletic directors, it was ‚Äúsuch a great hack‚Äù to have the Mannings on board, Powell says ‚Äî but not so much that Powers' school itself could be real. Talks with ‚Äúother colleges who will not be named‚Äù were ‚Äúa nightmare,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe could not afford any [outside] creative oversight.‚Äù It turns out Powell is not just a pretty face ‚Äî though he certainly is that, as Russ Holliday, if not so much as Chad Powers. He has told me he has not seen talent like this in a long time.‚Äù Eli then jokes that he knew Chad Powers would need a big budget to cover how much work Powell needed to play a convincing Division I QB. ‚ÄúI saw you throwing in Top Gun and wasn't all that impressed,‚Äù Eli tells him, referring to the ‚Äúdogfight football‚Äù scene in which Navy fighter pilots portrayed by Powell, Tom Cruise, Miles Teller and others play beach football ‚Ä¶ with two balls. For real, though, Powell ‚Äúthrows it well,‚Äù Eli says. To keep up with them, Powell did what any good pro does ‚Äî he practiced his ass off. Producers hired Nic Shimonek, the personal quarterback coach to Kansas City Chiefs superstar Patrick Mahomes. Powell's North Star for Holliday/Powers was Johnny Manziel, the Heisman Trophy-winning QB at Texas A&M whose nickname was Johnny Football. Manziel, like Holliday, was ‚Äúa complicated figure,‚Äù as Powell politely puts it. Drug and alcohol abuse, a domestic violence charge (that was dropped) and struggles with mental health derailed his professional career. ‚ÄúWe wanted Russ Holliday to be extremely likable, but also a guy who represented a really fun, charismatic, wild character to watch that would give in to his best instincts on the football field and his worst instincts off the field,‚Äù Powell says, ‚Äúand I think Johnny definitely represented that.‚Äù So, it was serendipitous when, six months before filming began on Chad Powers, Powell met Manziel after playing golf in the Waste Management Phoenix Open Pro-Am. ‚ÄúI went out with Johnny, and I was like, ‚ÄòThis guy is such a blast,' ‚Äù says Powell, recounting their night having dinner at Mastro's before ending up at Casa Amigos, a nightclub and bar. ‚ÄúAnytime you catch me at the club, it's always research,‚Äù he adds with a smile. For Eli, the hardest part of playing Powers was creating a voice that wouldn't make him recognizable to the other walk-ons trying out ‚Äî and sticking with it all day. Powell and Waldron wanted their Chad to have a voice that was ‚Äúnaturally comedic and fun,‚Äù Powell says, but one that ‚Äúwould also feel like a shot from the hip.‚Äù So Powell and his Hit Man dialect coach, Susanne Sulby, aggregated the ‚Äúdirtiest accents from the South‚Äù and ‚ÄúFrankensteined‚Äù them together to get to Chad. ‚ÄúIf you were to try to invent a character and somebody was like, ‚ÄòHey, throw on a voice right now.' Under duress, what would you put on?‚Äù is how Powell explains his Powers voice. There was ‚Äúa lot of trial and error‚Äù for his Powers look, says Powell. Where it's like, ‚ÄòWhat happened to this person?' This is a show that no one would watch, it's so grotesque.‚Äù You can't wear a fake chin piece with a chin strap, for example, and don't get them started on wigs and helmets. The worst part: Powell could not have so much as a sip of alcohol throughout filming, as any trace in sweat would dislodge the facial prosthesis. ‚ÄúDuring the beginning of football season, I had to be absolutely sober, which was a first for me,‚Äù Powell says. With the NFL regular season two weeks away, the Manning bros are about as busy as they were during their playing days. They do their own direct outreach for pre-interviews with the coaches and players for their weekly Manningcast game, and new seasons of Eli's Places and Peyton's Places are on the way. Powell is arguably more in-demand in Hollywood right now than a good starting QB is in the NFL; his IMDb page can barely keep up with his career. Season one of the Hulu series is only a half-dozen episodes because of his busy schedule, Erwich explains ‚Äî not that he's concerned about Powell's daily planner should there be a season two. ‚ÄúIt's a quality problem that I believe everybody will be excited and incentivized to solve,‚Äù he says. The actor will appear in other Omaha projects this fall, including on a Manningcast episode and on an Eli's Places installment in which he (as Chad Powers) meets Manning (as Chad Powers, in wig and nose, though not necessarily full makeup) so the original can ‚Äúmake sure the legacy of the iconic walk-on is told properly.‚Äù Powell's next marquee project is a remake of The Running Man, directed by Edgar Wright. And he says he and Sweeney are ‚Äústill talking‚Äù about an Anyone But You sequel, though they've agreed to not make one ‚Äúuntil it's the right idea,‚Äù which ‚Äúrequires patience.‚Äù He'll also probably get around to directing ‚Äî pretty much the only Hollywood job this side of lighting he's yet to tackle. Whenever that time comes, I'll be much more prepared.‚Äù (Hey, if it's good enough for the pope ‚Ä¶) A Texan should not play James Bond,‚Äù Powell says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For better or worse, dating app profiles are replete with terms like ‚Äúethical non-monogamy,‚Äù ‚Äúpolycule,‚Äù ‚Äúfriends with benefits,‚Äù to the dismay of those simply seeking the one. Cinematically, these dynamics have long served as thematic fodder, among them Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice, many a Gregg Araki movie, and No Strings Attached and Friends With Benefits (both, oddly, released in 2011). But not until Splitsville has a film so aptly addressed the current moment as it pertains to an ever-expanding view of successful relationships. Splitsville opens with newlyweds Carey (Marvin) and Ashley (an excellent Adria Arjona) as they belt a duet while driving in their vintage hatchback. They are attentive, affectionate, and open with one another, the last tenet also describing their progressive attitude about fidelity. As they converse over glasses of wine, Paul and Julie divulge the specifics about their arrangement to Carey, who admires their candor but, ultimately, appears ill at ease with the revelation. This is when the cracks begin to show in this supposedly enlightened couple's relationship, putting Carey in the unfortunate (yet highly entertaining) position of maneuvering both his dissolving marriage and that of Paul and Julie. Despite seeing his friend's distressing reaction to an extramarital incident, Carey decides that an open relationship might be the only thing capable of saving his marriage with Ashley, whose main gripe is that she wants to date other people. To describe this sequence in specific detail would slacken the tension it so effectively garners, but trust that not an inch of an ultra-modern Hamptons estate goes undisturbed by their encounter. Marvin is particularly adept at utilizing his body (and I do mean his entire body) to yield a kinetic comedic performance, whether it be an inopportune theme park incident or simply directing drop-off traffic at the school where he teaches gym. In this sense, Aronja is a fantastic match (fans of Hit Man are already well aware of her ability to blend the silly and sexy), unafraid to tackle physical gags and emotional intensity with whip-crack precision. Covino and Johnson's chemistry isn't lacking, per se, but their arc becomes far too embroiled in the dissolution of their marriage and the effect this has on their son (Simon Webster), already a troublemaker who begins to act out in more concerning ways. This is when Splitsville becomes more absorbed in plotlines about bankruptcy and interpersonal betrayal, straying from its initial focus on the individual neuroses that spring from attempting to adapt to someone else's desires rather than understanding and committing to one's own. Indeed, the film is composed of chapters that reference several legal clauses inherent to divorce papers (a similar structure to The Climb), meaning that Corvino and Marvin clearly intended to also delve into the relevant particularities of such an ordeal. There are far more films about divorce than there are lampoons of 21st-century sexual liberties, so the observations made here tend to be a tad less compelling. Compared to Johnson's other rom-com showing this summer, Materialists, Splitsville is a much more successful examination of modern love and its limitations. Even Johnson's character is given more dimension here, the tug between two men and the potential future they promise her a much more interesting exercise than Celine Song's conventional rich man/poor man dichotomy. But the clunkiness of this device feels at home in Covino and Marvin's story: In our real-life relationships, ensuring that no one has to read between the lines typically yields a more perfect union.
