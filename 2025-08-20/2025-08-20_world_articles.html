Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced on Tuesday that, effective immediately, when reviewing applications, the agency will consider “any involvement in anti-American or terrorist organizations, as well as the use of discretion in adjudication of certain benefit requests where evidence of antisemitic activity is present.” The applicant “bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted,” the announcement states. For months after Israel began its genocide in Gaza in October 2023, the Biden administration repeatedly lobbed baseless accusations of antisemitism and support for terrorism at pro-Palestine, anti-genocide activists. Soon after taking office, the Trump administration escalated attacks on these activists by abducting and imprisoning many of them, particularly those who were foreign-born. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. “The ability to speak one's mind is a core constitutional right and an indispensable American value,” Vera Eidelman, senior staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said in a statement to Truthout. Earlier this year, the Trump administration abducted and attempted to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder, based on his pro-Palestine activism at Columbia University. During that time, his wife gave birth to their first son. Immigration officials denied his request to attend the birth. Government officials falsely accused Khalil of antisemitism to justify deporting him. In a letter to the immigration court, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote that Khalil's “public actions and continued presence in the United States” undermine “U.S. In another case, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers abducted Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk for co-authoring an opinion piece for the student paper that called on the university to break ties with Israel. Anti-American activity will be an overwhelmingly negative factor in any discretionary analysis.” “America's benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies,” USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser said of the new policy guidelines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Where can we escape, when every corner is pervaded by death? My family and I look into each other's eyes. We don't say a word, but our anguished faces are all asking the same question: Do we flee to the south, where bombardment and killing never cease — where death only comes slower? Or do we remain in Gaza City Governorate, just before the Netzarim checkpoint, which has also become home to everyone from Gaza's north — more than 1 million people — only to be erased quickly, because the occupation has already decided to wipe it out completely? The choice seems to be between how quickly we may die. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. Entire neighborhoods were erased as if they had never existed. This total destruction is precisely what Israel today threatens in Gaza City Governorate— to turn it into a mirror image of the north and east, despite the destruction already present, leaving it as lifeless as those areas have become. Between 2023 and 2024, Israel launched three brutal ground invasions into Gaza City Governorate, with tanks rolling through the streets, crushing everything in their path. Al-Rimal was placed under a suffocating siege for nearly 20 days. During that period, we could not even drink safe water. We could not contemplate moving or even looking out from our windows. My family and I endured a real famine, facing death by starvation during those 20 grueling days. Al-Shifa Hospital was completely destroyed, leaving behind total ruin, while surrounding neighborhoods were shattered, and residents trapped under relentless bombardment from tanks and airstrikes. Everything that moved in the streets — whether human or animal — was targeted. I witnessed the full reality of an Israeli ground invasion: tanks patrolling day and night without pause, their engines roaring like beasts, the streets trembling under their weight. Yet the cruelty did not end with their withdrawal from any area. Once Israeli forces moved a safe distance away from a neighborhood, they obliterated it entirely from the air, erasing every home, every life — which is what happened to Palestine Square in Al-Rimal. This month — on August 10, 2025 — the occupation began demanding that the residents of Gaza City Governorate prepare for displacement — including from Al-Rimal neighborhood, where I reside. This governorate is one of the largest in Gaza, home to more than 1 million people. Is the plan, after seizing this vast governorate, to take control of the south, gather all of us in Rafah, and forcibly displace us from Gaza entirely? Days after the occupation's announcement, my father began reaching out to people in the south, searching desperately for any place where we could seek refuge. By God's grace, he survived, but the experience traumatized my family. Ten days later, on October 23, 2023, we returned to northern Gaza, where the nightmare intensified. Now, as the occupation presses us once again to flee south, we face a terrifying dilemma: How can we trust that the south is safe, after nearly losing my brother Mohammed there? We know that any misstep could revive the same nightmare, and that our lives, and the lives of our loved ones, could hang by a thread. How could my family, which endured more than a year and a half of unimaginable suffering in northern Gaza, surviving the deadliest horrors — ground invasions, manufactured famine, relentless airstrikes, all from Israel — ever leave our city now? For them, going back north was like a dream realized after unbearable hardship. How could they even consider leaving it all again for the south? Everyone is advising us to,” my father asked his colleague, Abu Moayad Al-Ramlawi. Just days earlier, the Al-Tuffah neighborhood had received a warning to flee — and then was completely wiped out. My brother-in-law's wife lost her brothers simply because they refused to flee. I will carry this tent anywhere in the south. Death will find me there too, but I'd rather die among people than alone here.” He replied firmly: “I will stay in my home. She apologized: “There is nothing here but a tent, if you want it.” And so, my family is torn, trapped in uncertainty. The coming winter looms — should we shiver in a tent, exposed to bitter cold? This war drags on endlessly, and no one else besides Palestinians seems to care how long it will last. Tensions have escalated sharply over the past few days. On August 16, tanks drew dangerously close to the Al-Rimal neighborhood, signaling an imminent threat. Two days later, the situation appeared to shift slightly. Reports indicate that Israel and Hamas have resumed negotiations. Analysts warn that a full occupation of Gaza City Governorate, due to its vast size, could take the entirety of 2026 to complete. We fear that these negotiations may prove futile, leaving us displaced and forced out of Gaza — reliving the tragedy Palestinians endured during the Nakba of 1948.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge said he would not unseal grand jury transcripts and exhibits from the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein – rejecting the Justice Department's request to make them public. Judge Richard Berman said the Justice Department did not overcome long-standing precedent to keep grand jury materials sealed and noted that the information contained in the sealed materials is small relative to the entire investigation file already in DOJ's hands. The Justice Department declined to comment on Berman's ruling. This is the third federal judge to decline to release Epstein-related transcripts and evidence from a grand jury. Federal judge rejects Trump DOJ's bid to unseal grand jury materials in Ghislaine Maxwell case The ruling comes as the Trump administration has faced mounting pressure to release more information around the Epstein files, especially after senior officials promised to do so. The judge added another compelling reason to keep the records sealed are “possible threats to victims' safety and privacy.” Attorney General Pam Bondi released binders to right-wing social media influencers at the White House in February, but many of the influencers shared that the binders did not reveal any new information regarding the Epstein files. The Justice Department started revoking their promises to release more information in Epstein's case in May and downplaying the situation. On July 7, the DOJ released an unsigned memo saying they would not be releasing any more documents regarding the Epstein files. The Justice Department has explored several avenues to have more information released, including by asking two federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury materials in Epstein's case and Ghislaine Maxwell's case. Maxwell is Epstein's long-time partner who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for carrying out a years-long scheme with Epstein to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. New York federal Judge Paul Engelmayer denied the Justice Department's request for grand jury materials in Maxwell's case on August 11 in a scathing opinion, saying that the premise of DOJ's argument was false and that the request was not a matter of public interest. Additionally, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche conducted a two-day interview with Maxwell on July 24 and 25 at the US Attorney's Office in Tallahassee, Florida.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov dismisses European diplomacy as ‘clumsy effort to sway Trump' Moscow has said it must be part of any international talks on Ukraine's security, as Russia continues to stall on Donald Trump's push for a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Wednesday that Moscow must be included in any talks on Ukraine's security guarantees, dismissing European diplomacy as “aggressive escalation” and a “clumsy effort to sway Trump”. European leaders have begun exploring post-conflict security guarantees for Ukraine, following Trump's pledge to help protect the country under any deal to end Russia's war. Russian officials have repeatedly said Moscow would not accept the deployment of European forces to Ukraine, one of the key security guarantees under discussion. Kyiv is likely to view with scepticism any prospect of China, a supporter of Russia during the war, acting as a security guarantor. Lavrov, meanwhile, avoided any direct reference to a possible Putin-Zelenskyy summit, highlighting the Kremlin's apparent plans to delay any concrete planning of a meeting. Putin, who almost never refers to Zelenskyy by name and instead speaks of the “Kyiv regime”, has repeatedly cast doubt on whether his Ukrainian counterpart even holds the authority to sign a peace agreement. “You can negotiate with anyone, but because of his illegitimacy, he [Zelenskyy] has no right to sign anything,” Putin told Russian officials earlier this year. But Trump's promise of a meeting puts Putin in a difficult spot: rejecting it risks tension with the US president, while agreeing to one would elevate Zelenskyy to equal status and confront Putin with a media-savvy rival ready to meet almost without preconditions. Moscow has shown scant sign of preparing for such an encounter. Lavrov cautioned on Wednesday that any contact between the two leaders would need to be arranged “with the utmost care”, while other Russian officials dismissed Zelenskyy as a lightweight unworthy of serious attention. Several countries have offered to host a possible Putin-Zelenskyy meeting, including the Vatican, Switzerland and Hungary. “He has repeatedly stated that such a meeting would only be possible if there were well-prepared grounds, which in practice means Zelenskyy's acceptance of Russia's terms for ending the war.” “Simply put, Putin only sees value in a meeting with Zelenskyy if it ends with a capitulation,” wrote the nationalist commentator Alexei Mukhin. “If Zelenskyy is unwilling to sign one, the Kremlin will keep ‘working on' the idea of a meeting until he is,” Mukhin added. Lavrov said the US was beginning to gain a clearer understanding of the “root causes” of the war – a phrase Putin has used to describe demands ranging from Ukraine's formal renunciation of Nato membership to its “demilitarisation” and “denazification”, a vague formula that in practice would mean removing Zelenskyy. Those failed negotiations centred on Moscow's demands for Ukraine's disarmament, political neutrality and the abandonment of its ambition to join Nato. Meanwhile, Russian officials told Reuters that Moscow was preparing to raise taxes and cut spending to sustain high defence outlays and keep the war effort going.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Poland's Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz confirmed that the object, which fell into a cornfield near the village of Osiny, was a Russian unmanned aerial vehicle. Osiny is located in Lublin Voivodeship, a province that borders Ukraine and Belarus. "Russia once again provokes NATO countries — after drone incidents that took place in Romania, Lithuania, and Latvia, as well as after airspace violations that occurred in almost all NATO countries," Kosiniak-Kamysz added. Kosiniak-Kamysz said that Poland's Defense Ministry had briefed top military commanders, as well as security and foreign affairs officials, and that Poland's allies had been informed. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said the incident was a fresh violation of Polish airspace "from the east" and announced that Warsaw would issue a diplomatic protest. A Polish military spokesman said the drone appeared to have flown very low to avoid radar detection and likely carried only a small amount of explosives. A special investigation team has been appointed to examine the wreckage. Poland, a NATO member on the alliance's eastern border, has repeatedly accused Moscow of testing its defenses and attempting to destabilize the region through drone flights and airspace violations. The incident in Poland comes as Western leaders accelerate talks on possible peace arrangements for Ukraine, with Kyiv pressing for binding international security guarantees. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. Closer to Ukraine, Lithuania said it was ready to put troops on the ground as part of a peacekeeping force, while Poland said its soldiers would assist the "coalition of the willing" from Poland. In a joint statement, representatives of five Security Council members — Denmark, France, Greece, the United Kingdom and Slovenia — along with incoming member Latvia, denounced Russia's invasion of Georgia 17 years ago and its continued military presence in the country's Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions. Poland's Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz confirmed that the object, which fell into a cornfield near the village of Osiny, was a Russian unmanned aerial vehicle. The Kyiv Independent spent a day with the 20th Separate UAV Regiment, also known as K-2, which specializes in ground robots, in northern Donetsk Oblast. Ukrposhta, Ukraine's state-owned postal service, is closing its offices in the front-line city of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast due to the deteriorating security situation, company CEO Ihor Smelyansky announced on Aug. 20. "Valerii Zaluzhnyi has stated his position more than once, and as far as I know, it has not changed: while the war continues, we need to work to preserve the country, not think about elections," Zaluzhnyi's aide  Oksana Torop said. Russian President Vladimir Putin "noted with satisfaction Turkey's assistance in hosting talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives in Istanbul," the Kremlin reported. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that "seriously discussing security issues without Russia is a road to nowhere." Indian Oil Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. bought several shipments of Russian Urals crude in recent days, with deliveries expected in September and October.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration escalated its fight against the International Criminal Court by imposing sanctions on four more court officials involved in work related to alleged Israeli and US war crimes. In a statement Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department was designating Kimberly Prost of Canada, Nicolas Guillou of France, Nazhat Shameem Khan of Fiji and Mame Mandiaye Niang of Senegal for their work in the ICC “to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute nationals of the United States or Israel, without the consent of either nation.” The sanctions were imposed under an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in February that authorizes punitive measures like sanctions and possible entrance bans on ICC personnel because of its “illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.” The executive order was already used to sanction ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan and four ICC judges. According to a State Department fact sheet, Prost, an ICC judge “is being designated for ruling to authorize the ICC's investigation into U.S. personnel in Afghanistan.” Guillou, another judge, “is being designated for ruling to authorize the ICC's issuance of arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant,” the fact sheet said. “Deputy Prosecutors Shameem Khan and Niang are being designated for continuing to support illegitimate ICC actions against Israel, including upholding the ICC's arrest warrants targeting Prime Minister Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Gallant since they assumed leadership for the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor,” it said. The ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Gallant in November 2024 for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Trump also signed an executive order authorizing sanctions and visa restrictions for members of the court during his first term in 2020, months after the ICC authorized a probe into alleged war crimes committed in Afghanistan by US and Afghan forces as well as alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Taliban.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Residents cite pollution, loss of fishing and diminished tax revenue as liquefied natural gas production for export accelerates This story was originally published by Floodlight, a non-profit newsroom that investigates the powers stalling climate action For more than a decade, Rebekah Hinojosa has fought the build-out of liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals near the Texas border with Mexico. Some insurers and investors have severed ties with Rio Grande LNG. One of the three proposed LNG projects there was canceled in 2021. But then Donald Trump was elected for a second time. Eight months into his second term, at least six projects that had been awaiting crucial federal approvals – including those that Hinojosa has fought – are moving forward again. Fisher Tad Theriot has seen his yearly income from shrimping in the water near the LNG facilities drop from $325,000 in 2021 to $87,000 last year. This year he estimates the income from his catch will be less than half of that. “If … you don't get away from Cameron, you're not catching shrimp,” Theriot said of the small Louisiana community that already hosts three LNG terminals and where at least two others are planned to be built. The amount of LNG exported – last year it was 11.9bn cubic feet a day – is expected to double by 2028. Fracked gas is sent by pipeline to an LNG terminal where it is superchilled until it's a liquid and then shipped around the world. While a million British thermal units (MMBTU) of natural gas can be purchased in the United States for about $4, after it's superchilled and transported across oceans, countries such as Japan and Germany pay $12 to $15 per MMBTU for that gas. Even after the cost of producing and shipping the LNG, companies that export LNG stand to make billions of dollars in profits. A US Department of Energy study finalized in May said LNG creates jobs, expands the US gross domestic product and helps close the trade gap. “President Trump was given a mandate to unleash American energy dominance, and that includes US LNG exports,” the US energy secretary, Chris Wright, said in the report. Louisiana's Cameron parish alone would forfeit nearly $15bn between 2012 and 2040 if all proposed terminals were built. Local residents, such as James Hiatt, founder of the regional environmental and community advocacy group For a Better Bayou, say the communities do not benefit. They do get one thing, activist Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project, an environmental justice organization, says: pollution. While families struggle to pay for their own energy, Ozane said all the local community gets from the methane build-out is “more health problems”. And across the Calcasieu ship channel from his property, he can see Venture Global's Calcasieu Pass 1 LNG, and the site of its expansion, called CP2. He has watched 90 meters of his shoreline disappear in the past 27 years because of rising sea levels and subsidence caused by the climate crisis. “These are the estuaries that supply the seafood that Cameron parish and Louisiana's so famous for,” Allaire said, pointing to wetlands near his home where crabs and shrimp lay their eggs. LNG is sometimes promoted as a “bridge fuel” because it burns cleaner than coal. But Cornell scientist Robert Howarth warns that its full lifecycle emissions – including methane leaks during drilling, liquefaction, shipping and regasification – is 33% worse for the climate than coal. The International Energy Agency has warned that any new fossil infrastructure jeopardizes global climate goals. The LNG industry says its fuel is helping by replacing coal in countries such as India. But a recent analysis from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found that India is turning toward renewables, not LNG, to replace coal. Export terminals require gas prices of around $8 per MMBTU to break even – far more than the $3 to $5 per MMBTU equivalent of energy that countries like India can afford. Despite these analyses, developers are touting a booming market. Trump has extracted promises from Asian countries, including Japan and Vietnam, to purchase more LNG, but not all of the deals are binding – or even new. Golden Pass LNG in Texas, Allaire notes, was originally built as an import facility, but is now being refashioned as an export terminal after a pause caused by the bankruptcy of the construction firm building the project. Despite Trump's aggressive promotion of LNG, Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program for Public Citizen, said there are still grounds to fight the build-out, even if the environmental and justice arguments have been removed by his administration. For residents such as Roishetta Ozane, adding more LNG facilities is not an abstract energy debate. “Our community is already surrounded by pollution,” she said. “It makes absolutely no sense to approve two or three new LNG facilities here in south-west Louisiana when we already have as much industry as we do. Still, both Ozane and Rebekah Hinojosa refuse to give up. In late July and early August, Ozane was among roughly 70 Gulf coast advocates who protested outside the headquarters of companies in New York City that are financing and insuring the LNG boom. “We will still keep fighting and speaking up to do everything we can to stop these projects, because our community doesn't want these projects,” Hinojosa said. “I mean, for us, it's about continuing to exist here.” Floodlight is a non-profit newsroom that investigates the powers stalling climate action.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Toronto entrepreneur David Ossip transformed one of America's oldest technology companies, Ceridian Corp., from an underperforming, debt-laden equity-owned enterprise based in Minneapolis into a leading enterprise software vendor that was largely managed from Canada. That human resources software company, now known as Dayforce Inc. DAY-T, appears to be headed back into the private realm after confirming Wednesday it was in advanced discussions to be acquired by private equity giant Thoma Bravo for US$70 per share, valuing the company at more than US$11-billion. Dayforce stock, which had already soared earlier this week on reports of an impending deal, was trading Wednesday morning at $67.06 on the New York Stock Exchange, up 2.4 per cent. Dayforce beats revenue estimates, experts warn U.S. tariff labour impact could hit HCM industry This time, private equity firms, including Thoma Bravo, have been largely focused on sturdy, growing subscription software firms that have fallen out of favour with public market investors. Other prominent publicly traded Canadian software companies have recently looked into privatizing, including Lightspeed Commerce Inc. – which abandoned a sale process early this year – as well as Altus Group Ltd. and Dye & Durham Ltd. Mr. Ossip, a veteran, South African-born Canadian software entrepreneur, was already one of Canada's most high-profile software entrepreneurs when he launched Dayforce in the late 2000s: His previous startup, time-and-attendance management software provider Workbrain Corp., was bought by Infor Global Solutions for $227-million in 2007. At the time, the buyer, a payroll processing stalwart, was a faded technology has-been that started life as an IBM unit in 1932 and was purchased by U.S. private-equity giant Thomas H. Lee Partners in 2007. Mr. Ossip, now 58, subsequently built Ceridian's effective headquarters and executive team in Toronto, where much of the development work happens, while maintaining its U.S. domicile and Minneapolis headquarters. Dayforce had nearly 7,000 customers on its subscription software platform as of June 30, up 4.9 per cent year-over-year. If the original Dayforce startup had remained a stand-alone Canadian company, it would be one of this country's largest homegrown software vendors. Dayforce eventually consumed the old Ceridian, which formally changed its name early last year. After going public on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges in 2018 at US$22-a share (as Ceridian HCM Holdings Inc.), the stock soared through 2021, topping US$130 that November as the pandemic pushed consumers and companies alike to increasingly adopt online software. But like other software companies, Dayforce's stock fell after soaring inflation raised concerns that central banks would counteract with interest rate hikes. By that June, the company's stock had lost nearly two-thirds of its peak value, and was only trading in the low $50s range before news broke about a possible buyout last weekend. Rising rates also weighed on the enterprise software sales market. Dayforce's recurring revenue growth from its subscription software platform slowed from the 30 per cent-plus range two years ago, gaining 13.6 per cent in the second quarter to reach US$315.5-million. That outpaced total revenue growth, weighted down by Ceridian's legacy payroll management business, of 9.8 per cent. The company raised its annual revenue forecast last week, as more enterprises increase use of AI and cloud-based platforms to run day-to-day operations. Mr. Ossip briefly shared the CEO title with Leagh Turner from early 2022 through November, 2023. Ms. Turner, who had joined as president and chief operating officer in 2018 after serving as global chief operating officer with SAP AG, left Dayforce to lead Coupa Software, a Silicon Valley spend management software vendor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president's levy could meet cost of air cover for peacekeeping efforts, says treasury secretary Donald Trump could use a 10 per cent levy on weapons sales to Europe to fund US security guarantees for Ukraine, his treasury secretary has said. Scott Bessent revealed that the president had increased the price of US military hardware being bought by European countries for Ukraine by 10 per cent. “We are selling arms to Europeans, who are then selling them on to the Ukrainians, and President Trump is taking 10 per cent mark-up on the arms,” Mr Bessent told Fox News. Ukraine has also tabled a proposal that would see the country promise to buy a further $90bn worth of hardware after its war with Russia comes to an end. Mr Trump has insisted for some time that he will no longer spend US taxpayers' money on supporting Ukraine, the defence of which he believes is a problem for European nations. They joined a virtual meeting of Nato's military leaders “as diplomatic efforts to secure peace in Ukraine progress”, Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, an Italian admiral who heads the alliance's military committee, said. Around 10 nations have shown a willingness to join the deployment, including Britain, France and Germany. Mr Trump has signalled he could join bolstered plans for “Article Five-like” assurances for Kyiv – a reference to Nato's mutual defence clause that states an attack on one member is an attack on them all. But he has ruled out putting American boots on the ground as part of assistance. Meanwhile, the suggestion of a European peacekeeping force stationed in Ukraine has been met with veiled rejections from Moscow. Russia's top diplomat suggested that any guarantees should be on the basis of Russian demands from initial peace talks in the spring of 2022, which gave Moscow a veto over any military aid for Kyiv. “We cannot agree with the fact that now it is proposed to resolve questions of security, collective security, without the Russian Federation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk has dismissed a Wall Street Journal report claiming that he is quietly backing away from plans to launch his America Party. The newspaper said Musk had told allies he will focus on his businesses and not risk splitting Republican voters with a third-party bid. Musk supported US President Donald Trump in the 2024 election and temporarily served as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) before a public falling-out over the president's “Big Beautiful Bill” spending package. After resigning, he announced he would start his own political faction to challenge the two-party system and field candidates in the 2026 midterms. On Tuesday, however, the WSJ reported that Musk had allegedly told allies he would instead concentrate on his companies and avoid alienating Republicans by siphoning away GOP votes. Commenting on the report, Musk wrote on X that “nothing WSJ says should ever be thought of as true.” He did not address the outlet's claims. It noted that Musk has not formally ruled out forming a party and could change his mind as the midterm elections near. “I wouldn't use that to line my cage for parrot droppings,” the billionaire said of the WSJ earlier this year. Trump, meanwhile, has called Musk a “train wreck” and argued that third parties “have never succeeded in the US,” predicting that the billionaire's initiative would only create “disruption and chaos.” Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last summer, I found myself in a position that's become all too common in Canada: Despite signing up for daycare options early in my pregnancy, my maternity leave was winding down, and I still didn't have child care lined up for my 11-month-old daughter. Growing up, my parents – especially my mom – fit the stereotype of the strict Asian immigrant parent that still endures today. In the end, we took my parents up on their offer. But what surprised me was how they embraced taking care of my daughter: that is, with real tenderness. My daughter quickly formed a deep bond with them. My parents were attuned to – and even accommodated – her big toddler feelings, like when she got upset about dropping rice on the floor because she wanted to use the spoon all by herself. In effect, my mom and dad adopted “gentle parenting” – a style in which parents calmly meet children and their emotions where they are, and which I'm inundated by every time I open Instagram. Every day felt like a new challenge as I had to adjust to her constant changes and tackle endless meals and appointments. Feeling out of control, I started projecting my stress in unhealthy ways – including by occasionally being short with my daughter. I had started off worried that my parents would be too harsh, and then found myself feeling like I was becoming them. One of the first cases I managed at a gender-equality organization was about the impact of caregiving on women workers. I knew how workplaces systematically devalued “female pattern employment” – that is, the way that many women have to work part-time because of their caregiving responsibilities. In many workplaces, the ideal worker was “unencumbered” – meaning, most often, a man who did not have such responsibilities and could therefore work full-time. And while many of today's parents make more money than their parents did, the rapidly increasing cost of living and education means that many feel that they can't ever provide adequately for their children. Opinion: The art of letting go as our kids venture into adulthood The Canada-Wide Early Learning Childcare (CWELCC) program has significantly eased the economic burden for parents – daycare rates for infants in Toronto went from about $100 per day to about $22 – but the uncertain future of CWELCC beyond 2026, combined with the soaring cost of living, is leaving many families stressed and stretched. Further, a promise to add 250,000 child care spots across the country by next year appears to be far from achieving its goal. I am fortunate that my parents could give us the gift of intergenerational child care – and that their gift has brought us closer together, too. The intimacy that grows from sharing meals and updates about my daughter every day has also led us to share more openly about ourselves. Watching my mom and dad become loving, generous grandparents has been an important reminder to me that we are all capable of evolving; they've inspired me by showing what is possible when you're allowed to be your full self while raising a child. But intergenerational child care is not an option for everyone. And of course, it's different for retirees without professional commitments. And they're no longer facing the hardships of being new immigrants. They have the freedom to pursue caregiving with eagerness and an abundance mindset. Today's parents are expected to be everything, everywhere, all at once, a burden that fails to account for systemic shortcomings.

THE HAGUE, August 20. /TASS/. Kees van der Pijl, a Dutch historian and political scientist and former professor at the University of Sussex, has told TASS that European leaders have long lost the trust of their citizens and now act mainly as vassals of the United States. Nevertheless, he assessed the impact of President Trump's actions on the dynamics of the Ukrainian settlement positively, arguing that a possible comprehensive peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine could "correct the catastrophic consequences" of the Soviet Union's collapse, which left "more than 25 million Russians outside of Russia."

On August 18, Trump hosted in Washington a meeting with Vladimir Zelensky and the leaders of several European states. Zelensky was accompanied to the White House by French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Trump stressed the day before that the White House would be hosting such a large number of European leaders for the first time in its history. The Trump-Zelensky one-on-one conversation lasted about an hour, after which the American president met with Zelensky and the European leaders together. Trump also spoke by telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin; according to Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov, the call lasted about 40 minutes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India's state-owned refiners have resumed purchases of Russian oil after a brief pause triggered by U.S. tariffs, Bloomberg reported on Aug. 20. The suspension followed a 25% tariff imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on Aug. 6 over India's continued imports of Russian oil. Despite the pressure, Indian Oil Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. bought several shipments of Russian Urals crude in recent days, with deliveries expected in September and October, according to Bloomberg. Earlier this month, the companies had suspended purchases for those months under U.S. pressure. Imports of Russian crude have risen more than 20-fold to over 2 million barrels per day. Wear our new T-shirt to let other people know you want answers. China has also expanded its role as a leading buyer of Russian oil. Bloomberg reported on Aug. 19 that Beijing has ramped up purchases amid Trump's threats of tariffs, with imports of Urals crude from the Baltic and Black Sea doubling in August to nearly 75,000 barrels per day. Trump had threatened penalties if Moscow did not agree to a ceasefire, giving Russia 10 days on July 29 to halt its war or face secondary tariffs. U.S. officials have warned that countries like China could face tariffs of up to 100% on their exports to the U.S. if they continue buying Russian oil. Oil revenues account for roughly one-third of Russia's federal budget, making energy exports a vital source of funding for its war against Ukraine.

The Kyiv Independent spent a day with the 20th Separate UAV Regiment, also known as K-2, which specializes in ground robots, in northern Donetsk Oblast. European leaders have accelerated negotiations on security guarantees for Ukraine in recent weeks, responding to President Volodymyr Zelensky's request for binding assurances that Russia will not attack again if a ceasefire is reached. Ukrposhta, Ukraine's state-owned postal service, is closing its offices in the front-line city of Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast due to the deteriorating security situation, company CEO Ihor Smelyansky announced on Aug. 20. "Valerii Zaluzhnyi has stated his position more than once, and as far as I know, it has not changed: while the war continues, we need to work to preserve the country, not think about elections," Zaluzhnyi's aide  Oksana Torop said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that "seriously discussing security issues without Russia is a road to nowhere." According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russian forces launched 93 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones, along with two Iskander-M ballistic missiles, overnight. "We expect that Ukraine will not launch new attacks on the pipeline, which is critical to our country's energy supply," Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prosecutors believe Julio Cesar Chavez Jr acted as a henchman for the Sinaloa crime syndicate Chavez Jr, 39, has been imprisoned in Hermosillo in the northern state of Sonora, Mexico, and is facing charges of arms and drugs trafficking. Prosecutors believe Chavez Jr acted as a henchman for the Sinaloa cartel – one of the world's most powerful crime syndicates that was designated a foreign terrorist organisation earlier this year. An arrest warrant was issued in 2023 following a four-year-long investigation. Chavez Jr was arrested last month by Immigration Customs Enforcement officers in Studio City, California, 10 miles north of Los Angeles, days after being beaten by Jake Paul, a social media influencer turned professional boxer, in an exhibition bout. Ronald Johnson, the US ambassador to Mexico and former CIA officer, shared a photograph on social media of Chavez Jr being led away by armed officers from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Mr Johnson said Chavez Jr, a Mexican national, would “face charges under his country's justice system”. Mexico's national arrest registry showed that the boxer was arrested at a checkpoint in the Mexican border city of Nogales at 11.53am local time and transferred to a federal institution in Sonora's capital of Hermosillo. Chavez Jr was wearing a black hoodie and red trainers, it said. The DHS has said that the warrant for Chavez Jr details his alleged involvement in “organised crime and trafficking firearms, ammunition and explosives”. He was also said to have made “multiple fraudulent statements” on an application filed last year for lawful permanent resident status that was based on his marriage to a US citizen alleged to have family connections with the Sinaloa cartel. Later that year, Chavez Jr tested positive for marijuana after fighting Sergio Martínez, the Argentinian two-weight division world champion, and received a nine-month suspension. He was also fined about £666,000 by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.</p>
