                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's ≈öwiƒÖtek/Ruud (3) vs. Pegula/Draper in the first semi on Arthur Ashe ‚Äî before champions Errani/Vavassori vs. Collins/Harrison. Who goes to the top of this list in little more than a fortnight's time? Let us know your thoughts with an email to: live@theathletic.com Alongside this re-formatted mixed doubles, the men's and women's singles qualification tournaments are also taking place during Fan Week, which runs until Thursday. It is then a few days off before the U.S. Open gets fully underway on Sunday. üí¨ ‚ÄúWith fiery determination and an unrelenting attack, Martina climbed the game's highest peaks by amassing an incredible 15 U.S. Open championships including four singles titles. ‚ÄúBecoming a U.S. citizen, Martina went on a remarkable run reaching five consecutive U.S. Open singles finals and her Open Era achievements may never be surpassed.‚Äù As proof, she is the only player to win all four Grand Slams and an Olympic gold medal in the same year, doing so in 1988. Her five U.S. Open singles titles stretched over nine years. She was also a singles finalist on three occasions.‚Äù Still a familiar face in New York City, John McEnroe's tennis career was defined by his flair for the dramatic and a sense of style that was equally dazzling. ‚ÄúA master at singles as well as doubles, McEnroe won three consecutive U.S. Open singles titles, 1979-80-81, becoming the first man to do so since Bill Tilden in the 1920s. He is also one of the most dominant players ever on grass, winning seven Wimbledon titles.... üí¨ ‚ÄúWith quiet confidence, unfailing courage and unparalleled commitment to excellence, Pete Sampras rewrote the record books and redefined the word ‚Äòchampion.' ‚ÄúHis ascent to greatness lifted this event ‚Äî and the sport of tennis ‚Äî to new heights of energy and intensity. ‚ÄúArmed with an enormous serve, explosive forehand and exquisite net game, Sampras was a competitor of singular brilliance ‚Äî and a champion of exceptional class. Billie Jean King is one of the most decorated players to play the sport, earning 39 Grand Slam titles during her playing career, including four U.S. Open singles titles. üí¨ ‚ÄúAn effervescent and unrelenting fighter for women's tournament rights, ‚ÄòBillie Jean' was universally revered throughout the sporting community. A civil rights pioneer and a superstar on the court, Althea Gibson is one of the most consequential figures in tennis history. A true pioneer, she broke barriers as she rose from the streets of Harlem while battling ignorance and prejudice with grace, courage and dignity. ‚ÄúThe first African-American to compete at the U.S. Championships and Wimbledon, Gibson won 11 career Grand Slam titles ‚Äî including two U.S. nationals singles crowns. Never shy in terms of speaking out against racial injustice both in the United States and abroad, Arthur Ashe is as well-known for his civil rights advocacy as he is for his tennis. On the court, he had an ability to combine immense shotmaking with strategic excellence. üí¨ ‚ÄúHis name synonymous with integrity, dignity and class, Arthur Ashe was a champion of extraordinary talent and a man of singular grace. ‚ÄúEach defines the essence of talent and character required to win at tennis' ultimate proving grounds. Let us take you through those iconic names and memories next... Not only is it an iconic drink, you can now also purchase a candle scented like the cocktail. Ben Shelton going behind the scenes of a shoot. A new partnership between the ATP Tour and TikTok illustrates how tennis wants to embrace a younger, more casual audience as well as hardcore fans. One of several notable sculptures at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, a portrait of tennis icon and civil rights pioneer Althea Gibson. Did you know, in addition to her historic tennis career, Gibson became the first Black woman to ever join the LPGA tour in 1960? As I mentioned earlier, anyone competing at the 2025 U.S. Open mixed doubles is going to walk away with a bit of cash. This year's Grand Slam in Queens is already set to be the first tennis event to reach $90 million in prize money ‚Äî which is a whopping 20 percent increase on the previous high set by the U.S. Open 12 months ago. As for this revamped mixed doubles championship, here is what the pairs are playing for today (all figures per team)‚Ä¶ Those who lost their first match yesterday took home $20,000 and it was $100,000 if their mixed doubles ended after two matches As for today, the stakes are clearly far higher. The Norwegian sent ≈öwiƒÖtek a message of support after she fought back tears during a heavy defeat against Coco Gauff at the Madrid Open, telling her that she inspires so many. Since then, she has risen back to world No. Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek won the Cincinnati Open final against Jasmine Paolini on Monday. Less than 12 hours later, she was back on Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York playing mixed doubles with Casper Ruud. Then in the quarterfinal, ≈öwiƒÖtek/Ruud trounced Caty McNally and Lorenzo Musetti 4-1, 4-2. Ruud was very complimentary of ≈öwiƒÖtek after the match too: Instead, he's in the mixed doubles semifinal alongside Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek. He lost in four sets to Carlos Alcaraz, as the Spaniard took his first slam. This year Ruud won the Madrid Open, his first ATP Masters 1000 title. Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek retained her place within the top tier of women's tennis with a dominant 6-0, 6-0 victory in the women's singles final at Wimbledon to win her first title at SW19 and shake off a rough start to 2025. Less than 12 hours after winning in Cincinnati, ≈öwiƒÖtek rattled off two wins in the mixed doubles championship to advance to the semifinals. A U.S. Open singles victory may not get her closer to a career Grand Slam since she already won the event in 2022... But it would further secure ≈öwiƒÖtek as a force to be reckoned with after some shine came off her star in back-to-back Grand Slam semifinal defeats in Australia and at Roland Garros to begin 2025. For various reasons ‚Äî illness, injury, their playing partner dropping out, focusing on another event ‚Äî plenty of players have pulled out of the mixed doubles event. Late last week Emma Navarro, Paula Badosa and Tommy Paul all withdrew from the U.S. Open mixed doubles championship ‚Äî leaving Jannik Sinner, Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula briefly without a playing partner. Pegula and Draper pivoted by pairing together, while Sinner joined doubles specialist Kate≈ôina Siniakov√°... before Sinner then pulled out due to the illness which forced him to end his Cincinnati Open final against Carlos Alcaraz early. No playing partner was found for Siniakov√° so they were replaced by Americans Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are no new alerts at this time 2 men's player in the world, and Raducanu, the 35th-ranked women's player, are both former U.S. Open singles champions. Yet they lost 4-2, 4-2 against the top-seeded team of Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula in a match that lasted less than one hour. The mixed-doubles event has drawn criticism this year for a new format that prioritizes singles stars over teams that specialize in doubles play. Instead of a 32-team field, there were only 16 teams in the tournament this year. The prize money is also significantly higher, with the winners taking home $1 million compared to only $200,000 last year. ‚ÄúIt would be like if, at the Olympics, they didn't let the actual high jumpers participate, and instead had basketball players compete in the high jump because it's more ‚Äòinteresting,‚Äù Sara Errani, who won the doubles event with Andrea Vavassori last year, told the Associated Press earlier this week. You can't have a Grand Slam doubles (trophy) and not let doubles players take part. British player Joe Salisbury told the AP the decision to include singles stars "does bring a bit more attention to it." "But I'm not sure it's good for the doubles event, because it's not really a proper event. The mixed-doubled tournament will conclude on Wednesday.

Thousands of players took part in the qualifying stages this year, leading to county and regional finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on Wimbledon's Aorangi Courts last week. Compton won the women's B1 Visually Impaired tennis finals during the tournament and revealed it was an experience she will never forget. "It's a case of third time lucky for me. "It was a really good match and I held my nerve on my serves to get a resounding win which I'm thrilled about." This year's tournament delivered over 10,000 playing opportunities with thousands of singles and doubles players taking part at 800 venues, leading to county and area finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on the All England Club's Aorangi Courts from 3 ‚Äì 9 August 2025. ‚ÄúPlay your Way to Wimbledon is a massive event for someone to pick up a racket for the first time or start playing again if they haven't for a while. ‚ÄúIt's about being active at grassroots level, making friends and new tennis partners and that is the beauty of events like this.‚Äù Reid added: ‚ÄúWe want tennis to be available and accessible to everybody and get as many people as possible enjoying the sport. ‚ÄúThis event encapsulates that perfectly and we're proud to be a part of it.‚Äù Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article is part of a series reported and written by students at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville as an assignment for a course offered by the School of Journalism and Media. In the 147 years since that first competition, players have been required to wear all white: no bright colors or flashy designs. Wimbledon has also adhered to a strict code of conduct, with players punished for misbehavior such as yelling, breaking rackets or seeking assistance from coaches during a match. The all-white dress code was established to prevent players from showing sweat, something that was seen as improper in the Victorian Era. In 2015, these rules compelled the tournament's organizers to force Aussie Nick Kyrgios to turn his Wimbledon-branded headband inside out because it was too colorful. If it's 9 p.m., most courts at Wimbledon don't have lights, and the tournament has an 11 p.m. curfew because the local neighborhood demands it. The perception of Wimbledon is quintessentially British: posh, quiet, snobby and elite. Look no further than the royal box that is constructed each year on Centre Court, where the tournament's finals are played, just so that the royal family can remind everyone what it means to be born lucky. John, a long-time tour guide at Wimbledon and London native who requested we not fully identify him to protect (we used an alias for his first name) his status as a Wimbledon employee, answered the cries of thousands of fans who want to feel included in this seemingly unreachable sport. "We have a diversity program within the club as well. Scott Shannon, an American lifelong fan of tennis, echoes this call for acceptance. ‚ÄúGrowing up, (my family) did not have the opportunity to watch many professional tennis tournaments; however, Wimbledon was an event at our house, and we learned the game by watching.‚Äù He may have never picked up a racket or stepped onto a lawn tennis court in his small town in South Carolina, but the game was real to him. ‚ÄúI love the traditions that make Wimbledon what it is," Shannon said. There are certain traditions in sports that make a tournament or venue special.‚Äù But tradition at Wimbledon does not preclude the tournament from selling some seats in the front row at Centre Court for a relatively affordable 30 British pounds or about $40. ‚ÄúAny money that we make over and above the usual income that comes in, we support hundreds of charities within the area. We work very closely with food programs as well.‚Äù For Scott, the allure of Wimbledon remains in its traditions. The allure, he said, remains in its traditions; ‚ÄúI think tradition has to do with identity. Wimbledon is the standard against which all other tournaments are measured.‚Äù Now, female players can wear darker undergarments to conceal menstruation. Additionally, despite tradition, Wimbledon pays its men's and women's tournament winners equally. And while tradition previously might have meant waiting seven years to include women, or over 70 years to include Black players, it also means providing the platform for Serena Williams to dominate the world stage and inspire younger women like Coco Gauff to follow in her footsteps. A 147-year-old tree planted firmly in its roots will not walk forward, but it will sway and bend in the blowing wind.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FRANK SHIELDS was the original tennis badboy. A New Yorker through and through, Shields reached the final of his home tournament at the US Championships, which would later become known as the US Open, in 1930. As reported by the Telegraph, however, cultural critic Jeffrey Hart once claimed of the 1931 showpiece: "This was a murky episode, in which legend has it that Shields was busy investigating the attributes of a matched pair of French countesses. "The truth is probably that he had a badly twisted leg from his previous match with [Jean] Borotra ‚Äì though the explanations are not mutually exclusive." His second was a Spanish princess, Marina Torlonia di Civitella-Cesi, with whom he had two children. In total he had five children with two different women, and among his grandchildren is American actress and socialite Brooke Shields - who would go on to marry Andre Agassi in 1997, their marriage lasting two years. Much has been made of this year's controversially revamped US Open mixed doubles event, which saw Carlos Alcaraz partner Emma Raducanu at Flushing Meadows. But in 1950, a grizzled veteran by this point, Shields partnered Hollywood A-lister Ginger Rogers in the mixed event at the US Open. Rogers, an Academy Award-winning actress more used to recreational matches at country clubs than Grand Slam tennis, partnered Shields - although the glamorous pair were eliminated in round one at Forest Hills. Per the Telegraph, Budge Patty, who reached world No1 that year, believed that Shields' motives for partnering Rogers went beyond mere forehands and backhands. Patty said: "There was only one reason why Frank would have been playing with her." Shields enjoyed a taste of the high life alongside Rogers, but couldn't match her exploits on the silver screen. The tennis lothario did attempt a career in cinema, appearing in several films during the 1930s, albeit with little commercial success. Shields went on to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1964, but while his quality was not in doubt, his reliability often was. Amazingly he was later discovered at sea, armed with nothing but the tuxedo on his back. Hart wrote of the episode: "He had accompanied some friends on the boat train to Le Havre, a party all the way, and woke up at sea on the Warren Harding with no money, only his tuxedo." Shields struggled with alcohol in his latter years and he eventually died in 1975 aged 65, sadly succumbing to a third heart attack. His legacy is a complex one, but Shields will forever remain one of the most intriguing stars in American tennis history.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner has claimed three hardcourt Grand Slam titles ‚Äì two at the Australian Open and one at the US Open. The player with the most hardcourt Grand Slam singles titles is none other than Novak Djokovic, whose tally is 14 (10 Australian Open and four US Open trophies). In the recently concluded Cincinnati Masters, Sinner failed to defend his title as he suffered from an illness and which forced him to give a walkover to Carlos Alcaraz after trailing 0-5 in the first set. It also ended his 26-match winning streak on hardcourts that started from the Shanghai Masters last year. I don't think we would be surprised, honestly. I think it shows how good he is that the stats are getting lost in all the results because he is literally in every final and is winning and playing for every title and tournament that he plays in. The fact that it's like he's now accumulated 26 hard-court wins in a row, it wouldn't surprise me at all. It was Sinner who stopped Djokovic from reaching the finals of two Grand Slam events this season. I don't know about 16 hardcourt Majors, but I think he is going to dominate for a long time. But Djokovic played his match, along with Olga Danilovic. They lost in their first match against the Russian team of Daniil Medvedev and Mirra Andreeva. Since that win, the Serb has made a Grand Slam final only once, in last year's Wimbledon which he lost to Alcaraz. The main draw of the US Open singles is scheduled to start on August 24, so Jannik Sinner has an ample amount of time to recover from the illness before starting his title defense. And this is why former player from America, Ryan Harrison, is not worried about the four-time Grand Slam champion. I think hearing that he has seven days to respond. Last year at Flushing Meadows, Sinner spoiled Taylor Fritz‚Äòs hope to end the American men's title drought in singles with a straight-set win. The 24-year-old has far this season, played five finals and clinched two titles, both in Grand Slam events. He breezed past Alexander Zverev to defend his Australian Open title. After losing the French Open final to Alcaraz following five tough sets, he took his revenge on the five-time Grand Slam champion with a four-set win at Wimbledon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All eight ATP Winston-Salem round of 16 matches will be completed on Wednesday. Sebastian Korda and former Wimbledon semifinalist Roberto Bautista Agut's contests are among those predicted in this article. We here at LWOT predict the rest of the action, including Lorenzo Sonego vs Jaume Munar, in a separate article. Medjedovic's powerful tennis can trouble most players when it clicks. The Canadian is a more consistent performer, but I feel Medjedovic could edge this. He impressed in the first two rounds and is capable of taking time away from Diallo and not letting him settle. Stefanos Tsitsipas's poor display should not detract from how well Bu played in his 6-3 6-2 victory. Navone's level was not far behind in a crushing 6-2 6-2 success over Marcos Giron. Despite that strong performance from the Argentine, Bu is a slight favorite to win. The intensity of his hitting from the match against Tsitsipas would probably be too much for Navone to handle on a hard court. Despite being 37, he retains the ability to stifle opponents with his relentless consistency. The Spaniard has lost half a step in speed, but his exceptional tennis IQ and more reliable level make him the favorite against Fucsovics. This will be Korda's second match since the French Open after being sidelined by a severe injury. Understandably, he was quite rusty in his first match back. No part of Majchrzak's game is superior to last year's Citi DC Open champion. He is particularly interested in the women's game and loves offering his insights on anything related to the WTA Tour.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top singles names and unlikely pairings share the stage in a made-for-primetime mixed-doubles tournament with a million-dollar stakes. Here are the results from Day 1. Watching some of the great singles players in mixed doubles ahead of the US Open main singles draws was an unprecedented treat. Perhaps Wednesday's best point came when Emma Raducanu somehow tracked down a thunderous overhead from Jack Draper -- and Carlos Alcaraz eventually finished with an improbable around-the-net winner. But more than anything, the results of the first day before big, supportive crowds in Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong Stadiums underlined just how special those ‚Äúdoubles specialists‚Äù are. Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori look like the favorites heading into Thursday night's semifinals and finals. ‚ÄúTactics in doubles are very important,‚Äù Vavassori said. ‚ÄúThere are many very strong players here, but we often play together, we also talk off the court, and this is important. ‚ÄúWe also play for all the doubles players who cannot compete at the mixed doubles tournament here. We try to do our best.‚Äù In 12 matches, four went to a second-set tiebreak -- but not one went to a third set. The Thursday semifinals and finals are scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. Here are the results from Tuesday's matches: 1 Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper def. The skinny: The 50-minute match was decided by superior net play, from both Draper and Pegula -- who has played the doubles quarterfinals at all four majors. They won 24 of 34 service points and were not broken. They converted their fifth match point on Pegula's serve with a winner from Draper. 3 Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud def. The skinny: Swiatek looked fresh, considering she stepped off the court in Cincinnati 16 hours earlier. She and Ruud needed only 39 minutes to dispatch the Americans, who had five double faults and were broken twice. The winners saved two of three break points and hit a combined 10 winners, against only six unforced errors. Caty McNally and Lorenzo Musetti def. The skinny: There were some awkward moments -- Musetti, aggressively running down a lob, almost knocked McNally off her feet -- but the makeshift team prevailed comfortably. When Paolini withdrew, McNally stepped in to become Musetti's partner. They forged 10 break-point opportunities and converted three. The skinny: This one required only 46 minutes, while the winners saved both break opportunities against them. ‚ÄúEven though we haven't played together, we had good communication on the court,‚Äù Swiatek said in her on-court interview. Rybakina and Fritz were seeded No. 2 based on their Top 10 singles prowess, but all those big serves (seven aces) weren't enough to prevail. Errani is a six-time Grand Slam doubles champion, and Vavassori has played in three major finals. 1 doubles player in the PIF WTA Rankings -- and she looked like it in this one. ‚ÄúI just do what she says.‚Äù The skinny: The Americans had 11 aces, but Muchova and Rublev took better care of their serves, winning 23 of 28 first-serve points and a remarkable 10 of 14 seconds. They also saved both break points against them and finished with seven more winners than unforced errors. The match was over in 42 minutes, as the American team converted three of five break-point opportunities and won 39 of 64 points. Errani and Vavassori hit a combined 18 winners, against only six unforced errors. It's not a coincidence that this is the only team in the field that consists of two pure doubles specialists. In an all-American contest, the winners needed only 46 minutes to take down Townsend, the WTA Tour's No. 1 doubles player and Shelton, the ATP Tour's No. Top singles names and unlikely pairings share the stage in a made-for-primetime mixed-doubles tournament with a million-dollar stakes.</p>
