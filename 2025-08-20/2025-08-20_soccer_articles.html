The college soccer season kicks off this month for NCAA men's and women's teams, and we're celebrating the occasion with a lively conversation with Tiffany Roberts Sahaydak, an Olympic gold medalist, World Cup champion, two-time NCAA champion and current head coach of the women's soccer team at the University of Central Florida.

In the episode, Sahaydak shares her journey from playing on boys' teams to becoming a professional (2:50). Then, she recounts her experiences as a soccer player, including the 1999 World Cup (20:18), the formation of the WUSA (24:20), and the challenges of maintaining a professional career. Throughout the conversation, Sahaydak puts on her coach's hat, emphasizing the importance of teamwork, resilience, role models and how UCF can beat top-ranked UNC, where Sahaydak won two national championships as a student-athlete.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every four years, the top national teams from a select group of countries faces off in an unprecedented sporting battle, competing for the ultimate prize in one of the world's most popular sports: soccer. In less than a year, on June 11, 2026, the United States, Canada, and Mexico will host the tournament, which this time will feature 48 teams, 104 matches, and 16 host cities. It's the first of several release phases. To enter the ticket lottery, applicants must first create a “FIFA ID” at FIFA.com/tickets. Winners will be selected in a random draw, with notifications starting September 30. It's not yet clear which matches will be available in this round, but FIFA says more details on the presale will be released in the coming weeks. According to the specialized media outlet Marca, once the draw stage is over, the remaining tickets will go on sale on a first-come, first-served basis, where speed and punctuality will be key. It is advisable to log in a few minutes before the official start, as tickets sell out quickly due to global demand. Subsequently, the official resale phase will open, managed directly by FIFA, allowing fans to purchase tickets that have been returned by other buyers in a secure environment. In all phases, a FIFA ID is still required, and only verified payment methods, such as international credit or debit cards, will be accepted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italy's national football team are due to play Israel in two World Cup qualifiers ahead of the 2026 tournament. The Italian Football Coaches' Association (AIAC) is pushing for Israel to be suspended from international competition over the war on Gaza. Ahead of Italy's crucial World Cup qualifiers against Israel in the next two months, the AIAC says “Israel must stop. “The AIAC Board of Directors unanimously believes that, given the daily massacres, which have also resulted in hundreds of deaths among managers, coaches, and athletes … it is legitimate, necessary, indeed a duty, to place at the centre of federation talks the request, to be submitted to UEFA and FIFA, for the temporary exclusion of Israel from sporting competitions,” the letter concludes. Italy is set to play Israel on neutral turf in Debrecen, Hungary on September 8, before hosting the return match in Udine on October 14. “We could just focus on playing, looking the other way. But we believe that is not right,” AIAC vice president Giancarlo Camolese said. The Azzurri also played Israel in Udine last October in a Nations League match that saw protests before and during the game and intense security measures, including snipers on the roof of the stadium. Many people like the Palestinians are suffering,” AIAC vice president Francesco Perondi said. German tabloid Bild recently reported that Bundesliga 2 football side Fortuna Dusseldorf pulled out of signing Israel international striker Shon Weissman in response to fan anger about his social media posts on the Gaza war.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Live in constant hope of the top flight as a Preston North End fan. Written in the past for SPORF, GiveMeSport and more. The two nations will face off in Oslo on October 11. Norway are currently top of Group H having won all four of their games, with Israel in second on six points from three matches. With Italy three points further back in third but with two games in hand on Norway, the outcome of the match could prove pivotal in deciding who will qualify automatically for the World Cup. Norway's successes so far include a 3-0 win over Italy in June, and a 4-2 win away against Israel in March. It has urged for significantly more humanitarian aid to be allowed to enter Gaza, describing the current crisis as 'a disaster unfolding in front of our eyes'. Now, Norwegian FA president Lise Klaveness has stated: "Neither we nor other organisations can have an indifferent attitude to the humanitarian suffering and the disproportionate attacks that the civilian population in Gaza has been subjected to for a long time. But we want to give the profits to a humanitarian organisation that saves lives in Gaza every day and that contributes with active emergency aid on the ground." The statement reads: "We do not usually advise associations regarding the use of match revenue, even if it is obtained thanks to a match against our proud national team, but we will deviate from our custom this time. "It would be nice if some of the amount were directed to try to finding a condemnation by the Norwegian FA of the October 7 massacre that claimed the lives of hundreds of Israeli citizens and children, or action in favour of the release of 50 hostages - and please, make sure that the money is not transferred to terrorist organisations or to whale hunting. "We are also aiming to gain three points." While the 2026 World Cup qualifiers are only just getting underway in Europe, they have almost reached their completion in Asia. They drew 1-1 to Oman in their final fixture via a controversial injury-time penalty, which knocked them out and sent Oman through.</p>

[They said] ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one',” Trump said in an interview with DAZN. “And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.” Chelsea's Reece James holds the trophy as he celebrates with teammates and US President Donald Trump after Chelsea won against Paris St Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup final, at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on July 13, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea fans have claimed they have spotted Noni Madueke's missing Club World Cup medal in the White House, as Donald Trump hosted European leaders this week. The US president hosted Ukraine peace talks on Monday, with British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer joining French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb around the Resolute Desk. They were joined by by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Having spotted the trophy, fans have now speculated that they have been able to see a winner's medal next to the trophy. Trump had been seen holding onto the medal, before placing it into his pocket after making his way off the stage. Madueke had flown home during the competition to complete a £52million move to Arsenal and had therefore not been part of the trophy presentation. Chelsea defender Marc Cucurella recently contributed to the theory when asked about Madueke's medal. 'He [Trump] put it in his pocket,' the Spaniard stated. 'He has it there in the White House, very well placed.' 'Zoom the club world cup trophy and you go see Madueke's medal there,' another wrote. 'Noni's medal is trapped in the White House,' added a third. 'Madueke's world cup medal just casually on display in Trump's office is frying me,' another added. Daily Mail Sport, however, recently revealed that Madueke was expected to be mailed a Club World Cup's winners' medal. Trump's overall involvement in the Club World Cup ceremony came as a surprise to Chelsea players as they celebrated winning the tournament last month. Cucurella recently revealed his surprise, telling Spanish journalist Gerard Romero: 'We had been told that, as a rule, Donald Trump would come to present us with the trophy and that we couldn't lift it until he left. 'And of course, we were all there waiting for him to leave, but the guy didn't want to leave, and on top of that, we looked at him and he said, "Get him up, I'll stay here, and so on." 'And I wondered who would say anything to him, you know... But Trump's crowning moment came after the final whistle when he took centre stage as the trophy was given to Chelsea. It was anticipated that Trump would step aside after giving the trophy to Chelsea captain James - as is customary. Palmer had been visibly confused with the England star spotted saying 'What's he doing?' Speaking afterwards, the England star was honest but slightly more measured than his facial contortions had suggested. 'I knew he was going to be here but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy so I was a bit confused, yeah,' he said. Trump had earlier presented Palmer with the golden ball award with the 23-year-old midfielder looking as equally baffled during that presentation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the White House posted a picture of US President Donald Trump meeting with world leaders in the Oval Office at the White House this week, eagle-eyed football fans spotted an unlikely piece of silverware in pride of place. The image led many on social media to question why 'Chelsea's trophy' resides in one of the most important offices in the world weeks after Enzo Maresca's side lifted it at Metlife Stadium. "I said, 'When are you going to pick up the trophy?' You can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one'," he said in an interview with DAZN. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now." But, according to Fifa, that is not quite the case. One replica belongs to Chelsea and the holders paraded it during a pre-season friendly against AC Milan. Following the Blues' triumph, Trump presented the trophy to Chelsea captain Reece James before being invited to move aside by Fifa president Gianni Infantino. But Trump remained alongside James and goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, and applauded as James lifted the trophy, staying in position for a few seconds before he and Infantino left at the rear of the stage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's what you need to know for the first ticket release window. The 2026 FIFA World Cup is nine months away, and until now the only way to get tickets was through expensive hospitality packages. That changes Sept. 10, when the first lottery round of tickets will be made available to the public  — with one  catch. From Sept. 10 to Sept. 19, Visa cardholders can enter the lottery for the chance to buy World Cup match tickets. It's the first of several release phases ahead of the 2026 World Cup's opening match on June 11 in Mexico City. Next year's World Cup will take place in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, including in Philadelphia, where six matches will be played. “Excitement for the FIFA World Cup 26 is building fast, and Sept. 10 is a date every football fan should have marked in their calendar,” said FIFA chief business officer Romy Gai. To enter the ticket lottery, applicants must first create a FIFA ID at FIFA.com/tickets. Winners will be selected in a random draw, with notifications starting Sept. 30. It's not yet clear which matches will be up for grabs in this round — for example, whether Philadelphia fans will be able to buy tickets for games at the Linc.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid will slash their asking price for Arsenal target Rodrygo in the final weeks of the summer transfer window. Rodrygo started just one of Real's six matches at the Club World Cup, managing a combined total of 92 minutes across the entire competition. Los Blancos opened their La Liga campaign with a 1-0 win over Osasuna on Tuesday night with the winger again an unused substitute. Explaining Rodrygo's latest absence, Xabi Alonso said: ‘Nothing's happening. I'm counting on him; there's no need to read too far into the future. If he's still the same in three months, I'll be able to answer.' Sky Sports is going full throttle this Premier League season, airing a record-breaking 215 live matches - that's nearly double the usual dose of drama, goals, and post-match meltdowns. From Friday night clashes to Super Sundays and even all ten final-day fixtures, Sky's new deal means fans won't miss a single nutmeg or last-minute screamer. And with pundits like Jamie Carragher probably already rehearsing their 'I told you so' lines, expect top-tier commentary alongside top-tier football.

Manchester City have also been among the sides interested in signing the Brazilian this summer as a possible replacement for Savinho. City however are determined to keep the youngster, effectively ending their interest in his countryman Rodrygo.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The club is in advanced talks to sign U.S. Men's National Team midfielder Paxten Aaronson from Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt, a source told The Denver Post on Tuesday. The source added that while a transfer fee isn't finalized, it could be a club record that surpasses current Rapids forward Rafael Navarro's $3.5 million mark. He impressed in the Eredivisie, particularly as a member of Utrecht last season, where he scored eight goals and provided four assists in 33 matches. Last Sunday, he scored as a late sub in a 5-0 rout of Engers in the first round of the German domestic cup DFB-Pokal. It's unclear what type of roster slot he'd occupy, but it's possible he'd take the Designated Player slot Mihailovic vacated. He appeared in two Concacaf Gold Cup matches, including a start with his brother, Brendan, in a group stage loss to Switzerland. Should the move be finalized and made official, not only will the Rapids have broken inbound and outbound transfer fee records, but they will also exit a turbulent transfer window with a new face of the franchise. Multiple players went out on loan, then another DP (Kévin Cabral) was waived by the club. The biggest bombshell was Mihailovic's surprise transfer request, which the Rapids complied with and received a major paycheck in return. Colorado may have made up for Mihailovic's departure with inbound moves, though. The Rapids brought in two solid center backs: Noah Cobb, a young player who has started and impressed in three matches; and Rob Holding, a Premier League-level player who fell out with his former coach at Crystal Palace. On the back line, they traded for Orlando City left back Rafael Santos to provide depth and instigate competition with Sam Vines for the role. Offensively, they brought Colombian winger Alexis Manyoma on a one-year loan from Argentinian club Estudiantes. And now they are on the verge of adding Aaronson. Should the deal for Aaronson go through, that will be three big pieces to integrate in just two months. Time will tell, but the future of life post-Mihailovic may not be so grim for the Rapids after all. Sign up for the Sports Omelette to get all our analysis on Denver's teams.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Parks, Recreation and Culture director Luis Ruiz giving a presentation to the Lawrence City Commissioners about raising the Transient Guest Tax on Aug. 19. City commissioners voted Tuesday night to increase the guest tax on hotel or short-term overnight stays in Lawrence by 2 percentage points to capitalize on an increase in visitors expected next summer for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The item needed a supermajority of at least four commissioners to pass; Commissioner Amber Sellers was the lone no vote. At an increased rate of 8%, however, the city projected that the guest tax fund would receive just under $940,000 in additional tax money and grow its balance. Six matches will be held in the KC area between June 16 and July 11, including a quarterfinal contest, and there is a possibility that Lawrence could be selected as a base camp for one of the 48 national teams. Ruiz also said that Lawrence's guest tax was lower than those of other cities in the region. Cities such as Overland Park and Mission have a guest tax of 9%, while Shawnee, Merriam, Lenexa, Leawood and Kansas City, Kansas, all are at 8% — and Ruiz said Kansas City, Kansas, was moving to increase its rate during the World Cup to 10%. “This is an opportunity to grow without going outside the boundaries of what is common in the marketplace,” Ruiz said. Ruiz said that many city leaders have been working with leaders across the region since last October on how Lawrence could capitalize on the increase in visitors from the World Cup, but that there were no funds allocated to help programs aimed at increasing tourism. Ruiz said some projections in previous budgets were too high, and that when the fund had a larger balance, some of the money was used for things that weren't as related to increasing tourism. Larsen asked Ruiz how the city would make sure that this doesn't happen again; Ruiz said the city would work to ensure that the guest tax dollars went to programs that generated revenue and provided a good return on investment. Kim Anspach, the executive director for Explore Lawrence, said more transparency around the guest tax would build trust. Anspach said tourism is “one of Lawrence's strongest economic engines,” bringing nearly $300 million into the Lawrence economy in the past year. And she said it was equally important to put the guest tax fund in a good position so “it can continue to attract visitors and grow the local economy.” Sellers asked whether it would be possible to raise the guest tax only on short-term rental units such as Airbnb properties. Randy Larkin, the deputy city attorney, and Rachelle Mathews, the city's finance director, said it would likely be more difficult to make that a possibility. Anspach said that out of the $2.2 million in guest tax money the city collected last year, about $300,000 came from those types of units. Sellers also felt it would be better to first increase the guest tax to 7.5% instead of 8%, partly because Ruiz said a rate of 7.5% would still get the guest tax fund out of its deficit. • Commissioners approved on final reading multiple items to create financial incentives for KU's Gateway project. Those incentives included creating multiple new taxing districts and entering a development agreement with the university. The second reading for these items was initially on the commissioners' consent agenda for Tuesday, which is usually approved with one vote, but Sellers asked to pull the items for a separate discussion and vote. The items that the commissioners adopted on second and final reading will create new taxing districts — a Tax Increment Financing district and a STAR Bond district — and allow a special sales tax area on campus. The special sales tax area passed 3-2, with Sellers and Larsen voting no. As part of its consent agenda, the commission unanimously approved the request to rezone 1.32 acres of land at 515 McDonald Drive from a mixed-use district to a high-density residential district. As the Journal-World reported, longtime Lawrence developer Doug Compton and Lawrence-based Adams Architects had filed plans for a two-building apartment complex on the 1.32-acre site, which once housed a hotel until that building was destroyed by a fire in 2018.</p>
