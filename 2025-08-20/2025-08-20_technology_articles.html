                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Made by Google 2025 event is finally happening, notably before Apple's hardware event is expected to take place in September. Google already dropped several AI-related updates at its developer conference in May, but the company demonstrated more Gemini features during the Pixel 10 event. In a recent YouTube video promoting the new devices, Google even seemed to poke fun at Apple's failed promises with Apple Intelligence advancements on the iPhone. For instance, sharing an image of your room with the AI and getting interior design ideas. Taking photos on the Pixel 10 also got a boost. In addition, there's a new conversational photo editing tool, where you tell Gemini what you want to tweak in a photo, such as increasing the brightness, removing objects, or changing the background. Google released a teaser for the Pixel 10 prior to Wednesday's event. Aside from these updates, there weren't many obvious changes. Notably, the Pixel 10 devices have magnetic technology built into them thanks to “PixelSnap,” the company's version of “MagSafe.” Google released a line of magnetic accessories to pair with the lineup, including a new $40 Pixelsnap charger that supports Qi2 wireless charging. As for Google's latest foldable, it has a larger cover display, measuring at around 6.4 inches, alongside an 8-inch main screen. Another exciting addition is an IP68 rating, a first for the device. This means it can stand up to both dust and water, whereas the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has zero dust protection. The phone also saw an improvement in battery life. The tech giant is coming for Apple's Journal app with Pixel Journal, a new journaling app for Pixel 10 devices. With the app, you can write entries, add photos, locations, and activities, as well as lock entries for privacy. The app also includes AI features, such as prompt suggestions to spark inspiration. Wearables will also get their time to shine at Google's event, with the Pixel Watch 4 getting a thicker design, a longer battery life, and smaller bezels. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 introduced a new Gemini feature for answering calls with gestures and comes in a new Moonstone color. Google announced a new AI personal health coach for the Fitbit fitness tracking app. This feature allows users to create customized workout routines by discussing their goals, preferences, and available equipment. The AI coach generates a personalized fitness plan with workout suggestions and adjusts plans in real-time based on user data to help achieve fitness goals. A preview of the AI coach will be available in October. It will be integrated into the redesigned Fitbit app and will work with the latest Fitbit trackers, smartwatches, and Pixel Watches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FieldAI, a robotics startup backed by Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and others, raised $405 million in recent funding rounds as the California-based company aims to deploy its “software brain” in a variety of robots across diverse environments. The investment, which came in consecutive Series A and A1 rounds, values the 2-year-old startup at $2 billion according to reports by Axios and CNBC on Wednesday. Gates Frontier, an investment arm of the Microsoft co-founder, previously backed FieldAI. FieldAI attaches its system to third-party robot hardware, and they can work autonomously across industries including construction, energy, manufacturing, urban delivery and inspection. Amazon has invested in Salem, Ore.-based Agility Robotics through its Industrial Innovation Fund, a billion-dollar venture capital fund that backs different forms of supply chain technology. Agility — known for its Digit bipedal humanoid warehouse robot, was raising $400 million in new funding earlier this year, according to reports. Last year, Amazon hired three of the founders from Covariant, a Bay Area startup that develops AI for advanced warehouse robotics systems. Bezos Expeditions previously joined a $400 million funding round for Physical Intelligence, a robot startup in San Francisco that is also backed by OpenAI. FieldAI is led by veterans in robotic AI from DeepMind, Google Brain, Tesla Autopilot, NASA JPL, SpaceX, Zoox, Cruise, Amazon, DARPA, TRI, and others. “Rather than attempting to shoehorn large language and vision models into robotics — only to address their hallucinations and limitations as an afterthought — we have designed intrinsically risk-aware architectures from the ground up.” Cash flow: Top 10 tech startup funding rounds in the Pacific Northwest for Q4 Carbon Robotics raises $70M for AI robots that blast weeds with lasers Portland startup lands $2.7M for autonomous robots designed to disinfect hotels and hospitals</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Andy Abramson, director of product management at Google, says the redesign also offers easier app navigation, better data visualization, improved syncing between wearable devices, and (finally) a dark mode. Those are all purportedly common user suggestions from existing Fitbit customers. This Personal Health Coach feature is available only to Fitbit Premium subscribers. The idea behind the assistant—which doesn't quite have a personality or even a name—is to let users ask anything and everything about health and fitness and receive personalized guidance thanks to the 24/7 health data collected by your Fitbit wearable or Pixel Watch. During the onboarding, the coach will ask you questions so it can better understand your preferences and equipment, but this is a conversation that will continually evolve. If you're just not feeling up to it or are under the weather, just tell the coach, and it'll make tweaks to the workout plan and even follow up about how you're feeling after some time. Rishi Chandra, vice president for Health at Google, says the company had to balance a fine line between responses that were too short and weren't insightful, and extremely lengthy responses. Chandra says the company is exploring multimodal interactions—think sending a video of your hotel gym equipment and asking for workout recommendations—and potentially incorporating Gemini Live for a more real-time conversation experience. Much of the new Fitbit app experience also centers around customization. The Coach also looks at your performance on a weekly basis rather than a single day, giving users more flexibility in hitting their goals. (That includes last year's Cardio Load feature on the Pixel Watch.) The Coach will be able to tap into your historical Fitbit data, however long it dates back. Google still has to follow the data separation commitments established when it acquired Fitbit, meaning your health data cannot be used for Google Ads and is stored separately from other Google data. Abramson says the Coach also will sometimes suggest lifestyle activities rather than specific workouts, like if you've indicated that you like to kayak, and that Fitbit is working to pull more data from other third-party apps via the Health Connect platform. That way, you'll ideally be able to incorporate your Strava data, for example, and still have it count in your Fitbit app. (The new Fitbit app will finally add support for Apple's HealthKit platform as well.) It'll even tack on an extra half hour to your sleep schedule based on your workout performance if it thinks you need the extra recovery time. Trust will play a big role in the new AI-powered experience. Google's own AI Overviews on Search can hallucinate and deliver flat-out wrong answers. How can you trust the same platform to answer health and wellness questions? Google says the Coach is being developed with “leading industry experts” and through scientific research—the company published a paper in Nature last week about a personal health large language model for sleep and fitness coaching. There's also a partnership with NBA star Stephen Curry and his performance team for more grounded results, and Google says it's working closely with its Consumer Health Advisory Panel. We've tried several versions of AI-powered health coaches with other fitness trackers with mixed results (Garmin, Whoop, and Oura all have them, for example), but Fitbit's partnerships and peer-reviewed research make this an attractive proposition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>T-Mobile subscribers who buy one of the phones in Google's newly announced Pixel 10 lineup will be able to explore a new frontier in mass-market mobile connectivity: satellite access to data-dependent apps, including Google Maps. Google worked with Bellevue, Wash.-based T-Mobile to equip Pixel 10 devices with the software upgrades required to transmit application data directly through SpaceX's Starlink satellite network in low Earth orbit. Pixel 10 users will be able to use Google Maps, Messages and Find Hubs in areas where traditional mobile coverage isn't available, thanks to T-Mobile's T-Satellite service. T-Satellite went into operation last month for text messaging, location sharing and emergency alerts, and the service is being extended to UScellular customers in the wake of T-Mobile's acquisition of UScellular. But Omar Tazi, T-Mobile's executive vice president and chief product and digital officer, said in a blog posting that “this capability is far too important to hold back.” “If you don't have a Pixel 10, your time is coming soon,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Pixel 9 had a pair of wide and ultra-wide sensors. The base model has a 48-megapixel wide sensor, Quad phase detection per pixel — with faster and better focus in low light — and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide sensor. The Pro phones have a new 50-megapixel wide sensor with optical stabilization and Super Res Zoom (up to 20x) for video. Google said all devices have a new “actua” display, which allows them to go up to 3,300 nits of brightness on the Pros and 3,000 nits on the Pixel 10. All Pixels are powered by Google's new Tensor G5 chip, coupled with the Titan M2 security chip and a new image processing unit. Google said that the new chip bumps up CPU performance by 34% and TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) by 60% over the previous gen chip, allowing for faster and new kinds of AI features. Google introduced Gemini as a default assistant last year with the Pixel 9, along with features like Pixel Studio for AI-powered image generation and a new screenshot app. This means the assistant can guide you with direction and signs by highlighting certain parts of a screen. Google is also debuting a new feature called Magic Cue, which can surface contextual information from across the app. For instance, if you are on a call with an airline, it can surface your flight details from email or get your restaurant reservation details while chatting to a friend. The company is also adding a Gemini-powered camera coach that would guide you to take better photos from the camera interface by making suggestions about framing and composition. Additionally, Google is adding features like real-time translation for calls, transcripts for missed or declined calls through call screening, Notebook LM integration with the screenshot app, and recorder. However, the Pixel 10 Pro XL now starts at $1,199 instead of $1,099, with base storage bumped up to 256GB. Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This year Google's Pixel Buds A-series (the cheaper line of Pixel wireless earbuds) is getting an update with some features that should make them a lot more appealing to anyone looking to save a little bit of money on non-pro earbuds. It's hard to believe that any pair of wireless earbuds would dare exist without the option to listen with ANC at this point, but it's still a notable improvement over the last generation, which came out all the way back in 2021. Google says there should also be some sound quality improvements to the Buds 2a thanks to the addition of a new Tensor A1 chip, including more bass, but it's hard to say how drastic the improvement is until we hear for ourselves. Notably, Google also says the Tensor A1 will lead to significant battery life gains gen-over-gen. Specifically, Google says you can now get 7 hours of playback with ANC activated, which is a solid amount of time—most wireless earbuds in this price range get between 6 and 6.5 hours typically. One thing I love to see here is that Google made the battery replaceable on its case, which is surprisingly a rare thing in the world of wireless audio. Naturally, given Google's emphasis on AI, there are some Gemini tie-ins here. With the Pixel Buds 2a, you'll be able to summon Gemini as a voice assistant on your Pixel phone to do stuff like summarize your messages. Speaking of nice to have, the Pixel Buds 2a will also be the smallest and lightest A-series buds yet thanks to a notable redesign. It's not all about the Buds 2a; the Pixel Buds 2 Pro will get a minor update with a new color, Moonstone, and Google says a software update dropping next month will bring improvements to various features on the buds. The Moonstone version of the Pixel Buds 2 Pro can be preordered today for $229 and will be in stores starting August 28. As for the Pixel Buds 2a, there's nothing groundbreaking on paper, but they seem fairly solid based on what we know. There are a lot of wireless earbuds in the $130-150 range, so Google has a lot of competition to that end. If you're dying to hear the improvement for yourself, you can preorder the Pixel Buds 2a right now or wait until October 9, when they hit shelves officially.

The Sony Inzone H9 II sounds incredible and feels great. It's just short of perfect in one important way. Just because the Galaxy Buds 3 FE are cheaper doesn't mean they have to be worse.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's why, other than some new colors, the whole Pixel 10 lineup looks so similar compared to the Pixel 9 series. To be fair, there are hardware upgrades to the Pixel 10, but most of them are under-the-hood improvements for stuff like performance and battery life—it's a spec bump year for Google. Since these are the 10th-generation Pixels, Google said it wanted to give a nod to the original “Really Blue” Pixel. I like the color a lot, though I didn't have the new “Blue Shadow” Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 on hand to compare the shade of blue. Either way, blue is definitely in this year—unless you're Apple, orange will apparently be the iPhone 17 Pro's new special color. The Pixel 10 also comes in “Frost” (pastel purple), “Lemongrass” (yellow), and “Obsidian” (black). But, wait, what's that inside the pill-shaped camera bar? Yes, that's a third camera lens—a 10.8-megapixel telephoto with 5x optical zoom. It's the first time that a regular Pixel has three cameras. The image sensors are also smaller, which may mean worse low-light performance. However, it's possible that improved software and AI processing can make up for the hardware downgrades. The 6.3-inch LTPO OLED display is the same size as before, but it is brighter (up to 2,000 nits for HDR and up to 3,000 nits for peak brightness), so visibility outdoors should be better. Google is also introducing a new MagSafe-like magnetic charging puck called Pixelsnap. And for the first time on any Pixel phone, there's built-in Satellite SOS, which works more or less the same as it does on newer iPhones. There's a gray “Moonstone” color that has shades of purple under specific lighting, and the “Jade” is a lime-ish colored green-yellow. It's a bummer there's no “Indigo” blue for the Pixel 10 Pros. Both phones have the same 6.3-inch and 6.8-inch LTPO OLED screens, but they're even brighter than the Pixel 10 (up to 2,200 nits for HDR and up to 3,300 nits for peak brightness). These are “Pro” phones, so you do get more RAM (16GB) and additional storage capacities to choose from (128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB). The potential game-changers are in the AI and Gemini features, which I'll get to in a minute. There's not much to say about the foldable except that it isn't a threat to the thinner and lighter Galaxy Z Fold 7. Google has polished up the rough edges (i.e., there's a new gearless hinge that Google says is twice as durable as the one on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold), and the cover screen is a teensy bit larger at 6.4 inches, which also means the 8-inch foldable screen is also a smidge larger. Google also says the folding screen is more durable. Well, first, it's finally IP68 rated for dust and water resistance, which makes it as durable as non-folding flagship phones. And apparently, it can handle 10 years of folding with the new gearless hinge. Also, with two layers of “anti-impact film,” the Pixel 10 Pro Fold should be more protected if dropped. Of course, I wasn't able to test out this improved durability, but I appreciate that Google has bolstered the design cause foldables are fragile as hell. There's a larger 5,015mAh battery (up from 4,650mAh) with Qi2 wireless charging and Pixelsnap compatibility, a faster Tensor G5 chip, and Satellite SOS. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes with 16GB of RAM and 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage, and you can get it in two colors (Moonstone or Jade). If you've been paying attention to the world of consumer tech, you'll already know that phone hardware has matured to the point where it's now all about what kind of AI features tech companies can shove in there to make new phones worth buying. Everybody's trying to figure this out, not just Google. All Pixel 10 Pro phones (10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold) come with a free year of Google AI Pro—a $250/month subscription that gets you the best of what Google's AI has to offer, including access to Veo 3, the video generator that's taken the world by storm since its debut at I/O. As you can tell from the mild hardware refresh, the Pixel 10 phones are just vehicles for Gemini, and some of the new AI features that Google has come up with seem genuinely useful. “Magic Cue” is on-device “personalized intelligence” that helps you surface relevant information within apps and then suggests quick actions to take. For example, say you're calling up a restaurant to make a reservation; Magic Cue could show relevant info like directions to the place or opening and closing hours. Magic Cue feels like the start of agentic and ambient computing, where we spend less time interacting nonstop inside of apps, and AI gives us a helping hand. I also demoed a new Gemini-powered version for Google Translate, which uses on-device language processing to essentially deepfake your voice into another language. It worked fast, and hearing myself speaking in German with what sounded like my intonations was both impressive and eerie. This felt like the breakthrough that Google Translate has been working toward to make real-time translation even more frictionless with a phone between two people. Other AI and Gemini features that I saw were located within the Pixel 10's camera app. “Camera Coach” uses Gemini models to show a row of thumbnails with suggestions on how to improve a shot you've taken. It offers up basic suggestions like using the rule of thirds by reframing certain subjects to the left or right and foreground or background, telling you to switch cameras or modes—basically, it's photography for dummies. I won't get much out of it, but I could see it being helpful to regular people who want to take more interesting photos. There's also a new “Auto Best Take” that automatically merges similar photos into one “best” photo and an enhanced “Add Me” feature that ‘photoshops' the photographer into a group shot using pseudo augmented reality. The one Gemini-powered camera feature that I'm most interested in trying in depth is “Pro Res Zoom” for the Pixel 10 Pros. The Pixel 10 (and older Pixel phones) has regular Super Res Zoom, which uses machine learning to sharpen and enhance detail for zoomed-in photos. Pro Res Zoom uses AI and Gemini models to basically generate new detail. In one demo, the difference in detail between Pro Res Zoom on a Pixel 10 Pro and Super Res Zoom on a Pixel 10 was night and day, especially at even higher magnifications like 100x zoom for the Pixel 10 Pros. In my limited demo, we zoomed in on a water tower, and Pro Res Zoom generated wood textures for its exterior. But on text, like signs, it's clear AI still has a way to go. Text did look clearer and more legible, but still a little garbled, like an alien language at times. I'm a realist, and as much as I want foldable phones to be cheaper, I know it'll be a long road to that day, or it may never even come. I also know that regular bar-style smartphones only have so much room for improvement, and so transplanting AI into them and eking out small improvements to the displays, battery life, and the cameras is just how things are gonna be for the foreseeable future. I'll need to spend real time with the Pixel 10 phones once I get review units to try, but for now, the hardware is fine. Preorders for the 10 Pro Fold start Aug. 20, and availability on Oct. 9. The Pixel 10 starts at $799 with 128GB of storage. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold starts at $1,799 for 256GB of storage. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Google's first Pixel Watch was fashionably late to the wrist computing party, arriving in 2022 when the market was already quite mature. And while the smartwatch has since cemented its place among top-tier wearables, it has one red flag: It isn't repairable. For the past three generations, Google has been replacing broken Pixel Watches instead of repairing them. “Watches and wearables are still fairly nascent," a spokesperson explained at a 2024 Climate Week panel when asked why the watch wasn't repairable. The Pixel Watch 4 retains its domed glass design but can be disassembled with a screwdriver, and it uses largely the same-size screws throughout its construction. A customer won't void the one-year warranty if the watch is disassembled for screen or battery repairs, and Google will sell replacements for those components at iFixit. There are several other small improvements to the smartwatch, like longer battery life and a new gesture that lets you talk to Gemini by raising your wrist. (The versions with LTE connectivity cost $100 more, respectively.) You can preorder it now, but unlike the Pixel 10 phones that are available this month, the watch won't be available until October 9. Google invited me to its Mountain View, California, offices to take an exclusive look at a teardown of the Pixel Watch 4. (Google paid for a portion of my travel expenses to see its research facility.) Junyong Park, an industrial designer who worked on the device, began disassembling it, manicured nails and all. Park says it was a “tremendous collaboration” between the design and engineering teams. “We're pretty proud of how this turned out.” Google intentionally made it so that this connector doesn't need to be removed for battery replacements. Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, which has partnered with Google to sell the spare parts for the watch, says these kinds of connectors can be fragile, so it's always better if the device's design lets you replace components without having to unplug them. This is intentional, as you can use the same Torx screwdriver for battery replacements, reducing the number of tools needed for repairs. (A Torx screwdriver is commonly used in electronics repairs and is included in the repair kits sold by iFixit.) Overall, it looked fairly simple, and it took Park less than 13 minutes to remove these components while talking about the process and answering my questions. A silicone O-ring helps create a seal when the two halves of the watch are placed back together. Hoe, who has been the product lead since the Pixel Watch 2, says Google always wanted to make its smartwatch repairable. “It has taken us a little bit longer to get to this place—it required a lot of change internally in the product; those types of big architecture changes take multiple years.” While you can replace some components in an Apple Watch or Galaxy Watch, they're not as easy to repair yourself. Samsung tells WIRED that user repair is supported on its Galaxy Watches (the Galaxy Watch Ultra earned a respectable 7/10 on iFixit), but this doesn't include the battery due to safety reasons. “Smartwatches ought to be a mature product at this point,” Wiens says, though he notes that challenges around serviceability are harder on a smartwatch compared to a smartphone due to its smaller size. Repairability “should be possible; it's just a matter of will,” Wiens says. “I think we did a pretty good job—it's much harder to make than a phone, but it had much lower return rates," Shedletsky says. “It's really hard to get all the stuff in there that you need; most of the stuff that you'd require for repairability requires extra space.” She also noted that the square shape of the Apple Watch made it more challenging to seal. What else is new with the Pixel Watch 4? While it may win points for repairability, Google's latest wearable isn't earning any plaudits for environmental impact: For the third time in four generations, Google is changing the charger. The smartwatch now charges on its side, allowing it to rest sideways, like a clock. It's not just for show—charging is faster, too, going from 0 to 50 percent in 15 minutes. The watch's haptic engine is stronger, so you can feel more precisely when there's a notification or alert, and the clearer custom speaker should make it easier to hear answers from the Gemini voice assistant. Just raise your wrist, and Gemini will wake up and listen, eliminating the need to say a hotword or press a button. (There are settings to turn off this feature or adjust the sensitivity.) The Pixel Watch 4 also has a redesigned smart reply system, utilizing a new on-device Gemini small language model optimized for the smartwatch. These smart replies aren't personalized to you, but they'll show up more consistently as reply options when you receive a message. You'll see a performance boost thanks to the new dual-chip architecture—Qualcomm's Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 paired with a machine-learning microprocessor—delivering more processing at half the power. That also means 25 percent longer battery life, bumping Google's claim up to 40 hours of run time for the 45-mm watch and 30 hours for the 41-mm model. Several smartphones have this capability, including Pixel phones, but this may prove useful for folks who tend to leave the phone at home when going on a run. As for health features, Google focused on upgrading sleep tracking this year. It says the watch is more accurate at classifying your complete sleep cycle, precisely detecting when your body is in REM, light, or deep sleep. A new skin temperature sensor can detect when your temps veer out of your usual range, which could help you identify if you're under the weather. It maintains many of the same features as before, including Cardio Load, Loss of Pulse Detection (which became available in the US earlier this year on the Pixel Watch 3), Fall Detection, and Car Crash Detection. Fitness-wise, you can stream cycling workouts to your phone, turning it into a bike computer of sorts, and the new dual-frequency GPS radio allows for more accurate route tracking. There's a new “AI-powered activity recognition system,” meaning if you forgot to track a workout, the watch will still track your activity in the background and give you credit for it—it classifies the activity and will send a summary afterward with your cardio load, calories burned, and other metrics. In October, Google will introduce a redesigned Fitbit smartphone app with a new AI Health Coach, powered by Gemini. It'll launch as a preview—sort of like a beta—and is only available in the US at the start for Fitbit Premium subscribers. Google says this health and fitness coach is built with “leading industry experts and through scientific research,” though keep in mind it was just over a year ago that Google's AI Overviews recommended adding glue to pizza sauce.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. Next-gen battery materials manufacturer Group14 Technologies today announced $463 million of new funding. The Woodinville, Wash.-based company has raised more than $1 billion from investors. The new cash comes as Group14 is forging a path forward despite significant federal cuts for clean tech support, ongoing tariff uncertainties, and projections for a slowing electric vehicle market. The company last month laid off an undisclosed number of workers and is delaying by more than a year the start of production at its flagship battery materials plant in Eastern Washington's Moses Lake. “This raise is powerful validation that, despite a tough macro environment, investors are doubling down on Group14's role in shaping the future of energy storage,” said Group14 CEO Rick Luebbe in a statement. SK Inc., an investment holding company, also led the Series D round that was disclosed today. Group14 has developed a silicon anode technology used in lithium ion batteries that holds more power and requires less time for recharging than traditional graphite anode batteries. The company previously raised $649 million from investors, bringing its new total to $1.11 billion. The South Korea factory, BAM-3, has been producing anode material since last September, which it's shipping to customers for testing. The new funding will help Group14 “accelerate and ramp-up production” at its two manufacturing sites, a spokesperson said by email. It was smoother sailing for Group14 and its competitors under the Biden administration, which prioritized the transition to clean power and worked to rebuild U.S. battery production, which is currently dominated by China. In September it was awarded a $200 million DOE grant to build a Moses Lake plant that would produce silane gas, an essential ingredient for manufacturing silicon battery materials. “With over 90% of anode-grade graphite coming from China, the vulnerability is clear,” Luebbe said. “Our silicon battery material gives manufacturers a high-performance alternative that helps derisk the supply chain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X are slated for release on Oct. 16 in the U.S., Europe, and other markets in Asia. We won't know how much it will cost and when we can preorder one until sometime “in the coming weeks,” Asus said in a press release. Gamescom attendees will be first to try out the new Xbox-ified version of Windows 11, which should make it easier than Microsoft's regular ol' OS to launch games on both the Xbox app and through third-party launchers like Steam and Epic Games Store. Microsoft is also working on a “Handheld Compatibility Program” akin to Valve's Steam Deck Verified badges. Xbox will label whether a game is “handheld optimized,” which means it works with the default controller layout, or “mostly compatible,” which will require a few adjustments. The one in white comes packed with an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor. Based on specs alone, the chip seems closest in power to a Steam Deck. It's a 4-core, 8-thread chip based on AMD's Zen 2 microarchitecture, which the chipmaker launched back in 2019. It's running on eight RDNA 2 GPU cores, which should be enough for the vast majority of smaller games and a fair few AAA titles on lower graphics settings. That APU, or accelerated processing unit, sports 8 cores and 16 threads based on AMD's latest Zen 5 CPU architecture. Just like the Asus ROG Ally X from 2024, it contains an 80Wh battery that should enhance overall playtime, depending on your performance settings. Microsoft also hinted the Xbox Ally X will make use of Microsoft's Automatic Super Resolution for on-device AI upscaling to enhance performance. Microsoft said either handheld should receive future updates that will allow for faster launching and better battery life, as well as “enhancements to the docking experience” that suggest the Xbox Ally will work better connected to a monitor or TV. There are a few reasons you should be concerned that neither Microsoft nor Asus wants to drop the bombshell that is pricing. We caught a hint of supposed Xbox Ally prices for European customers back in July. Tariffs have already caused havoc on PC supply chains and led to manufacturers raising prices. Without any official notice, Asus raised prices on its ROG Ally X from $900 to $1,000 a few months after President Donald Trump announced sweeping global tariffs. Optimists will look at the delayed pricing and hope Microsoft is working out a way to subsidize what will be its first new gaming hardware in years, even if it's simply sporting the Xbox brand name. If the Xbox Ally X is truly as pricey as other handheld PCs, it would make it a premium product that only the most ardent PC gamers would be willing to fork over their funds for. It will need to compete with upcoming handhelds like the Lenovo Legion Go 2 that sports a better OLED display compared to the Ally's LCD.

Secretary Lutnick also reiterated that the U.S. must manufacture its own chips domestically. “America should get the benefit of the bargain; that is exactly Donald Trump's perspective, which is, ‘Why are we giving a company worth $100 billion this kind of money? What are (sic) in it for the American taxpayer?' And the answer Donald Trump has is, ‘We should get an equity stake for our money,'” Lutnick said. We'll get equity in return for it; get a good return for the American taxpayer, instead of just giving grants away. Lutnick also highlighted the perceived security risks of relying on foreign chip production. "For national security, we must manufacture our own chips domestically," he said in the interview. 99% of leading-edge chips should not be made in Taiwan. This is why we negotiated with South Korea and Japan to expand our chip manufacturing capacity at home." Since then, new CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been trying to turn the company around after Pat Gelsinger's surprise resignation. However, Tan is also under scrutiny after Cadence admitted to exporting chip design tools to Chinese entities that have been banned by the U.S. while he was at the helm. President Trump went so far as to say Tan must resign because of conflicting interests. It was a couple of days after this meeting that reports started to surface that Trump was considering trying to secure a 10% U.S. stake in the company. This will not be a golden ticket for Intel, though, as it would still need a path to profitability, even if it gets the extra cash from Washington. We've reached out to Intel for comment on this latest development. Although this move would be beneficial for Intel in the short term, a few experts are raising red flags, including one cited in the interview who said that it is “corporate statism and it rarely does end well.” Reuters also reported that Lutnick wants to expand this move — the exchange of cash grants for equity stake — to other CHIPS Act beneficiaries. This will certainly be something that companies will be wary of, as it adds several layers of complexity to the deals. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. And when you pair that with Softbank's $2 billion purchase of Intel stock, the chipmaker is certainly getting a lot of resources to help it move forward. Now, it just needs to find customers for its 14A node. Jowi Morales is a tech enthusiast with years of experience working in the industry.

Asus has announced a trio of OLED gaming monitors designed explicitly for hardcore gamers at Gamescom. Notably, only the ROG Swift OLED PG27AQWP-W and ROG Strix OLED XG27AQWMG are equipped with what Asus calls Tandem OLED technology, which promises a 15% increase in peak brightness, a 25% expansion in color volume, and a 60% extension in lifespan compared to previous-generation WOLED monitors. The Neo Proximity Sensor is also present on all three monitors. This tech determines whether the user is present and switches to a black screen to prevent panel burn-in when the user isn't in front of the monitor. However, if you're willing to sacrifice resolution for a higher refresh rate, this gaming monitor can do a blistering 720 Hz at 720p (1280 x 720). The PG27AQWP-W's other impressive attributes include a 0.03 ms GTG (gray-to-gray) response time, VESA DisplayHDR 500 True Black certification, and a 99.5% DCI-P3 gamut. This monitor also has a nifty semi-transparent back panel that shows off the guts inside. It still maintains the 26.5-inch panel with a 1440p (2560 x 1440) resolution. However, the refresh rate has been limited to 280 Hz. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The XG27AQWMG's other specifications, such as the 0.03 ms GTG response time, VESA DisplayHDR 500 True Black, and 99.5% DCI-P3 gamut, remain unchanged compared to its fancier stablemate. The HDMI 2.1 ports are still present and accompanied by a useful USB hub. Last but not least, Asus unveiled the new ROG Strix OLED XG27AQDMG Gen 2, a follow-up to the original XG27AQDMG.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI is a powerful tool, but only if used correctly. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Many companies are rushing to implement various AI tools into their operation, but most of these pilot programs fail, according to an MIT study. Fortune reported that 95% do not hit their target performance, not because the AI models weren't working as intended, but because generic AI tools, like ChatGPT, do not adapt to the workflows that have already been established in the corporate environment. “Some large companies' pilots and younger startups are really excelling with generative AI,” MIT researcher and lead author Aditya Challapally told the publication. “It's because they pick one pain point, execute well, and partner smartly with companies who use their tools.” The research reveals that AI works best in back-office automation — basically taking over administrative and repetitive tasks that many corporations tend to outsource. However, over half of the money spent on AI projects reportedly focuses on sales and marketing, departments that arguably need a human touch, especially as most buyers are still humans, not machines. MIT says that two out of three projects that use specialized AI providers are successful, while only a third of in-house AI tools deliver expected results. Despite this, many organizations working in highly regulated fields, like finance and healthcare, prefer building their own AI programs. They likely do this to reduce regulatory risk, which can be especially damaging if an AI leaks private information — something that has happened in the past. While there haven't been widespread layoffs because of AI yet, MIT reports that companies aren't replacing positions that have become vacant when a staff member leaves. This was most prevalent in customer support and administrative positions — entry-level jobs that have usually been outsourced. This could be the harbinger of what several CEOs, including Anthropic's Dario Amodei and Ford's Jim Farley, are warning about: that AI might wipe out half of all entry-level white collar jobs in five years.
