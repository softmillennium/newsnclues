                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fewer than half of all adolescents with major depressive episode (MDE) received mental health care in the US in 2022, with the odds of specialist treatment being even lower among marginalized groups, according to a new study published this week in the open-access journal PLOS Mental Health by Su Chen Tan and colleagues at University of Tennessee, USA. Depression experienced during adolescence can be linked to more severe social and psychological consequences compared to depression that begins in adulthood. In addition to the low levels of mental health service use. Adolescents in rural areas had significantly lower odds of receiving specialist treatment compared to their urban counterparts (AOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47-0.87). In addition, females had greater odds and Black adolescents significantly lower odds of utilizing any mental health treatment relative to males and non-Hispanic White adolescents, respectively (Females: AOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.11-2.28; Black: AOR 0.36, 95% CI 0.22-0.59). "Addressing the disparities in mental health treatment revealed by this study is crucial for ensuring a more inclusive and equitable mental health support system for all adolescents," the authors say.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stanford Medicine scientists investigating the neurological underpinnings of autism spectrum disorder have found that hyperactivity in a specific brain region could drive behaviors commonly associated with the disorder. Moreover, they were able to reverse symptoms similar to those of autism - including susceptibility to seizures, heightened sensitivity to stimulus, increased motor activity, repetitive behaviors and decreased social interactions - by giving the mice drugs that suppressed this area of the brain. The findings will be published Aug. 20 in Science Advances. The lead author is Sung-Soo Jang, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in neurology and neurological sciences. In mice that had been genetically modified to model autism (Cntnap2 knockout mice), the reticular thalamic nucleus showed elevated activity when the animals encountered stimuli like light or an air puff as well as during social interactions. The brain region also showed bursts of spontaneous activity, causing seizures. Epilepsy is much more prevalent in people with autism than in the general population - 30% versus 1% - though the mechanisms are not well understood. Recognizing this connection, the researchers tested an experimental seizure drug, Z944, and found that it reversed behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model. With a different experimental treatment that genetically modifies neurons to respond to designer drugs, known as DREADD-based neuromodulation, the researchers could suppress overactivity in the reticular thalamic nucleus and reverse behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model. They could even induce these behavioral deficits in normal mice by ramping up activity in the reticular thalamic nucleus.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Guatemalan communities, a recent visit to a health clinic or hospital - not antibiotic use - is the strongest predictor of carrying bacteria resistant to critical antibiotics, according to a new study led by Washington State University. Previous research in Guatemala's Western Highlands found nearly 46% of residents were colonized in the gastrointestinal tract with bacteria known as extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (ESCrE). These bacteria, often E. coli, can render the commonly used and important antibiotic ceftriaxone ineffective, complicating care for infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections. By identifying the most important risk factors for carrying these resistant bacteria, we can begin to target interventions where they will have the most impact. Dr. Brooke Ramay, study's lead author and an assistant research professor in the WSU College of Veterinary Medicine's Paul G. Allen School for Global Health "Being colonized isn't necessarily harmful, but it means you can carry and spread these bacteria to others in the community or in health care facilities. And when these bacteria get into the wrong place - your bloodstream, urinary tract or other vulnerable sites, for example - they can cause serious infections." While the study doesn't prove that health care visits cause colonization, it's likely that exposure to hospitals and clinics increases the chance of picking up resistant bacteria through contact with surfaces, medical equipment, water or staff. It's also possible that people who need medical care already have health conditions like chronic illness, diarrhea or malnutrition that make them more vulnerable to colonization. "People who had reported going to a health care facility or a hospital for treatment for any type of illness had a much higher risk of being colonized in the gastrointestinal tract with these bacteria," Ramay said. Alternatively, this might be because inflammatory processes occurring in the gut of sick individuals make it easier for these bacteria to colonize. The study also found urban residents and households without trash pickup were roughly twice as likely to carry the bacteria compared to rural residents or those with waste services. Contrary to common assumptions, the study found no significant link between colonization and self-reported antibiotic use. "We've seen this in other projects as well," she said. The research was completed in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and University del Valle de Guatemala as part of the broader Antimicrobial Resistance in Communities and Hospitals (ARCH) study partnership, which has research projects in six countries. WSU is leading the ARCH efforts in both Guatemala and Kenya. While resistant bacteria remain rare in the U.S., global travel and trade could mean they are just a flight away. "These bacteria and the resistance genes they carry do not respect borders," Ramay said. "By understanding and addressing colonization risk factors abroad, we can help slow their spread everywhere."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study analyzes the negative effects of stress on the brains of male and female rats and concludes that acute stress induces anxiety-like behaviors, especially in males, while chronic stress is more associated with depressive symptoms. Understanding these differences may help develop more effective approaches to preventing and treating mental disorders such as anxiety and depression. It is well established that stress can increase susceptibility to various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, which are highly prevalent worldwide and represent a significant economic burden and public health issue in our society. The World Health Organization estimated that in 2019, around 970 million people globally - one in eight - suffered from a mental disorder.Evidence also points to sex differences in the prevalence of and responses to stress. In fact, while women account for two-thirds of patients with stress-related disorders, another indicator shows that more than two-thirds of suicide victims are men.Although stress is a part of life and, in small doses, can even be beneficial, excessive exposure, whether acute or chronic, can have profound negative effects, especially on the brain, potentially leading to cerebrovascular diseases. One of the most sensitive targets of excessive stress is the blood-brain barrier, a structure that protects the brain from potentially harmful substances.However, despite evidence suggesting that different types of stress can compromise its integrity and trigger neuroinflammatory responses associated with various neurological conditions, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood.In the article "Distinct behavioral and neurovascular signatures induced by acute and chronic stress in rats", published in September in the scientific journal Behavioural Brain Research, a research team from the University of Coimbra, Portugal, led by Ana Paula Silva, sought to clarify this issue by analysing the effects of acute and chronic stress in rodents.With support from the BIAL Foundation, the researchers used open field and forced swimming tests to assess locomotor activity and anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in male and female Wistar rats.The results showed that acute stress induces anxiety-like behaviors, especially in males, while chronic stress is more associated with depressive symptoms. Additionally, changes were observed in key proteins of the blood-brain barrier, with significant sex differences.The research confirmed that acute stress and so-called chronic mild unpredictable stress induce distinct behavioral and biochemical profiles, highlighting the importance of differentiating stress types and considering biological variables, such as sex, in neuroscience research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The long-term predictors of survival in individuals with brain abscess are not well understood. Researchers have now addressed this knowledge gap using a retrospective cohort study based on patients from Thailand. They have identified key predictors of long-term survival in patients and created a dynamic nomogram that can aid individualized prognostication for each patient. There have been significant advancements in the clinical management of BA, including medical and surgical approaches. However, the condition still leads to functional disability and mortality in patients, suggesting an urgent need to improve the standard of care. Further, they developed a dynamic nomogram for predicting long-term survival in patients with BA. "This is a retrospective cohort study of individuals who had a BA that required either pathological confirmation by a pathologist or neuroimaging plus intraoperative purulent findings at a tertiary care hospital in southern Thailand between January 2014 and August 2024" explains Dr. Thara Tunthanathip, Assistant Professor at Prince of Songkla University, the lead author of the study. The researchers comprehensively evaluated various demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging factors to assess their predictive value for long-term survival in BA patients. They identified several independent predictors of long-term survival such as age, Karnofsky performance status, hemoculture results, preoperative coagulopathy, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, bandemia, and occipital location of BA. Furthermore, they estimated the 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year survival probabilities for these patients. Prior systematic reviews and metanalyses have documented a broad spectrum of mortality rates in individuals with BA, often ranging from 10 to 40%." The dynamic "nomogram"—a graphical tool used to predict disease progression—offers a user-friendly way of estimating long-term survival in these patients. Researchers have validated this nomogram using several distinct statistical techniques, confirming its robustness. Calibration plots and receiver operating characteristic analysis further supported its reliability", Dr. Tunthanathip. "The model provides an interactive tool for individualized risk assessment and facilitating clinical decision-making", he explains further. In the clinical setting, the predictive model created through this study may facilitate more accurate prognostication, thereby facilitating better treatment decisions and improving treatment outcomes for individuals with BA. With sufficient adaptation, the predictive model and dynamic nomogram can be applied to a wider population of BA patients. "Future research should focus on external validation and further refinement of the model to ensure its generalizability across diverse populations", Dr. Tunthanathip concludes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The good news about cancer is that there are increasing numbers of people who are surviving after treatment, in some cases due to newer medicines and, in others, due to screening detecting the disease earlier. While the estimate excludes most in situ carcinoma and basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, it still shows how primary care clinicians will likely face increasing demands to help patients manage the aftermath of their cancer treatment. Older chemotherapies that stop fast-growing cells, such as cancerous ones, remain widely used, but many new kinds of drugs have been introduced, sometimes only with emerging data available on their safety and benefits. These include immune checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, and new forms of monoclonal antibodies. Yet there has not been much focus in US medicine in general on what happens when patients cycle back to being seen primarily by their primary care clinicians after treatment. Peairs in 2015 founded the Primary Care for Cancer Survivors Program, which has served as a model for physicians elsewhere seeking to help bridge gaps that might otherwise happen in patient care. For example, Ilana Yurkiewicz, MD, of Stanford University School of Medicine sought advice from Peairs when she sought to create a more unified approach to caring for patients who have had cancer treatments. In an interview with Medscape Medical News, Steele noted how patients can face a jarring change at the end of treatment. “But survivorship is a paradigm shift where we're really trying to empower patients with information and skills to manage some of their health risks longitudinally, and this can be challenging for a lot of reasons.” For primary care clinicians, the changes in treatment and outcomes are allowing them to participate in one of the most rapidly advancing fields of medicine. For example, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) updated its guidelines 241 times last year. Clinicians in primary care can also rely on many tools like UptoDate and continuing medical education courses to aid with this challenge. Physicians can help patients adjust to their “new normal” life after cancer treatment, Peairs said. “We're not asking primary care people to be oncologists,” she said. Below are three tips for primary care clinicians based on interviews with physicians who have significant expertise in oncology and in the emerging field known as survivorship. Primary care clinicians can help get important messages through to patients who may struggle to keep track of follow-up care, said Kathleen N. Mueller, MD, the system director for integrative medicine and cancer survivorship for Nuvance Health, a seven-hospital health system in Connecticut and southeastern New York. “When you're undergoing treatment for cancer, it's really difficult to process information,” Mueller said. In many cases, people did not suspect they had cancer before their diagnosis. “Now, all of a sudden, they're thinking about their mortality,” she said. “They may not get all the information that's communicated to them. A key to success with these talks about preventing recurrence is finding a way to make sure patients hear the message, such as by discussing different steps at different visits, said Crystal S. Denlinger, MD, the chief executive officer of NCCN. “You don't need to tackle it all at every visit. During one visit, you could ask somebody about how physically active they are and then talk about the fact that physical activity can lower the rate of development of cancer, and for certain cancers, could actually lower the rate of recurrence.” Denlinger also said it's important to acknowledge the good habits patients already have, such as getting enough physical activity. Steele said she works to provide a “safe space” where patients can talk about what they are going through. “After cancer treatment, a lot of people don't feel like the person they were before cancer,” Steele said, adding that this can be distressing for them. Primary care clinicians have a chief role in helping patients with concerns about recurrence and the challenges of managing life after cancer treatment, Denlinger said. Anxiety is likely to crop up “in those quiet moments” after the most challenging phases of cancer treatment are done, Denlinger said. After treatment, patients disconnect with their constant oncology engagement, she said. “This may be a time where primary care providers are an important resource to address some of this post-treatment anxiety, as they're sort of processing all the things that they've been through. This paper included results from a survey of patients that found many sought help with emotional needs. For example, a woman diagnosed with breast cancer may be worried about her daughter's risk. Family physicians often build relationships with their patients over many years, and in many cases, know something about their relatives, giving them insights that oncologists couldn't be expected to have, Mueller said.

These diets led to a marked decrease in the relative abundance of Streptococcus, Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, and Lactococcus bacterial strains, coupled with an increase in Clostridium and Mucispirillum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have shown that there is strong evidence that e-cigarette use may act as a gateway to cigarette smoking and other health issues in young people. A review of reviews has revealed that there is a consistent link between e-cigarette use and later cigarette smoking, as well as potential links between vaping and a range of health issues, including asthma, mental health concerns, and drug use. Our previous reviews have shown that commonly used marketing strategies for e-cigarettes on social media networks resulted in more young people vaping, and this new review looks at what happens when vaping is a regular practice. Across multiple studies, young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke in the future. These findings support stronger public health measures to protect teens from the risks associated with vaping." Researchers not only showed an increased smoking risk, but that young people who once vaped, may go on to smoke more frequently and intensely. The review also found that vaping in young people often is followed by alcohol and marijuana use. Many young people report signs of nicotine dependence, including cravings and difficulty quitting, but despite concerns about nicotine's effects on the adolescent brain, very few reviews have examined this issue. In particular, we found consistent evidence around transitions to smoking which of course, in turn, opens the door to the multitude of harms that conventional cigarettes bring."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Teaching about periods in schools is still too focused on basic biological facts with insufficient information around how menstruation can affect a woman's mood and wellbeing, problems associated with menstrual bleeding and the impact on physical and academic performance, concludes a new study by UCL (University College London) researchers. The survey and focus group-based research, published in the academic journal Women's Health, also suggests that periods should be taught amongst mixed sex groups as well as single sex at both primary and secondary schools, something which some schools don't currently do. Sex (also known as relationships) education has been compulsory in English primary and secondary schools since 2020, and earlier this year was updated to include topics such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and heavy menstrual bleeding. Now the academics behind the UCL study are calling for lessons on periods in British schools to be much more comprehensive. Professor Joyce Harper (UCL Institute for Women's Health) said: "Educating pupils about periods may now be compulsory in schools in England and Wales, but we know that for many of them that still only amounts to two lessons in their entire school career. "Our survey suggests that those lessons are still very much concerned with the basic biological facts around menstruation – what we and the women who participated in our study are calling for is that lessons on menstruation need to be much more comprehensive, and cover everything from what effect periods can have on a girl or woman's well-being and academic and sporting performance, to what abnormal bleeding looks like. It was agreed that classes should not be segregated by gender, believing mixed sessions are crucial for boys' education. "Through work with the International Reproductive Health Education Collaboration and Wellbeing of Women, we are providing teachers with resources to support teaching about menstruation." Many were educated before the topic on menstruation became mandatory in English and Welsh schools. As part of the survey each participant was asked the following questions: how do you feel about having a period? ; how do you manage your period and menstrual cycle, and what support do you need (e.g. food, exercise, period trackers, work)? One participant pointed to a serious lack of education around periods: "The priority should be to teach the practical application of these hormonal changes; how might we expect these changes to affect our mood, social battery, physical performance and academic performance throughout the month." In their report, the researchers said that menstruation continues to be "highly stigmatised" and that a "lack of education and normalisation of difficult periods restricts individuals from seeking help". Co-author Caroline Musulin (UCL Institute for Women's Health), who conducted the 18-25-year-old study group, said: "Many women endure menstrual problems longer than they should due to the inability to speak openly about uncertainties, fears of being dismissed by healthcare professionals, the view that it's 'just' a painful period or feelings of shame. "Strict behavioural expectations to conceal menstruation and resource limitations contribute to negative experiences, where dissatisfaction with menstrual practices and management environments exist, along with feelings of disgust if participants feel they have failed to manage their menstruation discreetly." "Many believed normal physiological processes, like vaginal discharge, were abnormal. The lack of education on how external factors, such as stress and contraceptive methods, can impact menstrual cycles was another point of confusion." The recruitment via social media and word of mouth may have introduced sampling bias by attracting people of a similar demographic to the researchers. Also, the study only included cisgender women and further studies need to be conducted on gender-diverse individuals, the researchers said. Musulin, C., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Munich, Germany, use 4 PIPETBOY GENIUS serological pipet controllers from INTEGRA Biosciences to streamline their cell culture workflows. These ergonomic devices support fast and precise serological pipetting, while the aliquoting function makes repetitive tasks more comfortable for users. We really appreciate the repeat dispensing function, which we've found incredibly useful; it's so convenient to simply press a button and dispense multiple aliquots from a single aspiration. Of the many pipetting aids I worked with, PIPETBOY GENIUS controllers are the most sensitive to variations in finger pressure, giving us extremely fine control over dispensing speeds and liquid flow. This is very helpful for avoiding damage to delicate cell monolayers or loss of valuable reagents and unwanted mixing between neighboring wells due to spill-over when filling small multiwell plates." The PIPETBOY GENIUS is incredibly light, and I'm impressed that INTEGRA managed to fit all its advanced features into such a compact design. It has significantly improved our workflow and become popular across the cell culture labs. I'd recommend it to anyone in the field," Albert concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists say rising climate disasters could act as hidden childhood traumas, reshaping brain development and fueling mental health crises without urgent global action. Perspective: Extreme weather and climate-related adverse childhood experiences are a humanitarian crisis during the 21st century. Their perspective article is published in the journal Communications Medicine. Although direct neurobiological evidence remains limited, emerging evidence, such as the Generation R study, shows links between extreme temperatures, reduced brain connectivity, and impaired white matter development, and parallels with research on childhood trauma show that repeated ECEs elevate risks to mental health and disrupt development. Water scarcity isn't just physical: Beyond causing disease, ECEs like droughts create profound psychological distress linked to distrust of water sources and reliance on expensive or unsafe alternatives, adding another layer of toxic stress. Beyond causing immediate harm like malnutrition, injury, and disease, they also act as traumatic stressors that disrupt children's sense of security and stability. These events can trigger post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, and even contribute to long-term physical conditions such as cardiovascular disease. Traditionally, research on adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), harmful or traumatic events occurring within the family, such as parental instability, abuse, and neglect, has focused on family-based trauma. Still, environmental stressors like ECEs remain underrepresented, despite their ability to produce toxic stress responses similar to ACEs, particularly during sensitive developmental stages. The authors introduce environmentally driven ACEs (E-ACEs), emphasizing their distinct impact on children's lifelong mental and physical health. Displacement hits hardest where resources are scarce: Over 383 million people displaced by climate disasters from 2008-2023 came specifically from low- and middle-income countries – regions least equipped to support affected children. E-ACEs describe the stress children endure from direct exposure to repeated or intense climate and weather events or from indirect consequences like displacement, poverty, family separation, and violence. Evidence, though still limited, suggests that such experiences can disrupt neurodevelopment. For example, studies link high temperatures and early exposure to extreme weather with changes in brain connectivity and impaired white matter growth. These disruptions may parallel the neurobiological effects of traditional ACEs, which are known to alter brain development, immune function, and stress regulation. ECEs can overwhelm children's sense of safety, triggering toxic stress responses that increase risks of PTSD, anxiety, depression, and behavioral problems. Indirect pathways, including food insecurity, unstable caregiving, and loss of livelihoods, may further amplify biological effects by dysregulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and heightening inflammation, with evidence pointing to elevated cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-2 that are linked to long-term vulnerability to mental disorders and chronic diseases. Repeated exposure shows cumulative, dose-response effects, with risks escalating alongside the number and severity of ECEs, patterns similar to those found in ACE research. Protective factors, such as strong family support, can buffer these outcomes. Case studies, such as urban displacement into Dhaka's overcrowded slums, highlight how climate refugees face compounded risks, including neglect, violence, and lack of access to education and healthcare. Inflammation could be a hidden long-term culprit: Research suggests chronic stress from E-ACEs might persistently elevate inflammatory markers (like IL-6), potentially damaging developing brains and setting the stage for adult physical illnesses. The authors argue that strengthening resilience, defined as the ability to adapt and recover from adversity, is central to protecting children from E-ACEs. Instead, multi-level approaches that combine family, community, and institutional support are recommended. At the family and community level, strong social ties, supportive parenting, stable caregiving, and peer networks can buffer children from the psychological toll of repeated climate shocks. When these supports are compromised, alternative structures such as schools, community organizations, religious groups, non-governmental organizations, and government child protection services become vital. Schools can also foster resilience through trauma-informed teaching, social-emotional learning, and climate education. Community-based mental health programs demonstrate the effectiveness of layered, culturally grounded psychosocial care that involves local leaders, health workers, and digital tools. Examples include India's NIMHANS psychosocial care model, which mobilizes local leaders, health workers, and volunteers, and the COPEWELL resilience framework in the US that integrates health systems, social capital, and emergency response planning. However, the authors caution that frameworks like COPEWELL remain largely untested in LMICs and will require local adaptation before they can be scaled. The authors emphasize the need for transformational resilience by building systems that adapt and grow stronger against future crises, particularly in LMICs. Most resilience programs aren't built for chronic climate stress: Existing support often focuses on short-term disaster recovery, lacking strategies for the persistent "overwhelming toxic stress" caused by repeated ECEs compounding ACEs. With ECEs becoming more frequent and severe, the authors warn that these events could increasingly act as E-ACEs, disrupting brain development, stress regulation, and immune function, with long-term risks for mental and physical health. In LMICs, rising displacement and urban poverty may further amplify these adversities. The authors stress that addressing E-ACEs requires coordinated action across local, national, and global levels, with wealthier nations playing a key role in supporting vulnerable populations.
