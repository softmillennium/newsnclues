                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- XRP-based mobile mining apps leverage energy-efficient blockchain tech to democratize crypto access, enabling smartphone users to earn passive income via cloud contracts. - Platforms like MintMiner offer compounding returns (up to 41,000% annually), accelerating adoption in emerging markets with limited traditional banking infrastructure. - XRP's 3-5 second transaction speed and near-zero energy costs contrast sharply with Bitcoin's 950 kWh per transaction, aligning with global sustainability trends. The cryptocurrency landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by the rise of XRP-based mobile mining apps that are redefining how individuals access and generate passive income. These platforms, leveraging cloud infrastructure and XRP's unique blockchain technology, are dismantling traditional barriers to entry—such as high hardware costs, technical complexity, and energy inefficiency—while aligning with global trends toward financial inclusivity and environmental sustainability. XRP's blockchain technology is the linchpin of this revolution. Unlike Bitcoin's energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Ethereum's transitioning Proof-of-Stake (PoS) models, XRP operates on the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol (RPCA). This mechanism relies on a network of validator nodes to confirm transactions through a social governance model, enabling near-instant confirmations (3–5 seconds) and negligible energy consumption. Apps like Find Mining and SIX MINING allow users to deploy XRP-based contracts on cloud infrastructure, bypassing the need for local hardware. The result is a system where users can mine XRP or other cryptocurrencies with a smartphone, earning daily returns ranging from $4 to $210, depending on the contract size. This legal clarity has spurred institutional adoption, with Ripple's partnerships with Chainlink for price feeds and the launch of XRP-focused ETFs by firms like 3iQ and HashKey Capital. Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act have further solidified XRP's legitimacy, pushing its price toward its all-time high of $3.60. Platforms like BAY Miner and MintMiner report compounding returns of up to 41,000% annually, with users in emerging markets—where traditional banking infrastructure is limited—leading adoption. Such models are democratizing access to passive income, particularly in regions where crypto adoption is outpacing traditional finance. The rise of XRP mobile mining reflects a deeper shift in how retail investors engage with crypto. Traditional mining, dominated by institutional players and energy-hungry hardware farms, is being replaced by a model that prioritizes accessibility and user experience. This aligns with the broader trend of “democratized finance,” where tools like DeFi and stablecoins are enabling everyday users to participate in global markets. As governments and consumers increasingly prioritize sustainability, XRP's energy efficiency gives it a competitive edge. Platforms like XRP Mining highlight their use of green energy, appealing to a generation of investors who demand both profitability and ethical alignment. The crypto market remains volatile, and cloud mining platforms are not immune to scams or regulatory scrutiny. Users must conduct due diligence—verifying platform transparency, contract terms, and security measures. Additionally, while XRP's technology is robust, its long-term success depends on sustained institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates and global payment trends. For investors, the rise of XRP mobile mining presents a dual opportunity:1. Platform Participation: High-yield contracts on platforms like Find Mining and BAY Miner offer immediate passive income, though diversification is key to mitigate platform-specific risks. As XRP continues to solidify its role in cross-border payments and DeFi, its mobile mining apps are likely to accelerate the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology, reshaping how individuals earn and invest in the digital age.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin is trading almost $11,000 below its Aug. 14 record, according to CoinDesk data, but FalconX's head of research says the market's internal structure still looks “extremely bullish.” In a post on X on Wednesday, analyst David Lawant pointed to what happens in bitcoin's order book — the live record of buy and sell offers on exchanges — when the price pulls back slightly from highs. In plain terms, Lawant is saying that sellers are not sticking around to push the market down after modest declines. Instead, strong demand steps in almost immediately, and buyers crowd out sellers. Rather than signaling weakness, the absence of sustained selling indicates confidence in bitcoin's longer-term trajectory. This repeated shift toward the bid side is a hallmark of a bullish market structure, since it demonstrates that demand is waiting in the wings to absorb any supply that comes to market. For traders, the takeaway is that bitcoin's resilience after dips points to strong underlying support. While bitcoin is still below its Aug. 14 peak of $124,481, the pattern highlighted by Lawant — sellers vanishing quickly and buyers reasserting control — continues to underpin bullish sentiment among analysts who see dips as opportunities rather than warning signs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Jack Mallers' Twenty One Capital plans to dethrone MicroStrategy and Marathon with $5 billion Bitcoin treasury—but the real innovation might be how they measure success Jack Mallers, the Bitcoin maximalist behind Strike—a digital payments app that uses the Lightning Network to enable instant, low-cost Bitcoin and dollar transactions—and the driving force that helped El Salvador adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is making his boldest move yet. His new venture, Twenty One Capital, has accumulated over 43,500 Bitcoin worth more than $5 billion and is positioning itself to become the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder—surpassing current leaders MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and MARA Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA). The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share. But what sets Twenty One apart isn't just the size of its Bitcoin war chest. In a recent Bloomberg Television interview, Mallers revealed a fundamentally different approach to measuring corporate performance that could reshape how Bitcoin-native companies think about shareholder value. While traditional companies obsess over earnings per share, Twenty One has introduced what Mallers calls “Bitcoin per share” as their primary performance metric. This isn't just accounting innovation—it's a philosophical shift that treats Bitcoin as the ultimate unit of account. Twenty One expects to complete its public listing in the third quarter following Securities and Exchange Commission review, with over $5 billion in Bitcoin at launch, giving investors direct exposure to this new performance framework. Mallers' confidence in Bitcoin's trajectory stems from what he calls “definitive scarcity.” Unlike traditional commodities where increased demand can stimulate additional supply, Bitcoin's fixed 21 million coin limit means new buyers must compete for existing holdings. You have to go up in price,” Mallers told Bloomberg, predicting Bitcoin could reach $150,000 as institutional and sovereign buyers compete for limited supply. MicroStrategy holds the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury, while MARA ranks second with over 46,000 BTC. Twenty One's goal to surpass both reflects Mallers' belief that corporate adoption is still in its infancy. See Also: Grow your IRA or 401(k) with Crypto – unlock the power of alternative investments including a Crypto IRA within your retirement account. Perhaps most telling is Twenty One's unwavering focus on Bitcoin exclusively. Mallers embraces the “Bitcoin maximalist” label, viewing other cryptocurrencies as inferior alternatives to what he calls “pristine money.” This single-asset focus contrasts sharply with diversified crypto strategies, but it also provides clarity of purpose that resonates with institutional investors seeking pure-play Bitcoin exposure. Twenty One's approach could accelerate corporate Bitcoin adoption by providing a clearer framework for measuring success. With an unrealized gain of over $1.3 billion already accumulated, the company serves as a real-time case study in Bitcoin treasury management. For investors, Twenty One represents a new category: Bitcoin-native companies that measure success in Bitcoin terms rather than fiat. This could appeal to those who believe traditional accounting methods undervalue Bitcoin-holding companies. Twenty One's public debut will test whether investors are ready for this new paradigm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The platform is building a system that makes using crypto for everyday purchases fast and affordable. Based in London and backed by global investors, SpacePay works with hundreds of wallets so people can spend crypto as easily as a bank card. It keeps costs low for both shoppers and merchants and has already raised over a million dollars in its presale. The goal is to make crypto payments part of daily life everywhere. Customers want quick and easy payments without delays or high fees. Merchants need a system that is steady and dependable. These problems have made it hard for crypto to be used in physical stores, even though more people now own it. It can handle heavy payment traffic without slowing down. It works with more than 325 wallets, including MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, and Ledger, meaning customers can pay directly from the wallets they already use. The system also connects to existing payment terminals through an APK. On busy days, such as holiday sales, SpacePay is built to process every payment quickly and efficiently. This could be a better choice compared to most traditional banking systems. It also protects merchants from price changes in crypto. This system is made possible through its volatility protection mechanism, which locks the crypto funds as soon as the payments are processed. Customers can use Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins such as USDT, and more. Merchants only pay a 0.5% fee per transaction, which is lower than most bank card fees. The hotel receives the exact amount they expected in their local currency, with no waiting and no surprise charges. SpacePay's focus on speed, low fees, and a simple user experience makes it stand out. With instant settlement, protection from price swings, and support for hundreds of wallets, it has the tools to make crypto a normal way to pay. For those who believe crypto should be as easy to spend as cash, joining the SPY presale is a way to be part of that future. Token holders can vote on decisions, gain early access to new features, and receive loyalty rewards. They can also share in part of the platform's revenue. The presale is more than a way to raise money; it helps build the network by bringing in early supporters. You can pay with ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, BASE, USDC, USDT, or a bank card. Once your wallet is connected and has funds, choose how much SPY you want to buy. After the swap, your SPY tokens will be sent to your wallet and ready to use when SpacePay launches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The landscape of meme-driven tokens keeps expanding, and investors are watching closely. Dogecoin has long been a leader in the meme coin space, but new projects are starting to gain traction. One such crypto presale is Pepe Dollar ($PEPD), now in stage 2 of its offering. This new crypto token presale has raised over $1.5 million, sparking curiosity among both retail traders and larger investors. With its mix of meme culture and decentralized payment solutions, Pepe Dollar adds fresh competition to the top crypto presales list. Pepe Dollar's stage 2 presale crypto has already secured over $1.5 million in contributions, highlighting strong demand from the community. This significant difference between presale and launch price is a central talking point. It explains why Pepe Dollar is making its way into the crypto presale list of projects that attract both small and large investors. As a presale cryptocurrency, it offers accessibility to anyone with an Ethereum wallet, making it easier for users to buy presale crypto directly through its official platform. The cap on total supply further reinforces its structure, ensuring that demand isn't diluted by unlimited minting. These aspects make Pepe Dollar stand out in today's crowded field of token presales, particularly for those comparing crypto coins on presale. Some long-time Dogecoin investors, often called whales, have reportedly set aside $15,000 allocations to join the Pepe Dollar presale. Their decision isn't based only on hype, it stems from the token's practical features and its growing community presence. Whales often look for crypto presale projects that combine cultural appeal with long-term development. Pepe Dollar's integration of meme culture with payment infrastructure has caught their attention. This move shows how larger investors often recognize early opportunities in top presale crypto offerings. Their participation highlights how Pepe Dollar has crossed from being just another presale coin to becoming part of conversations alongside Dogecoin itself. Pepe Dollar ($PEPD) reflects a shift in the way meme tokens are viewed. It blends humor, internet symbolism, and blockchain infrastructure to create an ecosystem that does more than entertain. These qualities distinguish it from many other crypto presales that exist only for short-term speculation. For Dogecoin investors and newcomers alike, Pepe Dollar represents how meme culture can evolve into usable systems. While comparisons with Dogecoin are inevitable, Pepe Dollar carves its own space in the wider landscape of crypto presale 2025 opportunities.

China, one of the most restrictive global jurisdictions for cryptocurrencies, is reportedly considering allowing Chinese yuan-backed stablecoins in what would be a major policy reversal. Chinese authorities may authorize yuan-backed stablecoins for the first time to promote global use of its currency, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter. If approved, China's plan for stablecoin use would mark a major shift in its approach to crypto after the country banned crypto trading and mining in September 2021. The news followed multiple reports suggesting that mainland China had been warming up to stablecoins amid a US stablecoin push in 2025. According to the sources, China's State Council will review and potentially approve a roadmap later in August to expand global use of the yuan. The plan reportedly includes steps to counter US progress on stablecoins and guidelines for risk prevention. One use case for a potential yuan-backed stablecoin from mainland China would be the implementation of stablecoins for cross-border trade and payments with some countries. As of June, China's yuan was the sixth most active currency for global payments by value, with a share of around 2.9%, according to Swift's RMB Tracker.

In June, a PBOC official acknowledged the transformative potential of emerging technologies like stablecoins in global payment systems, intensifying calls for regulatory approval of yuan-backed stablecoins. Neighboring jurisdictions like Hong Kong have also taken steps toward stablecoin approval, launching a dedicated regulatory framework on Aug. 1 Magazine: South Koreans dump Tesla for Ethereum treasury BitMine: Asia Express Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, fintech, and iGaming industries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. The ICO, or initial coin offering, era was notorious. A decade ago, crypto founders raised millions and even billions from small-time traders by selling cryptocurrencies tied to new projects. Regulators cracked down on the practice, and ICOs soon became another chapter in crypto history. Now, the practice appears to be making a comeback, and the crypto startup Legion hopes to create the go-to platform where companies can—responsibly—sell tokens to small-time traders, say cofounders Fabrizio Giabardo and Matt O'Connor. On Wednesday, the pair announced that Legion had raised $5 million in a seed round led by VanEck and Brevan Howard Digital. Giabardo and O'Connor declined to disclose their startup's valuation. The round was for equity and token warrants, or promised allocations of a yet-to-be-launched cryptocurrency, they said. The return of the ICO follows a regulatory thaw in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump's administration has signaled a friendlier approach to crypto than that of former President Joe Biden. Crypto companies, who once were fleeing the U.S. amid a flurry of lawsuits from the Securities and Exchange Commission, are now returning. But Giabardo and O'Connor believe their platform will help prevent the outright scams that were common a decade ago—when founders would raise millions off the back of a jargon-filled white paper and then disappear in so-called “rug pulls.” Giabardo, who had stints as a geologist and then consultant, started exploring crypto in 2020 and eventually began working with the crypto analytics platform Delphi Digital. O'Connor comes from traditional finance, where he worked at the asset manager Bridgewater Associates before he found his way to working on Stacks in 2022, a blockchain built on top of Bitcoin. Their platform is built to comply with recently released regulatory framework in the European Union for early token launches, they said. The statutes require projects to release a “white paper” that requires issuers to detail, for example, risks involved with the offering and update their white papers anytime there are material changes to the projects. “Give people honest, truthful, succinct disclosures that they can fully understand, do some kind of checking that validates that, yes, they do truly understand these things,” he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fed Vice Chair urges banks to embrace blockchain or risk irrelevance, citing tokenization and fraud prevention as key benefits. At the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium on Aug. 19, Bowman emphasized that regulators and banks must adopt a more proactive approach to the crypto industry. She pointed out that integrating these new innovative technologies would be crucial for maintaining relevance in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. She added that institutions that fail to evolve could become peripheral players, while forward-looking banks could strengthen their position in the market. She explained that tokenized assets can be transferred digitally without intermediaries or the physical movement of securities. Moreover, Bowman noted that tokenized systems can streamline these steps, reduce operational friction, and expand market access. Due to this, the Fed chief noted that regulatory alignment could move tokenization from pilot projects to mainstream adoption that would benefit both major banks and smaller community institutions. Beyond tokenization's efficiency, Bowman highlighted blockchain's potential to combat fraud. In the speech, she conceded that financial institutions face risks from identity theft, scams, and related crimes. However, she argued that if blockchain can measurably reduce fraud, regulators should facilitate its adoption rather than impede it. “If fraud can be addressed using new technology, we should make sure that the regulatory framework does not stand in the way. I see this as an exciting opportunity for collaboration between industry and the Fed.” He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change. Follow us on X for instant crypto news and insights updates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Snorter bot users didn't, and smart money are taking notice as SNORT token blasts to $3.5M in skyrocket ICO. The token has been around for years, but it only staged its first major breakout this month, vaulting past a $200 million market cap and showing just how unpredictable meme coin runs can be. While Solana remains the top launchpad for meme coins, significant opportunities also emerge on BNB Chain and beyond – and Snorter's tech stack is being built to track them wherever they appear. Wiki Cat launched in March 2022 on BNB Smart Chain as a community-driven meme coin tied to the SMC DAO. Its model combined massive burns, renounced ownership, and a push to onboard new users into crypto education, particularly across Africa. It wasn't until June 2025 that WKC began drawing serious attention, with trading volume and price action surging as its valuation spiked to $10 million. But that's exactly why the idea to develop Snorter Bot Token was formalized. Its purpose is to turn the guesswork of finding breakout tokens into an automated process. Finding the next WKC before a surge like this can be life-changing, and Snorter Bot Token is being built to make that scenario more common among retail traders. Right now, its Solana-native Fast Sniper tool monitors mempools and DEX contracts for the exact moment a new liquidity pool forms, then routes buys through private RPC endpoints that confirm faster than public gateways. Most competing bots aren't built for this speed as they typically lean on public endpoints, slow feeds, or Ethereum-first templates that don't translate well to Solana's high-frequency environment. Even Solana-based bots often charge higher fees, react more slowly, or leave users exposed to MEV traps – all of which eat away at gains. Wiki Cat lives on Binance, and Snorter's first rollout (Phase 2) will remain Solana-focused. But Phase 3 on the roadmap unlocks multichain capability, putting Snorter in a position to track and snipe opportunities across ecosystems, whether they start on Solana, Binance, or elsewhere. That's how Snorter ensures the next WKC-style move won't slip through retail's fingers. Now once launched, traders won't even have to look far for a 100x shot because the SNORT token itself carries that upside. That traction has also secured SNORT a place in Best Wallet's Upcoming Tokens feature. Its recognition of SNORT underscores just how much potential the project holds. While the team hasn't officially confirmed the closing date, Snorter Bot Token's presale has already far outpaced Banana Gun's early raise, which could indicate that it is nearing its final phase. That means the window to secure SNORT at its lowest entry price may close quickly. Early positioning has always been key to chasing 50x or even 100x gains. You can buy SNORT directly on the Snorter Bot Token website with SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or even a credit card.

Shineco (NASDAQ: SISI) hat eine wegweisende Partnerschaft mit Plus Me Limited angekündigt, um die weltweit erste blockchain-basierte Plattform zur Tokenisierung von Zellvermögenswerten zu starten. Die Initiative umfasst die Schaffung von "Cell Infusion Redemption Tokens" auf dem Ethereum-Mainnet und ermöglicht digitale Verwahrung und den Handel mit biologischen Zellvermögenswerten. Diese strategische Übernahme zusammen mit den bestehenden Infiniclone-Aktivitäten in Singapur schafft eine umfassende Infrastruktur für Token-Einlösung und Asset-Abwicklung.

Shineco combines blockchain tokenization with stem cell therapy, creating a novel business model through strategic acquisition and partnerships. Shineco has pioneered a groundbreaking convergence of blockchain technology with biotech by establishing the world's first on-chain tokenization platform for cellular assets. The implementation of non-fungible digital identifiers (NFDIs) on Ethereum's mainnet creates immutable proof of cellular asset ownership and provenance, addressing a critical pain point in the industry where authenticity verification has historically been challenging. The ERC-1400/ERC-20 compliant security tokens introduce a novel liquidity mechanism for previously illiquid biological assets. The strategic acquisition of a 51% controlling stake in Xi'an Dong'ao Health Management demonstrates execution capability beyond conceptual planning. This acquisition, combined with their previously acquired Singapore firm Infiniclone, establishes a critical global network that bridges the gap between digital tokens and physical cellular assets - solving the 'last mile' problem that has plagued many real-world asset (RWA) tokenization projects. The business model innovation centers on transforming cellular assets into programmable financial instruments while maintaining biological integrity. The open ecosystem approach, where Shineco provides physical infrastructure while Plus Me delivers the tokenization layer, creates network effects that could scale more rapidly than a closed system. This initiative reflects broader market trends where RWA tokenization is gaining institutional adoption, though regulatory frameworks remain inconsistent across jurisdictions. The inclusion of governance rights through future DAO voting indicates an evolving business structure that may decentralize certain decision-making processes while maintaining corporate control of critical infrastructure. BEIJING, Aug. 20, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Shineco Inc. ("Shineco" or the "Company"; NASDAQ: SISI), a leading innovator in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, today announced the execution of a "Cellular Asset On-Chaining and Marketing Ecosystem Cooperation Agreement" with blockchain infrastructure provider Plus Me Limited. This partnership enables blockchain-based tokenization of biological cellular assets, facilitating seamless global transfers and auditable standardized custody, creating a novel 'Asset On-Chaining + Application Scenarios' model in cell therapy. Verifiable uniqueness and regulatory compliance are cryptographically enforced through on-chain hashing. These utility tokens can be redeemed at Shineco-affiliated Cell Therapy Centers, with Tokens are programmatically burned upon redemption, enforcing scarcity and aligning long-term value for stakeholders. This RWA (Real-World Asset) tokenization framework addresses critical industry pain points: high user costs, unverifiable product provenance, and illiquid asset pools – converting biological assets into tradable digital instruments. To bolster the initiative, Shineco has secured a controlling 51% stake in Xi'an Dong'ao Health Management Co., Ltd., a specialist in cryogenic cell storage and clinical applications, provides the off-chain infrastructure critical to token redemption, as of August 18, 2025. This strategic buyout operationalizes the tokenization initiative, providing off-chain infrastructure for token redemption. Combined with previously acquired Singapore firm Infiniclone, Shineco now controls a global storage & infusion network ensuring on-chain<>off-chain asset settlement. This tokenized ecosystem transforms Shineco from a sole service provider into a global infrastructure provider for the cell economy, positioning the ecosystem for rapid revenue scalability. Shineco's asset tokenization protocol aligns with the industry's shift from clinical trials to commercial scalability. "This marks the birth of a decentralized biotech economy—where every cell becomes a liquid, programmable asset, unlocking unprecedented value for medicine and investors alike," said Jennifer Zhan, CEO of Shineco. "Token holders gain governance rights, including future DAO voting to enhance global ecosystem development in cell therapy—fundamentally transforming traditional marketing paradigms."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors face turbulence as Shiba Inu price struggles to hold key levels around $0.00001237. While meme coins remain volatile, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a compelling alternative, with $20 million raised, over 609 million tokens sold, and a Q3 beta wallet launch, highlighting real-world utility and growing adoption momentum. Shiba Inu price is hovering near $0.00001237 as traders work to maintain crucial support levels. According to the latest Shiba Inu Price Forecast, the area between $0.00001250 and $0.00001230 will be pivotal in determining whether SHIB can stage a recovery or continue its downward move. Market analysts remain cautious, noting that short-term sentiment is tilted toward selling as investors take profits. At the same time, attention is gradually shifting toward utility-focused tokens like Remittix (RTX), which recently surpassed $20 million raised and is gaining traction with growing adoption. Recent technical patterns show SHIB retreating from $0.00001280, indicating hesitation among buyers. Should this level fail, SHIB could test lower zones near $0.00001200, risking the loss of recent gains. While SHIB faces uncertainty, Remittix (RTX) has gained traction as a utility-driven crypto solution. Priced at $0.0969, with over 609 million tokens sold and $20 million raised, RTX is designed to solve real-world problems like cross-border payments and crypto-to-fiat transfers. The project's Q3 beta wallet launch further positions it as a functional platform rather than a speculative token, making it one of the most attractive opportunities for investors right now. The upcoming wallet launch will enable seamless conversion across 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. Combined with strong fundraising momentum, these developments explain why interest in Remittix continues to grow despite market turbulence. Shiba Inu price may face up to a 50% drawdown this year if support fails, while Remittix continues to build a product-focused narrative with tangible adoption. Its cross-border payment capabilities, staking opportunities, and time-sensitive bonuses make it a standout choice in 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FRNT is a groundbreaking digital money programme for the public sector as the first fiat-backed, fully-reserved stablecoin issued by a public entity in the US – an eye-catching development given that traditional stablecoins are issued by private companies. STABLECOINS: EXPLAINED Stablecoins (also known as stabletokens) are a type of digital asset / cryptocurrency, minted on a blockchain network, that seek to maintain a stable value by having their market value pegged to an external reference, most commonly fiat (traditional currency). But it has been undertaking numerous legislative, policy and marketing initiatives to position itself as a fintech and blockchain-friendly location – as exemplified by FRNT. FRNT is designed to provide ‘secure, transparent and efficient digital transactions for individuals, businesses, and institutions – worldwide', according to a press notice issued by state governor Mark Gordon's office. FRNT ‘fortifies its stability' with a legislatively-mandated remit to achieve 2% overcollateralization,' the press notice states. FRNT makes use of blockchain technology to offer ‘instant transaction settlement, reduced fees and enhanced accessibility for all users,' the press notice states. This means users can send FRNT instantly and cheaply between any of these networks, while Wyoming maintains complete control over the currency's issuance and compliance. FRNT is launched as a single, unified digital currency across seven blockchains – Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon and Solana – that were chosen via what the press notice describes as a ‘robust candidacy' process. Further private-sector suppliers include LayerZero Labs (‘token issuance partner'), Fireblocks (blockchain infrastructure), Franklin Advisers (reserves management), Inca Digital (‘open-source intelligence') and The Network Firm (‘financial audit and monthly attestations'). At time of writing (20 August), the stabletoken's website (https://stabletoken.wyo.gov/) states that FRNT is ‘not currently available for purchase'. These digital currencies offer, he said, the “promise of secure, efficient and transparent transactions with the potential to transform everything from cross-border payments to public sector operations”. Wyoming, he added, has “positioned itself at the forefront of this movement, creating a blueprint for what state-backed innovation can look like.” Apollo, who took up his role in September 2023 after working in the private sector, said that (at the time) Wyoming lawmakers have passed about 45 pieces of digital asset-related legislation since 2016. He described the Commission's $5.8m budget as “not very big… but perhaps appropriate” given that it is public funding. This capital is ultimately due back to the state's general fund. The stablecoin is, Apollo explained, “intended to look a bit like” pre-existing stablecoins that are similarly pegged to the US dollar such as USDC, a stablecoin issued by Massachusetts-headquartered Circle, and PayPal's PYUSD, “with some differentiators.” Treasury purchases funded by the programme should generate interest income that will be transferred to a ‘Wyoming School Foundation Program' that is run by the state's Department of Education. Since he began in the role, his office had received an “extensive amount of inbound interest” from more than 730 individuals across more than 360 organisations, as well aspirant “vendors who want to help build” the Wyoming Stable Token, he said. “We want to make sure this has all the best practices of existing incumbent stablecoins, and go a little bit further than that,” he said. RELATED ARTICLE Trump signs stablecoin act into law as Washington steps on crypto gas – a news story (21 July 2025) on the GENIUS Act (see below) The intention is for the Wyoming Stable Token to be “certainly a domestic product and then international and also on DeFi platforms,” Apollo said. “It might take some time for us to get there,” he explained. “There might be some beta testing involved and making sure we have the appropriate compliance framework in place. But we do intend to be used pretty much anywhere that incumbent stabletokens are utilised.” Wyoming's initiative comes to fruition just weeks after US president Donald Trump signed a law to establish a federal regulatory regime for stablecoins in a move closely watched by public- and private-sector fintech and payments specialists worldwide. The law was signed after the House of Representatives passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) on 17 July by 308 votes to 122 during what US lawmakers dubbed ‘Crypto Week' in Washington DC. RELATED ARTICLE “There's a case for stablecoins across all government departments…” – an article based around a speech titled ‘Why the UK Public Sector Should Embrace Stablecoins' given by Lord Holmes at an event in London on 26 June 2025 If you look at fiat-backed stablecoins and aggregate [them], they would represent a top 20 holder of US debt.” He also highlighted an opinion piece (article) authored by former Speaker Paul Ryan in the Wall Street Journal published on 13 June 2024 (‘Crypto Could Stave Off a US Debt Crisis' and sub-titled ‘Stablecoins backed by dollars provide demand for US public debt and a way to keep up with China'). In respect of the dollar's global power, the currency is on one side of almost 90 per cent of all global foreign exchange (FX) transactions.“However, with the sanctions activities of the prior [president Joe Biden] administration, many nation states have begun selling off dollars that are in their treasury,” Apollo said. RELATED ARTICLE ‘Biased, confusing, used inconsistently…': fintech terminology dissected in ECB paper – a news story (17 March 2025) on a 49-page European Central Bank (ECB) working paper (‘Digital money and finance: a critical review of terminology') in which the authors stated that ‘public sector institutions have a responsibility to help the public understand new technologies within the scope of their mandates' – and that ‘sound terminology is the very basis for this' (‘stablecoin' was among the terms criticised) “However, for members of the public who may not be aware of what blockchain is, [and have] heard negative things about crypto, there will be a bit of a hurdle here to explain how stabletokens can benefit both users and retailers or even institutions in that it would be very efficient, lower fees, etc,” he said. He provided a single sentence that he felt summarises the project: ‘a Wyoming stabletoken released on a public blockchain can be used to settle dollar-denominated transactions of any size anywhere on Earth in seconds, incurring fees less than one cent while minimising counterparty risk.' A related angle is the possibility of what he described as ‘malicious actors' snapping up Wyoming's stablecoins. “We need to make sure that Wyoming Stable Tokens do not end up with malicious actors,” he said, mentioning groups including North Korea's ‘Lazarus Group'. “But states do have some exemptions around securities laws,” he continued. Answering the second part of the question first, he said that “if we launch this programme and it becomes successful, because everything we do is public, it'll be pretty easy for any other state to kind of copy-and-paste the work that we've done.” “My hope is that, in the future, this Commission can look more like other agencies within the state that have multiple divisions,” he said. I would hope that we can, in time, have a division for tokenised real-world assets. These are things I would like to put on [block]chain.” In this vein he mentioned the possibility of using blockchain during political elections. “That, to me, will be downstream of robust solutions around digital identity,” he said. “I would hope in the future that a division within this agency can handle on-chain voting tied to some kind of digital ID that would help really shore up elections and make sure there's no fraud.” In a LinkedIn post on 19 August, LayerZero Labs opined that ‘there's no clearer signal of where finance is heading than a US state putting the dollar onchain' (meaning ‘on blockchain').</p>
