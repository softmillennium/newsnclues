                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers have uncovered a vast cloud of energetic particles -- a 'mini halo' -- surrounding one of the most distant galaxy clusters ever observed, marking a major step forward in understanding the hidden forces that shape the cosmos. The mini-halo is at a distance so great that it takes light 10 billion years to reach Earth, making it the most distant ever found, doubling the previous distance known to science. Such a mini-halo consists of highly energetic, charged particles in the vacuum between galaxies in a cluster, which together emanate radio waves which can be detected from Earth. The researchers analysed data from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) radio telescope, a vast network of over 100,000 small antennae spanning eight European countries. While studying a galaxy cluster named SpARCS1049, the researchers detected a faint, widespread radio signal.They found that it did not emanate from individual galaxies, but from a vast region of space filled with high-energy particles and magnetic fields. "It's as if we've discovered a vast cosmic ocean, where entire galaxy clusters are constantly immersed in high-energy particles," said Hlavacek-Larrondo. Added Timmerman: "It's astonishing to find such a strong radio signal at this distance. One is that there are supermassive black holes at the hearts of galaxies within a cluster that can eject streams of high-energy particles into space. However, astronomers are still trying to understand how these particles would be able to migrate away from the black hole to create such a gigantic cloud of particles, while maintaining so much of their energy. This new discovery provides a rare look at what galaxy clusters were like just after they formed, the astronomers say. It not only shows that galaxy clusters have been infused with these high-energy particles for billions of years more than previously known, but it also allows astronomers to study where these high-energy particles come from. It suggests that black holes and/or high-energy particle collisions have been enriching the environment of galaxy clusters much earlier than expected, keeping them energized over billions of years. "This discovery gives us a new window into how galaxy clusters grow and evolve, driven by both black holes and high-energy particle physics." Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Did cameras finally spot the ocean's most elusive monster? Humans spend nearly their entire lives on land, but the Earth we call home is really a water world. With 71 percent of the Earth's surface covered by water, this expansive ecosystem has been difficult to study, and many animals of the deep ocean remain a complete mystery. Believed to live in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, this immense cephalopod—the largest invertebrate species on the planet— has never been observed in its natural habitat. Scientists only get a good look at these animals when trawlers accidentally catch them in their nets. “Antarctica is experiencing rapid and complex change, and it is critical to have a better understanding of these changes for the region's ocean ecosystems,” the Kolossal team wrote in a paper detailing the method in 2024. Yet, the tourism industry in Antarctica is growing rapidly, and collaboration between tourism companies and researchers provides important access to the region.” While leveraging tourism for marine exploration is a logistical win-win, finding verified footage of a colossal squid is as hard as ever. Even the short clip of the above specimen isn't confirmed, as the video could be capturing an adult glass squid Galiteuthis glacialis or perhaps even a species completely unknown to science. The video is being peer-reviewed by experts, but it's unlikely that scientists will ever know for sure. But because footage of any squid species in the Southern Ocean is rare, the footage is a huge victory for marine biologists studying these famously elusive animals regardless of its contents. Although the team's stated goal is to capture footage of an adult colossal squid in its natural environment, according to IFLScience, the camera filmed nearly 80 species. Among them were giant volcano sponges, Antarctic sunflower stars, and many other marine invertebrates. But as marine biologists team up with tourism vessels to explore the oceans, some of the our water planet's biggest questions could slowly be answered.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spinal cord injuries are currently incurable with devastating effects on people's lives, but now a trial at Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland offers hope for an effective treatment. "Unlike a cut on the skin, which typically heals on its own, the spinal cord does not regenerate effectively, making these injuries devastating and currently incurable," says lead researcher Dr Bruce Harland, a senior research fellow in the School of Pharmacy at Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland. Before birth, and to a lesser extent afterwards, naturally occurring electric fields play a vital role in early nervous system development, encouraging and guiding the growth of nerve tissue along the spinal cord. Scientists are now harnessing this same electrical guidance system in the lab.An implantable electronic device has restored movement following spinal cord injury in an animal study, raising hopes for an effective treatment for humans and even their pets. Unlike humans, rats have a greater capacity for spontaneous recovery after spinal cord injury, which allowed researchers to compare natural healing with healing supported by electrical stimulation. After four weeks, animals that received daily electric field treatment showed improved movement compared with those who did not. Throughout the 12-week study, they responded more quickly to gentle touch. "This indicates that the treatment supported recovery of both movement and sensation," Harland says. "Just as importantly, our analysis confirmed that the treatment did not cause inflammation or other damage to the spinal cord, demonstrating that it was not only effective but also safe." "Long term, the goal is to transform this technology into a medical device that could benefit people living with these life-changing spinal-cord injuries," says Professor Maria Asplund of Chalmers University of Technology. "This study offers an exciting proof of concept showing that electric field treatment can support recovery after spinal cord injury," says doctoral student Lukas Matter, also from Chalmers University.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The C-type asteroid Ryugu is composed of rocks similar to meteorites called CI chondrites, which contain relatively high amounts of carbon, and have undergone extensive aqueous alteration in their past. The presence of this mineral is wholly unexpected, as djerfisherite does not form under the conditions Ryugu is believed to have been exposed to over its existence. "Djerfisherite is a mineral that typically forms in very reduced environments, like those found in enstatite chondrites, and has never been reported in CI chondrites or other Ryugu grains," says first and corresponding author Masaaki Miyahara, associate professor at the Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Hiroshima University. "Its occurrence is like finding a tropical seed in Arctic ice -- indicating either an unexpected local environment or long-distance transport in the early solar system." Miyahara's team had been carrying out experiments to understand the effects of terrestrial weathering on Ryugu grains. While observing the grains by field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM) for effects of weathering, they found djerfisherite in the number 15 grain of sample plate C0105-042. "The discovery of djerfisherite in a Ryugu grain suggests that materials with very different formation histories may have mixed early in the solar system's evolution, or that Ryugu experienced localized, chemically heterogeneous conditions not previously recognized. Ryugu is a part of a larger parent body that formed between 1.8 to 2.9 million years after the beginning of the Solar System. The temperature during this process is estimated to have remained below approximately 50℃. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that djerfisherite in enstatite chondrites formed directly from high-temperature gas. In addition, hydrothermal synthesis experiments have shown that djerfisherite can also form through reactions between potassium-bearing fluids and Fe-Ni sulfides at temperatures above 350 ℃. Preliminary evidence indicates that the intrinsic formation hypothesis is more likely to be true. "Ultimately, our goal is to reconstruct the early mixing processes and thermal histories that shaped small bodies like Ryugu, thereby improving our understanding of planetary formation and material transport in the early solar system," Miyahara concludes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bright colors, fruit imagery, and labels like "locally made" or "vegan" might seem harmless -- but when used on cannabis edibles, they can send misleading messages to teens. That's according to a new Washington State University-led study examining how adolescents perceive the packaging of cannabis-infused products such as gummies, chocolates and sodas. Despite regulations barring packaging that targets youth, many teens in the study found these products appealing -- often likening them to everyday snacks or health foods. The research, conducted in collaboration with Public Health - Seattle & King County, is part of a broader effort to reduce accidental cannabis exposure among teens. The findings could help shape new rules aimed at limiting underage appeal. "When you combine that with vibrant packaging and familiar fruit flavors, it's easy to see how these items start to look like snacks -- not something potentially harmful or illegal for teens." With parental permission, participants shared which packaging elements caught their eye and why. The teens consistently pointed to bright, colorful designs and packaging that resembled healthy snacks as particularly appealing. The study also showed that teens with greater familiarity with cannabis -- either through personal use or family exposure -- were more likely to notice warning labels and dosage information. Those with less knowledge often overlooked health warnings or didn't recognize cannabis symbols at all. The results raise concerns for health educators and policymakers as cannabis edibles become more prevalent. The researchers recommend incorporating teen perspectives into regulatory discussions and increasing cannabis literacy through targeted education efforts. "Teens are telling us what speaks to them -- and sometimes it's not what adults expect," said Sarah Ross-Viles, youth cannabis prevention manager with King County and study co-author. The WSU team recently worked with Public Health - Seattle & King County health officials and the Washington State Liquor & Cannabis Board to conduct a follow-up quantitative study exploring how packaging elements correlate with perceived teen appeal and intent to use. While broad changes like plain packaging may ultimately be difficult to implement, the researchers say practical updates -- such as clearer warnings and limiting branding that mimics health food -- could help reduce youth attraction. Ross-Viles agreed: "This is about ensuring cannabis packaging serves its real purpose -- informing adult consumers -- without confusing or enticing teens. And now, for the first time, we are getting direct feedback from Washington youth to help make that possible."
