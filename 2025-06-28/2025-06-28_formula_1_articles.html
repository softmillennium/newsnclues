Josep María Martí took his second race victory of the 2025 Formula 2 season after a Sprint Race full of drama at the Red Bull Ring. The Campos Racing driver started from fifth after receiving a grid penalty following Qualifying on Friday, but was up to second with a superb launch and opening few corners. After a prolonged battle with front-row starter Joshua Duerksen, Martí made an overtake stick on the AIX Racing driver to take the lead and he went on to finish P1, almost three seconds clear of the pack. The race was red-flagged in the early laps following a multi-car collision at Turn 3. Sami Meguetounif was launched into the air after contact with Arvid Lindblad, and he collected Luke Browning in the process. Into the closing stages, Martí made his move at Turns 3 and 4, sealed the lead and never looked back. Having started second, Duerksen finished on the podium in P2, holding off Invicta Racing's Roman Stanek despite clipping the gravel just a few corners from the chequered flag. Elsewhere, Alexander Dunne's advantage in the Drivers' Championship was reduced to one point over Richard Verschoor after the MP Motorsport driver finished fourth, with Dunne finishing sixth.</p>

Lando Norris and McLaren set the pace in final practice at the Red Bull Ring as drivers began to test the limits before Qualifying.

Lando Norris remained at the top of the timesheets during Saturday's final practice session for the Austrian Grand Prix, fronting a McLaren 1-2 over team mate Oscar Piastri.

Norris worked his way down to a best time of 1m 04.324s on soft tyres to edge out Piastri by 0.118s, followed by Red Bull's Max Verstappen and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton.

Several drivers had wide moments and brushes with the gravel traps, including championship leader Piastri, who spent a few minutes in the garage midway through the session while mechanics checked for damage to his floor.

Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar and World Champion Verstappen experienced slightly bigger scares, going for full 360 spins at the final corner but avoiding any barriers, while Yuki Tsunoda dropped his Red Bull exiting Turn 1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘It's been a very smooth weekend' – Norris revels in ‘the best feeling' after taking pole It was not an entirely smooth Friday for Ferrari at the Austrian Grand Prix, with Lewis Hamilton losing track time in FP1. Lewis Hamilton has explained the issues he faced during a “not spectacular” Friday at the Austrian Grand Prix, with Ferrari team mate Charles Leclerc also suggesting that there is “a lot of work to be done” overnight. While Leclerc sat out FP1 to hand his car over to rookie Dino Beganovic, Hamilton had a disrupted session owing to a gearbox problem, meaning that he lost time on track while the team worked on his SF-25 in the garage. But I think we recovered okay with it, they did a great job changing the gearbox and getting us ready for FP2. Hopefully we can try and get a little bit closer. “The car actually doesn't feel bad, we're just a huge chunk off pace-wise, so we need to look into that and that's about it really. We just keep pushing, just trying to dial the car in more and see what we can get, but it's obviously very close in the top 10 so a tenth could make a difference, so we'll work towards trying to gain at least that over the night.” Leclerc also appeared disappointed by how Friday had unfolded, the Monegasque finishing his sole practice session in fifth place. When quizzed on whether he was happy with his day's work, Leclerc answered: “Not really. “It doesn't feel like the performance is quite there yet, but hopefully we will put everything together tomorrow and do a step forward, but there's quite a lot of work to be done tonight. In Qualifying there's a lot of work to be done.” Despite the difficulties on Friday, Leclerc remains confident that Ferrari's race pace can at least put them nearer to their rivals in theory. “We were, I would say, [setting] very similar lap times to the fastest guys, so that's good, but the problem is that we've seen recently that everything is so close, and as soon as you start P6, P7, then in the race it's extremely difficult to come back where you should be. “So that's really our target, is to try and maximise Qualifying – whether we'll make it or not I don't know, but there will be a lot of work tonight to try and maximise that.” “Doing an F1 weekend is obviously even more special, and on top of that doing it in a Ferrari, even more special. “This is my sixth year now [in the Ferrari Driver Academy], so it's been a long journey and here we are doing the steps towards my goal, which is to have an F1 seat one day, and doing these programmes that we have in the Academy really helps me to show myself but also get a first taste of what it is.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ONBOARD: Lando Norris' 2025 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Austrian Grand Prix ‘It's been a very smooth weekend' – Norris revels in ‘the best feeling' after taking pole With speculation continuing over George Russell's contract situation at Mercedes – and whether the team are having talks with Max Verstappen – Toto Wolff has given his take on where things stand. Toto Wolff has insisted that “everything is normal” in terms of George Russell's contract discussions, though the Mercedes boss also admitted that some talks “you just need to have” amid Russell's suggestion that the squad are having “conversations” with Max Verstappen. When quizzed about where the process of agreeing a deal with the Silver Arrows currently stood during Thursday's media day in Austria, Russell stated that he was more focused on performance than “pressing massively” to get something signed, despite conceding that “it does help if there was pen on paper”. "So, it's only normal that conversations with the likes of Verstappen are ongoing. However, with Wolff and Russell both having previously suggested that they want to continue their partnership, Wolff asserted that this was still the case when speaking to media on Friday, whilst recognising that the team still need to have certain conversations. Wolff was then quizzed on Russell's comments about “conversations” with Verstappen and whether, as such, he would expect the 27-year-old to speak to other teams as well. “We are going into territory that I don't want to discuss out here,” the Team Principal explained. Wolff also added that he had no issue with Russell speaking openly about the situation, commenting: “I like what George says, and I'm always supportive of the driver. There's no such thing as saying things I wouldn't want him to say. At the moment, clearly, you need to explore what's happening in the future, but it doesn't change anything of what I said before about George or about Kimi [Antonelli], about the line-up that I'm extremely happy to have.” In terms of whether there was a deadline for the possibility of Verstappen joining Mercedes, Wolff said: “You make it sound like we have been asking when do you want to join and here are the terms. I just want to have the conversations behind closed doors, not town halls. Russell and Verstappen – who has a contract to race for Red Bull through to the end of 2028 – have shared some contentious moments on track, including a controversial collision at the Spanish Grand Prix that saw Verstappen receive a 10-second time penalty. Pushed on whether the two drivers could ever race together at Mercedes, Wolff suggested that he would not rule such a pairing out. I had [Nico] Rosberg and [Lewis] Hamilton fighting for a World Championship, so everything else afterwards is easy,” the Austrian reflected. “There's pros and cons of having two drivers fighting each other hard.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘It's been a very smooth weekend' – Norris revels in ‘the best feeling' after taking pole Alex Dunne hailed his Formula 1 practice debut with McLaren, for the Austrian Grand Prix, as "something pretty special." Alex Dunne has hailed his Formula 1 practice debut as "something pretty special" after finishing only fractionally slower than the sister McLaren of Oscar Piastri during FP1 ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix. Although Dunne previously sampled McLaren's 2023 challenger and underwent simulator running, this was his first time in an official F1 session. Despite his relative lack of experience, Dunne posted the fourth fastest time at the Red Bull Ring in FP1, less than a tenth behind championship leader Piastri in the sister McLaren, and just over two tenths down on George Russell's session-best. "I don't even know where to start," said Dunne after the session. McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella was impressed by Dunne's performance, not only because of his speed but also that he was able to help the team develop the car, which featured a new suspension set-up. This in turn helped regular driver Lando Norris once he got back behind the wheel of his car, before topping FP2 ahead of Piastri. "I think we have to acknowledge that he [Dunne] has gone through quite an extensive plan of testing with some new parts, with some rake work, some adjustments on the steering wheel that we don't see on TV but definitely keeps the drivers very busy," Stella told Sky Sports F1. "I think we need to be a bit careful looking at the lap times because his time came later on in the stint when the fuel was down but I think encouraging and impressive in terms of Alex himself and also I think a good session for McLaren."</p>
