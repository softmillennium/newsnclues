Meta Platforms Inc. has hired four notable artificial intelligence researchers from OpenAI, ramping up a hiring spree for its Superintelligence group. 

The company on Friday signed on Jiahui Yu, Shuchao Bi, Shengjia Zhao and Hongyu Ren, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named discussing unannounced hires. They join several other AI industry leaders, including Daniel Gross and Nat Friedman, heading to Alexandr Wang's new team at the social networking giant. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Don Bacon, a centrist Republican in Nebraska, is preparing to announce his retirement from Congress. Bacon's retirement from Congress creates a ripe opportunity for Democrats to win the House seat representing Bacon's Omaha district. In an election cycle where the House majority could be decided by just one or two seats, Democrats will need to flip several Republican-held seats like the one in Nebraska's 2nd District. With Bacon out, the GOP no longer has an incumbent advantage. The formal announcement could come as early as next week, NBC reported on Friday night. NOTUS and Punchbowl News first reported Bacon's plans, which are not unexpected. A spokesperson for Bacon did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment Saturday morning. Bacon represents a key battleground district for Nebraska, which includes most of Omaha. Former Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris won Bacon's district by nearly 5 percentage points in 2024, and former President Joe Biden carried Bacon's district by a larger margin in 2020. Bacon is one of the few congressional Republicans who have been openly critical of President Donald Trump. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

In upholding a Texas law requiring age verification to access porn websites, the court overturned a precedent that stood for more than two decades. 

This isn't enough anymore. 

Photographer: Leon Neal/Getty Images

In a landmark 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court upheld age-verification requirements for accessing online pornography sites, effectively overturning a precedent that had stood for more than 20 years. Alongside its January decision on TikTok, the ruling marks a new era in the court's online First Amendment jurisprudence: the justices are increasingly willing to uphold government suppression of free speech for policy reasons.

The opinion in the case, Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, was written by Justice Clarence Thomas, who, until recently, was something of a free speech absolutist. Thomas made it extremely clear that his goal was to find a way to uphold the Texas age-verification law at issue, regardless of precedent.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Department of Justice has settled its lawsuit challenging server maker Hewlett Packard Enterprise's all-cash acquisition of Juniper Networks for $14 billion, according to court filings. The settlement requires the combined company to divest HPE's Instant On wireless networking business and license the source code for Juniper's Mist AI software used in Juniper's WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) products. The joint settlement, filed late on Friday, requires approval by a judge and would avoid the need for a trial scheduled for July 9. The Department of Justice (DOJ), HPE and Juniper did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside business hours. The DOJ sued to block the deal in January, arguing that it would stifle competition and lead to only two companies — Cisco Systems and HPE — controlling more than 70% of the U.S. market for networking equipment. HPE said more than a year ago that it would acquire Juniper, as it looks to spruce up its artificial intelligence offerings. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BANGKOK, June 28 (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters gathered in the Thai capital Bangkok on Saturday demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, as her government faces rising anger over a border row with Cambodia. The rally, the largest anti-government protest since her Pheu Thai party came to power in 2023, increases pressure on Paetongtarn, 38, who is battling to revive a faltering economy and keep a fragile government coalition together ahead of a potential no confidence vote next month. Shinawatra-backed governments over the last two decades. While the past protests did not directly cause the downfall of those governments, they built up pressure that led to judicial interventions and military coups in 2006 and 2014. Paetongtarn said on Saturday that she was not concerned about the protest and had instructed authorities to ensure the gathering was peaceful. "It's within people's rights and I will not retaliate," she said. The prime minister, who now controls a slim majority coalition following the exit of former partner Bhumjaithai Party last week, could face a no confidence vote when parliament reconvenes next week. Bhumjaithai Party last week withdrew its support for the government citing the risk of a loss of Thai sovereignty and integrity after a leaked phone conversation between Paetongtarn and Cambodia's former premier Hun Sen. During the call, Paetongtarn appeared to seek to appease the veteran Cambodian politician and criticised a Thai army commander, a red line in a country where the military has significant clout. The prime minister also faces judicial scrutiny after a group of senators petitioned the Constitutional Court and a national anti-graft body with a wide remit to investigate her conduct over the leaked phone call. Decisions from either bodies could lead to her removal. Hun Sen, a former ally of the Shinawatras, made an unprecedented public attack on Paetongtarn and her family in an hours-long televised speech on Friday, calling for a change in government in Thailand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the age of instant gratification where Gen Alpha has easy access to instant delivery services like Amazon Prime and Uber Eats, some parents are wondering how to teach the young money-saving skills. Born between 2010 and 2024, Gen Alpha are not like other generations. Gen Alpha spent £92 million ( $126.2 million) between 2023 and 2024, according to research from financial technology company GoHenry, which provides debit cards for kids in the U.K., U.S., France, and Spain. Much of this money is going to online services, with GoHenry kids spending over £3 million on food delivery services, up 113% from the year before. "Convenience and speed have become the norm," Louise Hill, GoHenry founder, told CNBC Make It in an interview. "One of the things we need to remember when we're thinking about Gen Alpha in particular, is that they are totally used to everything being available at the flick of a switch, at the click of a button, and this drives different behaviors with money." Hill explained that despite the influx of financial education resources online, there has also been a surge in money products and apps that are easy to use, such as credit cards, buy-now-pay-later options, and contactless payments. She emphasized the importance of kids understanding "that money has to be earned before it can be spent," and then spending it with thought and consideration. "If you give a child 50 pence and pick a day of the week that works for you as a family for pocket money, that might be Saturday, then you can literally give them 50 pence every Saturday. Handling physical cash allows kids to know how much their favorite items cost. "You can give a child some coins, and then they can have the concept of how many of those coins get exchanged for a bag of sweets, versus a bigger toy," the GoHenry founder said. For teenagers, Hill proposed the method of "pizza budgeting," which allows children to visually understand how much money goes into running a household and paying bills. "The pizza is your pot of money, or your wages, or your pocket money and then taking the child through, 'Would you like to guess how big a slice of pizza we need to cut out if this is the household wages? As the pizza gets smaller and smaller, it creates an understanding of how much money is left over for leisure spending. Kids are like sponges and tend to absorb attitudes around money from their parents, so Hill believes it's good to keep them in the loop about household finances. GoHenry started hearing from customers that their kids were concerned about the cost-of-living crisis. "Kids do soak up everything in that sort of situation where perhaps as a family, you're stressed about money," she said. Parents can talk about money struggles without raising the exact issue, such as if they're unable to pay the rent. For example, Hill said that if you can no longer afford to have a takeaway every Friday night, then get children involved in making a "fakeaway," which means making a takeaway at home. "What about getting the kids involved in making a pizza and choosing their toppings? Maybe even going to the supermarket with you and picking up those toppings instead of paying the money for a takeaway and then showing them how much money is being saved," Hill added. This can help children feel more in control of their money spending habits, and learn to tighten their belts when they need to as they get older. Learn more about the world of CNBC Make It</p>
