                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — It didn't take long for Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka to patch up their relationship after this month's French Open final. A day after dancing together on Wimbledon's Centre Court in a TikTok video, the two tennis players faced more questions on Saturday about the aftermath of Sabalenka's comments right after the final, when she said her loss had more to do with her own mistakes than Gauff's performance. The Belarusian later wrote to apologize to Gauff and said her comments were “unprofessional,” but not before she faced some major backlash from fans and pundits — especially in the United States. Gauff is trying to make sure the criticism stops. “I'm not the person that will fuel hate in the world,” said Gauff, who opens her Wimbledon campaign against Dayana Yastremska on Tuesday. … It was just really targeting and saying a lot of things that I felt were not nice. “I hope the U.S. media can be easy on me right now.” Sabalenka reiterated that she never meant to offend Gauff. “I was just completely upset with myself, and emotions got over me,” she said. Gauff did acknowledge that she was initially tempted to hit back publicly at Sabalenka, who said the American “won the match not because she played incredible; just because I made all of those mistakes from ... easy balls.” But once that happened, the American was quick to bury any grudge. “I'm happy to see that they turned the page about it,” said Frances Tiafoe, who is seeded 12th in the Wimbeldon men's bracket. Then the American added with a laugh: “But also it wouldn't be too bad if they were also back-and-forth.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — Novak Djokovic offered some lighthearted advice to top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon on Saturday after gatecrashing the Belarusian's news conference. Djokovic and Sabalenka spent some time practicing together at the All England Club this week ahead of the start of the grass-court Grand Slam tournament. Djokovic, a seven-time Wimbledon champion, then playfully interrupted the end of Sabalenka's news conference on Saturday by telling her to hurry up so he could take over the podium. Sabalenka then took on the role of interviewer as reporters had been asking her about their session on court. “What did you think about hitting with me?" "How do you see my level? You're like a really talented player,” he said, before offering a criticism of Sabalenka — who is known as one of the biggest hitters on the women's circuit. You're lacking intensity on the court," Djokovic said, drawing laughter. You've got to lighten up a little bit and put some power into it.” Djokovic has experience with this kind of hijinks. 1 Caroline Wozniacki crashed his news conference and peppered him with questions. Djokovic went on to win his first Wimbledon title, while Wozniacki lost in the fourth round. Djokovic opens his bid for an eighth Wimbledon title on Tuesday when he plays Alexandre Muller of France.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic believes Wimbledon gives him the best chance of disrupting the dominance of his younger rivals and finally landing an outright record 25th Grand Slam title. The 38-year-old Serb is bidding for what would also be a record-equalling eighth Wimbledon men's title, moving him level with his long-time rival Roger Federer. Asked about claiming the 25th major that would take him clear of Australia's Margaret Court, he said: "I would probably agree that Wimbledon could be the best chance. Djokovic's 2025 season has been patchy by his lofty standards, but he continues to be a threat at the business end of the Grand Slams. He has continued to defy age - and logic - by producing some extraordinary performances, particularly when he beat Alcaraz in a memorable Australian Open quarter-final in January. "In a sense you're always hunting because you're always going for the titles - in my also privileged position - the records and more history," said Djokovic. "I do feel that I'm always in that position of going for something with the attitude of trying to win rather than trying to defend.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner has cemented his status as one of the dominant forces on the ATP Tour over the past year, but as he returns to Wimbledon, there's still unfinished business. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has had time to reflect on his gut-wrenching defeat to Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros, where he let slip three consecutive championship points. When asked about the biggest hurdle in adapting to grass-court tennis, Sinner was direct in his response. “Movement, for sure, because the movement is the most important part for us tennis players,” Sinner said in Saturday's pre-tournament press conference. “If someone moves well, it means that he is a good player. That's how I see tennis from outside. “You have to cover the spots more, improvise a little bit more on the other sides. It's a very different game style we see on grass.” Last season, just two weeks after falling in the Roland Garros semi-finals, the Italian lifted his first grass-court trophy in Halle. However, his title defence at the German ATP 500 didn't go as planned this year, with Sinner bowing out in the second round to Alexander Bublik. That loss, coupled with his defeat to rival Alcaraz, who now leads Sinner 8-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, might raise doubts over his momentum heading into Wimbledon. We are practising very well,” said Sinner. Halle was a little bit different, because before I haven't had so much time to cut that off. Just privileged to be in this position. Hopefully I can show this also in the match court. I'm just looking forward to going on court and to compete and enjoy the time.” Sinner has plenty of positive memories at the All England Club. “It feels good again after one year coming back here,” said Sinner, who faces countryman Luca Nardi in his opener. I have some good feelings coming here, even though it's a bit different than last year, coming with the win in Halle. I had some time off before coming here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka ended any talk of tension by practicing and dancing together at Wimbledon after their heated Roland Garros final. Sabalenka apologized for her viral post-match remarks, and Gauff made it clear: “We're good.” Rumors of any bad blood between Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka have been greatly exaggerated. The top two players in the PIF WTA Rankings offered proof that all is well between them after heated scenes both during and following their recent Roland Garros final by practicing -- and dancing -- together at Wimbledon on Friday, posting videos on social media. “TikTok dances always had a way of bringing people together,” Sabalenka wrote on Instagram as the two revealed a choreographed clip to “Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)” by C+C Music Factory after a Centre Court practice session. After Gauff came from a set down to defeat Sabalenka for her second Grand Slam title in Paris, Sabalenka's emotional post-match comments -- saying she felt she “lost the match more than Coco won it” -- sparked chatter online and in the media about whether tension existed between the pair. Gauff repeatedly downplayed any notion of a feud, telling ESPN, “She's probably emotional about [the loss], so I'm not going to take it with too much anything, and I hope people give her a bit of slack too.” “I didn't really want to offend her," Sabalenka said. "I was just completely upset with myself, and emotions got over me. "I hope the U.S. media can be easy on me right now.” The sporting scenes were received warmly by fans, and even impressed U.S. Olympic rugby player Ilona Maher. “We need to make one with you,” Sabalenka wrote in response.

Over two hours and 28 minutes, the second- and third-youngest players in the WTA's Top 100 battled in a back-and-forth affair that ultimately concluded with a dramatic 73-minute final frame that saw both sit in winning positions.After falling behind 4-1 to start her maiden final appearance, Eala wrestled momentum back from Joint in the middle of the match despite dropping the first set. She won eight of nine games to not only take the second, but push ahead 2-0 in the third, as she sought to be not only the first Filipina to claim a WTA singles title, but also become the first qualifier to win Eastbourne since Ekaterina Makarova in 2010.From there, Joint won four straight games, but dropped eight consecutive points to bring the score to 4-4 in a blink. Neither player faced a break point from then on, setting the stage for a dramatic final frame in which saw the inexperience of both players, but also their undeniable talent, shine through.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, Djokovic did tune in to watch Alcaraz's historic come-from-behind victory in which he saved three match points before winning a phenomenal final-set tiebreaker. Speaking to Wimbledon's social media channels while practicing against the Spaniard on Centre Court, Djokovic recited the tale of how his son Stefan and wife Jelena were more interested in the match than he was, leaving Alcaraz smiling with joy. Djokovic full of praise for Sinner and Alcaraz showcase“The first part of the match, we spent outside, had lunch. They were very anxious to get back home so they can turn on the TV when the guys were playing. However, once he had gotten a sniff of the quality on show between these two remarkable athletes, he was hooked on to watch. “But the match was so captivating that of course we ended up watching for another few hours. “Incredible match, I gave huge credit to both of them for producing this battle for not just the tennis world but the sports world to enjoy. However, seven-time champion Djokovic will be fancying his chances to push the two younger stars, having reached the final each of the last two years and hungry for a record-setting 25th grand slam title. His campaign begins with a first round match against Frenchman Alexandre Muller. They were very anxious to get back home so they can turn on the TV when the guys were playing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff's olive branch a sign of things on court? Is Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner's dominance of men's tennis about to go up another level? Is the disappearance of line judges going to cause more problems than solutions? She has won tournaments in Brisbane, Miami and Madrid. She is more than 2,000 points ahead of world No. 2 Gauff in the WTA rankings race that counts points won this season. Sabalenka isn't great at losing, just like most champions. She finds it so crushing to lose these matches that while it's happening, while the world is watching, she's visibly miserable. Every champion who loses feels this way, and only some let it out. It makes Sabalenka one of the most compelling players on the tour, because fans — and her rivals' fans — live every moment with her like it's their career on the line. After losing to Gauff at Roland Garros, Sabalenka spoke, first on court and then in her news conference, about how horribly she played. She barely gave any credit to Gauff until after the event. Then they came to Wimbledon and made a TikTok or two. Then Wimbledon posted that on their own social media, which came off more strangely. Should a tournament be casting its top seeds as best friends? Does the tennis world not want more rivalries? She's only won Grand Slams on hard courts, and Wimbledon is the Grand Slam that completes a career, so the pressure is there, but she might be far enough ahead of her rivals for that not to matter. Gauff's forehand grip makes it very difficult for her to win on such a low-bouncing surface. Madison Keys, who beat Sabalenka in Australia, could trouble her. Markéta Vondroušová, a potential third-round opponent, beat Sabalenka in Berlin and has won Wimbledon before. The 2022 champion Elena Rybakina cannot be discounted. Iga Świątek, who uses a similar forehand grip to Gauff, has been making the Bad Homburg grass in Germany her living room this week. And if Sabalenka does make the final, it's more likely than not that said final will be stressful, that she will not play a perfect match, because no one ever does. And if she can't, can she redirect her energy away from the way it manifested in Melbourne, Indian Wells and Paris? Djokovic is an incredible winner — he has 24 Grand Slams. He's also an incredibly gracious loser, in public. That's taken as the thing to be in tennis — even if some needle is good for business and for the sport. Remember what it was like to be a tennis fan this time of year between 2006 and 2008, when Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer contested the final of the French Open and Wimbledon for three consecutive years. It was an incredible rivalry and a testament to their dominance of the sport. Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have now won every Grand Slam since the start of 2024. And if it isn't, can anyone who's going to be contending in three years (that means anyone not named Djokovic) do anything about it? This is the question that Holger Rune, Lorenzo Musetti, Jack Draper, Ben Shelton and some players even younger than them are going to have to start answering. Tennis, meanwhile, might have to get better acquainted with the difference between a player's ceiling and their current peak. Musetti has been in a final at that level. Shelton reserves his best tennis for the majors. He's 18, sure, but Menšík is barely 19 and inside the top 20. How can he be the one and not them, when they have better results? Fonseca is on his way to something like that. He can take rackets out of top-10 players' hands. Just not consistently yet, and he hasn't worked out how to grind reliably when his first plan doesn't work. Menšík and Learner Tien, who Fonseca beat to win the ATP Next Gen Finals last year, are more ready for deeper runs than Fonseca is for now. So is someone coming into disrupt this duopoly anytime soon? Or will Djokovic have to look at the younger generation and realize that, at least for now, he has to do it himself? To use a favorite phrase of Sinner and Alcaraz, “Let's see…” For the first time in the event's 148-year history, it has dispensed with human line judges in favor of ELC, which is used at all ATP Tour-level and combined events and two of the other Grand Slams, but is not immune to glitches. At Eastbourne last Monday, a misleading replay image disagreed with the system's call during a first set tiebreak between Fonseca and Zizou Bergs. Players are overwhelmingly in favour of ELC, because of how it removes doubt and takes away their need to self-officiate. Until this year's Wimbledon, players had to challenge a call they disputed in a timely fashion, meaning that they had to think about their next shot, whether or not to challenge and what their opponent would do on their next shot all at once. If the technology does fail at Wimbledon, then each court will have a couple of match officials to step in, but assuming all goes to plan, players and fans will have to get used to a relatively bare court, with the elegantly dressed line judges who have been such a feature of Wimbledon throughout its long history absent. Will that absence be meaningful at this year's event, or will everyone get used to it very quickly and move on? Only time — and perhaps some dubious calls — will tell. Bubbling away in the background at this year's Wimbledon is the All England Lawn Tennis Club's (AELTC) ongoing legal battle over 39 new grass courts. It wants to construct them, including an 8,000-seat stadium, on the old Wimbledon Park golf course. The Greater London Authority (GLA) granted planning permission at a hearing in September 2024, but after appeals led by the Save Wimbledon Park (SWP) group, a judicial review will take place July 8 and July 9, right in the heart of the tournament's second week. During the hearing, the AELTC and SWP will outline their arguments, with a decision expected a few weeks later. The case is proving to be a major headache for the AELTC, which is desperate to press on with its expansion plans. Not being able to host qualifying on site (and not being able to pull in the revenue that would come with that) sees it, it says, lose ground on the other three majors. At the pre-tournament briefing a couple of weeks ago, Wimbledon chair Debbie Jevans said that the need for the transformation “becomes ever more apparent as we see our fellow Grand Slams staging fully integrated three-week events by welcoming many more spectators and staging charity and community events during the qualifying week and, crucially, providing the players with a stage benefiting their sporting excellence”. It feels like no Grand Slam is complete these days without high-level discussions going on in the background, and this year's Wimbledon will be no different. For only the second time since 2004, there will be no Andy Murray in either the singles or doubles draws. Last year's opening week was dominated by questions of whether he would be healthy enough to compete. On middle Saturday came Emma Raducanu's decision to jilt Murray at the altar of the mixed doubles event, with the Brit needing to rest her wrist for singles competition. It's probably a relief for all involved that there is no major Murray storyline this time around. Last year was a painful end in many respects, and the rest of the event got sucked into a vortex by its gravity. The statue of him, which will arrive on the grounds in time for 2027, will have to do stand in his stead: he is not planning to attend at this time. It will fall to one of the other Brits, like Raducanu and Draper, to step up in his absence. Tell us which storylines you are looking out for in the comments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 French Open men's singles final will forever be etched in tennis history as a classic. However, Jannik Sinner's coach has cast the spotlight on a particular aspect of Carlos Alcaraz's triumph that particularly worked in his favor. There, he overcame a two-set deficit to triumph in a five-set tennis thriller at Roland Garros and deny Sinner the crown in agonizing fashion. And it's a strategy that may prove advantageous in future matches, too. "He was down two sets to zero and needed energy. Given his Spanish roots and the legacy of compatriot Rafael Nadal in Paris, it's not that surprising that Alcaraz has a robust fan base in France. Nevertheless, Vagnozzi offered a gracious perspective and suggested that while the crowd's enthusiasm buoyed Alcaraz, it didn't detract from Sinner's performance. "The truth is that Carlos was very clever in seeking people's support and managed it well, but we cannot use that as a key factor for the outcome. "There are times when playing with people against you can also be good, as extra motivation, and we must not forget that in Rome, Sinner was the one who had most of the support." Players can often be boosted or face courtside opposition depending on crowd support at various venues. And it's generally a given that this back-and-forth is intrinsic to conquering the sport's grandest arenas. Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic's 10 titles at the Australian Open made him a great Down Under. Alcaraz has tasted victory on all but one elite stage, boasting two French Open victories, two Wimbledon triumphs, and a U.S. Open title. However, the Australian Open crown continues to elude his grasp. Sinner, on the other hand, has shown a particular affinity for Melbourne and has won two Australian Open titles, in addition to the U.S. Open trophy he lifted last year. As he gears up for Wimbledon 2025 this week, the young talent knows full well how much sway spectators can have over his performance at the All England Club. However, he can at least hope to win over more of his own supporters on English soil.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prince Louis may not have taken his seat in the royal box at Wimbledon just yet, but he already has a very special connection to the tournament. It was during the 2019 Men's Singles Final that Princess Kate was handed a pair of Adidas Stan Smith trainers by the tennis champion himself. Prince Louis, now seven, has not yet made his public debut at Wimbledon, unlike his older siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte. George, 11, and Charlotte, 10, have been pictured with their parents at the tournament in recent years, enjoying time in the royal box and meeting players. Princess Kate revealed last year that her youngest son has already started learning the sport. She told a Wimbledon ball boy that Louis practices standing like one of them while she plays tennis in the garden. Ball boy Joel, then 16, said: "He tries to practise the standing and staying serious, like us." Kate is known to be passionate about tennis and is the royal patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. She has often been seen at the tournament and was even spotted playing with tennis star Roger Federer in a special clip for Wimbledon's official channel. During a visit to Wimbledon in 2022, Kate revealed: "George is playing. That same year, she attended with George for his very first time, with the pair watching the Men's Final together. Stan Smith, who won Wimbledon in 1972, has become synonymous with the iconic white Adidas trainer that bears his name. Giving a signed pair to Louis was seen as a lovely gesture from one sporting legend to the next generation. It's Royal Ascot week and over on The HELLO! There were no cameras present when the shoes were handed over, but a photo of them circulated online shortly afterwards, showing the sweet personalisation. It seems likely that Louis will eventually attend the tournament alongside his family, especially as he gets older. His cheeky personality and love of sport would no doubt make him a fan favourite on Centre Court. And with George and Charlotte already involved in the sport, it's clear that tennis will continue to play a big role in this royal household.
