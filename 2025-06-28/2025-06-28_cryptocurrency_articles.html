                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins On June 27, 2025, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs witnessed substantial inflows, underscoring a growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency market. Fidelity and BlackRock were among the leading contributors to these inflows. The sustained inflows into these ETFs suggest a growing trust in regulated crypto products. Historically, such inflows have correlated with increased market capitalization and potential price appreciation. This trend is likely to continue as more institutional investors seek regulated avenues for cryptocurrency investment. Institutional players are expressing growing interest in regulated crypto products, which bolsters overall market stability. Looking ahead, the future may see increased demand for regulated investment products, with elevated attention on market dynamics and digital asset infrastructures. As inflows escalate, expectations center on innovative investment avenues that support growing institutional share. The trend of institutional adoption is accelerating, with nearly $50 billion flowing into Bitcoin ETFs since their January launch and Ethereum funds beginning to see strong traction. This signals that crypto is steadily becoming part of mainstream investment portfolios, driven by the confidence and trust of top-tier asset managers in regulated crypto products.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robinhood (HOOD) has introduced micro futures on bitcoin BTC$107,291.78, solana SOL$151.09 and XRP in the United States., expanding its existing crypto futures offering for its nearly 26 million funded accounts. Micro contracts need far less collateral than full-size futures, letting traders take directional positions while committing a smaller slice of capital. The contracts offer traders more flexibility to bet on a cryptocurrency's future price direction or hedge current positions given their smaller size. The launch rounds out a futures suite that began with BTC and ETH in January. It also comes weeks after the firm closed its $200 million purchase of Bitstamp and finalized a $179 million deal for Canada's WonderFi. Robinhood's data shows that crypto notional volumes have exploded upward over time, reaching $11.7 billion in May. The figure marks a 36% rise month-over-month, and a 65% growth year-over-year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin is becoming more than just a store of value for retail investors. For institutional players like Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, it's becoming a core part of the corporate finance playbook. The Canadian-listed company has just completed the first phase of its Bitcoin acquisition strategy—one that could signal a new era of Bitcoin-denominated financial services. Bitcoin's price was around CAD$146,500 when the purchase was made and the total value of BTC Treasury's stash is now worth past CAD$113 million (~USD$82.5 million). This makes the company's Bitcoin per Share (BPS) value to be around 0.0000634 when calculated on a Fully Diluted (FD) basis excluding warrants. This brash early accumulation is a clear indication of Bitcoin Treasury's core belief: Bitcoin is not simply an asset but a foundational pillar of its treasury model. That is, it can lend, be a counterpart funder and provide capital access to institutional players from its BTC holdings, all in a native way that traditional treasuries would lend their cash out through bonds or credit lines.

BTC Treasuries adds to a growing list of major companies trying their luck with Bitcoin as part of their business offering. While firms like MicroStrategy and Block Inc. receive much of the fanfare for their bullish BTC holdings, smaller and mid-cap organizations like BTC Treasury are quietly drafting models that don't revolve around price speculation. Bitcoin Treasury is taking a different approach, deliberately targeting Bitcoin-native services. It's also part of a larger trend in which Bitcoin is not simply digital gold — it is also becoming a form of digital capital. BTC Treasury underlined the institutional-grade nature of its custodial solution, compliance monitoring, and asset protection. The company is overseen in Canada and trades on the TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV), which holds it to strict public disclosure and auditing regimens. This is a departure from crypto's early days, when corporate BTC holdings were criticized for a lack of structure or governance. By building around regulated norms, BTC Treasury aims to attract institutional counterparties in need of secure, professional-grade Bitcoin services. Bitcoin Treasury Corporation's announcement was met with moderate interest on Canadian markets, but industry analysts say this could represent a larger institutional trend. If BTC Treasury executes successfully, it may serve as a model for a new class of Bitcoin-native financial institutions: small-cap firms that don't just own Bitcoin—but build on top of it.

With Immutable's (IMX) volume topping $34.9 million, driven by hits like Guild of Guardians, the token has rebounded slightly off recent lows. However, declining active wallet engagement and a sharp increase in IMX token supply on exchanges cast shadows over the rally. For now, bulls are eyeing a possible 98% surge toward the pattern's neckline at $0.8100—if support holds. CryptoSlam data shows that Immutable has become the biggest player in the NFT space, flipping popular chains like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Mythos. Immutable's Guild of Guardians Heroes saw sales jump by 21% to over $20 million. It dropped to the important support at $0.3458, its lowest point since April. This pattern comprises two swings and a neckline, which is at $0.8100.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With strong growth and the Layer 2 blockchain ecosystem, Little Pepe is quickly becoming more popular than big meme coins like SHIB and PEPE. As SHIB and PEPE continue to ride their wave of past successes, $LILPEPE is defining a new trajectory: a meme coin supported by real infrastructure, scalability, and low transaction cost. What makes $LILPEPE truly stand out is its use of Layer 2 blockchain technology. The integration of an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible protocol ensures seamless interoperability which in turn opens up a broad spectrum of use cases for $LILPEPE, ranging from decentralized finance to meme-themed marketplaces – all within an ecosystem designed to be both fun and functional. Unlike SHIB and PEPE, which exist primarily as speculative tokens, $LILPEPE serves as the meme token of a fully operational network focused on four core technical pillars: meme culture integration, ultra-low transaction fees, enhanced security protocols, and fast finality. $LILPEPE is the native token of Little Pepe and is built on the ERC-20 standard with a total supply of 100 billion tokens. The project has already raised over $2.6M so far in its ongoing $LILPEPE presale and is gaining unstoppable momentum. However, both SHIB and PEPE saw their most explosive growth after listings and viral moments but LILPEPE is attracting serious capital even before hitting major exchanges. Additional allocations include 13.5% for staking rewards and community incentives, 10% each for marketing initiatives, liquidity provision, and centralized exchange reserves. This distribution model prioritizes operational sustainability and community rewards over team allocations. The project has undergone a comprehensive smart contract audit covering; The $LILPEPE token offers real utility within a growing Layer 2 ecosystem, giving it long-term viability that meme projects often lack. Investors aren't just buying into hype; they're positioning themselves within an ecosystem with ambitious goals and solid technological developments. Little Pepe project leans into meme culture while giving it a technological upgrade. Where old meme coins were seen as short-term pumps, $LILPEPE is setting the stage for lasting relevance. Its developers envision a digital realm where memes don't just entertain- they empower. In this new meme-powered kingdom, $LILPEPE is more than a cryptocurrency. Little Pepe is a next-gen Layer 2 blockchain designed to blend the meme culture with high-speed, low-cost decentralized infrastructure. The project's mission is to create a meme coin environment wherein utility meets virality, empowering users through cutting-edge technology and lightning-fast transactions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pepe NFT projects linked to original Pepe the Frog creator Matt Furie have suffered a devastating cyberattack, reportedly orchestrated by North Korean hackers. 1/  Multiple projects tied to Pepe creator Matt Furie & ChainSaw as well as another project Favrr were exploited in the past week which resulted in ~$1M stolenMy analysis links both attacks to the same cluster of DPRK IT workers who were likely accidentally hired as developers. While Furie has publicly distanced himself from the meme coin movement that adopted his artwork without consent, he recently sought to enter the NFT space on his terms. However, according to leading blockchain investigator ZachXBT, that partnership turned disastrous after Chainsaw inadvertently hired a North Korean operative for a key IT role. The hacker, posing as a legitimate candidate, was granted back-end access. The same hacker repeated this attack on three other Chainsaw-backed NFT collections, ultimately draining around $310,000. This time, the infiltrator had been hired as Favrr's Chief Technology Officer, highlighting a severe lack of background checks and basic operational security. 10/ DPRK ITW consolidation 0x477 received payroll from the project Favrr which was exploited for $680K+ on June 25, 2025I suspect they have a second ITW on payroll as well because the exploiter address is tied to a Gate deposit address 0xab7 which ITW 2 sent payroll to. 8/ Other indicators revealed from internal logs point out irregularities in a suspected DPRK IT workers resume. Why would a developer who claims to be living in the US have a Korean language setting, Astral VPN usage, and have an Asia/Russia time zone? Chainsaw briefly posted a warning to its social media channels before deleting it. In contrast, Favrr has at least acknowledged the breach publicly. This series of attacks not only underscores the growing threat of state-sponsored crypto crime but also serves as a wake-up call to NFT creators and blockchain firms. In an increasingly high-stakes environment, basic due diligence, robust hiring practices, and multi-layered security protocols are no longer optional; they are essential.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin briefly climbed back above $100,000 this month, pushing close to the $108,000 level before a new pullback. According to on-chain data, late-June's volume on Bitcoin futures stayed high as prices marched upward. Funding rates and the three-month futures basis both moved lower, signaling less bullish conviction. In other words, fewer people were making big, long bets on Bitcoin these days. At its $111,910 peak in May, daily spot volume hovered around $7.65 billion. That's well below the previous cycle highs, which topped $20 billion on some days. This week saw Michael Saylor's Strategy, Metaplanet and ProCap BTC together pick up about $1 billion worth of Bitcoin. At the same time, US-listed Bitcoin ETFs bought over $1.5 billion in fresh supply. Those steady purchases hint at genuine interest from institutions, even if short-term traders set the pace recently. Glassnode now shows just 7 million BTC left freely available on exchanges. Roughly 14 million BTC are held by people who haven't moved their coins in ages. That supply squeeze could support prices if demand holds up. But it also means any sudden sell-off might hit hard when exchange wallets run low. Yet, the ongoing buying by big companies and ETFs offers a buffer. If they keep at it, Bitcoin may need a breather now but could rally again later. Market watchers will be looking for a return of fresh spot demand or a stabilizing of futures bets before declaring the uptrend back on solid ground.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this video interview, Goldi explains why stablecoins are more than a buzzword—they're ‘another payments rail… an infrastructure upgrade to whatever it is we have today'. Fireblocks now works with 300+ payment firms worldwide, and its latest survey shows 90 % of 300 financial institutions are already strategising, running POCs, or rolling out stablecoin solutions. Regulatory anxiety has plummeted, with concerns dropping from 84 % two years ago to just 18 % today. Goldi's guidance for newcomers is blunt: ‘First of all, don't believe the hype… If you go on LinkedIn today, it seems like stablecoins maybe can cure cancer, right? He recommends a staged path ‘from crypto‑remote to crypto‑inside', starting with trusted partners and gradually bringing the infrastructure in‑house. Beyond speed and savings, programmability is the real game‑changer: ‘We can say, only move my dollars to Mexican pesos if the rate is underneath that specific rate. The panel Goldi joined at Money 20/20 concluded that every company needs a stablecoin strategy. Remote.com already pays 1 % of its global freelancers in stablecoins—and wishes the figure were higher—while shielding users from the technical jargon of USDC vs USDT. Watch the full interview to hear exactly how stablecoins are reshaping cross‑border payments, B2B flows, and corporate treasuries—and what your first steps should be. Ran Goldi is the SVP of Payments and Network at Fireblocks, where he drives blockchain-powered payment solutions. Previously, he was CEO of First Digital, a stablecoin and CBDC payment firm acquired by Fireblocks. He co-founded an algorithmic trading company, led IT investments for a private equity fund, and served as a VP at a London Stock Exchange-listed firm. Fireblocks is the most trusted digital asset infrastructure provider, enabling businesses to build, run, and scale on the blockchain. With best-in-class security and a seamless platform, Fireblocks supports custody, tokenization, payments, and settlement for over 2,000 organisations—including BNY Mellon, Galaxy, and Revolut—securing USD 10+ trillion in transactions across 100+ blockchains.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrency traders such as Mohammed Arsalan are prepared to watch their online assets expand and explode if they miss the right moment, making or breaking their fortunes in just minutes. All in a day's work on the internet. Offline, though, they have found themselves less equipped for the consequences of affluence. Arsalan grew up working class in Karachi, Pakistan. At 14, he started a business exporting T-shirts overseas. Inside, online and penniless, the booming world of Bitcoin beckoned him. His phone didn't have enough storage to keep the videos, so he'd upload them onto Facebook groups. Arsalan says he went from $24 to $340,000 in five years. “It's the only business that accepted me when I was poor.” They darted through checkpoints with ease, driving further away from Karachi and into the night. With a gun to his temple, Arsalan was ordered to take out his phone, reset its passwords, and hand it over. Once home, Arsalan ran to the computer and opened his Binance wallet. “After this case, I will not trust anyone.” Arsalan's abduction is not an isolated event; kidnappings of cryptocurrency industry figures have surged in the past 18 months. This year, a single French gang cut off the finger of an entrepreneur, doused an influencer's father in gasoline and tried to snatch a CEO's daughter from the streets of Paris, according to French police. An Italian investor was tortured with a chainsaw and taser for weeks in a New York City townhouse, local police said. The value stored within these digital vaults is soaring. Cryptocurrency has long suffered from sophisticated and devastating digital attacks. Now, however, thefts are manifesting in the offline world, too. “In five minutes, you can find someone's address. Navigating an increasingly dangerous offline world, the industry is on edge, feeling as though securing their empires now falls to them as law enforcement struggles to keep up. Building one's fortunes on blockchains entails novel risks. Firstly, blockchains, the technology on which cryptocurrency is based, create public ledgers, so balances and transactions are visible. Other times, they will hack exchanges to access personal data, as was the case last month, when Coinbase support agents in India were bribed to leak the data of 70,000 users. “A lot of these [crypto] guys thought they were moving around in silence. But, people are now able to find out that they are actually some of the richest guys in their cities,” says says a US-based founder and trader, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Secondly, transactions are instant and permission-less – kidnappers don't need a bank to approve their withdrawal. This can also make looted funds easier to hide. Assets are swiftly sent to various decentralized exchanges, which do not require know-your-customer information. Once there, funds can't be frozen by centralized entities like Binance or Coinbase. In Karachi, Arsalan's kidnappers were found within 48 hours. Following the attack, Arsalan was offered protection from three other officers and a police car. But, fearing this could actually endanger him further, he declined. For many of crypto's kings and queens, unfettered access to one's money via blockchains can feel buffered from institutional corruption. “There is no justice in Pakistan if you're poor,” says Arsalan. This means taking matters into their own hands – or a pair they've hired. “I used to like my space away from my [bodyguards], but now I want them closer,” says the anonymous US-based founder and trader, who doesn't reveal his security arrangements to anyone, even his close circle. Half of these guys are scammers,” he says. Over the past month or so, his two guards have not left his sight – even for walks around the block. Over the past six months, Jethro Pijlman's global security services firm, Infinite Risks International, has seen a rise in cryptocurrency investors from western cities wanting protection. Requests range from safeguarding team meetings to guarding entire families around the clock. Paris leads when it comes to new requests, says Pijlman, as France emerges as a hotspot for attacks, particularly after the high-profile kidnapping in January of David Balland, the entrepreneur whose finger was severed. In mid-June, an investor was abducted from a Paris suburb, while his partner was ordered to deposit the key to his cryptocurrency account. A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives It will feature the “most comprehensive security effort in the event's history”, conference organizers said in a statement. Prepping security began almost a year ago, taking three times longer than usual, according to Bettina Boon Falleur, head of EthCC. Companies are also taking measures to protect their staff. Kraken, the second-largest exchange in the US, has deployed armed guards to accompany its top executives at all times, including outside their homes, according to a source familiar with the matter. Liu says his company is evaluating hiring a team of bodyguards for trips. His company has also introduced a new rule when the team goes to conferences: no posting until after the event. “Many crypto investors are increasingly conscious of their exposure, especially after publicly sharing – or oversharing – details of their success and affluent lifestyles online,” says Pijlman in regards to his clients. Indeed, for an industry that's chronically online, its titans have often built large social media followings, while their wealth stays encrypted in anonymous blockchains. For Arsalan, he watched his savings be chopped up and sprinkled across the cryptographic abyss. Over the next four months, he fell into a deep depression. He went offline and relied on whatever handouts his father could afford to give him. Between 2020 and 2023, a Florida-based gang accessed the personal data of everyday cryptocurrency investors, and were able to steal from their wallets remotely. Another man was abducted and found 120 miles from his home. Two of the attacks targeted seniors, court documents show. “I always dreamed of having a good retirement. They'd hoped to take one last trip together – “to have at least some good years, good times”, she said. The couple lost $3m in cryptocurrency at 2022 prices via wire fraud. Wanting more, the gang invaded their home and held them at gunpoint to claim whatever was left. “One whole life of savings and you just took it all,” she said. Despite the burgeoning risks, only 10% of cryptocurrency holders across the world have coverage on their digital assets, according to a report by insurance firm GlobalData. Glenn Morgan, SVP, head of digital assets at Aon, says he's seen an increase in clients asking about coverage in recent months. Amid the surge, insurers may be on the eve of a windfall: last month NBC News reported that three crypto-specific insurance companies are working on K&R policies. From the moment Arsalan checked his balance, he knew any chance of recovery would fall to him. Without the help of law enforcement, he's been able to trace and recover about $160,000 of cryptocurrency, while the police have seized $60,000 in cash and a luxury car. It's all now held by local police as case property. He thinks it'll be at least six years before it's returned to him, given the pace of Pakistan's courts. He says seven people have reached out to him with similar ordeals they didn't report. Trading digital assets in Pakistan is a legal gray area, as banks are forbidden from facilitating transactions. When asked why they targeted crypto traders, the kidnappers said they thought victims wouldn't have legal recourse, according to Arsalan. He wants to rebuild within a year: “They grabbed my money but they did not grab my brain.” He's also returned to social media, posting his first video in May. No amount of threats will make him give up crypto, he says. Despite all of its risks, public ledgers still feel safer to him than institutions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has soared toward its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, with traders betting a looming Federal Reserve flip will turbo-charge the crypto market. In-kind redemptions for the bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have taken Wall Street by storm over the last 18 months could be coming soon, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Hester Peirce. “I can't prejudge, but we hear that there's a lot of interest,” Peirce, who heads up the SEC's crypto task force, said on stage at a Bitcoin Policy Institute event, adding that in kind bitcoin and crypto ETFs are now “on the horizon.” Earlier this year, BlackRock, which has dominated the spot bitcoin ETF market with its $75 billion IBIT fund, asked the SEC to permit in-kind creations and redemptions for bitcoin ETFs, instead of having to use cash, with the likes of Fidelity and other smaller bitcoin and crypto ETF providers following suit. "Those (forms) are going through the process now," Peirce said. BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street's campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024 that now hold 1.4 million bitcoin worth $152 billion. Meanwhile, the combined bitcoin price and crypto market is on the verge of a “turning point” as it hits $3.4 trillion, according to one analyst. “The $3.4 trillion to 3.55 trillion range is a turning point, which has activated sellers and prevented the market from consolidating higher,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, said in emailed comments. Over the past couple of days, we have seen a smooth but steady intraday uptrend, accompanied by heavy buying from medium—and long-term investors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BlackRock just made headlines by flipping the script: its spot Bitcoin ETF, iBIT, is now generating more fee revenue than its own S&P 500 ETF, IVV. As institutional interest expands, the best altcoins with real potential could be next in line. In a development few could have predicted a year ago, BlackRock's iBIT ETF is now generating $186M in annual fees – surpassing the $183M earned by its S&P 500 ETF, IVV. That's not just a win for Bitcoin – it's a bold signal that institutional interest in crypto is growing rapidly and with conviction. With billions in capital at stake, traditional finance is no longer ignoring digital assets. New crypto projects that show promise, utility, and strong community backing may soon attract serious attention from the same institutional investors who once wouldn't touch crypto at all. At the core of its ecosystem, $BEST unlocks real benefits: reduced transaction fees, early access to new crypto projects, higher staking rewards, and exclusive perks through iGaming partnerships. It also enables access to Upcoming Tokens – a secure, in-app crypto presale hub that helps users dodge scam sites and buy early, safely. The wallet is powered by Fireblocks' MPC-CMP tech, giving users full control without compromising safety. So far, $BEST has raised $13.6 million in its presale phase, with the current price sitting at just $0.025245. It's still early, but clearly not under the radar, especially with forecasts predicting a potential high of $0.072 in 2025 and up to $0.82 by 2030. Built as the first AI-powered content and monetization platform, $SUBBD empowers creators to generate income directly from their audience while automating the behind-the-scenes work that usually eats up their time (and profits). Creators get an AI assistant to handle chat, editing, scheduling, and monetization. Fans can interact via AI-generated photos, videos, and avatars – all approved by the original influencer. Payments are instant, low-fee, and borderless, with crypto or fiat options. With $702K raised and $SUBBD currently priced at $0.055775, it's still early – but not unproven. If Wall Street's next bet is on the creator economy, $SUBBD may be one of the few projects that actually understands what Gen Z wants, and how to monetize it. $ONDO is the token behind Ondo Finance, a project that's bringing traditional assets like U.S. Treasuries onto the blockchain in a way that institutions can actually get behind. Holding $ONDO gives you a say in how the project evolves, including decisions around new products and the development of Ondo Chain – their own upcoming Layer 1 blockchain. One of Ondo Finance's standout products is $OUSG – a token that gives accredited investors access to short-term U.S. Treasuries, with 24/7 minting and redeeming via RLUSD (Ripple's USD-backed stablecoin). As institutions look beyond Bitcoin for yield and stability, $ONDO is well-positioned to be part of that next move. If BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF success proves anything, it's that institutions are diving into crypto. As Wall Street looks beyond Bitcoin, projects like Best Wallet Token, SUBBD Token, and Ondo Finance offer real utility – from DeFi access to creator monetization to tokenized Treasuries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vitalik Buterin warns that single digital IDs could erode pseudonymity, proposing pluralistic systems to safeguard privacy and fair access. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has introduced a new kind of digital identity system dubbed “pluralistic identity,” arguing it could protect privacy while enabling fair participation in digital life. In a blog post published Sunday, Buterin explored the promise and pitfalls of zero-knowledge (ZK) proof-wrapped IDs, warning that even privacy-preserving systems can carry serious risks if they rigidly enforce one identity per person. The Ethereum (ETH) mastermind noted that many new digital ID projects use zero-knowledge proofs to let users prove they have a valid ID without revealing personal details. “ZK-wrapping solves a lot of important problems,” he wrote, but warned that “ZK-wrapped ID still has risks,” especially because enforcing one ID per person can undermine pseudonymity and expose users to coercion. One key risk Buterin identified is that platforms could force users into a single, trackable identity, eliminating the ability to maintain separate pseudonymous profiles. “In the real world, pseudonymity generally requires having multiple accounts,” he said. Without this flexibility, he argued, users could find themselves in a world where “all of your activity must de-facto be under a single public identity,” heightening dangers from government or employer surveillance. Buterin also rejected the idea of using “proof of wealth” alone as an anti-Sybil measure, saying it excludes people unable to pay and concentrates power among the wealthy. He explained these could be explicit, using social-graph-based verification like Circles, or implicit, relying on multiple ID providers — government documents, social platforms, and others — so no one ID gains near-total market share. “Any form of pluralistic identity… is naturally more error-tolerant,” he noted, pointing out that this flexibility helps stateless individuals or those unable to access traditional IDs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Bitcoin continues to capture the spotlight, a fresh wave of altcoins is quietly preparing to lead the next market surge. Among these emerging projects, one stands out for its unique vision and potential: Qubetics ($TICS). This blockchain protocol is making waves, especially in regions like Central Asia, where privacy and digital autonomy are at risk. Qubetics is tackling challenges that have stymied traditional solutions, offering practical tools like a decentralized VPN and real-world asset tokenization marketplaces. Let's explore these standout projects and examine why they're set to outperform expectations. Positioned as a solution for decentralized privacy and real-world asset tokenization, the protocol addresses the critical needs of regions where digital autonomy is being suppressed. Through its decentralized VPN, Qubetics is providing a secure alternative to traditional methods of accessing the internet in areas with heavy surveillance, such as Central Asia. Qubetics' roadmap, which focuses on community governance and practical applications like the decentralized VPN, has captured the attention of analysts, with many forecasting a price surge post-listing. Given its robust tokenomics and community-first approach, it is increasingly seen as a frontrunner for those seeking the best altcoins for next bull run. Qubetics ($TICS) has officially locked in its public listing on a top 10 global exchange. The trading launch is set for June 30 at 11 AM UTC, following the close of its final presale stage at 8 AM UTC that same morning. With a presale price of $0.3370 and listing set at $0.40, time is running out for early access. This announcement adds to growing excitement around Qubetics' deflationary model and real-world asset tokenization platform. Market analysts now estimate potential growth to $10–$15 in the coming cycle. It offers real-world use cases in critical regions, and its top crypto presale success and limited token supply make it a compelling choice for the Best Altcoins for Next Bull Run. Known for its faster transaction speeds and lower fees, Litecoin has cemented its place as a top alternative to Bitcoin for both everyday transactions and larger-scale applications. Recently, Litecoin has experienced a resurgence, driven by its integration into the growing world of decentralized finance (DeFi).

The Cosmos SDK has allowed developers to create independent blockchains that can communicate and transact with each other, addressing a fundamental flaw in blockchain scalability and adoption. Cosmos' ability to solve blockchain interoperability challenges places it at the forefront of decentralized finance and blockchain infrastructure, earning it a spot among the best altcoins for next bull run. In recent months, AAVE has introduced several upgrades, including the launch of Aave V3, which brings improved liquidity, gas optimization, and cross-chain capabilities. AAVE's role in the decentralized lending ecosystem, combined with its continued evolution, positions it as one of the Best Altcoins for Next Bull Run. AAVE's innovative approach to decentralized lending and its continuous platform upgrades make it a standout in the DeFi sector, ensuring its place as one of the best altcoins for next bull run. Immutable X is a leading platform for building and scaling non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces. With a focus on high-speed transactions and zero gas fees, Immutable X has gained significant attention from both developers and NFT creators. The platform's commitment to sustainability through carbon-neutral NFTs has also helped it stand out in a crowded space. Immutable X is now home to several major projects, including top-tier gaming titles and NFT collections, further solidifying its place in the growing NFT ecosystem. Immutable X's unique approach to scaling NFTs with gas-free transactions, combined with its growing ecosystem, makes it one of the best altcoins for next bull run. The platform allows users to share their spare bandwidth and computing resources in exchange for rewards, making video streaming more efficient and cost-effective. Recently, Theta has expanded its ecosystem by partnering with major media companies and integrating with decentralized applications (dApps) on its network. Theta's innovative approach to decentralized streaming and its growing partnerships within the media industry make it a prime contender for the best altcoins for next bull run.
