                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People in the earliest stage of Alzheimer's disease begin to experience some mild cognitive impairment that may affect their memory and ability to complete tasks and communicate. Past studies show that detecting Alzheimer's disease in its earliest stage allows currently available medications and lifestyle changes to be more effective in helping to slow down disease progression. “Current tools can diagnose the disease, but they don't always predict how fast it will progress. Identifying individuals at higher risk of rapid decline [c]ould allow for timely, targeted interventions during a critical window when the disease could be still responsive to treatment or changes in (lifestyle),” she said. Gumina is part of the research team for a study recently presented at the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress 2025 that has identified a simple blood test used to measure insulin resistance that may also help doctors determine which people with early stage Alzheimer's disease are most likely to experience rapid cognitive decline. For this study, researchers analyzed medical records from 315 adults with an average age of about 70 that did not have diabetes. (It is) easy to calculate and already available in routine labs.” At the study's conclusion, the research team found that when grouping study participants by their TyG index results, those in the highest TyG index group experienced a quicker deterioration in cognitive decline than those with lower TyG index results. Patients in this early phase with high TyG levels had a fourfold increased risk of rapid cognitive decline compared to those with lower TyG levels. “The TyG index is a low-cost, widely available tool that could be easily integrated into routine clinical practice to flag patients at higher risk of rapid decline,” she continued. “By identifying these individuals early, clinicians could prioritize them for closer monitoring, lifestyle interventions, or even enrollment in clinical trials, maybe individualizing sub phenotypes of the disease. Aziz commented that he thought this was a very interesting study involving a new variable to consider when working with patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's dementia, especially as it may predict who is likely to decline faster. Clinically, it helps us identify patients who need more intensive monitoring and earlier intervention.” “With new disease-modifying treatments like aducanumab and lecanemab becoming available — treatments that carry real risks including brain swelling and bleeding — we urgently need better ways to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from aggressive treatment versus those who might have slower progression,” Aziz continued. “This metabolic marker could help us personalize the risk-benefit calculation for each patient, ensuring we're offering these powerful but potentially risky therapies to those who need them most while protecting slower-progressing patients from unnecessary exposure.”— Rehan Aziz, MD Aziz said he'd like to see this study's results validated in larger populations. Gliebus commented that he found the study both fascinating and highly applicable to daily clinical practice. '— and we often don't have a definitive answer,” he explained. “Early-stage Alzheimer's, especially during the mild cognitive impairment stage, exhibits significant variability-some individuals remain stable for years, while others decline rapidly. Identifying those at higher risk of swift decline enables us to customize clinical care and research strategies. It also helps families set clearer expectations and facilitates early, potentially more effective interventions, whether through lifestyle changes, medications or future planning.” — Peter Gliebus, MD “As new treatments are developed, timing and patient stratification will be essential — tools like the TyG index may play a crucial role in that process,” he added. A new contender for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, lecanemab, may soon be on the market, but what does it really do, and how much promise does… This podcast episode examines two studies that assess the impact type 2 diabetes has on brain health and explores three lifestyle interventions that…</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SAGO has advanced the understanding of the origins of COVID-19, but as they say in their report, much of the information needed to evaluate fully all hypotheses has not been provided. I thank each of the 27 members of SAGO for dedicating their time and expertise to this very important scientific undertaking over more than three years. As things stand, all hypotheses must remain on the table, including zoonotic spillover and lab leak. We continue to appeal to China and any other country that has information about the origins of COVID-19 to share that information openly, in the interests of protecting the world from future pandemics." In its report, SAGO considered available evidence for the main hypotheses for the origins of COVID-19 and concluded that "the weight of available evidence…suggests zoonotic spillover…either directly from bats or through an intermediate host." WHO requested that China share hundreds of genetic sequences from individuals with COVID-19 early in the pandemic, more detailed information about the animals sold at markets in Wuhan, and information on work done and biosafety conditions at laboratories in Wuhan. To date, China has not shared this information either with SAGO or WHO. SAGO published its initial findings and recommendations in a report on 9 June 2022. SAGO convened in various formats 52 times, conducted briefings with researchers, academics, journalists, and others. "As the report says, this is not solely a scientific endeavor, it is a moral and ethical imperative," said Dr. Marietjie Venter, Chair of the group and Distinguished Professor and One Health Research Chair in Vaccines and Surveillance for Emerging viral threats at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. At a Special Session of the World Health Assembly in late 2020, WHO Member States adopted a resolution asking WHO to study the origins of SARS-CoV-2. WHO welcomes any further evidence on the origins of COVID-19, and SAGO remains committed to reviewing any new information should it become available.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of scientists at the MRC Laboratory of Medical Sciences (LMS) has uncovered a previously unknown mechanism that controls how genes are switched ‘on' and ‘off' during embryonic development. Published today in Developmental Cell, their study sheds light on how diverse cell types are produced in developing embryos. All cells contain the same DNA but must turn specific genes 'on' and 'off' – a process known as gene expression – to create different body parts. The duration of Cdx2 expression helps to determine where and when a cell produces spinal cord progenitors. The researchers wanted to understand what processes control this brief window. The team discovered a DNA element they termed an 'attenuator', which reduces gene expression in a time and cell type-specific manner – unlike enhancers or silencers, other types of DNA elements that broadly switch genes on or off. By altering this element, they could tune how long or how strongly Cdx2 was expressed, effectively acting like a 'genetic dimmer switch'. This breakthrough paves the way towards programmable gene expression, offering the ability to precisely control gene activity in space and time. The findings not only deepen our understanding of developmental biology but may inform new therapeutic strategies targeting the non-coding genome. Such approaches could one day enable treatments that selectively adjust gene expression in specific tissues, with implications for diseases caused by gene misregulation. Vicki emphasized the potential: "We're excited because previous research suggests that our genome may harbour many different types of elements that finely tune gene expression, but they've not been easy to identify. If we can address this challenge, this holds enormous potential for unlocking new ways to treat diseases by fine-tuning gene expression where and when it's needed." The study, funded by Wellcome, with support from the Medical Research Council, adds to a growing body of work exploring how non-coding DNA governs gene regulation – an area with profound implications for medicine, from designing new gene therapies to improving treatments. A dual enhancer-attenuator element ensures transient Cdx2 expression during mouse posterior body formation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emergency department (ED) presentations are associated with higher cancer mortality. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, frequency, and risk factors in Australian patients diagnosed with malignant skin cancers. This data-linkage cohort study examined adult patients presenting to the ED at the Royal Melbourne and Western Health hospitals within 12 months of a malignant skin cancer diagnosis. Multivariable logistic and Poisson regressions were used to analyze factors influencing the prevalence and frequency of ED presentations. A total of 3,873 patients were diagnosed with skin malignancies between 2010 and 2018, of which 631 were diagnosed with melanoma. Other preferred languages and cancer treatment experience were also risk factors in the sub-cohort with melanoma. This study provides the first prevalence and frequency data on post-diagnosis ED presentations in patients with skin malignancies, including melanoma. Notably, male patients, those of older age, individuals with both lower and higher SES levels, those primarily speaking a language other than English, and those undergoing systemic therapy or radiotherapy, had a higher risk of ED presentation within 12 months after their skin cancer diagnosis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To overcome the inherent challenge of translation termination interference caused by stop codon reprogramming in mammalian cells, researchers from Peking University led by Chen Peng from College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering and Yi Chengqi from School of Life Sciences have developed a novel codon expansion strategy that enables precise incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) without perturbing natural genetic codes. This innovative approach utilizes post-transcriptionally modified RNA codons-distinct from all 64 standard genetic codons-within targeted transcripts to encode ncAAs in mammalian systems. This work establishes a versatile platform for expanding the genetic code in mammalian cells, paving the way for advanced protein engineering and functional studies in complex biological systems. These findings were published in Nature on June 25, 2025, under the title "RNA codon expansion via programmable pseudouridine editing and decoding." The site-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) provides new opportunities to tailor protein functions with custom chemistries. Traditional genetic code expansion (GCE) strategies achieve ncAA incorporation by reassigning stop codons as "blank" codons, which is not fully orthogonal to endogenous translation termination, limiting its precision and scope in cellular contexts. This RCE method utilizes bio-orthogonally assigned pseudouridine-modified codons (ΨCodons: ΨGA, ΨAA, or ΨAG) at designated mRNA transcripts for ncAA incorporation in mammalian cells. The RCE platform integrates a programmable guide RNA, an engineered decoder tRNA, and a specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to achieve highly selective decoding of ΨCodons. These advances establish a robust strategy that employs pseudouridine as a post-transcriptional "letter," creating new RNA codons for targeted protein engineering and expanding the genetic code in eukaryotic systems. In this study, researchers established an RNA codon expansion (RCE) platform to assign pseudouridine (Ψ)-modified RNA codons (ΨCodons: ΨGA, ΨAA, ΨAG) as novel "blank" codons for non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) incorporation in mammalian cells, independent of endogenous codon usage. The RCE system is comprised of three essential components: a programmable guide RNA for targeted ΨCodon installation, a specifically engineered decoder tRNA ((ΨGA)-tRNAPyl, (ΨAA)-tRNAPyl, or (ΨAG)-tRNAPyl) for ΨCodon recognition, and a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for decoding. Each decoder tRNA demonstrated a strong preference for its corresponding ΨCodon over native codons, ensuring orthogonality within the mammalian translatome. Ribosome profiling and proteomic analyses revealed that RCE(ΨGA) achieves high specificity for ncAA incorporation, while preserving the endogenous UGA stop codon, which constitutes approximately 52% of stop codons in the human genome. Furthermore, the three ΨCodon–decoder tRNA pairs were shown to be mutually orthogonal, enabling the site-specific incorporation of multiple ncAAs with distinct side chains into mammalian proteins. Importantly, the RCE platform was also compatible with conventional GCE systems, allowing for dual ncAA incorporation within single cells. - The RCE system enables programmable encoding and decoding of modified RNA codons, achieving high translatome-wide specificity for ncAA incorporation and minimizing disruption to endogenous translation termination. This study establishes RCE as a robust and versatile platform for programmable genetic code expansion in eukaryotic systems, enabling precise site-specific protein modification and functional studies in complex biological settings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), one of two major forms of esophageal cancer, is the sixth most deadly cancer worldwide for which no effective targeted therapy exists. Patients need to rely on chemotherapy as a standard-of-care, which is started ahead of surgical interventions as a so-called "neoadjuvant chemotherapy" (NACT) in the hope to shrink or control tumors. Given the utter lack of therapeutic alternatives, responders and non-responders alike, continue to receive one of the available chemotherapies without knowing whether it will work. Even in responders, the chemotherapy of choice may not completely stop their tumors from progressing and metastasizing, and it can have toxic side effects on the body. Researchers had grown so-called "organoids" from biopsied EAC cells, which are 3D esophageal mini-organs formed with tissue-specific stem cells that exhibit critical features of the esophageal epithelial lining. However, these lack important components of a patient's specific tumor microenvironment (TME), such as the stromal fibroblasts and collagen fibers, and thus, they do not show the same responses to NACT as actual tumors. Now, a research collaboration led by Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., Founding Director at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University and Lorenzo Ferri, M.D., who heads the Division of Thoracic and Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery at the McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, has advanced a personalized medicine solution with the potential to improve chemotherapy for EAC patients. Since the approach can produce results within 12 days from starting the model, it enables the rapid stratification of EAC patients into responders and non-responders, and investigation of non-standard NACTs based on different chemotherapy agents for resistant patients in a clinically useful timeframe. The findings are reported in Journal of Translational Medicine. This patient-centered approach strongly builds on our previous successes using human Organ Chip technology to recapitulate each individual cancer patient's TME outside their body so that we can identify the drug combination that will work best for that very patient. This new way to approach personalized medicine could be implemented at clinical centers focusing on the care of patients suffering from many different types of cancer, such as the one run by our collaborators with patients who have esophageal cancer. Perhaps equally important, it can also be used as a pre-clinical testbed to break new ground in the development of tumor- or stroma-targeted therapies for cancer patients and enable the discovery of biomarkers that could be used to monitor and optimize drug effects in these patients." Ingber is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital and the Hansjörg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Ingber's and Ferri's teams started to collaborate already in 2023 on an earlier study in which they modeled Barrett's esophagus in a microfluidic Organ Chip with vital support by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Cancer Research UK. These start with inflammation, which most commonly is induced by acid reflux, continue via the transformation of esophageal tissue into hyper-proliferating stomach and small intestine-like tissue (Barrett's esophagus), to ultimately lead to the conversion of these highly proliferating abnormal cells into cancer cells. Importantly, these malignant changes are not only driven by molecular and cellular processes in the esophagus' epithelial lining, but also in its underlying "stroma," which is made up of fibroblast cells that communicate with the cancer cells through a constant exchange of molecules, and it also contains immune cells and blood vessels. "Whereas in our earlier work, we faithfully recapitulated the earlier stages of the pathological process potentially leading to EAC, namely Barrett's esophagus, in our new study we fast-forwarded to its cancerous end result," said second-author Elee Shimshoni, Ph.D., who was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Ingber's team during both studies. "Only by reconstituting key components of the TME and mimicking some of its fluid flows, which normally is provided by the fluid surrounding cells (interstitial fluid) and supporting blood vessels, were we able to achieve physiologically relevant drug exposure, and to accurately predict patient-specific responses to NACT in personalized EAC Chips. First-author Sanjima Pal, Ph.D. and other members in Ferri's team at the McGill University Health Care Centre where Ferri treats patients with esophageal cancer, had mastered the ability to create patient-matched esophageal organoids with high consistency. Both channels are separated by a porous membrane, which allows the cancer and stromal tissues to freely exchange molecules as they would do in an actual tumor. For a cohort of eight patients, all EAC Chips accurately predicted their responses to NACT within 12 days. These results perfectly correlated with the patients' responses to the same chemotherapy and their survival rates following surgical resection of EAC tumors. Other authors on the study were Salvador Flores Torres, Mingyang Kong, Kulsum Tai, Veena Sangwan, Nicholas Bertos, Swneke Donovan Bailey, and Julie Bérubé. It was funded by a Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge STrOmal ReprograMing (STORMing Cancer) grant that enabled a consortium of researchers, including Ingber and Ferri, to focus on the role of stroma in the pathology of various diseases, as well as the Montreal General Hospital Foundation (LF), and an Impact Grant award from the Department of Defense-Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (Award # CA200572).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An 8-year HonorHealth Research Institute clinical trial, using non-surgical techniques, showed 86% of patients with a type of usually fatal low blood pressure known as 'structural shock' survived at least 3 months, while 73% survived at least 6 months, according to a study presented here at a major heart convention. Dr. Rizik presented the study's findings today at New York Valves 2025: The Structural Heart Summitheld at New York's Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. In only its second year, New York Valves is already the world's premier meeting of structural heart disease, which refers to conditions affecting the heart's valves, walls, chambers and muscles. While ultra-low blood pressure, or cardiogenic shock, is often caused by a heart attack due to blockages in the arteries that feed the heart muscle, there is a growing recognition that this condition is also caused by structural shock, which usually involves damage to two major heart valves: These are patients who come into our emergency departments in what is referred to as 'cardiogenic shock.' These patients are generally too sick to have an operation (open-heart surgery) to replace the mitral valve," said Dr. Rizik, lead author of a paper, Mitral Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair and Mandatory Mechanical Circulatory Support in Patients With Structural Shock, (doi: 10.1016/j.jscai.2025.102626) published in the Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (JSCAI). Instead, structural shock patients at HonorHealth were diverted to the Institute's cardiovascular catheterization laboratory, where specialists - using devices guided through large blood vessels to enter the heart - performed two procedures: Dr. Rizik said that, on average, more than 90 percent of cardiogenic shock patients do not survive. "This is a brand new area of clinical investigation," he said, adding that the success of the HonorHealth clinical trial resulted from an unprecedented collaboration of heart specialists at the Institute, including cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons, and specialists in imaging, critical care and intensive care. "This represents one of the largest single-center prospective experiences examining transcatheter edge-to-edge repair in this high-risk population," according to the paper published in JSCAI. Dr. Rizik plans to build on the initial study of 30 cases by working with other medical centers to refine non-surgical techniques through a larger clinical trial involving hundreds of patients. Structural shock can be caused in younger patients from genetic susceptibility, and in older patients from progressively worsening valves and chronic damage to the heart muscle. New York Valves 2025 features live-case demonstrations, interactive debates, and hands-on training for professionals in the field, including interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, clinical cardiologists, cardiac imagers, heart failure specialists, catheter lab professionals and nurses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Depression affects 1%-2% of children younger than 13 in the U.S. and can arise as early as age 3, but a specialized therapeutic intervention can help preschool-aged children find relief from this condition - with benefits lasting at least four years, according to a new study led by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The researchers, led by Joan Luby, MD, the Samuel and Mae S. Ludwig Professor of Psychiatry at WashU Medicine, and Mei Elansary, MD, an attending developmental behavioral pediatrician at Boston Medical Center, measured the long-term effects of a dyadic (parent-child), 18-week intervention developed by Luby. Luby and Elansary also found that the children in remission had lower rates of mental health service and psychiatric medication use compared to kids who didn't achieve remission from depression after treatment. "The beauty of this therapy is that it's a short-term, parent-child interaction therapy that's delivered by a master's level clinician, so it's very accessible, very low risk, and it's literally changing the trajectory of mental health over four years," said Luby, who also directs the Department of Psychiatry's Early Emotional Development Program at WashU Medicine. "From a public health perspective, it's a really good early investment, and, in terms of return on investment, it's huge." Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Emotion Development (PCIT-ED), which Luby developed and applied in this study, is the first and only psychotherapeutic intervention designed to treat depression in preschoolers that has been rigorously tested in a large-scale trial. PCIT-ED was modified from PCIT, which is a standard intervention for treating children experiencing behavioral difficulties. In PCIT-ED, therapists coach caregivers in real-time interactions with their children, helping them reinforce positive behaviors, develop effective parenting skills and build a supportive and nurturing environment. The focus is on improving the child's emotional awareness and expression, fostering a secure parent-child relationship and mitigating early symptoms of depression. Prior work by Luby's team has shown children receiving PCIT-ED had remission rates of 73% after the 18-week intervention compared to 23% of children who were on a waiting list for treatment. Several months after treatment, the vast majority of children remained in remission. This latest study is the first follow-up examining the long-term effects of PCIT-ED for children and their families. It included 105 children who received a full course of PCIT-ED in the earlier trial and were reassessed four years after the end of treatment, at which point they were 8 to 12 years old. The interviewers assessed symptoms of major depressive disorder, such as guilt, sadness, aggression and sleep problems. They also looked at other family characteristics, such as parenting strategies and whether caregivers had depression. They found that 57% of 3- to 7-year-olds with major depressive disorder were in remission four years later, without any follow-up or booster sessions. It's like the foundation of a house. Joan Luby, MD, the Samuel and Mae S. Ludwig Professor of Psychiatry, WashU Medicine The findings underscore the value of early diagnosis and intervention for young children with depression, said Elansary, who is also an assistant professor of pediatrics at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine. "Our results offer promising evidence that PCIT-ED can reduce the risk of future mental health challenges into preadolescence," she noted. "Perhaps most strikingly, children who achieved remission required significantly less use of psychotropic medications and intensive mental health services, suggesting a more favorable long-term trajectory." Furthermore, parents of preadolescent children in remission reported less parenting stress in Luby and Elansary's follow-up study, highlighting the holistic benefits to the family. The Hermann Center for Child and Family Development, a research center housed within the Children's Discovery Institute, a collaboration between St. Louis Children's Hospital and WashU Medicine, provides mental and emotional health support to children and families - including PCIT-ED - with a focus on preventive care to decrease psychiatric needs later in life. The Hermann Center blends world-class research with a revolutionary model for whole-family behavioral health care. The Hermann Center, established in 2022 by a $15 million gift from Bob and Signa Hermann, is the first of its kind to adopt a transgenerational approach to reducing the burden of serious behavioral health conditions of childhood, one that engages the whole family and that will track the results of this care for years to come. With the long-term benefits of PCIT-ED established, Luby said she anticipates that providers nationwide will take advantage of downloadable training materials she has developed and start offering the protocol at their facilities. She also plans to develop additional modules to help people who would benefit from further support, such as extra emotional development for caregivers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality due to its aggressive nature and limited therapeutic targets. While the Warburg effect initially emphasized glycolysis, recent research highlights the critical role of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in cancer progression. Mitochondria, dynamic organelles regulated by fission, fusion, and mitophagy, are central to metabolic plasticity, supporting tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy resistance. This review explores the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics in breast cancer metastasis, their diagnostic and prognostic potential, and emerging therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways. Metabolic heterogeneity is a defining feature of breast cancer, with TNBC exhibiting heightened reliance on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and mitochondrial respiration to meet its energetic and biosynthetic demands. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS): Despite glycolytic dominance in primary tumors, metastatic lesions show increased TCA cycle flux and ATP production, underscoring mitochondrial metabolic flexibility. These adaptations highlight mitochondria as central hubs of metabolic reprogramming, offering vulnerabilities for therapeutic intervention. Drp1 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and is linked to Notch1-mediated chemoresistance in TNBC. PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy eliminates damaged mitochondria, but its dual role-suppressing ROS or enabling stress adaptation-depends on context. For example, BRCA1 deficiency disrupts mitophagy, elevating ROS and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which drives metastasis. Conversely, mitophagy induction by compounds like polyphyllin I or silibinin triggers apoptosis in TNBC. Fusion promotion: Enhancing MFN2 activity suppresses glycolytic flux and tumor growth. Heterogeneity: Mitochondrial adaptations vary by tumor subtype and stage, necessitating personalized approaches. Drug resistance: Metabolic plasticity may undermine targeted therapies, requiring combinatorial strategies. Translational gaps: Standardizing mitochondrial biomarkers (e.g., Drp1 levels) and improving drug delivery (e.g., nanoparticle carriers) are critical for clinical adoption. Future research should integrate multi-omics to unravel metabolic-immune crosstalk and explore mitochondrial transplantation as a novel therapy. Mitochondrial dynamics are pivotal in breast cancer metastasis, influencing metabolic flexibility, stemness, and therapy resistance. Targeting fission, fusion, and mitophagy offers a transformative approach to disrupt tumor adaptability. While challenges persist, advancing mitochondrial-directed therapies-combined with precision medicine tools-holds immense potential to improve outcomes for aggressive breast cancer subtypes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is a common brain lesion resulting from traumatic brain injuries and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Emergency surgery is the most common intervention for these patients; however, in some cases, patients refuse to undergo surgery owing to social, religious, economic, or psychological reasons. In these cases, ASDH transitions to sASDH, and non-surgical interventions should begin immediately. To address this issue, researchers from Capital Medical University, Beijing, and Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China, set out to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of the drugs atorvastatin and dexamethasone in five patients who reported sASDH. This study was conducted under the guidance of Professor Rongcai Jiang and was published in the prestigious Chinese Neurosurgical Journal on April 2, 2025. Previous phase-II randomized proof-of-concept trials had reported that atorvastatin plus low-dose dexamethasone was effective in patients with chronic SDH. Based on this, Prof. Jiang explains the rationale of their study "Considering that sASDH and chronic SDH share highly similar pathological and clinical characteristics, we speculate that atorvastatin combined with low-dose dexamethasone may be safe and effective for sASDH patients initially selecting nonsurgical therapy". Of the five patients, four were females, aged between 30 and 85 years old. The male patient was a 97-year-old who presented with convulsions and atrial fibrillation. The medical histories of these patients were also varied, ranging from hemophilia to rectal and bladder cancers. Two female patients reported post-operative and post-fall SDH. The authors next searched research databases like PubMed and Google Scholar for literature regarding safety and efficacy of non-surgical treatments for patients with ASDH/sASDH. However, "more than 80% of the patients did not need delayed surgery; this further illustrates that patients with ASDH/sASDH can have a good prognosis with conservative treatment in certain cases", comments Prof. Jiang on the literature survey performed by the team. The mechanism of how atorvastatin improves ASDH symptoms still remains unclear. Rats with sASDH/ASDH when treated with atorvastatin showed significant reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines present in the hematomas, removing local inflammation, promoting proliferation and maturation of blood vessels, and contributing towards the absorption of SDH. The lack of an optimal non-surgical treatment for sASDH prompted this study. The literature review suggests a high mortality rate of 7% which calls for an urgent non-surgical treatment plan for these patients. This study, although conducted in a small local pool of patients with sASDH, shows that atorvastatin with low-dose of dexamethasone successfully resolves symptoms and removes hematomas without recurrence during a six-month follow-up period. Overall, "the nonsurgical treatment strategy of atorvastatin plus dexamethasone is safe and effective.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is known to be associated with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but how and why they are connected remains unknown. Researchers from Mass General Brigham discovered that HBV does not cause liver inflammation or cancer on its own, but worsens liver inflammation and may make patients more susceptible to early cancer development caused by environmental carcinogens. Limiting carcinogen exposure or reducing inflammation could mitigate this risk. Our research sheds light on the intricate interplay between HBV infection and carcinogen exposure to generate immune dysregulation in the liver that leads to cancer development. We propose the potential of combining statin therapy with conventional HBV treatments like entecavir to improve patient outcomes." Using a mouse model, the researchers found that HBV did not directly cause liver inflammation or cancer. However, when the HBV models were exposed to a carcinogen found in tobacco smoke, fried foods, processed meats, and alcoholic drinks, they developed an extreme liver cancer phenotype. This carcinogen, also known as diethylnitrosamine (DEN), caused an increase in interleukin-33 (IL-33), an inflammatory molecule, which is required for the development of liver cancer. This treatment was effective in reducing the risk of chronic hepatitis and liver cancer. The researchers then extended their findings into humans, finding higher levels of IL-33, especially in patients with HBV-associated hepatitis, compared to healthy controls. They then looked at data from more than 200 million patients, finding that the risk of hepatitis and liver cancer were significantly reduced in patients treated with a statin compared with those treated with another cholesterol-lowering drug. Hepatitis B virus promotes liver cancer by modulating the immune response to environmental carcinogens. Explore how spectrophotometry is evolving to deliver speed and accuracy in biopharma workflows.
