                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Lawrence Brothers have announced their newest project together: a graphic novel. According to Yahoo, the Lawrence Brothers' new series will start as a graphic novel and potentially spawn into an animated series and a live-action show. We were like, ‘Oh, how funny would it be if we three, these actors who have all done cop drama shows, decided to help these guys?' And we came up with storylines where we'd use our procedural drama detective skills to help track down these lost items.” “As zany as it is, and we are going to go a little edgy with it too at times, we want to keep it broad enough so that our diehard fans love it, but also their children love it.” He added, “I have a 19 and a 15-year-old. So it won't be for little kids, but it will be for teens and their parents to enjoy together.” The Lawrence brothers have been in Hollywood for over 30 years. Joey got an early start, starring in various commercials and making an appearance on “The Johnny Carson Show” when he was only six years old. In the early 1990s, he became a series regular on the popular series “Blossom“, which catapulted him to heartthrob status. Since then, he has starred in “Melissa & Joey”, “Hawaii Five-O”, and “My Brother's Keeper”, among others. Matthew followed in his older brother's footsteps, even starring as the younger version of his character on “Blossom.” The actor is purportedly most known for his role as the son of Robin Williams' character in “Mrs. In 1997, Matthew joined the cast of “Boy Meets World” as Jack Hunter and was on the series until its cancellation in 2000. Since then, he has starred in “The Hot Chick”, “Trucker”, and “NCIS”, among others. Like Matthew, Andrew also had a guest spot on Blossom playing the younger version of his brother Joey's character. Since then, Andrew has starred in “Going to the Mat”, “Oliver Beane”, and “Hawaii Five-O”, among others. According to IMDB, the youngest Lawrence brother is also a director, having directed at least 9 projects, approximately 7 of which starred one or both of his brothers. Are you excited about the Lawrence brothers' new project?</p>

The novel, as the cover announces, will eventually be a project for James Cameron — and he insists that he will be tackling the subject in a different fashion than Christopher Nolan did two years ago with his Oscar-winning “Oppenheimer.” Cameron actually told Deadline that he felt Nolan took “a bit of a moral cop out” because of “what he stayed away from” in his narrative. “He's got one brief scene in the film where we see — and I don't like to criticize another filmmaker's film – but there's only one brief moment where he sees some charred bodies in the audience and then the film goes on to show how it deeply moved him,” Cameron said. I don't know whether the studio or Chris felt that that was a third rail that they didn't want to touch, but I want to go straight at the third rail. Related Stories Scarlett Johansson Is Still Working on ‘Tower of Terror' Adaptation, but Calls ‘Thin' Plot a ‘Hard Nut to Crack' ‘Crying' — A Tribute to the ‘Mulholland Drive' Club Silencio Singer Rebekah Del Rio Nolan had insisted at the time that that was not the story he was trying to tell, and it may instead take a filmmaker like Cameron to do it. “You come to my premiere and say nice things… I can't tell you today what's going to be in the movie. I've been making notes for 15 years and I haven't written a word of the script yet because there's a point where it's all there and then you start to write. And then there's a moment where you're ready to write. And I'm not in that head space right now.” There is one filmmaker, however, whose product he does wish to emulate in substance. This, of course, is none other than Steve Spielberg, who made a pair of definitive World War II classics with “Schindler's List” and “Saving Private Ryan” in the '90s. “This is Joe Abercrombie in absolute peak form, opening up a whole new world and an ensemble of delicious new characters,” Cameron said earlier this month. ‘The Devils' showcases Joe's jaundiced view of human nature, in all its dark, selfish glory, as told through some decidedly un-human characters. But of course, Joe always teases with the flickers of redemption that make it all worthwhile — and ultimately quite heart-wrenching.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kneecap shocked exactly as expected at a raucous Glastonbury set on Saturday. The Irish rap trio has drawn widespread criticism in recent months, with one of the members, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, charged with a terror offence last month. Glastonbury partner, the BBC, stood by their decision to air their set, despite U.K. culture secretary Lisa Nandy's comments that the band “thrive on the oxygen of publicity.” Nandy said Thursday: “Personally, I don't want to see that on TV screens.” Matty Healy Gives Mixed Message on Politics as The 1975 Kick Off Glastonbury Headline Sets “The amount of Palestinian flags I can see is insane,” Ó hAnnaidh also said. The pressure that that family was under and they stood strong,” they said of being allowed to perform, “Fair play to them.” In May, the Met Police said it would investigate after online videos showed the band calling for the death of British parliament ministers, as well as chanting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah.” It is illegal in the U.K. to express support for Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim political and military group in Lebanon, as it is considered a terrorist organization in Britain. Kneecap, which also includes members Naoise Ó Cairealláin and J.J. Ó Dochartaigh, said the video in question has been taken out of context and that they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah. After news of Ó hAnnaidh's charge, the band took to defend themselves. Last year, the movie Kneecap, also starring Michael Fassbender, dominated film headlines. He won one BAFTA — namely for outstanding debut by a British writer, director, or producer — serving as both writer and director of the film. But the group's political views have gotten them into hot water. Later, they parted ways with their booking agency Independent Artist Group, sources confirm to The Hollywood Reporter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is being enabled by the U.S. government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes. Historic footage of the band from November 2024 allegedly showing support for Hezbollah – a militant group proscribed terror status in the U.K. – triggered an investigation and eventual charge under anti-terror laws for MC Mo Chara. He appeared in court earlier on June 18, with a hearing set for later this summer. He denies the charge, and says that it is a “carnival of distraction.” The set began with clips of recent global news broadcasts about the band, including footage of Sharon Osbourne calling for them to have their U.S. work visas revoked. Mo Chara took to the stage in a Palestinian keffiyeh, while bandmate Móglaí Bap wore a Fontaines D.C. football shirt – with the Dublin band having continually voiced their support for Kneecap. “Glastonbury, I'm a free man,” Mo Chara shouted shortly after “It's Been Ages.” The crowd responded by raising a sea of Palestinian flags, while some festivalgoers let off red and green flares in support. “Has anyone been watching the news lately?,” added DJ Provai before starting a “Free Mo Chara” chant. After rattling through highlights from their 2024 LP Fine Art, as well as a handful of unreleased tracks, the group referenced their ongoing legal case. “Mo Chara was in the Westminster court this month,” began Móglaí Bap. “He is back in court for a trumped-up terrorism charge. It's not the first time there has been a miscarriage of justice for an Irish person in the British Justice System.” He then rallied the crowd to show up for Mo Chara's hearing, which is scheduled to take place on Aug. 20. Later on, Mo Chara acknowledged Glastonbury Festival and its owners, the Eavis family, for standing by them amidst calls for them to be removed from the line-up. The Prime Minister of your country – not mine – said he didn't want us to play. “This [legal] situation can be quite stressful for us at times. But the stress that we are feeling is minimal in comparison to what the Palestinian people are going through every single day. We are from West Belfast, a place that has experienced occupation. “But we were never bombed from under the skies with nowhere to go. Not only are they being bombed from the skies, they are being starved to death in this day and age. He continued: “I can see the amount of Palestinian flags here and it is insane. The BBC editor is going to have some job [editing them out]. Sometimes we feel helpless, sometimes we feel like we aren't doing enough and that is probably true sometimes – but this is about difference it makes to people in Palestine when they see this many people on the other side of the world screaming ‘Free Palestine'. “Believe me, I know firsthand what happens when you speak out about Palestine in this industry,” said Mo Chara as the set drew to a close. “I spoke at Coachella and everyone in that f—ing tent agreed with me. The US media do not want to believe that young Americans agree with us; young people around the world know what's going on.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

I first encountered Rebekah Del Rio as millions of others did — at the movies. I was away from Los Angeles, visiting my parents in Indiana, when a friend and I went to see director David Lynch's “Mulholland Drive” at Movies 6, a second-run house in nearby Mishawaka, where tickets cost a buck. With the exception of loving “The Straight Story,” I hadn't been a David Lynch aficionado at all, having seen “The Lost Highway” in film school and stupidly dismissing it as an over-symbolic kooky piece of hoohah. I sat in that creaky seat, watching a dim projection on a tattered screen, and was instantly transported to another world — or should I say, back home to L.A. Beyond Naomi Watts and Laura Harring's wonderful wig-swapping weirdness, what truly pulled me in was the scene where their two characters attend a late night performance in a Los Angeles theater (aptly named “Club Silencio”). The club's announcer introduces “Rebekah Del Rio” and a pale woman with a jeweled tear under her eye walks slowly and sadly to the theater's lone microphone. Against blood-red velvet curtains, and without any musical accompaniment, she belts out Roy Orbison's “Crying” in Spanish (“Llorando”). Related Stories James Cameron Says Christopher Nolan Took a ‘Moral Cop Out' with ‘Oppenheimer' — ‘It Dodged the Subject' Danny Boyle on That '28 Years Later' Tearjerker Element: ‘You'll Weep with Terror' Del Rio's performance, both intimate and grand at the same time, was a moment that captured the truth of Los Angeles like I'd never seen before — the experience of going out in the wee hours and discovering profound beauty in strange corners that can move you to tears. The melancholy and melodrama of that simple scene, mixed with Del Rio's mournful singing of Orbison's old pop song, still moves and inspires to this day. Many years later, my wife came home from work and said she had a new assistant who'd supposedly starred and sang in “Mulholland Drive.” Did I know of her? I asked, “It couldn't be Rebekah Del Rio, who had performed perhaps the greatest scene in film in the last twenty years, could it?” My wife didn't quite understand my enthusiasm, but confirmed that was her. Like so many in Hollywood, Rebekah had a day job. Fame and art don't pay all the bills. Rebekah was a kind, ebullient soul if ever there was, blessed with, as Lynch himself said, “one of the most beautiful voices in the world.” I later learned she'd suffered real hardship in her life, including the unbelievable tragedy of losing her only son. She was still singing as recently as June 13 at a charity event in Los Angeles and had toured with filmmaker Richard Kelly for screenings of the film “Southland Tales,” in which she'd also been featured.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this edition of Staff Picks, Film Editor Jacob Oller recommends an excellent road trip movie and Staff Writer Matt Schimkowitz hails the Dirtier Cut of a Norm Macdonald-led cult hit. You can't even be mad at that point. This is the case for Panah Panahi, son of Iranian New Wave legend Jafar Panahi, and writer-director behind 2022's excellent road trip comedy Hit The Road. Turning a quest to smuggle a man out of Iran into a blissful, warm family bonding session is a tall order, but one Panahi is well-equipped for; in addition to his father's censorship, imprisonment, and international escape, his sister needed to flee Iran due to threats on her life. It's no wonder Panahi is able to maintain the acerbic, ball-busting spirit of his central family—mother (Pantea Panahiha), father (Hasan Madjooni), elder son (Amin Simiar), his charisma bomb of a baby brother (Rayan Sarlak), and their cute pooch—despite the gravity of their undertaking. Like so much of Iranian cinema, Hit The Road unfolds its layers slowly, with a level of conspiratorial deceit and shadowy implication covering up the honest core of love that binds the family together. Why they're heading towards the border, what unspoken checklist they're running through with their seemingly eccentric and unrelated stops, that remains far more vague and aloof compared to the specific, jokey affection the relatives share for one another. In that close scrutiny, shoved into a van and unable to escape, Hit The Road‘s chatty characters flourish. (One hilarious subplot involves the precocious kid needing to get his contraband cell phone back because he has so many people trying to dial him up.) Meanwhile, Panahiha's complex facial expressions shoulder many of the more somber images as profanity flies easily from her lips. It's a contradictory film, simultaneously light and existentially heavy, this cognitive dissonance baked into life in a country that has plenty to say about how its residents act. It feels ridiculous that I want to advocate for movies that push this simple, self-evident point, but just as a great movie can be magical and transcendent, it can also be demystifying. Twenty-seven years after bombing in theaters and being reborn as a beloved cult object for now-grown 10-year-olds who saw it at sleepovers, Dirty Work returns with its long-fabled Dirtier Cut. Dirty Work was always a cut above the rest, primarily for showcasing Macdonald's unique, disaffected charisma. Vinegar's “Dirtier Cut” extends the film's considerable runtime from 82 to 83 minutes, returning jokes not seen since its 1998 test screenings. However, this new Dirty Work isn't an “R-rated” or “director's” cut. “We really worked hard to get an R with no nudity,” co-writer Frank Sebastiano said at the cut's os Angeles premiere. Macdonald stars as Mitch Weaver, who starts a revenge-for-hire business with his best friend Sam (Artie Lange) to raise money for a heart transplant for Sam's dad, Pops (Jack Warden). The plot largely functions so that Macdonald can play off an unbelievable comedic talent assembled for the film, including career-best performances from Chevy Chase and Chris Farley, and a one-scene turn from Don Rickles that belongs in the Smithsonian. His blunt delivery and easygoing smirk imbue the film with a distinctive comedic energy that keeps the shaggy plot moving. But we don't have to sell anyone on Dirty Work. The Dirtier Cut certainly makes good on Sebastiano's promise of weird sexual imagery. It excises some scenes meant to replace raunchier ones, like Rebecca Romijn's bearded lady cameo. The “way-outta line” prison scene is a touch more specific in ways that don't necessarily make it funnier. Still, it is a prime example of Macdonald's ability to underplay sensitive or offensive material. Thankfully, Vinegar Syndrome's release contains both cuts of the films, along with a host of special features, including multiple commentary tracks and a 60-minute retrospective documentary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I got you, fucker,” one of the agents says. The struggle lasts for several seconds, but Díaz's hands are pinned. From another camera angle on the back patio, Díaz's roommate tells the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who have not identified themselves or presented a warrant, that they are not allowed on the property, but they brush him off. Though Díaz was initially processed for deportation on April 29, he wouldn't stay long in ICE detention. But Martin Díaz's wife, Kendall Díaz, said in an interview that the Ring camera footage is proof he did not elbow the ICE agents. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, violent ICE arrests have been caught on camera across the country. DHS has never made this information public, so it is unknown whether the 500 percent increase is between 10 and 60 assaults or 200 and 1,200. Other publications have met similar resistance in communication with DHS about this topic. Recent data on immigrants booked into ICE custody acquired by Rolling Stone lists 35 pending assault charges since October 2024, but it is not clear whether those potential assaults were against ICE officers. From DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's public statements, though, it appears any physical contact with an ICE officer could now be classified as assault, and the agency is prepared to file charges against anyone and everyone as they see fit. Trump's Military Birthday Parade ‘Illegally' Used Hit Song: Cease-and-Desist Letter Florida GOP Hawks Merch for Brutal ‘Alligator Alcatraz' Migrant Detention Camp Trump Is Doing Crypto Corruption With a Billionaire Leader of Fake Country: Report Supreme Court Hands Trump ‘GIANT WIN' in Birthright Citizenship Case Even Democratic politicians have been arrested in recent weeks during altercations with ICE officers, including New York City Comptroller Brad Lander and Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.). Lander was arrested while escorting an immigrant out of a courtroom and DHS made a public statement saying he would be charged with assault, but the charges were dropped, while McIver was arrested at a protest in front of an ICE detention center and was indicted with three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding, and interfering with federal officials. In a statement, McIver called the charges against her “a brazen attempt at political intimidation,” part of “an effort by Trump's administration to dodge accountability for the chaos ICE caused and scare me out of doing the work I was elected to do.” Lander and McIver's altercations with ICE officers were filmed and took place amid a forest of bystanders, but many of these assault cases will rest only on the testimony of the people involved. In May, ICE charged Francisco DeJesus Morales, an undocumented man from Nicaragua with no criminal history (crossing the border without authorization is not a crime) with assault for grabbing and twisting an ICE officer's testicles. Cases like these balance on the integrity of the agents involved, and any evidence they can provide of physical injuries. When the footage was released, instead of assault, Martinez was charged with felony conspiracy to impede or injure an officer (a possible six-year sentence), charges that his lawyers claim were “trumped up” and “filed to justify the federal agents' violent treatment of Adrian.” José Manuel Mojica, also a U.S. citizen, participated in the anti-ICE protests in Paramount, California, on June 7, and was charged with impeding a federal officer, with a possible prison sentence of 8 years, after he attempted to halt a violent altercation between another protester and an agent. In any of these cases, if the ICE agents had been local police officers, the possible sentences for these crimes would be lighter, a reality that criminal defense attorneys are now urging the public to understand as civilians interact with federal agents for the first time in their workplaces, schools, and neighborhoods. An officer can file charges any time someone doesn't comply with a verbal order and has any physical reaction that does not follow the order. The situation is complicated by the fact that ICE officers often refuse to identify themselves, as well as their new costume: plainclothes, unmarked cars, and face coverings. Even if the officers are armed, nearly anyone can own a firearm in America. Kendall Díaz said a group of Customs and Border Patrol officers showed up at her house several weeks before her husband's arrest, but he wasn't home. They bumped into her car in the driveway in a false attempt to get her attention and start a conversation, pretending to be civilians. Complicating matters further, ICE impersonators have been arrested in at least six states over the past few months, including two men who used their false identities as ICE agents to sexually assault immigrant women. If it is impossible to tell who is a real federal officer, California state Senator Scott Weiner says, the public will lose trust in law enforcement. “The recent federal operations in California have created an environment of profound terror. If we want the public to trust law enforcement, we cannot allow them to behave like secret police in an authoritarian state,” he said in a press release. In El Monte, California on June 20, ICE agents tackled a U.S. citizen, and after realizing their mistake, asked, “Why were you running?” — as if there could be no explanation why one would run from masked, armed men, if not undocumented. While the majority of ICE's previous work involved tracking and arresting undocumented people with criminal convictions, the Trump administration has now set a quota of 3,000 arrests per day. Since January, ICE has picked up double the average number of people, and less than 10 percent have serious criminal convictions. In other words, ICE agents are unaccustomed to picking up everyday people from Home Depot parking lots, city sidewalks, or courthouses, areas where there could be crowds of citizens dissenting. In Los Angeles on June 24, an ICE agent pointed a taser at the head of a U.S. citizen who was filming an arrest. He attempted to swat away her phone and shouted, “You're resisting!” — even though filming a federal officer was her legal right. José Manuel Mojica, the protester charged with assaulting an ICE officer in Paramount said, on the way to the police station, one of the ICE agents told him,, “Don't act like you're not used to this,” but Mojica had never been arrested before in his life. David Bier, a research fellow on immigration at the Cato Institute who has been tracking ICE detentions, said there has also been a 500 percent increase in ICE arrests on the street in public places. Bier said given the tense environment, and the threat of being sent to a prison in a foreign country like El Salvador with no hope for release, the idea that people would fight back against arrests, leading to a 500 percent increase in perceived assaults, is “not surprising.” Bier also believes the vast majority of DHS' assault claims could be accusations that never translate into criminal charges. On June 13, DHS responded to a viral video on X of ICE agents arresting a U.S. citizen and stealing his ID. Regardless of whether civilians are assaulting ICE officers in large numbers, Houser says threats of criminal charges can be used to coerce people already in custody. Since October, 2024, over 44,000 people have been listed with “pending” charges when they were booked into detention. When an immigrant is placed in a detention center under deportation proceedings, they are not guaranteed legal representation. Often, federal agents will attempt to convince the immigrant to sign papers authorizing their own deportation, so their removal is expedited, without any input from a judge. The threat of prison time could get an immigrant to give up hope on their release, Houser says. Amanda Schuft, a lawyer with Immigrant Defenders Law Center in Los Angeles, says ICE officers and other DHS personnel have also taken action to impede immigrants' knowledge of their rights and legal representation in recent weeks. “It's very concerning that it's been so hard for us to get in touch with people who are getting arrested,” she said. But he still could be deported to Mexico if acquitted, even though he is married to a U.S. citizen and has submitted an application for a green card.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that lower federal courts should not have the power to issue nationwide injunctions blocking presidential orders — no matter how obviously unconstitutional such an order may be. The decision is a monumental gift to Donald Trump's administration, which is seeking to implement much of its anti-immigration and other policy priorities through executive orders. The Supreme Court's ruling effectively restricts the injunctions that blocked the birthright citizenship order, and could potentially apply to other authoritarian actions by Trump and his administration that have been blocked by federal courts. “GIANT WIN in the United States Supreme Court!” he wrote on Truth Social. “Even the Birthright Citizenship Hoax has been, indirectly, hit hard. It had to do with the babies of slaves (same year! “Thanks to this decision, we can now promptly file to proceed with numerous policies that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis, and some of the cases we're talking about would be ending birthright citizenship,” the president added at a news conference later on Friday. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, called out the administration's tactics in her dissent of Friday's decision. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship. The majority holds that, absent cumbersome class-action litigation, courts cannot completely enjoin even such plainly unlawful policies unless doing so is necessary to afford the formal parties complete relief. That holding renders constitutional guarantees meaningful in name only for any individuals who are not parties to a lawsuit.” During oral arguments in May, lawyers for the Justice Department argued that executive orders could not be blocked by the lower courts, and should be allowed to go into effect until something like a class-action lawsuit against a given policy makes its way to the Supreme Court.

As of the past few minutes, this has been reversed. “We are delighted to confirm that Neil Young's headline set from Glastonbury on Saturday will be broadcast live to audiences across the UK on the BBC,” said a spokeswoman. BBC Finally Sets Out Plans For Kneecap Coverage At Glastonbury BBC Storyville Seeking New Head Following Role Closures & 20% Reduction In Films Young's relationship with Glastonbury and the BBC has been rocky for months. Earlier this year, after he had been confirmed as headliner, he and his Chrome Hearts band initially said they were pulling out of the country's biggest music fest because it was under the “corporate control” of the BBC. Young's will he-won't he is not the biggest controversy at this year's Glastonbury, which is attended by more than 200,000 people and kicked off properly yesterday. In a few hours' time, controversial Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap will take to the West Holts Stage and the BBC is still not clarifying how it will go about covering the set. “S**t is thrown on stage all the time. If I'm supposed to know every f***ing thing that's thrown on stage… I'd be in Mensa, Jesus Christ,” said Mo Chara, AKA Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh. All eyes are trained on Kneecap and in what form they appear on the national broadcaster, which has said “our plans will ensure that our programming will meet our editorial guidelines.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Christian Zübert, the writer and director of hit Netflix film Exterritorial couldn't believe it when his German action thriller scaled the streamer's film charts. Donald Trump Says He's Ending Trade Talks With Canada Because Of New Digital Services Tax Duffer Brothers Developing 'The Savage, Noble Death Of Babs Dionne' At Netflix With Joshua Mohr & Ron Currie Having scaled the heights, the Constantin Film-produced movie is now fifth most-watched non-English language film ever on Netflix with over 85M views and is closing in on fourth spot. “You start to realize, and I don't say this to brag but more because Netflix has got such a huge reach, maybe at that moment, this was the most seen movie in the world,” Zübert says. The story follows former elite soldier Sara Wulf, played by Jeanne Goursaud (Barbarians), whose child mysteriously disappears in the labyrinthine U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany. He was in the U.S. consulate trying to get visas for his family. He didn't lose any offspring and embark upon a two-hour carnage-filled mission to get them back, per the film, but the idea was born. Netflix's German-language programming boss Sasha Bühler greenlit the movie. “We said maybe we can try to do this emotional take on Die Hard set in a consulate,” Zübert says. “You have this framing of the Die Hard-type movie, but there's also this mother looking for a child, and who has to overcome her own self-doubts. Those two elements were really important for me. If you had just taken one element, it probably wouldn't have had the same impact, people would have said: ‘I've seen this a million times. The director had seen numerous actors but until he saw Goursaud had not found one who could inhabit the role of Sara Wulf, a mother and ex-soldier haunted by memories of her time in Afghanistan. For me, from the beginning, I wanted her to do everything. I didn't want to use any stunt doubles.” Goursaud is in a cat and mouse game with Dougray Scott's head of consulate security Erik Kynch. “His brain must be really f***ed up, because he's Scottish and he had to play an American with an American accent but who can also speak German, but with an American accent,” Zübert says. On set [in Vienna, Austria], he was always saying: ‘Please speak German to me. Zübert is in Bratislava, Slovakia, when he talks to Deadline and prepping for a TV drama set within the world of showjumping. It has the working title Nordhof and comes from German novelist Julie Zeh. The series is for German public broadcaster ZDF. “It showcases the whole world of those really expensive horses which are sold to billionaires,” Zübert explains. “It was written by a famous German novelist called Juliet Zeh and this is her first series. There have been movies about horse racing, but I haven't seen [a project] like this where you really see this world of show jumping [represented] so visually and in such an exciting and new way.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the wider worlds of pop and hip-hop may not have realized it when it was announced earlier this week, the name of Cardi B's long awaited sophomore album, Am I the Drama?, is suspiciously close to a viral quote from Scarlet Envy's time on RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars season six. But for the predominantly (if not close to exclusively) LGBTQ revelers at Brooklyn's annual LadyLand Festival, “am I the drama?” is queer meme canon. So when Scarlet Envy emerged onstage at 1:35 a.m. on Friday night (technically Saturday morning, but who's counting) to introduce Cardi's headlining set, absolutely everyone knew why she was there. “Happy Pride, New York City!” Scarlet shouted, prowling the stage in a shimmering red outfit and gigantic wig. My name is Scarlet Envy: I'm the drama,” she said to cheers and finger snaps. “Who's tucking today?” Cardi B yelled at the LadyLand crowd as she rolled up on stage in a black-and-white horizontal-striped jumper. “Let's get sexy y'all!” Cardi shouted at the top of her set, perhaps needlessly – the LadyLand attendees, who had been gathering, gyrating, kiki-ing and flirting for hours, were way ahead of her, singing along and shaking ass the moment her tiny frame emerged on the fest's Fist Stage. (For those interested, “Fist and Resist” keychains were available at the merch table.) Flanked by two giant inflatable fists with nails even longer than hers, Cardi B delivered hits like “She Bad,” “Money” and her new single, the Offset-eviscerating “Outside,” with the effortless fervor and personality-drenched flow that catapulted her to fame. Four of those five chart toppers (“WAP,” “Bodak Yellow,” “I Like It,” “Up”) were accounted for during her show. Despite the persistent rain that gathered strength throughout Cardi's set, the audience remained undaunted and rapt; after all, it's not every day you get to see a hip-hop superstar perform under the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (LadyLand has called Greenpoint's Under the K Bridge Park home since 2023). “It's a full circle moment for me and Cardi,” she explained: back in 2017, before Cardi ascended to mainstream success with “Bodak Yellow,” she performed up at Holy Mountain, LadyFag's legendary NYC monthly throwdown. “She got very excited about being with the gays,” Ladyfag recently told Billboard of that February 2017 party. Within a few months, she became one of the biggest stars in the world — and she always remembered it.” That connection and warmth was obvious on Friday night, with Cardi blowing past her bedtime to give the gays, the dolls and everyone else an experience beyond what any other NYC festival provides.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And the pile is heaped on this particular Friday night, with news that NBC's Grosse Pointe Garden Society and ABC's Doctor Odyssey have both met their likely ends. That “likely,” by the way, is largely on behalf of Doctor Odyssey, since it's a Ryan Murphy show, and Murphy has a pretty hefty amount of latitude, with a lot of different networks and streamers, to shuffle his many shows around. The series—which starred Joshua Jackson as a cruise ship doctor, solving nautical medical mysteries—has not, technically, been canceled. But ABC has allowed its actors' contracts to expire, which is generally a death knell for a series, while also stating that the program won't be on its upcoming schedule. Co-starring Don Johnson, Philipa Soo, and Sean Teale, the series started with strong ratings, and has been bolstered with occasional crossovers from other Murphy shows like 9-1-1. But, uh, nuh-uh: NBC execs ultimately decided the series, while apparently pretty cheap to make by streaming TV standards, just wasn't in the streamer's existing budget, and wasn't expected to massively grow its audience in a new home.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a report in People, Amazon founder, 61, and the Emmy-winning journalist, 55, tied the knot on Friday, June 27. The couple exchanged their vows in a black-tie ceremony on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, Italy. Guests included Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Usher, Karlie Kloss, and Tom Brady. Also in attendance were Queen Rania of Jordan, Bill Gates and his partner Paula Hurd, François-Henri Pinault, and fashion icons like Diane von Fürstenberg, Domenico Dolce, and Tommy Hilfiger. According to People, the wedding began with a touching performance of Elvis Presley's “Can't Help Falling in Love,” sung by Matteo Bocelli, which was met with cheers from the guests. The couple's wedding weekend began on Wednesday, June 25, when they were photographed arriving in Venice via helicopter, walking hand-in-hand and smiling. According to People, Guests enjoyed an authentic taste of Italy — pizza made on-site by a famous Neapolitan chef, arancini, fried zucchini flowers, octopus, and lemon cakes. Initially, the ceremony was set to take place at Scuola Grande della Misericordia on Saturday, June 28. According to the Associated Press, in a gesture of appreciation, Bezos and Sánchez highlighted Venice's artisanal culture by sourcing nearly 80% of their wedding provisions from local vendors. That includes pastry shop Rosa Salva and glassmakers at Laguna B. Instead of wedding gifts, guests were encouraged to donate to three local charities: the UNESCO Venice Office, CORILA, and Venice International University. On their invitation, the couple wrote: “This magical place has gifted us unforgettable memories.
