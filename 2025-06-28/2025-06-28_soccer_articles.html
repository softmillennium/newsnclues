                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SPECIAL ELECTION: Virginia voters cast ballots for the Democratic and Republican nominees who will square off in a special contest set for September to replace the late Rep. Gerry Connolly. WTOP has details on how to voice your pick. MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Tobin Heath might know something about what makes soccer resonate within the U.S. Her resume, in part: She won NCAA titles in college at North Carolina, then went on to win two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. women's national team and two World Cup titles as well, all of that coming after she was inspired by the 1999 Women's World Cup. And so far, she thinks the Club World Cup could have a similar effect. Heath — who is working as part of FIFA's technical study group for the tournament, alongside the likes of former Arsenal coach Arsène Wenger, former German star and U.S. men's national coach Jurgen Klinsmann and others — said Saturday that a match she attended earlier this month between Bayern Munich and Boca Juniors, with a full and jammed stadium in South Florida playing host to that matchup, shows what could be possible in this country. “As an American, it was one of the coolest experiences of my life to witness that passion and energy,” Heath — during a FIFA briefing with the technical group — said. You could feel it, and the fans were absolutely incredible. So, I know the power of these home competitions. … I know the power of these games in our country, to change the landscape of this game in our country.” “This is a fantastic dress rehearsal for us,” Heath said. Only one U.S.-based team made the knockout stage: Messi's Inter Miami, though some wonder if that's a club that will have a true pronounced effect on soccer in this country. Messi is the biggest name in the sport and has an enormous following everywhere, one that obviously existed long before he came to Miami two years ago. “Messi has not the best data of this tournament, but he's certainly the most influential player of this tournament — because without him Inter Miami would never qualify,” Wenger said. The level of data collected from these matches is beyond deep; reports are more than 50 pages thick and measure everything from time it takes a team to recover possession after a giveaway to how hard players are sprinting at key times of a match. There have been comments — and in some cases, complaints — about conditions from European clubs, particularly about fields in Charlotte and Orlando, Wenger said. “I've been personally on the pitch at Orlando,” Wenger said. In my opinion, the pitch was a little bit soft and not dry, but the ball was not traveling as fast as we are used to. This is my impression, my feeling,” Borussia Dortmund coach Niko Kovac said after his team played a scoreless draw there earlier in the tournament against Fluminense.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jurgen Klopp has said the expanded Club World Cup “is the worst idea ever implemented in football” in relation to football's calendar and restricted time for player development. Former Liverpool boss Klopp, now head of global soccer at Red Bull (RB Salzburg competed in this year's Club World Cup but were eliminated in the group stage), raised the tournament's introduction when asked about developing players, and also drew on the volume of matches they play and the likelihood of increased injury risk. Speaking specifically on player workload, Klopp said: “Last year we had the Copa America and European Championship, this year the Club World Cup and next year then the World Cup. “This does not mean any real recovery for the players who are there, neither physically nor mentally. This is what (Liverpool defender) Virgil van Dijk got in his entire career.” Red Bull Salzburg were positive about their involvement in the Club World Cup and following their elimination after a 3-0 defeat to Real Madrid on Friday, they posted on social media thanking the tournament and calling it an ‘unforgettable journey.' In contrast to Klopp's opinion, Pep Guardiola said: “I [have] the feeling that it's a privilege to be here — for the people that say, “But it's so annoying, why should [you] be here?” — but once you are here, it's a privilege because in four years' time — four years time isn't going to happen again — and to be in four years time to happen again, you have to win big, big prizes. “I don't know what's going to happen. And once we are here, I love when I see Botafogo [de Futebol e Regatas], Fluminense [FC], all the Brazilian teams, Argentinian teams, and how they celebrate the goals, how they are together. :what he meant was “their fans are more numerous here than the European ones”]. We have to live with that competition.” Ahead of the tournament, FIFPro — the global representative organisation of player unions to ensure their collective recognition — called for the introduction of a mandatory four-week off-season break to safeguard against excessive workloads at the elite level and ease a congested football calendar. Concerns have also been raised regarding the heat in which Club World Cup matches are being played. (Joerg Mitter/Red Bull Content Pool via Getty Images)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FIFA Club World Cup now advances to the round of 16, showcasing a diverse array of teams from 10 different countries. According to the Associated Press, there have been one million empty seats during the group stage of the tournament, even though the world's top clubs are participating. This is despite FIFA claiming it has sold about 1.5 million tickets for the group stage. The organization says fans from more than 130 countries have purchased Club World Cup tickets, with a majority of the sales coming from the United States. This has sparked curiosity about how the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted in North America next year, will turn out. "FIFA is proud of the unique and multicultural atmosphere and support this new competition has already generated – and thanks every fan who has brought their voice, passion, and presence as the FIFA Club World Cup continues to grow into the undisputed pinnacle of global club football," FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a statement. The Round of 16 teams include Fluminense, Al Hilal, Inter Miami CF, Monterrey, Palmeiras, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Chelsea, Benfica, Inter Milan, Bayern Munich, Botafogo, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Flamengo, and Manchester City. The Round of 16 kicks off on Saturday, June 28. All rounds of the 16 matches of the Club World Cup will be available for free streaming on DAZN, and select games will also be broadcast in English on TNT. Univision, TUDN, and ViX will all carry games in the U.S. in Spanish.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jurgen Klopp often complained about players' workload and fixture congestion during his time as Liverpool boss Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp believes the Club World Cup is "the worst idea ever implemented in football" because of "serious fears" over player welfare. The German is now Red Bull's head of global soccer and one of their teams, Red Bull Salzburg, qualified for this summer's tournament in the United States. This year's Club World Cup is the first to feature 32 teams and 48 games, and saw Salzburg knocked out in the group stage. During an exclusive interview with German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, Klopp talked about the expanded format and player development. That means no real recovery for the players involved, neither physically nor mentally." How Club World Cup is paying for Man City and Chelsea's summer signings Extreme heat, poor pitches & plenty of goals - Club World Cup reaches halfway stage In September, a week prior to suffering an ACL injury, Manchester City midfielder Rodri said players were close to going on strike because of the increase in games, while team-mate Manuel Akanji suggested he would have to retire aged 30 as a result of the lack of breaks in the calendar. In October, Fifpro filed a legal complaint with the European Commission over what it said was Fifa's "abuse of dominance", specifically related to the Club World Cup, and Fifpro representatives met with Fifa over the fixture calendar in January. Klopp added: "I have serious fears, that players will suffer injuries they've never had before next season. If not next season, then it will happen at the World Cup or afterwards. "We constantly expect the players to go into every game as if it were their last. Club World Cup organiser Fifa has been approached for comment. Senior Fifa sources told BBC Sport earlier this month the protection of player welfare has been at the core of decision-making, pointing to initiatives such as a fund for players, additional substitutes in competitions and permanent concussion substitutes. Florian Wirtz surpassed Darwin Nunez (£85m deal in 2022) to become Liverpool's most expensive signing The Reds have since spent big on recruitment, signing Germany midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen in a club-record £116m deal. "There's no question about it, that's an insane sum," said Klopp. "My part of football will always remain the game itself, but if you want to play at the top level, you can't train all your players yourself. Sometimes you need to get hold [of players from] somewhere else." Asked if Wirtz, 22, will establish himself at Anfield, Klopp added: "Yes, although of course I don't know exactly which position Arne has in mind for Florian. "He's an outstanding player who can give any club something great. Whether he'll make the reigning English champions even better remains to be seen." Where will Wirtz rank in list of most expensive signings? The 58-year-old remains adamant he will not return to coaching, even on a temporary basis, such as when German club RB Leipzig sacked Marco Rose in March. "It's about my role at Red Bull, where I'm not the sword of Damocles hanging over our coaches, true to the motto: I'll tell you how it's done, and if you don't understand, I'll do it myself. Red Bull didn't bring me in as a potential coach. Hutchinson puts England 2-0 up against Germany in final of U21 Euros Verstappen, Russell and Mercedes - what factors are at play?

Klopp, a long-term critic of the ever-expanding football calendar who is now working as head of global soccer for Red Bull, feels the timing and duration of the tournament in its new format heighten the risk of burnout and injuries for players. "This means no real recovery for the players who are there, neither physically nor mentally. This is what (Liverpool defender) Virgil van Dijk got in his entire career." Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The competition features representatives from across the world, including Manchester City and Chelsea this year, and is due to be held every four years. Before the start of this year's tournament, FIFPro, the representative organisation of global player unions, recommended a mandatory four-week off-season break for players to ease calendar congestion and protect player welfare. Analysis by Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol: They have been asking FIFA to set up a competition which is the equivalent of the Champions League but for clubs all around the world and that is what they have done. If it wasn't for the Club World Cup, a lot of these big European clubs would be going on big pre-season tours anyway. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Football seems to have turned into a 365-day-a-year sport. Jurgen Klopp is unhappy about it but I don't see what can be done about the fact that we are where we are. Manchester City have brought around 35 players and they seem to be enjoying it. I think it's been a very useful activity for them because they've been able to bed in new signings and new coaches. Finally, I would say to Jurgen Klopp, is it really the worst idea ever implemented in football? Is it worse than Liverpool being one of the clubs who tried to set up a European Super League? Yes of course, Jurgen Klopp has a point. But my personal opinion is that football doesn't belong to the big clubs in Western Europe.

The second knockout-stage fixture of the FIFA Club World Cup features a Chelsea side that has been unconvincing so far, up against a Benfica team that has grown stronger as the tournament has progressed. We'll also explain how to use a VPN if the match isn't available where you are. Premier League big guns Chelsea finished second in group D behind Flamengo, but its 3-1 defeat to the Brazilians emphasized how much Enzo Maresca's team is still very much a work in progress. Benfica meanwhile started slowly with a 2-2 draw with Argentina's Boca Juniors, but ended the group phase with a flourish after claiming a memorable 1-0 win over German giants Bayern Munich to set up this fixture. These two sides last faced in the 2013 Europa League final -- a match that saw defender Branislav Ivanović's stoppage time header clinch a 2-1 win for Chelsea. Norwegian winger Andreas Schjelderup's first-half goal was enough for Benfica to claim a vital 1-0 win over Bayern Munich last time out.

Head coach Katie Schoepfer's roster for Saturday's match features four NWSL players – Kimmi Ascanio (San Diego Wave), Micayla Johnson (Chicago Stars FC), KK Ream (Utah Royals) and Mak Whitham (Gotham FC). Current USWNT contributors Ally Sentnor and Naomi Girma played for the United States as U-17s. Sentnor scored six goals in eight caps, and Girma played every minute of the 2016 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup in Jordan. Rising stars like Gisele Thompson, Kerry Abello, Sam Meza and Angelina Anderson also represented the red, white and blue on the U-17 level.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's just us, don't be embarrassed. If you're a casual fan, you probably knew close to nothing of most of the non-European teams in the Club World Cup unless they were from your region, with the exception of Inter Miami (because, well, Lionel Messi). LAFC: Isn't that the team David Beckham played for? Urawa Red Diamonds: That's from Super Mario, right? Ulsan HD: Isn't that a brand of TV? (Maybe, but this Ulsan won the past two South Korean league titles.) You may have heard of Brazil's Flamengo, but might have equally been surprised there's no long-legged pink bird on their crest. (The name comes from the Portuguese word for Flemish and stems from a Rio de Janeiro neighborhood.) And admit it -- we're among friends -- you probably thought all three teams with the word "Al" in the name (Al Ain, Al Ahly and Al Hilal) were from Saudi Arabia, since we in the mainstream media keep talking about how the country is spending billions to attract the world's top players from Cristiano Ronaldo on down. It's just that this Al Ahly is from Egypt.) If you're a soccer nerd -- or someone who gets paid to do this, like me -- you know that many of these clubs are massive local institutions, and some were historically among the best in the world. But the Club World Cup isn't designed to attract soccer devotees, who will tune in anyway -- it's meant to reel in the casuals and one day grow into a legitimate little brother of that sporting, cultural and entertainment juggernaut we know as the men's World Cup. That's why it was so important to FIFA that the Club World Cup group phase not degenerate into a series of WWE-style squash-fests in which the European clubs cruised through to a quarterfinal set that looks like the UEFA Champions League, only played over a single set and on a different continent. While we could still get seven of eight UEFA quarterfinalists, by and large FIFA got its wish. Craig Burley explains why you can't use the Club World Cup to determine which sides are stronger than others. With the exception of New Zealand semi-pros Auckland City (who nevertheless also grabbed a 1-1 draw against Argentinian giants Boca Juniors), nobody looked woefully out of place -- no more than Southampton looked out of place in the Premier League last year anyway. Take Auckland out of the mix, and if you define blowout as a game decided by more than three goals, well, there were just four matches out of 45 that qualify as blowouts, and one of them was the all-European affair between Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid. (It could have been five out of six: Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns came darn close, finishing on four points.) As for those European juggernauts, three of the twelve (Atletico Madrid, Porto and -- ahem -- FC Salzburg) exited in the group stage. All but one of them (Manchester City) dropped points against non-European competition. Yeah, I've heard the argument that some UEFA teams weren't taking it seriously. I'm not sure that was the norm at all. I heard other arguments, too, about how it was unfair to the European teams that they had to play in hot conditions and how, for them, this tournament comes at the end of the season while for others it's in mid-season, so the players are fitter and less tired. The "Futbol Americas" crew discusses how Inter Miami should feel after late goals from Palmeiras result in the MLS side facing off against PSG. The heat factor is kind of nonsense. Sure, it's not fun playing in extreme conditions and the spectacle suffers, but is it really some weird, upset-causing leveler? We still see the best teams advancing. None of these clubs are accustomed to playing in extreme heat: those from hotter nations tend to play their games at night if they do play in the summer (and most don't). Sure, maybe it helped the South American sides a bit. But the seasons in Africa and Asia run on a fall-to-spring calendar, just like most of Europe. The soccer world is a smaller place than we previously thought.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When USA faces Costa Rica in Sunday's Gold Cup quarterfinals at U.S. Bank Stadium, the Americans can search for the players they need. That also might not be a bad thing. Yes, the USA is missing some of its biggest names. Not here (and possibly now in a spat with coach Mauricio Pochettino). Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Giovanni Reyna, Antonee Robinson — all not in the squad this time around, for reasons ranging from injury to fatigue to the Club World Cup. It crashed out of that Copa América in the group stage, despite playing at home. The Americans got beaten twice in this spring's Nations League finals, again at home. They'll be playing as many as three do-or-die games against motivated opposition, always with the slight undercurrent of chaos that CONCACAF matches bring. And so it might be good that this USA team has been shorn of a number of players who probably already know they'll be at the World Cup next year, no matter what happens. Pochettino's task as manager, since taking over last fall, has changed significantly, even during his short tenure. At the beginning, his goal was to build on what Gregg Berhalter had constructed during his time as manager — a team that had talent and some tactical coherence, but not quite enough to compete with top teams. As the winter wore on, though, his challenge had seemingly become more basic: find players who are willing to fight. In the re-telling, those teams were short on talent but long on spirit, and that combative, underdog mentality was enough to carry a bunch of college kids into the quarterfinals of the 2002 World Cup. Already, we've seen players who have taken a huge step forward. Diego Luna, from Real Salt Lake, has emerged as the type of ball-first playmaker the USA has seemingly needed — and has paired it with the kind of attitude Pochettino appreciates. In a January friendly against Costa Rica, Luna had his nose broken in a collision, but making just his second start for the USMNT, he insisted on going back onto the field. With his nose packed with gauze, he rushed back onto the field and immediately provided an assist, dramatically impressing the Argentine manager. It's already come to define what Pochettino is looking for in his USA team: players determined enough to be on the field that they'll stay in the game, injured, in a meaningless January friendly. The USA won all three games in the group stage, but was expected to have no trouble with Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti, and — to a lesser extent — Saudi Arabia. Costa Rica striker Manfred Ugalde, who has three goals in the tournament, will be suspended for this one due to yellow card accumulation. Neither of Canada's two Loons — striker Tani Oluwaseyi or goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair — played in the Canucks' final group-stage match, a win over El Salvador. Canadian coach Jesse Marsch had to sit upstairs for the first two matches of the tournament, after being suspended thanks to some screaming at the officials at March's Nations League finals, but he'll be on the sideline — demonstrative as ever — for this one. Jon Marthaler has been covering Minnesota soccer for more than 15 years, all the way back to the Minnesota Thunder. When USA faces Costa Rica in Sunday's Gold Cup quarterfinals at U.S. Bank Stadium, the Americans can search for the players they need. The U.S. named Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes and Charlie McAvoy as its first six players for the 2026 Olympics, avoiding goaltenders on the initial roster unveiled Monday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They went unblemished in the group stage, but now it's time to elevate their execution. The USMNT allowed just 1 goal in the group stage, beating Trinidad & Tobago, Saudi Arabia, and Haiti on their way to winning Group D. Tomorrow, their first test in the knockout stage begins when they face Costa Rica in the quarterfinals. The USMNT, despite the perfect 3-0-0 record in the group stage, still have some things that they can work on so they can perform better in this win or go home stage. We take a look at 3 things the team needs to do in order to take their game to the next level in this tournament. The USMNT scored eight goals across the three group stage matches, but five of them came in their opener against Trinidad & Tobago. When they had chances to score, it felt like the connections weren't quite there and the execution fell flat. With a new group of guys, that's going to happen. But, this tournament can be unforgiving, and the United States will not want to look back and have regret at scoring chances they messed up that could have made a difference. That means the strikers need to produce. The attacking midfielders and wingers have done pretty well, but everyone on the team has to elevate their finishing and concentrate on executing inside the penalty area to get open space and finish shots. That's especially true on defense, and it shows when the team attempts to start their offense from deep in their defensive third. The lone goal they've conceded came against Haiti when they were trying to play it out of the back and goalkeeper Matt Freese passed it directly to Haiti's Don Louicius, who immediately fired a shot into the net. There have been some more nervy moments on defense where the USMNT failed to quickly get the ball moving forward down the field, which signals that the best option for them is to not let the ball settle in their defensive third where mistakes can cost them. Each of these players are not just playing for a trophy this year. They're playing to be in the mix for a roster spot next summer at the World Cup. Who on this roster has the juice to elevate their game against Costa Rica and, should they win, in the later rounds of this tournament? The playing time is earned in practice, and future chances are earned through performances on the field. Which players will be ready for the bright lights of the Gold Cup knockout stage?</p>

Watching the U.S. National team blitz the Republic of Ireland 4-0 on Thursday night it provided a soothing balm on concerns. Several top Americans were missing, including Coloradans Mallory Swanson (pregnancy), Lindsey Heaps (rest after European schedule) and Sophia Wilson (pregnancy). Swanson, Wilson and Trinity Rodman, out with a back issue, form the Triple Espresso of USWNT. But the team remains caffeinated with an infusion of youth. Credit coach Emma Hayes for building out age classes in the federation and debuting 21 players over the last year — creating a bright future. The Ireland coach was saying it the other day, that you could make 15 to 20 changes on the U.S. team and be fine,” Julie Foudy, legendary U.S. player and current analyst for TNT Sports, told The Post. There is something charming about the women's team. They are in a transition period after moving on from high-profile players, yet they should be favored to win the FIFA World Cup in 2027 in Brazil. “Our standard is always the same. That is what has made this team so good over so many years even with so many new faces coming in,” USWNT standout defender Naomi Girma said. Denver's pro team begins play in the NWSL next March. The franchise, whose ownership group includes Peyton Manning, has secured more than 10,000 season tickets, setting a new league record. This is such a good soccer community. “It's just buzzing from the go. Nickelback would blush at the amount of clichés spewed. This tandem could work, with Wallace excelling at player relationships and Tenzer crunching numbers. If there is confusion on who is in charge and opposing GMs decide to phone Josh Kroenke instead, then this risky arrangement will backfire. On the Rox: After advising Walker Monfort to push for the firing of GM Bill Schmidt, a flurry of texts came in, panning the Rockies' business model. The front office is like a hot dog. One call I would make is to Dodgers vice president and assistant GM Alex Slater. He is known for his high baseball IQ, while operating with toughness and honesty. That's not His Name: Mets reliever Richard Lovelady requested to be called by his nickname, Dicky. Time to go back to his first choice, and if the big leagues don't work, join the Savannah Bananas.
