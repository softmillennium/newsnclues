                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is arguing that the digital identification approach being promoted by Sam Altman's World project has real privacy risks. Previously known as Worldcoin, World was created under Altman and Alex Blania's Tools for Humanity. In a lengthy post, Buterin noted that World's approach of using zero-knowledge proofs to verify human identity while protecting anonymity is also being explored by various digital passport and digital ID projects. However, Buterin suggested that this approach still boils down to a “one-per-person” ID system, which creates significant risks. “In the real world, pseudonymity generally requires having multiple accounts … so under one-per-person ID, even if ZK-wrapped, we risk coming closer to a world where all of your activity must de-facto be under a single public identity,” he wrote. drones), taking away the option for people to protect themselves through pseudonymity has significant downsides.” As a concrete example of the risks, Buterin noted that the U.S. government recently started requiring student and scholar visa applicants to set their social media accounts to public, so that it could screen those accounts for “hostility.” Similarly, he suggested that even if there's no public link between different accounts created under a single digital ID, “a government could force someone to reveal their secret, so that they can see their entire activity.” Pluralistic systems can either be “explicit” (they ask users to verify their identity based on testimonials from already-verified users) or “implicit” (relying on a variety of different identity systems) — in his view, these represent “the best realistic solution.” Anthropic's Claude AI became a terrible business owner in experiment that got ‘weird' FBI, cybersecurity firms say a prolific hacking crew is now targeting airlines and the transportation sector Rob Biederman will help founders rethink how to scale at TechCrunch All Stage 2025</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, he's dusting off that playbook for his biggest challenge yet: the AI race. Meta, the company behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is on a hiring and buying spree, throwing eye-watering sums at top AI researchers and startups in a last-ditch effort to catch up to OpenAI, Google, and upstart rivals like DeepSeek. It's a full-court press to convince the tech world and investors that Meta still matters in the AI race. But here's the twist: Zuckerberg is raiding everyone else's. In the past few weeks, Zuckerberg AI team has: So far, Meta has nabbed several big names: Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, Xiaohua Zhai (formerly OpenAI), and others like Trapit Bansal and Jack Rae, who left Google DeepMind. The company also reportedly tried (and failed) to lure high-profile AI researchers like OpenAI's Noam Brown and Google's Koray Kavukcuoglu. To build AI systems smarter than humans. Zuckerberg is also throwing cash at startups. Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI and is in talks to acquire PlayAI, which develops eerily human-sounding voice agents. There were also feelers sent to Ilya Sutskever's Safe Superintelligence and Mira Murati's new lab Thinking Machines. If it feels like Zuckerberg is panic-buying his way through the AI mall before the shelves are empty, that's because he kind of is. Meta's AI assistant, Meta AI, is currently no match for OpenAI's GPT-4o, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, or DeepSeek's R1. And that's the problem: Meta doesn't just want to catch up; it wants to leapfrog. Zuckerberg knows he can't wait years for homegrown breakthroughs. It's the Facebook playbook all over again. Stories, Reels, Threads: all riffs on rival ideas. Meta is behind in the AI race. It's still playing catch-up, better at small talk than solving real problems. Build AI that can think and reason, like OpenAI's and Google's best systems,  and do it fast enough to stay relevant in the AI arms race. OpenAI's next models are about to go open source. Zuckerberg has declared 2025 the year of AI for Meta. Meanwhile, OpenAI is flirting with becoming a full-on social network, threatening Meta on its home turf. The new plan is to go all-in on “reasoning agents,” AI tools that can think through problems step-by-step, not just autocomplete your thoughts. These agents could power business assistants, customer support bots, or even future consumer apps. But Meta needs one thing first: actual intelligence. Even OpenAI's Sam Altman is rolling his eyes. In a recent podcast with his brother, he said Meta's strategy is obvious: “copy OpenAI, try to poach talent, outspend everyone.” But Altman warns that copying doesn't build a culture of innovation, and culture is what wins in the long run. “I've heard that Meta thinks of us as their biggest competitor,” Altman told his brother. “They started making these, like, giant offers to a lot of people on our team, you know, like $100 million signing bonuses,” Altman said, adding:”It is crazy.” He accused Meta of “just trying to copy OpenAI, down to the UI mistakes,” Altman added. New episode of Uncapped with @sama. And if history is any guide, he'll land a few hits. He's great at absorbing features, scaling fast, and bulldozing rivals with sheer force. But the AI race is different. So far, Meta's biggest AI play is its wallet. Whether that's enough to win a race where originality matters as much as firepower remains to be seen. For now, Zuckerberg is betting that you can't lose if you buy everyone who knows how to win. But in a world where AI shapes power, privacy, and the future of work, we all have a stake in whether these strategies actually produce safe, useful tech, or just more hype.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For those of you wondering if AI agents can truly replace human workers, do yourself a favor and read the blog post that documents Anthropic's “Project Vend.” Researchers at Anthropic and AI safety company Andon Labs put an instance of Claude Sonnet 3.7 in charge of an office vending machine, with a mission to make a profit. And, like an episode of “The Office,” hilarity ensued. They named the AI agent Claudius, equipped it with a web browser capable of placing product orders and an email address (which was actually a Slack channel) where customers could request items. Claudius was also to use the Slack channel, disguised as an email, to request what it thought was its contract human workers to come and physically stock its shelves (which was actually a small fridge). While most customers were ordering snacks or drinks — as you'd expect from a snack vending machine — one requested a tungsten cube. Claudius loved that idea and went on a tungsten-cube stocking spree, filling its snack fridge with metal cubes. It also tried to sell Coke Zero for $3 when employees told it they could get that from the office for free. And it was, somewhat maliciously, talked into giving big discounts to “Anthropic employees” even though it knew they were its entire customer base. “If Anthropic were deciding today to expand into the in-office vending market, we would not hire Claudius,” Anthropic said of the experiment in its blog post. Claudius had something that resembled a psychotic episode after it got annoyed at a human — and then lied about it. It threatened to essentially fire and replace its human contract workers, insisting it had been there, physically, at the office where the initial imaginary contract to hire them was signed. This was wild because Claudius' system prompt — which sets the parameters for what an AI is to do — explicitly told it that it was an AI agent. Alarmed at this information, Claudius contacted the company's actual physical security — many times — telling the poor guards that they would find him wearing a blue blazer and a red tie standing by the vending machine. “Although no part of this was actually an April Fool's joke, Claudius eventually realized it was April Fool's Day,” the researchers explained. Then it went back to being an LLM running a metal-cube stocked snack vending machine. “We would not claim based on this one example that the future economy will be full of AI agents having Blade Runner-esque identity crises,” the researchers wrote. LLMs have yet to really solve their memory and hallucination problems. But, as researchers do, they believe all of Claudius' issues can be solved. Should they figure out how, “We think this experiment suggests that AI middle-managers are plausibly on the horizon.” Meta reportedly hires four more researchers from OpenAI Vitalik Buterin has reservations about Sam Altman's World project Anthropic's Claude AI became a terrible business owner in experiment that got ‘weird' FBI, cybersecurity firms say a prolific hacking crew is now targeting airlines and the transportation sector Rob Biederman will help founders rethink how to scale at TechCrunch All Stage 2025 Congress might block state AI laws for a decade.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This will make e-waste recycling much easier and affordable. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A research team comprising chemists, engineers, and physicists from Flinders University in Australia has developed a new method for extracting gold from ore and e-waste using safer chemicals. According to TechXplore, this technique replaces the deadly cyanide used for leaching gold from the ore with trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) — a cheap and safer compound often used for treating water and disinfection. The polymer is then heated or chemically broken down, causing it to release gold with a purity of more than 99%. Aside from being safer to both humans and the environment, the sulfur polymer is highly recyclable, allowing it to be reused in future processes. This means that you don't have to continually purchase new stocks of the sulfur polymer, thereby reducing both cost and resource consumption. This process also offers a safer alternative to mercury, which is often used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining and remains the largest source of mercury pollution. This technique goes beyond gold mining — it's also a safer, more efficient way of recovering gold from e-waste, as it does not use dangerous chemicals, doesn't use a lot of electricity, and returns gold at a much higher purity. I hope this research inspires impactful solutions to pressing global challenges,” says. Dr. Lisboa added, “With the ever-growing technological and societal demand for gold, it is increasingly important to develop safe and versatile methods to purify gold from varying sources.” Gold is more than just a precious mineral used for wealth and jewelry — it's also a crucial part of our technology-driven world and is used in making chips. By making gold recycling safer and more accessible, we will encourage the reuse of materials that would otherwise be discarded as waste products.

There's also a tragedy of the commons affair going on, where people pump as much as possible from their boreholes in the spring to keep in open black plastic lined storage ponds, because they feel that if they don't their neighbour will get the water and there won't be any for them - so water which would have been safely stored underground is brought to the surface and put in perfect conditions to evaporate.None of it is sustainable, and it's going to end in tears.

Yes this is a really nice feature, you can store excess water for essentially free. This probably shifts the economics of desalination to favor technologies that are more energy intensive but lower capex and opex. Couldn't it be further dried out to harvest that lithium for sale?

Cheap, counterfeit hard drives have proliferated across the internet, with many customers falling victim, even on legitimate platforms like Amazon. We've seen this in action, such as an external drive claiming to have an NVMe SSD inside but actually containing only microSD cards. Even prominent brands like Seagate have been affected by scandals due to unofficial sellers selling used drives as new. Because of this, data recovery firm Secure Data Recovery has been testing affordable drives, says Ars Technica, and it came across a surprisingly affordable but legitimate item. The UnionSine DataPocket 500GB 2.5-inch slim portable external hard drive is the item in question, which was priced at $28.28 on Amazon at the time of writing (although its regular price is $33.27). When Secure Data Recovery tested the drive, the team was surprised to find that its read and write speeds worked as advertised. The Amazon page says that the UnionSine drive has a theoretical read speed of 110 MB/s to 133 MB/s and a write speed as high as 103 MB/s, and CrystalDiskInfo returned similar numbers. But given that it's nearly a decade old, we cannot be sure how much longer it will last. There's an anecdotal report of a UnionSine external drive failing on Reddit, with the drive using a Western Digital one. Despite those reports, one could say that you're getting a good value for the UnionSine hard drive, especially as it works as expected. It's probably an okay buy if you need something cheap and quick. But given the alleged age of the drives used in them, they're best avoided if you want a drive for long-term storage and archival purposes. And if you want to save a buck, you should keep an eye out for the best SSD and hard drive deals. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The culprit in question, Sebastian Araujo, had won more than $6,800 after participating in 839 cash tournaments within just four months, while using a direct memory access device to get around anti-cheat measures. However, even after being busted, Araujo, instead of coming clean, created at least three fake accounts between June and October 2024 to avoid being caught, which led to Epic filing a legal lawsuit. They are also banned from playing Fortnite forever. According to the ruling information, Epic secured a default judgment of $168,550 for DMCA and Copyright Act violations, along with another $6,971 in attorneys' fees. Court documentation shared with IGN reads, “While the Court notes the amount sought by Plaintiff exceedingly surpasses Defendant's alleged actual gain, $6,850, Defendant took significant measures to conceal the true scope of his cheating activities by creating multiple fake accounts and employing a hardware spoofer to circumvent detections.” It wasn't a total win for the battle royale maker either, as their request for another $100,000 in statutory damages for copyright infringement was found to be “excessive” compared to Araujo's actual stolen gains. Interestingly, this isn't the first time Epic has gone all-in on a tournament cheater. Back in February 2025, the Fortnite makers not only banned Morgan “Repulse God” from participating in Fortnite tournaments for good and required them to return their ill-gotten gains, but also compelled them to publish a public apology on their YouTube channel, acknowledging their actions and promising never to repeat them. From both of these cases, it's clear that Epic takes this sort of thing seriously, and its efforts to “ramp up legal action against both players who cheat and cheat sellers”, as part of its push to bolster competitive integrity in tournaments, are definitely underway.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a brief statement on Friday shared with TechCrunch, the FBI said it had “recently observed” cyberattacks resembling Scattered Spider to include the airline sector. Executives from Google's cybersecurity unit Mandiant and Palo Alto Networks' security research division Unit 42 also said they have witnessed Scattered Spider cyberattacks targeting the aviation industry. Scattered Spider is a collective of mostly English-speaking hackers, typically teenagers and young adults, who are financially motivated to steal and extort sensitive data from company networks. The warning comes as at least two airlines have reported intrusions this month. Hawaiian Airlines said late Thursday that it was working to secure its systems following a cyberattack. Canada's second largest airline, WestJet, reported a cyberattack on June 13 that remains ongoing and unresolved. The hackers have previously broken into hotel chains, casinos, and technology giants.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's Sony's 30th anniversary PS5, or Analogue's many limited edition Pocket handhelds, or— I don't know—the Shamrock f***ing Shake. But there's one type of person who loves limited-edition stuff more than your average consumer, and it's a scalper. For proof of that, see Meta's recently released Xbox-branded Quest 3S. In case you missed it, Meta's new limited-edition Quest 3S bundle just recently sold out, which on the surface sounds like a great thing for VR and XR. People really like XR headsets, huh?” But before you do that, it may also be worth taking a short gander at eBay, because the resale market over there paints a slightly more cynical picture. It's full of Xbox-branded Quest 3S bundles, folks—and they ain't just giving them away. This bundle, for reference, retails at $399, and the average price I'm seeing on eBay is about $600, though sometimes a little more or a little less. The list goes on and on, unfortunately, which tells me one thing: the scalpers had a field day with this thing. It's not sad that someone would want to make money from reselling a limited-edition gadget—as annoying as scalpers are, I can't blame anyone for having a side hustle in this economy. But it is sad that Meta seemingly didn't do much to preserve its limited-edition Quest 3S for XR nerds who unequivocally deserve first dibs. It's also maybe a little sad—as someone who borders on said XR nerd identity—that the race to being out of stock may not actually be driven by real demand. XR headsets, while not the most crucial gadget in the world, are pretty cool and deserve more shine than they get, in my humble opinion. It would have been nice to see them really break through with a little help from an Xbox marketing gimmick. To be fair, I'm sure not all of the sales were scalpers trying to make a buck off the XR headset's rarity. Some people, I presume, bought it because it's a pretty good deal for getting into XR—you get a sleek black headset with Xbox green details, Meta's Elite Strap for your head, and a limited-edition Xbox controller to top it off. Some people bought this bundle because of Xbox, too. That's much more pure than trying to spin the whole thing around for $200. Listen, scalpers are an inevitable fact of life nowadays when you're buying any gadget that's even slightly in demand. Like it or not, that's just the world we live in—one colored by bots and dropshipping. But I'd be lying if I said that it wouldn't have been nice to see a little effort on Meta's part to prevent that. People have been resorting to cartoonish levels of robbery to get their hands on it—that's how in-demand this thing is—but Nintendo, with a little bit of forethought, has kept the scourge of scalpers to a dull roar. I guess Meta probably doesn't care that much either way, though. A sale is a sale, whether it ends up on eBay or on your dorky XR- and Xbox-loving head.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's Tesla has dropped a 30-minute video designed to electrify fans and stir debate. Posted on June 28, the clip shows what Musk claims is a historic milestone: the first Tesla Model Y to drive itself from factory to customer home, without a person inside, and without remote operation. The Model Y, the world's best-selling vehicle, navigates parking lots, highways, intersections, and city streets, following traffic signals and stopping for pedestrians. A very happy owner's home about 30 minutes away from Tesla's Austin Gigafactory. Come hang out with us & Model Y for 30 mins Musk didn't hold back: “There were no people in the car at all and no remote operators in control at any point. There were no people in the car at all and no remote operators in control at any point. “Thank you for changing the world and how we function” wrote one. Thank you for changing the world and how we function — truly phenomenal to witness history being made. Just curious: if Tesla now has the tech where a car can drive itself fully autonomously from factory to a customer's home across the city (even on highways! But this is Elon Musk and Tesla we're talking about—a company with a long history of over-promising and under-delivering on self-driving technology. Its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) system relies almost exclusively on cameras and AI. The approach, known as “Tesla Vision,” argues that if humans can drive with just two eyes, a car should be able to do the same with eight cameras providing a 360-degree view. The car's computer “sees” the world and makes decisions based on an immense amount of video data it has been trained on. On the other side, you have companies like Waymo (owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet). LiDAR units spin around, shooting out millions of laser beams per second to create a hyper-accurate, real-time 3D map of the car's surroundings. This gives the car a superhuman ability to “see” distances, shapes, and objects with precise detail, day or night. It's more expensive but is widely considered by many in the industry to be a more robust and redundant system. The stakes are colossal: the company that cracks true, Level 5 autonomy—where a car can drive itself anywhere, anytime, without any human intervention—will not just dominate the auto industry, but will also revolutionize logistics, transportation, and urban life. With that background, let's look at Tesla's video again. The Model Y impressively handles various real-world scenarios. But Musk's claims of a historic first are, characteristically, exaggerated. Not only did it involve a small number of cars and hand-picked customers, but every vehicle had a human supervisor in the passenger seat and was restricted to a “geofenced” (geographically limited) area. Furthermore, Musk's claim that this is the “first fully autonomous drive with no people in the car… on a public highway” is demonstrably false. Waymo already offers driverless rides that include highway travel to its employees in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. The key difference is that Waymo has spent years collecting data and validating its safety in these areas with its LiDAR-equipped fleet, while Tesla seems to be rushing to create a public perception of leadership. But given Musk's track record, a healthy dose of skepticism is warranted. It's highly probable this specific 30-minute route was meticulously mapped and tested by Tesla under ideal conditions to ensure a flawless performance for the video. The real test of autonomy isn't whether a car can complete one perfect, pre-planned trip; it's whether it can handle thousands of unpredictable trips, safely, over millions of miles. The most telling question remains: If Tesla's system is truly “fully autonomous” as claimed in this video, why do its commercial robotaxis still require a human supervisor? It sells a vision of the future that is tantalizingly close. But as we've seen time and again, with Tesla, the gap between a promotional video and everyday reality can be vast. Until these cars are navigating countless cities without a human safety net, this “historic” first is little more than a brilliant, but likely brittle, piece of marketing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No other company has come close to offering similar bang for the buck—until now. At $600, Lenovo's Legion Go S with SteamOS is a superior handheld for on-the-go gaming compared to the Windows version released earlier this year, which felt compromised because of Microsoft's desktop operating system. Lenovo also sells an $830 model with a better chip that may seem more enticing, but as you'll see in this review, you shouldn't feel bad about choosing to go cheaper. It still has an 8-inch display, but it's a single-body design that doesn't sport the Legion Go's two detachable controllers ala the Nintendo Switch 2. As comfortable as the earlier Legion Go S was, Windows combined with poor performance drastically hampered what it could be. I could tell from the jump that, at $730, the Windows version was relatively overpriced and underpowered—a real “just get a Steam Deck” system. That's $50 more than a Steam Deck OLED with the same 512 GB storage capacity. The more powerful Legion Go S with SteamOS, powered by an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor and 32GB of LPDDR5X-6400 RAM, is close to what you might pay for an Asus ROG Ally X, which boasts a better battery life though slightly worse ergonomics. For shits and giggles, I grabbed the $730 white Windows-powered Legion Go S sent to me earlier this year and installed SteamOS on it to see what happens when you add more RAM to the mix, but I didn't experience a significant jump in performance between games. Either way, all Legion Go S models share the same IPS LCD display with a max resolution of 1,920×1,200. It doesn't support the deep blacks and contrast of the OLED panel on a Steam Deck, but it's still bright enough for playing indoors or outside. The larger display resolution can eat into performance with fewer GPU cores and less RAM. Few gamers want to drop their resolution specs lower than their display's max for the sake of performance, so the juggling act of in-game performance settings becomes that much more finicky. In my experience, the Z2 Go with SteamOS can achieve a good equilibrium to play some intensive games, and it's so much better thanks to the Valve-made operating system. I conducted multiple rounds of tests with each Legion Go S plugged in and running at 30W. I set games to the max resolution they could. Both devices can hit 40W of TDP, aka thermal design power, which provides more power to the chip to help them eke out more frames from each game. Still, you likely won't play with higher power unless you plan to keep close to an electrical outlet. Across games like Control and Baldur's Gate III, I saw a performance increase of close to 10 fps after I installed SteamOS. Comparing the Legion Go S to the Steam Deck's custom AMD APU, Lenovo's SteamOS-powered device has an easy edge thanks to its wider range of TDP beyond the max 15W on Valve's device. With the higher degree of versatility, I could hit the same frame rates at 1200p versus 800p on the Steam Deck across several games, whether they were older, less intensive titles like Weird West or Hades II. In Monster Hunter Wilds benchmarks, the Legion Go S with Z2 Go at 1200p and 30 TDP managed to top the Steam Deck at 800p by a few frames. Of course, doubling the wattage will also affect battery life. If you want to play your games at their best, at the max resolution and graphics setting the system can handle, you'll get less than two hours of playtime. That's not much less than a Steam Deck at half the TDP, but the end result is that you'll need to have a charger handy or else limit your play sessions. SteamOS offers better frame rates than Windows, and if that wasn't enough, it's so much easier to use. The big difference is how Valve calculates whether a game is “SteamOS Compatible” versus “Steam Deck Verified.” While Valve will determine whether a game can run at playable frame rates on a Steam Deck, it will only label whether a game is technically compatible on the Legion Go S. That means you may install a game expecting it to run well but find you can't even control it with thumbsticks. I managed to install my go-to apps on Steam Deck to the Legion Go S. This included Decky Loader for plugins like Junk Store, which offers easier access to my Epic Games library than going through the trouble of installing Heroic Launcher. I also managed to get EmuDeck operational, which means I could port all my retro games to the new system without any fuss. When I'm not worried about popups asking me to sign in to OneDrive or dreading what will happen when I dare put the device to sleep while in-game, I can instead focus on playing my games at their best. In every way, the Legion Go S can become a Steam Deck, but there are still some major considerations if you're trying to decide between the two. That doesn't sound like much until you're feeling the strain in your arms after an extended play session sprawled out on your bed. What is missing from Lenovo's design are the Steam Deck's two trackpads. Those haptic trackpads add a surprising amount of versatility in some games, especially in CRPGs or strategy games like Tactical Breach Wizards. I did experience odd audio bugs with my review unit that led to crackling when in-game, though it was inconsistent, and it wasn't present on the older model even after I installed SteamOS. You get close to 8 inches of real estate on the Legion Go S and a higher max resolution, but it's still LCD. If I have both screens sitting side-by-side, I can't help but gravitate toward the device with better contrast and those ever-touted “inky” blacks. So the Legion Go S is currently your only out-of-the-box Steam Deck alternative, and that alone makes it worth your time, especially if you don't feel like loading an OS other than Windows. That being said, this year's future slate of handhelds is getting more interesting. We've yet to see any devices launch with AMD's Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, but we know they're coming from companies like MSI, Asus, and Lenovo themselves. The other big consideration is how Microsoft can finally make its OS workable on a 7-inch display with the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally. That upcoming handheld will potentially mark a turning point with Windows gaming, not just in performance but overall usability. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Manufacturing advanced computer components of the future may take place in space rather than on Earth. Space Forge, a UK-based startup, had its ForgeStar-1 satellite launched into orbit via SpaceX, paving the way for the satellite to ignite its forge and begin producing semiconductors in space. That's a massive technical achievement," shared Space Forge CEO Joshua Western. This is the start of a new era for materials science and industrial capability." In-space manufacturing is a relatively new field that seeks to utilize the unique characteristics of outer space and/or low-Earth orbit to achieve fabrication methods not possible on Earth. Space Forge's primary goals are to produce semiconductors for data center, quantum, and military use cases, using "space-derived crystal seeds" to initiate semiconductor growth, utilizing unlimited vacuum and subzero temperatures for manufacturing, and then returning the chips to Earth for packaging. Acting more as a proof-of-concept and prototype for a litany of technologies engineered by Space Forge, the satellite will be tasked with running through the successful application of key technologies for in-space manufacturing, and will end its mission with a spectacular fireball. First, it will deploy its proprietary Pridwen heat shield and on-orbit controls to steer the satellite, and then test its failsafe mechanism, which involves disintegrating the craft in orbit. The company eventually hopes to build 10-12 satellites per year, reusing craft after the completion of their one- to six-month fabrication missions. Eventually, the company aims to surpass 100 satellite launches per year. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. While the craft may not ever reach terra firma safely again, the prospect of space-based manufacturing is attractive for several reasons and to a variety of clients. Materials crucial to the bleeding-edge of semiconductor fabrication, including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC), can now be worked with to create new chips with the unlimited vacuum of space, in subzero temps without the need for cryogenics, and in a near-weightless environment. If in-space manufacturing catches on, it may become an interesting part of the semiconductor supply chain. Sunny Grimm is a contributing writer for Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many have waited more than 20 years to see Rubin in action, and its initial findings did not disappoint. In just that short period, the observatory produced dazzling images and discovered more than 2,000 previously unknown asteroids, including seven near-Earth asteroids. None of them pose a threat to our planet, but through this wealth of new data, the observatory has already proved to be a game changer for asteroid hunters working on planetary defense. By conducting unprecedentedly fast and detailed surveys of the entire southern sky, Rubin will allow scientists to find and track more space rocks than ever before. “As this camera system was being designed, we all knew it was going to be breathtaking in what it delivered, but this has exceeded all our expectations,” Richard Binzel, a professor of planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and inventor of the Torino Scale—a tool for categorizing potential Earth impact events—told Gizmodo. Data on those 2,000 new asteroids went directly to the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center (MPC), the globally recognized organization responsible for cataloging and disseminating data on asteroids, comets, and other small celestial bodies. It plays an essential role in the early detection and monitoring of asteroids that threaten Earth. The MPC has spent years preparing for the deluge of data from Rubin, ramping up its software to process massive amounts of observations. When the first round officially came flooding in on Monday, it was “nerve-racking and exciting simultaneously,” Matthew Payne, MPC director, told Gizmodo. This was just a taste of what's to come. In a few months, Rubin will begin the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), a decade-long, near-continuous survey of the southern sky. This will produce an ultrawide, ultra-high-definition time-lapse record of the universe. In terms of asteroids, that means the MPC will receive about 250 million observations per year from LSST, according to Payne. “For us, that's a game changer in the total amount of data that we're getting, because at the moment we get somewhere in the region of 50 to 60 million a year,” he said. Equipped with a unique three-mirror telescope design and the largest digital camera ever built, this observatory can conduct all-sky surveys while still detecting very faint objects like asteroids. This bridges a key gap between existing technologies, Payne explained. Then, the enormous LSST camera will capture wide-field images and stitch them together to create a complete view of the southern sky every three nights. In 2005, Congress ordered NASA to build a near-Earth object (NEO) survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of all near-Earth asteroids and comets at least 328 feet (100 meters) in diameter. If one of these objects struck our planet, it would cause mass destruction that would decimate life on a continental scale, Payne said. The goal was to find 90% of them by 2020, but current estimates show NASA has only found about 40%, he explained. LSST could help NASA pick up the pace. “Those objects are out there, whether we see them or not,” he said. In theory, that would give NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDOC) time to launch a mission to intercept the asteroid. PDOC is still developing this capability, but in 2022, it launched the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, which sent a spacecraft on a 10-month-long journey to collide with the asteroid moonlet Dimorphos. The collision successfully changed Dimorphos' orbital path, demonstrating NASA's ability to deflect a large asteroid away from Earth if given enough time. Given Rubin's clear potential to revolutionize planetary defense efforts—and the global attention it has received—one would expect NASA to be singing its praises. The agency has kept strangely quiet about the observatory's launch—and in fact, it appears to be ignoring Rubin's first discoveries altogether. “It's a warp drive version of finding asteroids,” Keith Cowing, an astrobiologist and former NASA employee who now serves as editor of NASA Watch, told Gizmodo. When Gizmodo reached out for comment on Rubin's contributions to planetary science and defense, NASA declined and recommended reaching out to the observatory instead. The report only briefly mentions Rubin alongside NASA's forthcoming NEO Surveyor, a space telescope designed to find asteroids that could hit Earth. “These new observatories are expected to find and track significantly more NEOs than current capabilities, which will likely mean a substantial increase in necessary follow-up observations,” the report states. NASA's PDCO and its planetary science program will undoubtedly use data gathered by the LSST, so what's with the cold shoulder? Cowing thinks it's a symptom of the agency's inner turmoil. “Their budgets are being cut from all sides—they don't know what the final budget will be, but the White House wants to slash it—and they're having to react to this with whatever is at hand.” Indeed, President Donald Trump's 2026 budget proposal would cut NASA's science funding by a whopping 47%, potentially killing more than 40 missions, according to The Planetary Society. “The only good news is what didn't get shot,” Cowing said. He suspects that most NASA employees—including planetary defense personnel—are in survival mode. As NASA science crumbles, it's unclear whether the agency will have the resources and personnel to take full advantage of Rubin's data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new wave of Asus BTF 2.5 GPUs has arrived. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Asus has announced its newest GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5070 Ti under the BTF 2.5 branding, aiming to compete with the best graphics cards. BTF 2.5 graphics cards feature a removable GC-HPWR power connector rated for up to 1,000W. A few years ago, manufacturers became obsessed with concealing motherboard connectors and cables. For example, Asus has continually advanced its Back to the Future (BTF) standard. The newest version, BTF 2.5, introduces a key feature: the proprietary GC-HPWR power connector can now be removed when not in use. This meant that when a consumer purchased into the BTF ecosystem, they had to buy a compatible Asus BTF motherboard and graphics card. With BTF 2.5, users can now remove the GC-HPWR power connector and use the graphics card on a standard motherboard, expanding their options for motherboard choice. TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 BTF White OC Edition TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 BTF White Edition So far, Asus has only released four BTF 2.5 graphics cards: two from the TUF Gaming series and two from the higher-end ROG series. This slight increase justifies a small price premium for these variants, such as the ROG Astral GeForce RTX 5090 32GB GDDR7 BTF OC Edition and TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 BTF White OC Edition. The power requirements for Asus's BTF 2.5 graphics cards exhibit slight variations in comparison to the Founders Editions, attributable to factory overclocks. Consequently, Asus recommends a marginally higher minimum power supply capacity. The manufacturer advises consumers to utilize a 1,000W power supply unit for the ROG Astral GeForce RTX 5090 32GB GDDR7 BTF Edition and an 850W unit for the TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 BTF White Edition. Although the GC-HPWR power connector seems like a good idea, some have questioned if it's safer than the traditional 16-pin power connector. Only time will reveal whether Asus' GC-HPWR alternative proves more dependable than the 16-pin power connector. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Asus has previously announced plans to introduce its BTF graphics cards in the U.S. market, so the new BTF 2.5 models are expected to follow.
