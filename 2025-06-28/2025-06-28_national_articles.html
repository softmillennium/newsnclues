Tourists at Yellowstone National Park witnessed a bison's tragic death on June 21, when the animal fell into the near-boiling waters of the Grand Prismatic Spring at Midway Geyser Basin, near Old Faithful. A witness who posted photos of the incident on social media said the bison took a few steps into a shallow area before turning around and stepping out quickly. The animal then apparently paused before turning back and stepping into a deeper area, where it became trapped and was unable to free itself. It took a few steps into a shallow area to the right of the pool, it turned around and stepped out very quickly. It stood for a moment, then turned back towards the spring and stepped into a deeper section then couldn't get out despite trying its best. I have a video of it coming up to take its last breath but it's a tough watch," Louise Howard wrote in a Facebook post with the photos. Howard told CBS News that "as hard as it tried, it couldn't get out." Michael Poland, the scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, told CBS News that while it is rare, it is not unheard of for animals to fall into hot springs. He said scientists have found skeletons at hot springs in the park. Sign warning Yellowstone visitors not to go near wildlife. "This bison carcass is basically sitting in a pool of nearly boiling water, and ... that boiling water will eat away at the organic material, the tissues, and eventually there will just be some bone," Poland said, according to NBC News. The Grand Prismatic Spring is 300 feet wide, and its waters can reach up to 192 degrees Fahrenheit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Israeli hostage rallies: Anti-war demonstrators and the families of Israeli hostages are protesting in Tel Aviv to demand a ceasefire in Gaza following the truce between Israel and Iran, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seize a “historic window of opportunity” to bring remaining hostages home. • Trump's Middle East diplomacy: Many of the rallygoers are making direct appeals to US President Donald Trump to intervene in the conflict. Trump helped broker the Israel-Iran truce and his administration has quietly aimed to revive nuclear talks with Tehran, though he has also exchanged sharp words with top Iranian officials, casting doubt on the diplomatic path forward. • Funerals in Iran: Hundreds of thousands of mourners gathered in Tehran earlier Saturday for the state funerals of top military officials, nuclear scientists, and women and children killed by Israeli attacks during this month's 12-day conflict. Ayman Odeh, an Arab lawmaker in Israel facing impeachment proceedings, called for unity and a ceasefire at an anti-war protest in Kfar Saba, central Israel. In an appeal to the crowd, Odeh said, “I am your partner. Yes, there are differences, there are disagreements, but I want you to know: I am your partner, because my soul still yearns for freedom. In a subsequent defense of the post, Odeh said many of the prisoners released were minors who had not been charged with any crime. “While it is clear that many of you tend to see primarily the Jewish suffering, I see and feel the suffering of both peoples,” Odeh said. “After so much death, suffering, and tears, better days will come. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum estimated that 30,000 people came out. One sign said, “President Trump, end the crisis in Gaza! CNN's Nic Robertson reports from Tel Aviv where tens of thousands of anti-war protesters packed Hostages Square to call for an end to the Gaza war and the return of the remaining hostages. “How much more blood will be spilled before the guilty one goes?” read another. At Alonim Junction in northern Israel, demonstrators held up hands covered in red paint and chanted, “We have no soldiers for the wars for Netanyahu's welfare.” In the central Israeli city of Ness Ziona, protesters held a large banner that simply said: “End this f***ing war.” The hostages held in Gaza for more than 630 days of war should not be treated as “bargaining chips,” said Israeli lawmaker Yair Golan on Saturday, calling for a ceasefire and hostage deal at an anti-government protest in Haifa. They are our brothers and sisters,” said Golan, head of the left-wing Democrats party. “The soldiers fighting in Gaza are our sons and daughters. And anyone who does not place their return at the top of the national priority list — is neither a Zionist nor worthy of leadership.” Golan, who has been sharply critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, added that Israel's ongoing war in Gaza “serves only the survival of the coalition.” The country's ceasefire with Iran, achieved after 12 days of conflict, has led to a renewed push from mediators to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Protesters across Israel — forbidden from organizing their demonstrations for the last two weeks because of emergency guidelines during the conflict with Iran — are now packing the streets of major cities in Israel, including Tel Aviv and Haifa. Viki Cohen, mother of 20-year-old Nimrod Cohen, told CNN she feels there is “momentum” now to end the war and to bring all of the hostages home. Trump is very demanding and we believe in him. And we know he has the power to stop the war,” Cohen said as she prepared to participate in a protest in Tel Aviv. Trump said Friday he believes a ceasefire will be agreed to in Gaza “within the next week.” We finished with Hezbollah, so now there is no threat, and it's time to finish the war in Gaza and to bring them all home.” One mother showed CNN's Fred Pleitgen a band on her baby's head, which she said is a “symbol saluting Imam Hossein … who's the leader of all the oppressed who stand against oppressors and don't submit.” “The Iranian nation should know that the reason for the conflict with America is that they want Iran to surrender,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wrote in a post on his Farsi-language X account, echoing a portion of a previous statement. A top Iranian commander whose disappearance from public view after Israeli attacks sparked rumors he'd been killed attended Saturday's funeral procession in Iran's capital. Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani, thought to be a close aide to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was seen among the crowds in Tehran at the state funerals being interviewed on camera. Asked by a reporter if he had a message for the people of Iran, Qaani said that “we have been successful so far, and from now on we will also move forward successfully.” Meanwhile, Ali Shamkhani — another high-profile Iranian military and political official previously thought to be dead — also appeared at Saturday's state funerals, according to pictures published by Iranian state media. Iran's president thanked citizens for turning out to mourn those killed in the 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran that ended with a US-brokered ceasefire. “I sincerely thank you, dear people,” Masoud Pezeshkian wrote in a post on X Saturday. He added that “serving such a free-spirited nation is the honor of my life.” A host of senior Iranian officials joined the mass mourning in Tehran on Saturday for those killed in Israel's attacks, but Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was absent. Khamenei, who has not appeared in public since the start of Iran's conflict with Israel, did not immediately issue a statement regarding the state funeral, which was held for 60 top military officials, nuclear scientists, and women and children killed in the 12-day conflict. The chief of staff of Iran's Armed Forces, Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, was also not seen at the ceremony, but issued a statement praising people for showing up to what he described as a “unique and multi-million-strong funeral.” Senior officials in attendance included Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Khamenei. This post has been updated to reflect Mousavi's statement. Sixty coffins made their way through Tehran, carrying military leaders, nuclear scientists and civilians killed in Israeli attacks this month, CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports. Attendees said they wanted to honor those who were killed, but also vowed revenge on both Israel and the US. The remains of Hassan Salehi, who was killed in an Israeli attack on Iran's Evin prison, have arrived at Behesht-e Zahra, the largest cemetery in Tehran, Iran's semi-official state news agency Tasnim reported. Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's closest confidants, is set to visit Washington, DC on Monday, according to a source familiar with the planning. The visit comes ahead of a meeting between Netanyahu and President Donald Trump. On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said there is no set date for a Netanyahu visit, but Trump is “very open” to it. This past week, Trump denounced an ongoing corruption trial against Netanyahu as a “witch hunt” in a social media post, which was hailed by allies of the long-time Israeli leader. Hundreds of thousands filled the streets of Tehran on Saturday to commemorate the senior military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians killed during Iran's 12-day conflict with Israel. As mourners clad in all black chanted death to Israel and America, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi acknowledged the loss of lives was “hard and painful” but pledged the nation would return to “new glory.” The company said that customers connecting through Dubai with final destinations in Iran “will not be accepted for travel at their point of origin until further notice.” “We apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers. We continue to closely monitor developments,” the company said in a statement. The IDF says they spotted Israeli civilians driving toward a closed military zone near the Palestinian village of Kafr Malik, where days earlier settlers set fire to homes and vehicles in an attack Palestinian officials say killed three people. Six suspects were apprehended and transferred to police, the IDF said. “The IDF and Israel Police condemn any act of violence against security forces and will act firmly against any attempt to harm security personnel carrying out their duty to protect Israeli citizens,” the IDF said in a statement. Some background: Israel has been ramping up military operations in the West Bank alongside the offensive in Gaza and attacks on Iran and its proxies, displacing thousands of Palestinians and razing entire communities as it targets what it says are militants operating in the territory. The Israeli military said that “terrorists hurled explosive devices at IDF forces.” Speaking on the day of state funerals for those killed in Israeli strikes, Iran's foreign minister said that the loss of lives is “hard and painful” but their “memory will live on.” Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, in a post on Instagram Saturday, stressed that the “pride of a nation is paramount” as he pledged that Iran would return to “new glory and greater strength” following its 12-day conflict with Israel. He added that the 60 who were killed and whose bodies were laid to rest Saturday – in an event which saw hundreds of thousands line the streets of Tehran – gave their “blood” but did not surrender their honor. Top military commanders, scientists and civilians were killed in the brief and bloody conflict, which Israel said aimed at preventing Iran developing a nuclear weapon. Tehran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. US officials believe Isfahan's underground structures house nearly 60% of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile, which Iran would need in order to ever produce a nuclear weapon. US B2 bombers dropped over a dozen bunker-buster bombs on Iran's Fordow and Natanz nuclear sites. But Isfahan was only struck by Tomahawk missiles launched from a US submarine. Most of those attending were dressed entirely in black, trying to touch the coffins that were placed on several large trucks for the procession. “My message to Trump is: God willing, you will die! Because you attacked Iran,” said one man who attended. The funerals on Saturday were for a total of 60 people killed in Israeli attacks, according to state-affiliated media. These included Hossein Salami, who had served as head of the secretive Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and was one the most powerful men in Iran, Mohammad Bagheri, who had served as the chief of staff of Iran's armed forces, as well as Amir Ali Hajizadeh, former commander of the IRGC's Air Force. A high-profile Iranian military and political official previously thought to be dead appeared at a state funeral Saturday for those slain during the 12-day conflict with Israel, according to pictures published by Iranian state media. Ali Shamkhani, a close aide to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was reported dead by Israel and by Iranian media following Israel's unprecedented strikes on Iran on June 13. Iranian media later reported Shamkhani was still alive, publishing a message to Khamenei reportedly from Shamkhani which read “I am alive and ready to sacrifice myself.” On Saturday, Shamkhani was seen pictured in photos published by Iranian state media outlets at the mass funeral in Tehran, leaning on a walking stick, flanked by four other men. Some background: Shamkhani previously served as Iran's top national security official and held senior roles in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the ministry of defense.</p>

BYU quarterback Jake Retzlaff has denied allegations he sexually assaulted a woman in 2023, according to newly filed court documents. Retzlaff, 22, is being sued for alleged battery, assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress from an alleged assault at Retzlaff's apartment in November 2023, according to a lawsuit filed in Utah last month. BYU quarterback Jake Retzlaff passes in the first half of a game against Utah Nov. 9, 2024, in Salt Lake City. The woman, identified as Jane Doe A.G., claimed to have met the college football player on social media before agreeing to visit him at his apartment to play video games, ESPN reported. The original complaint alleged that after the alleged victim attempted to leave, Retzlaff put his hands around her neck and raped her, ESPN reported. In new filings Friday, Retzlaff denied the allegations and claimed the two had engaged in consensual sex.

Padraig Harrington does not take the unwritten rules of golf lightly. That was apparent after the three-time major winner got into a heated conversation with former PGA Tour pro Roger Maltbie during the second round of the U.S. Senior Open on Friday. The dispute between the two golfers was captured on video and appeared to be a matter of golf etiquette. Padraig Harrington watches his tee shot on the ninth hole during Kaulig Companies Championship: Pro-Am at Firestone Country Club on Wednesday, June 18, 2025, in Akron. In a video posted by KOAA reporter Brett Forrest, Harrington can be heard saying, "Never on a golf course stand and look at somebody looking for a golf ball." Maltbie, a five-time PGA Tour winner and current on-course analyst for NBC, appeared to push back, but Harrington was unrelenting. "You've played golf all your life," he said. FILE - Roger Maltbie watches players tee off on the fourth hole during the final round of the PNC Championship golf tournament at Ritz-Carlton Golf Club Grande Lakes Orlando Course on Dec. 18, 2022. Harrington's caddie, Ronan Flood, then walked into the conversation in an attempt to defuse the situation, but Harrington continued on. For his part, Maltbie didn't appear to disagree with the sentiment of good sportsmanship, but as he explained it, he had a job to do. The confrontation carried on without any resolution. Maltbie said he believed Harrington was "dead wrong," and reminded the pro, "I'm not a player." Padraig Harrington of Ireland takes his approach shot onto the No. 6 green during the second round of the 2025 Kaulig Companies Championship at Firestone Country Club, Friday, June 20, 2025, in Akron, Ohio.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? This new telescope lets you hold 10 million galaxies in your hand. Last Thursday, I took my son to the Rose Center for Earth and Space at New York's Museum of Natural History. A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world. But it didn't compare to what was blasted around the world just a few days later, as the new Vera C. Rubin Observatory began broadcasting its “first light” — its inaugural images of the cosmos. I could hold the universe itself on my screen. It will photograph the entire Southern Hemisphere sky every few nights to tackle four grand goals: unmask dark matter and dark energy, inventory the Solar System's asteroids and comets, chart the Milky Way's formation, and capture every transient cosmic event. At its core is a 27-foot-wide dual mirror cast from 51,900 pounds of molten glass that is still light enough to sweep across the sky in seconds. It's like a massive magnifying glass paired with the world's sharpest DSLR: Together they capture a swath of the night sky equivalent to 45 full moons every 30 seconds. And those images, which will be continuously shared with the world, are jaw-dropping. The headlining shot from Rubin's debut, nicknamed “Cosmic Treasure Chest,” stitches together 1,185 exposures of the Virgo Cluster, our nearest major collection of galaxies, some 55 million light-years away. But the Rubin Observatory is about much more than producing pretty cosmic wallpaper. The NSF notes that Rubin will gather more optical data in its first year than all previous ground telescopes combined, turning the messy, ever-changing sky into a searchable movie. As I've written before, the world has made great strides in planetary defense: Our ability to detect and eventually deflect asteroids that could be on a collision course with Earth. Rubin has already begun paying dividends toward that goal. In a mere 10 hours of engineering data, its detection software identified 2,104 brand-new asteroids — including seven near-Earth objects, heavenly bodies whose orbit will bring them near-ish our planet. That haul came from just a thumbnail-sized patch of sky; once Rubin begins its nightly scan of the whole Southern Hemisphere, it's projected to catalog over 5 million asteroids and roughly 100,000 NEOs over the next decade, tripling today's inventory. That will help NASA finally reach its congressionally mandated target of identifying 90 percent of the 25,000 city-killer-class NEOs (those over 140 meters) estimated to be out there. “It took 225 years of astronomical observations to detect the first 1.5 million asteroids,” Jake Kurlander, a grad student astronomer at the University of Washington, told Earth.com. “Rubin will double that number in less than a year.” Its Skyviewer app will allow anyone to zoom in and out of the corners of space that catch Rubin's eye, including celestial objects so new that most of them don't have names. Looking at the app gives you a sense of what it must have been like to be one of the first human beings, gazing up at a sky filled with wonder and mystery. It might seem strange to highlight a telescope at a moment when the world feels as if it is literally on fire. But the Vera Rubin Observatory isn't just a triumph of international scientific engineering, or an unparalleled window on the universe. If you open the Virgo image and zoom all the way out, Earth's orbit would be smaller than a single pixel. Yet that same pixel is where thousands of engineers, coders, machinists, and scientists quietly spent a decade building an eye that can watch the rest of the universe breathe, and then share those images with all of their fellow humans. Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars. On days when life on our little world feels chaotic, Rubin's first-light view offers a valuable reminder: We're just one tiny part in a tapestry of 10 million galaxies, looking up from our planet at the endless stars.

Tanner Mansell, a Florida diver, was pardoned by President Donald Trump after he was convicted of freeing 19 sharks. Tanner Mansell, 31, of Jupiter, Fla., was granted a Presidential Pardon from Donald Trump in May 2025. A longline is a type of deep-sea fishing gear with baited hooks to catch fish. "It was just another ordinary day on the water," Mansell said. "I had been running trips there for years and never had anything like this happen. I spotted something red in the distance thinking that, you know, maybe it was trash or a diver," he said. "We saw that it was a buoy connected to a line, which is when we started calling law enforcement." Unaware that the longline belonged to a legally sanctioned National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shark research operation, Mansell and his team acted swiftly and cut the line. They released 19 sharks back into the ocean. "I had no idea that this could be possible, you know, that you could have a permit to kill all these sharks," he said, noting that they had called the Florida Wildlife Commission (FWC) and NOAA's hotline before making the decision. "In our mind, the entire time, we thought we were uncovering a crime rather than committing a crime," he said. Tanner Mansell leads shark exhibitions and is passionate about conservation efforts. Days later, Mansell said he received a call while out to dinner. "I just felt like my world came to a stop, my heart sank," he said. Despite their outreach to law enforcement, both divers were charged and convicted. While they avoided prison time, they were ordered to pay $3,343.72 in restitution, and the felony convictions prevented them from voting, owning firearms and traveling freely. "The judge made a comment, and he commended us for our dedication to [the] environment," he said. "He gave out what my lawyer said was probably the lowest sentence ever." Looking back, Mansell said he would have acted differently if he had known the law surrounding legal shark killings. "But if I didn't know that there were permits for this, I don't think that I would change anything… when you think you're doing the right thing, you think you're doing the right thing." "We were really surprised to get the pardon," he added. "It wasn't really discussed by my lawyers because it was so far down the line." "She basically said … this should've never gone forward … she's never come across a criminal that has called enforcement to report what they're doing in real time," he said. "The White House actually called our lawyers and said that they were looking into this and asked for more information," he said. "That was really cool because our lawyer called us that the White House had it in front of them and were looking into it." Mansell learned of his pardon while boarding a plane, sharing he was left "speechless" from the news. You just got a full presidential pardon.' I couldn't even say thank you. "All I can say is thank you. And I hope that, you know, maybe in the name of sharks, we can all take a look at what's happening and say that [legal killings of sharks] shouldn't be happening in Florida." I have said thank you every step of the way. Words can't explain it," he said. "I know that the White House took a look at this and they decided it was worth it. "And most importantly, it expedites getting travel visas for my work in conservation." Tanner Mansell shared that he was shocked when learning he was the recipient of a Presidential Pardon following his 2020 conviction. Asked how his view of government and justice had evolved, Mansell admitted, "At first, I was like, I lost a lot of faith in it. "I've learned so much through this process," he said. "I've always considered myself a law-abiding citizen, somebody that doesn't break the law and I respect law enforcement and commercial fisherman." "I got through into this political battle between commercial fisheries and shark diving tourism and it's tough, but now I'm on the other side," he said. "At first I lost a lot of faith in the criminal justice system and now, a bit of that faith in the justice system is restored. Mansell remains committed to shark conservation and hopeful his case will raise awareness. "This case never should have been filed," Mansell's attorney, Ian Goldstein, said in a statement. "These gentlemen made an honest mistake and were trying to save sharks from what they believed to be an illegal longline fishing setup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the Trump administration looks to quickly pivot from military strikes to a diplomatic deal on Iran's nuclear program, the final military and intelligence assessment on the recent US strikes will be critical in informing what the Trump administration needs to accomplish in future Iran negotiations. “You're not going to the negotiation assuming that the other side is going to tell you everything you need to know about the state of their program,” explained Pranay Vaddi, a former senior official for nonproliferation at the National Security Council. “We need to have a baseline that is established by the US intelligence community before that,” Vaddi added. President Donald Trump continues to claim that Iran's nuclear program has been “fully obliterated,” which does not mirror an early assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency, finding that the attack did not destroy the core components of the country's nuclear program. And Trump's absolutist pronouncements could also complicate Witkoff's job, officials said. Even if the facilities themselves have been badly damaged, it does not mean that the nuclear program itself has been wholly destroyed. And while the final battle damage assessment will be important to take into account, future negotiations with Iran should prioritize getting the UN's nuclear watchdog back on the ground in Iran, said former officials who worked on previous Iran negotiations. “I don't know that there will be any assessment that I think is fully viable until there are inspectors on the ground,” said a former senior US official who worked on past Iran negotiations. “The deal meant there were inspectors on the ground 24/7, there was electronic monitoring, there was a process by which – that didn't exist anywhere else in the world – that if there was intelligence about a suspected site, if Iran, over a period of some days, couldn't satisfy the IAEA that there was a reason the IAEA could go and inspect,” the official explained, citing some benefits of the IAEA inspection efforts. Iran accused Grossi of facilitating the US and Israeli strikes in Iran, citing an IAEA report a day prior to the Israeli strike, which declared Iran was violating its nuclear non-proliferation obligations. For example, in 2022 Iran responded by removing surveillance cameras from key sites after IAEA censured Iran over uranium particles found at the undeclared sites. The steps that would need to be taken as part of any verifiable deal on Iran's nuclear program would likely include: destroying elements of the program that still exist, monitoring any further activity, blending highly enriched uranium, and declaring parts of the program that are in use. In order to prepare to take those steps, inspectors on the ground would be essential, former officials pressed. “I think it's been a long time since the US intelligence assessments have been accepted globally as authoritative when it comes to Iran's nuclear program. They would certainly be challenged by Iran. In order to have a successful negotiation everybody needs to at least agree on the source of facts,” said Laura Holgate, the former US Ambassador to the United Nations International Organizations in Vienna. “The IAEA will be needed to develop a new baseline of what exactly Iran has, where it is, and what its condition is in, and that's going to take time, and it will be based on Iran's cooperation,” Holgate added. With the IAEA access being diminished over the years and virtually nonexistent at this moment, the world now has large gaps in its knowledge of Iran's nuclear inventory. That is particularly true when it comes to the locale of Iran's enriched uranium. “We're going to work in the coming weeks to ensure that we do something with that fuel. And that's one of the things that we're going to have conversations with the Iranians about,” Vance said. Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, cited the importance of having “a full accounting” following an all-member classified briefing on Capitol Hill earlier this week. That's why Iran has to come to the table directly with us, so the IAEA can account for every ounce of enriched uranium that's there, I don't think it's going out of the country, I think it's at the facilities.” The final US military “battle damage assessment could take days or even weeks to complete,” multiple sources familiar with the Pentagon's process told CNN. The Trump administration was already working on possible terms to offer Iran to bring them back to the able for nuclear deal talks before the US military strikes occurred. “One of the key requirements for the negotiation is setting mechanisms for cataloging Iran's residual capabilities in order to have that conversation and ultimately a deal that is worth the paper it is written on.”</p>

(Aaron Lavinsky/Star Tribune via AP) MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris will join the mourners Saturday at the funeral for former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, who was killed in a pair of attacks that authorities have called an assassination and that also left her husband dead and a state senator and his wife seriously wounded. Biden also paid his respects Friday as Hortman, her husband, Mark, and their golden retriever, Gilbert, lay in state in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda in St. Paul, a few hours after the man charged with killing them while disguised as a police officer June 14 made a brief court appearance in a suicide prevention suit. It will be livestreamed on the Department of Public Safety's YouTube channel. Neither Biden nor Harris is expected to speak. Harris expressed her condolences earlier this week to Hortman's adult children, and spoke with Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate on the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, who extended an invitation on behalf of the Hortman family, her office said. Hortman, a Democrat, was the first woman and one of fewer than 20 Minnesotans to lay in state at the Capitol. Gilbert was seriously wounded in the attack and had to be euthanized. Many fought back tears as they left. Among the first to pay their respects were Walz, who has called Hortman his closest political ally, and his wife, Gwen. Lisa Greene, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park like Hortman did, but in a different House district, said she came to the Capitol because she had so much respect for the former speaker. And I was just so proud that she represented the city that I lived in,” Greene said in a voice choked with emotion. I mean, she was friendly, you could talk to her.” But, she went on to say admiringly, Hortman was also “a boss.” The man accused of killing the Hortmans at their home and wounding Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home in nearby Champlin, made a short court appearance Friday for what the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, Joseph Thompson, has called “a political assassination.” Vance Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest search in Minnesota history. An unshaven Boelter was brought in wearing just a green padded suicide prevention suit and orange slippers. Federal defender Manny Atwal asked Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko to continue the hearing until Thursday. She said Boelter has been sleep deprived while on suicide watch in the Sherburne County Jail, and that it has been difficult to communicate with him as a result. “Your honor, I haven't really slept in about 12 to 14 days,” Boelter told the judge. Atwal told the court that Boelter had been in what's known as a “Gumby suit,” without undergarments, ever since his transfer to the jail after his first court appearance on June 16. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first. And it says security video shows Boelter approaching the front doors of two other lawmakers' homes. Thompson said last week that no decision has been made. Boelter also faces separate murder and attempted murder charges in state court that could carry life without parole. Friends have described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York City mayoral Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa is under pressure to drop out of the race to consolidate support behind incumbent Mayor Eric Adams against socialist Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. Mamdani's victory has sent shock waves throughout the country. Andrew Cuomo, who lost the Democratic nomination but may run as an independent. Some Republican and business leaders are hoping to push Sliwa to drop out and get behind Adams, several people familiar with the matter told Politico and the New York Post. Though he didn't confirm that he wanted Sliwa out of the race, Republican billionaire John Catsimatidis told Politico that he's supporting Adams as the most viable candidate. “The only people who are going to help Eric Adams is Washington, whether it's [border czar] Tom Homan, whether it's Donald Trump,” Catsimatidis said. He remained diplomatic about Sliwa, however, stressing they were still friends and that the candidate “has to make up his own mind.” “I'm not getting out of this race unless they figure out a way to put me in a pine box and bury me 6 feet under,” he said. In an interview with the New York Post, Sliwa said he was running to save New York City from “the corruption and collapse” created by Adams. A unity ticket appears out of the question. “Absolutely,” he responded sarcastically when asked in an interview with Fox News if he would consider running in a joint ticket with Adams. “Eric, you have been the best nightlife mayor we've ever had. You can take over the shift at 12 midnight. Elsewhere, Sliwa has blasted Adams over his corruption allegations. “A lot of good men and women lost their careers who happened to be Republican conservative prosecutors because of Eric Adams, and he's the luckiest man alive because he should be in a jail cell right now with Bobby Menendez.” I'm the ‘protecting animals' independent party nominee, and I'm running 'til November 4, until the vote to figure out who our next mayor is.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An award-winning Washington Post reporter has been charged with the possession of child pornography, including on his work computer. Thomas Pham LeGro, 48, was arrested on Thursday after FBI agents raided his property on a search warrant. They seized several of his electronic devices and discovered fractured pieces of a hard drive in his hallway. Agents found a folder that contained 11 videos depicting child sexual abuse material on his work laptop, the Department of Justice said. He was working as a video editor at the time of his arrest. According to FBI charging documents viewed by the outlet, LeGro was first tied to child sexual abuse material in a 2005 investigation into E-Gold, a payment company used by child pornography websites. It's unclear what triggered a renewed investigation into him, but a search warrant was approved on Tuesday. He was part of the Washington Post team that won the Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of Roy Moore's Georgia Senate campaign, during which they uncovered sexual assault allegations that helped tank his campaign. LeGro's case is being handled by the FBI Washington Field Office's Child Exploitation and Human Trafficking Task Force. The charges against him carry a maximum of 20 years in prison.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Salesforce Tower and skyline are shown behind the gasoline price board at a gas station in San Francisco, July 20, 2022. Gavin Newsom's plan to penalize oil companies if their profits climb too high, a top energy regulator said Friday while unveiling proposals aimed at addressing high gas prices. The Democratic governor signed a law in 2023 giving the California Energy Commission the authority to penalize oil companies for excess profits, declaring the state had “finally beat big oil.” More than two years later, the commission hasn't imposed a single penalty or determined what counts as an excessive profit. Now, Siva Gunda, the energy commission's vice-chair, says the state should pause the effort in favor of pursuing other policies to lower prices and maintain a steady oil supply — all while pushing to phase out reliance on fossil fuels over the next two decades. “Together, we will evolve California's strategy to successfully phase out petroleum-based fuels by 2045 while protecting communities, workers, and consumers, and foster market conditions that support the industry's ability to operate safely, reliably, and successfully to meet demand through the transition,” Gunda wrote in a letter to Newsom. Newsom has pitched the penalty as a way to rein in profits by oil companies, but critics said it would only raise prices. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.61 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA. The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance, Gunda said. That proposal came out of a law Newsom signed last year after convening a special session aimed at preventing gas price spikes. Gunda's recommendations come months after Newsom in April directed energy regulators to work with refiners on plans to ensure the state maintains a reliable fuel supply as it transitions away from fossil fuels. Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in an email that the governor would review the recommendations and “advance solutions that maintain a safe, affordable, and reliable supply of transportation fuels for California.” Two major oil companies announced plans over the past year to shut down refineries in the state, further driving uncertainty about how the state should maintain a stable fuel supply as California transitions toward renewable energy. Phillips 66 announced plans to shut down its Los Angeles-area refinery, and Valero said it would cease operations at its Benicia refinery. A group of about 50 environmental and consumer groups penned a letter to Newsom and legislative leaders Friday criticizing the proposal to pause implementing a penalty on oil company profits. “California oil refiners do not need a bailout,” they wrote, adding that the state should “finish the job” it started to prevent prices at the pump from spiking.
