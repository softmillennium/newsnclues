                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran has dealt a blow to the trust of the other Gulf nations by attacking the US-run Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, said Anwar Gargash, advisor to the United Arab Emirates president. "The Gulf states took a strong and impactful stance against the Israeli war on Iran," he wrote on X. "Despite this, the Iranian targeting of the sovereignty of the brotherly state of Qatar occurred, an attack that affects us all." "Today, as we turn the page on the war, Tehran remains obligated to rebuild trust with its Gulf neighbors, after it was damaged due to this aggression," the official went on to say. Overnight into June 13, Israel started a military operation against Iran. Less than a day later, Iran carried out a retaliatory attack. In the small hours of June 22, the US forces attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities: in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. The following evening, Tehran launched missiles toward Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US air force base in the Middle East. According to the US, there were no casualties or significant damage. Trump then said Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, which took effect on June 24.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beneath a blaze of rainbow flags and amid roars of defiance, big crowds gathered in the Hungarian capital Budapest for the city's 30th annual Pride march – an event that, this year, is unfolding as both a celebration and a protest. Moving through the capital in the sweltering heat, demonstrators carried signs reading “Solidarity with Budapest Pride” and waved placards bearing crossed-out illustrations of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Music played from portable speakers as people of all ages joined the march – families with pushchairs, teenagers draped in capes, and older residents walking alongside activists. From the city's historic centre to its riverside roads, the procession swelled in numbers and noise – visibly reclaiming public space in defiance of a law designed to push them out. The march proceeded in open defiance of a police ban imposed earlier this year under sweeping new legislation that prohibits LGBTQ+ events nationwide. Eszter Rein Bodi was one of those who joined the massive crowds in Budapest on Saturday, telling Reuters: “This is about much more, not just about homosexuality … This is the last moment to stand up for our rights.” Krisztina Aranyi, another marcher, told the news agency that “the right to assembly is a basic human right, and I don't think it should be banned.” Van Sparrentak, who is a Dutch MEP from the parliament's “Greens/European Free Alliance” political group, told CNN that she will be attending Budapest Pride to “support the LGBTIQ+ community in Hungary, to let them know that they are not alone (and) to be visible as a community.” In March, Hungarian lawmakers passed legislation barring Pride events and permitting the use of facial recognition technology to identify participants – measures campaigners say is illegal and part of a wider crackdown on the LGBTQ+ community. Orban welcomed the ban, which he said would outlaw gatherings that “violate child protection laws.” His government has pushed a strongly Christian and conservative agenda. CNN's Catherine Nicholls and Billy Stockwell contributed to this report.</p>

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! Marsha P. Johnson has become an icon of gay, trans, and queer liberation, and yet little is known about her life beyond her participation in the Stonewall Uprising of 1969 and the decadeslong controversy after her lifeless body was found floating in the Hudson River in 1992. In Marsha: The Joy and Defiance of Marsha P. Johnson, Tourmaline, an award-winning Black trans artist, filmmaker, and activist who has dedicated her life to uplifting Marsha P. Johnson's legacy, recuperates her life from the flatness of postmortem deification. Her influence looms large, and Tourmaline is intent on presenting the full range of her choices, inspirations, limitations, and visionary imaginings for us to learn from today. What role did friendship play in Marsha's life, and how does looking at her life's work through the lens of friendship enrich her legacy? Tourmaline: Friendship almost doesn't feel like a big enough word for the depth and breadth of love Marsha offered to and received from her dear ones. We talk a lot in the queer community about “chosen family,” and the relationships that Marsha built in NewYork City starting when she moved to Manhattan in 1963 didn't just shape her life, they shaped history. Marsha's ability to be a beacon of power and joy was fueled by, nurtured in, and shaped among the community that she built with her fellow street queens, the wider queer community, and the bicoastal and transatlantic connections she made in a period of immense cultural change. Two friendships really stand out to me in very different ways — Marsha's relationship with Sylvia Rivera, and her relationship with Randy Wicker. I feel so lucky to have been able to become friends with Randy myself over 15 years ago while archiving Marsha's life. Then in the process of writing this book and my other work on Marsha's legacy, including my film Happy Birthday, Marsha, Randy has been incredibly generous in sharing source material related to Marsha, as well as his own memories and reflections. The two of them came together when Sylvia was just 13 years old, hustling in Times Square, and Marsha at times played a role of mother figure to the young street queens — offering guidance, love, and unconditional support that many had never had access to before. Kelley, “freedom dreaming” — seeing through the challenge of their circumstances to a bigger, more beautiful world that they knew they could build together. Authentic individual expression that disrupts binaries, coercive control, or the established flow of power is inherently threatening to the systems that be. Marsha, Sylvia, and other people who were committed to living authentically and deliberately demonstrated a new way of being that many people weren't ready for — it felt destabilizing to see so much freedom in action. There were occasions when it was a necessary result of her existence — for instance, at Stonewall — but I think often of her middle initial: P, which she said stood for “pay it no mind.” Her ability to look beyond, through, and even past daily circumstances of dismissal or marginalization was a huge source of strength and power allowing her to dream up the world she wanted and desired. Stonewall has become romanticized as a place where everyone belonged, but you show how actually it was a Mafia-run, segregated gay bar where street queens were most often not even allowed inside. Nuance and complexity are hard to hold when our culture often operates in binaries. It was not a perfect utopia of total collective welcome; but what it was was a gathering place where people found their way towards each other, even across some of the limitations you described. And that moment of collective uprising in 1969 — even coming out of an imperfect hub for gathering and building community — might help us learn the power of broad-based coalitions for freedom and joy. Stonewall can teach us how strong we can be when we ignore what would keep us apart, and double down on our desire to be together, free from fear and shame. You quote poet and disability justice author and activist Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha as saying that a riot is a “powerful place of madness.” So, if we want to reinvoke the spirit of Stonewall, should we be invoking madness? Marsha was open with herself and others about the ways that trauma, violence, and her own unique humanity led her to perceive the world differently than others. By applying a disability justice lens to Marsha's story, you're able to show how her mental health challenges were also part of how she was able to imagine a different world, to conjure this in everyday experience, in spite of abuse from her mother, from people on the street, from the cops — talk more about what this enabled her to do. Marsha looked beyond and through the harsh circumstances she endured. She invested in a vision of the world that others found improbable or even impossible. Now we have funded nonprofits that often do much less. Her logic was sound, but perhaps unfamiliar to many people. You write that Marsha P. Johnson was “disinterested entirely in respectability and assimilation.” What can this teach us today? In my two decades of researching, learning from, and diving into Marsha's life story, I've learned over and over again that turning the volume up on what makes us feel authentically alive and joyful can be a powerful antidote to structures and systems that would try to reduce our power. Marsha taught us that being authentically and unapologetically yourself can be a guiding light that leads us closer to the world of freedom, ease, love, and joy that we deserve to live in.

I'm always consumed by the same question: How will this endless, brutal spectacle of killing finally end? Will it be like a movie — justice prevailing, liberation won, goodness triumphing over evil? Or will it all fade away in an open-ended scene, full of unknowns, unanswered questions, and the absence of closure? Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Will I make it to the final scene? Or will my story be abruptly cut short, lost before the credits even roll? But this isn't a movie. This isn't a nightmare I'll wake up from. And this is our reality — where every day, our lives are silently severed, not even properly documented in the ledger of Israel's war crimes. On June 8, Israeli forces bombed the core internet infrastructure in both the north and south of Gaza. We were cut off completely. Here, we've become experts in sensing when something monstrous is coming — when death lurks under the stillness. Every possible ending ran through my head: Would we be massacred quietly, all at once? Would we be erased without anyone ever knowing? Does the world even realize we're vanishing? Will they ever try to wipe our blood off their hands with real action, not hollow statements? It didn't end with internet blackouts. For us, the internet wasn't a luxury — it was a lifeline, a way to transfer funds during the liquidity crisis, a fragile system holding back hunger. When even that collapsed, desperation surged. Crowds gathered at what was called a “humanitarian aid” point in Gaza — praying, not for salvation, but for a box of food. But the gates were shut. Snipers targeted anyone who dared raise their head. Some bled to death on the ground because every call for help was met with the same cold, mechanical response: “No network. Please try again.” But there was no “again.” Only death. One survivor said he heard voices from the drones above: “We told you not to come.” That same day, Israel's military spokesperson posted on Facebook that the distribution point had been closed. Just a death trap dressed as relief. Instead of food bags, people were shattered. Their remains brought back home in plastic bags. That very evening, our neighbor's home was bombed. Their screams haven't left my ears. So we ran barefoot into the inferno, trying to pull them out with our hands. We huddled together, not just out of fear — but because it was the only thing left to do. My frail body couldn't bear more. But I couldn't stop thinking of the people who'd just died — unseen, unmourned. It could have been someone I loved. But I couldn't even check my phone to know. Even mourning is a privilege denied to us. I curled up in the corner. And a voice inside me whispered: This is the last fall, Hend. You're going to die in limbo. Nothing changed — except our deepening isolation. We've learned to live with gnawing emptiness. But we cannot live without connection. That fragile internet line — it's our only thread to the rest of humanity. Nearly two years of televised carnage. Still, the world can't name it. No international court willing to enforce its own laws. And so the question remains: Are we still pleading — after all this — to be seen as victims? To prove that our blood is not less valuable? That our children deserve to live, just like yours? If no one is listening, maybe we should stop screaming. Maybe we should keep the last shred of dignity we have — turn off the cameras — and let the world go on, uninterrupted. But that's not what we want. We want to be seen as humans — not corpses. We want you to pressure your governments to end this slaughter — not to sip your coffee and scroll past another mass grave. How you respond will define your legacy. At 3 am on June 14, a phone rang. It felt like a bomb in the dark. We had no cell service — so how was this happening? I feared it was the Israeli military — an order to evacuate. It was my sister, Intimaa, calling from abroad. “Are you okay?” she asked. Then she shared news I hadn't heard: “Israel attacked Iran. She went on: “The Sumud Convoys — the ones meant to break Gaza's siege — were blocked by Egyptian forces. That brief call brought no comfort, just more evidence that the world is burning. I lay awake, watching the dark sky erupt with bombs. I used to believe in those convoys, filled with a thousand people who traveled from across North Africa to try to make it through the Rafah crossing. But they were met with batons and detentions — not solidarity. And, Israel's assault on Iran was a tactic — to distract, while they accelerate our annihilation. The journalists who once told our stories are gone — killed or silenced. The massacres are hidden behind fake aid and polished lies. And yet, the sun rose again. I told my family about Intimaa's call. So much horror, and we — trapped, starving, displaced — stayed in place. We passed the news on to neighbors, like stories passed in ancient times. My father, determined, charged a single battery through a flimsy solar panel — just to turn on our battered TV. We watched images of Tel Aviv and Tehran — but not a word about Gaza. Not a whisper about our dead. We — who are bleeding — were watching another conflict unfold, as if we had already died. Eventually, workers from the telecom company managed to negotiate access to fix the broken lines. One technician lost his leg to an airstrike. But on June 15, the internet returned. And with it, a flood of messages. The simple miracle of: “You're still alive.” By June 16, the connection failed again. And this time, Israeli forces struck the main service point. The telecom company sent a message: “We're doing everything we can.” And they were — working under death's shadow. On June 18, my mother was washing dishes when an airstrike hit our neighbor's house. She saw a man fly into the air — and crash to the ground. She still can't stop trembling. His family is still buried beneath the rubble. And so I write this, in the hope that you are reading it. If you are, then I've broken through the blackout — for just a moment. The silence isn't accidental. It's the tool they use to erase us quietly. Being Palestinian from Gaza means carrying trauma as identity. Nothing will ever truly heal us. But if our voices still reach you, maybe we haven't been completely erased.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venue drops gig under pressure from campaigners and local MP, who said show was against ‘city's values' Heavy metal star Marilyn Manson, has had the first UK concert of his One Assassination Under God Tour cancelled after pressure from campaign groups and an MP. Four women had sued Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, accusing him of rape, sexual assault and bodily harm. However, after a year-long investigation, the case against him was dropped in January. Prosecutors in California found that the statute of limitations had been exceeded and argued they would not be able to bring charges that prove Warner was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In 2021, Manson's former fiancee, the Westworld actor Evan Rachel Wood, also named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post. Last week, Green Party MP Siân Berry expressed her concerns about Warner's scheduled performance in her constituency in Brighton, writing an open letter to the leader of Brighton and Hove city council, Bella Sankey. She added: “The council has a responsibility to take action where there are risks of discrimination, harassment and victimisation.” Others said the decision infringes on freedom of speech. One person told The Argus: “This is cancel culture, nothing more, and it'll backfire when artists don't add a Brighton and Hove date to their tours and stick to London, which incidentally hasn't banned Marilyn Manson from their city.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia is returning outdated T-62 tanks to service due to mounting equipment losses in its full-scale war against Ukraine and a shortage of modern military equipment, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) said on June 28. According to HUR, the restoration of T-62 tanks is primarily carried out at a facility in the village of Atamanovka in Russia's far-eastern Zabaykalsky Krai. HUR said that Russia's stockpile of Soviet-era tanks from the 1970s is being depleted, while most T-62s are even in worse condition after decades of open-air storage without maintenance. Some of these tanks can also be used at the front as stationary firing points to reinforce defensive positions. Since the start of its full-scale war in February 2022, Russia has lost 10,970 tanks, Ukraine's General Staff said in its latest update on June 28. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these numbers. Kateryna Denisova works as a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent.

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on June 28 that he does not intend to meet directly with President Volodymyr Zelensky, claiming that the Ukrainian president "hates" him, as relations between the two countries continue to sour. "Andrzej has been with Ukraine since the first days of the war, always side by side, a reliable ally and a true friend. This is undoubtedly the level of relations we want to preserve and strengthen with Poland," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. "The key factors limiting the ability to produce modern armored vehicles in Russia are a lack of industrial capacity and a shortage of imported high-tech components," Ukraine's military intelligence said. The Atesh partisan group set fire to a signal cabinet that helps control traffic on a railway line near the Russian-occupied city of Yasynuvata in Donetsk Oblast, a route used for Russia's military logistics, the group claimed on Telegram on June 28. Ukrainian forces downed 21 out of the 23 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. A couple was killed and 14 others were injured, including three children. In a YouGov survey conducted June 12-16, 24% of U.S. adults said they "strongly support" sanctioning Russian energy buyers while 25% said they "somewhat support" secondary sanctions against these countries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia launched its new Grom-1 bomb missile at Dnipropetrovsk Oblast for the first time on June 28, but it was shot down by Ukrainian air defenses, Governor Serhii Lysak said. The attack comes as Russian troops continue their offensive in neighboring Donetsk Oblast, pushing closer to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast — a major industrial region in central Ukraine. In mid-June, Ukraine's military denied reports that Russian troops had entered the region, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying that Ukrainian troops had intercepted Russian reconnaissance units attempting to breach Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Explosions in Dnipro were heard around 11:30 a.m. local time, shortly after the Ukrainian Air Force reported that Russia had launched guided aerial bombs. As Moscow intensifies its attacks on Ukrainian cities, earlier this week on June 24, Russian forces struck civilian infrastructure and a passenger train with ballistic missiles, killing at least 21 people and injuring more than 300 others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists left scrambling amid hurricane season after irreplaceable program is slotted to be shuttered A critical US atmospheric data collection program will be halted by Monday, giving weather forecasters just days to prepare, according to a public notice sent this week. In a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) message sent on Wednesday to its scientists, the agency said that “due to recent service changes” the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) will “discontinue ingest, processing and distribution of all DMSP data no later than June 30, 2025”. Noaa said they would not affect the quality of forecasting. “Before these types of satellites were present, there would often be situations where you'd wake up in the morning and have a big surprise about what the hurricane looked like,” said Wing. The satellites also formed a unique source of data for tracking changes to the Arctic and Antarctic, and had been tracking changes to polar sea ice continuously for more than 40 years. “This new announcement about the sea ice data really amounts to blinding ourselves and preventing us from observing these critical systems.” Researchers say the satellites themselves are operating normally and do not appear to have suffered any errors that would physically prevent the data from continuing to be collected and distributed, so the abrupt data halt might have been an intentional decision. “It's hard to imagine what would be the logic of removing access now and in such a sudden manner that it's just impossible to plan for. I certainly don't know of any other previous cases where we're taking away data that is being collected, and we're just removing it from public access.” The loss of DMSP comes as Noaa's weather and climate monitoring services have become critically understaffed this year as Donald Trump's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) initiative has instilled draconian cuts to federal environmental programs. A current Noaa scientist who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation said that the action to halt the DMSP, when taken in context with other recent moves by the Trump administration, amounted to “a systematic destruction of science”. It frankly is an embarrassment for the government to pursue a course with less data and just pretend everything will be OK.” Scientists said the decision to halt the DMSP will result in immediately degraded hurricane forecasts during what is expected to be an above-average season as well as a gap in monitoring sea ice – just as Arctic sea ice is hitting new record lows. “This is a huge hit to our forecasting capabilities this season and beyond, especially our ability to predict rapid intensification or estimate the strength of storms in the absence of hurricane hunters,” said Michael Lowry, a meteorologist who has worked at Noaa's National Hurricane Center and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In recent years, the DMSP had struggled to maintain consistent funding and priority within the Department of Defense as it transitioned away from its cold war mission. The only other nation with similar satellite capability is Japan, and messages posted earlier in June indicate that scientists had already been considering a switch to the Japanese data in case of a DMSP outage – though that transition will take time. Neither Noaa nor the Department of Defense specified exactly which service changes may have prompted such a critical program to be so abruptly halted. This routine process of data rotation and replacement would go unnoticed in past administrations, but the media is insistent on criticizing the great work that Noaa and its dedicated scientists perform every day. “Noaa's data sources are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.” One Noaa source the Guardian spoke to said the loss of DMSP's high-resolution data could not be replaced by any other existing Noaa tool. DoD users (including the Navy) will continue to receive and operationally use DMSP data sent to weather satellite direct readout terminals across the DoD.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shock primary result has sparked panic among New York's ultra-rich A rank outsider, Mr Mamdani was carried to victory by a wave of young voters who were won over by his radical campaign pledges to freeze rents and introduce free public transport and city-run grocery stores, all of which he pledged would be paid for by hiking taxes on the wealthy. “There's an old saying in real estate: Money goes where it's welcome,” said John Boyd Jr, founder of Florida-based corporate site selection specialist The Boyd Co, who works with a range of multi-millionaire New York-based clients. “There's alarms going off among many key executives as well as the billionaire class about New York becoming a socialist run city,” he said. Eric Benaim, a leading real estate broker known as “The King of Queens”, said that his phone has been “blowing up” with clients panicking about the impact of Mr Mamdani's policies. He was just about to make another investment in New York city but he's now going to look elsewhere,” said Mr Benaim, the founder of Modern Spaces. “It's the most devastating thing (to our industry) since 9/11,” he added. Briggs Elwell, the CEO and co-founder of RLTYco, a real estate consultant in New York, told The Telegraph it was “a time of unique uncertainty”. While James Whelan, president of the real estate board of New York, described Mr Mamdani's proposals on how to cut crime, build houses and create jobs as “fanciful and extreme”. Many of the city's ultra-wealthy have thrown their weight behind the more business-friendly incumbent Eric Adams, who launched his re-election campaign as an independent on Thursday with a rousing speech in which he declared: “This is not a city of handouts.” Late on Wednesday, Mr Adams courted Wall Street sharks and politicos in a Manhattan conference room where they plotted how to block the rise of Mr Mamdani, according to The New York Times. As New York's top one per cent look to leave the city, low-tax states such as Florida, which does not levy income tax, are set to become “big winners”, with Mr Benaim claiming property agents are “rubbing their hands” at the prospect of wealthy buyers flooding into the state. Mr Boyd said that he has been inundated with enquiries in recent weeks from business executives looking to move full-time to South Florida, which he called “the sixth borough of Manhattan”. It is not only Mr Mamdani's fiscal policy that has generated consternation among New York's business leaders. “I've probably had about 30 phone calls from clients who are very nervous,” he said. Experts also fear that Mr Mamdani's plans to pay for free public transport and universal free childcare with tax rises on the wealthy are unrealistic. “If you are making a million or more in New York City, going from four per cent to six per cent in income tax is a 50 per cent tax increase - it's substantial,” said Nicole Gelnas, a senior fellow focused on Urban Economics at the Manhattan Institute. “It doesn't take many of them to say, ‘I can spend eight months a year in Florida and come back here whenever and save myself a lot of money,' to change the tax base,” Ms Gelnas added. Luxury real estate dealers fear Mr Mamdani's support for de-funding the police and abolishing prisons will drive down property prices. The last democratic socialist elected mayor of New York was David Dinkins, whose three-year term in office from 1990 was marked by racial discord, a drug epidemic, high levels of homelessness and a soaring murder rate. “Crime was through the roof, businesses were fleeing and public services weren't being met,” recalled Mr Kraut, warning that the election of Mr Mamdani could herald a return to those dark days. Mr Mamdani romped to victory thanks in part to a tidal wave of support from young voters, enamoured with his progressive agenda and slick social media campaign. However, real estate agents warned that wealthy liberal voters' preoccupation with radical left-wing politics is naive. “Everyone's a liberal until they lose their limo,” said Mr Kraut. He said: “There's a very significant concern among job creators, investors and the real estate industry that New York is now always one election cycle from being a socialist-run city.”</p>

WAKAYAMA — Visitors to Adventure World theme park said goodbye to all four giant pandas housed there as they departed for China from Shirahama, Wakayama Prefecture, on Saturday morning. The four pandas were placed in cages and carried onto two trucks as part of their journey to China. The pandas left the park as about 300 people, including staff and their families, waved flags and bid farewell. “I hope they will stay healthy and show their good health to people in China and those coming from Japan,” said Koji Imazu, the park's director. After their return to China, there will be only two pandas in Japan. These two pandas, kept in Ueno Zoo in Tokyo, are set to be returned to China on Feb. 20 next year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hikvision has faced numerous sanctions and restrictions by the U.S.Reuters The federal government has ordered Chinese surveillance camera manufacturer Hikvision to cease operations in Canada over national security concerns, Industry Minister Melanie Joly said late on Friday. “We strongly disagree with this decision and view it with deep concern, as we believe it lacks a factual basis, procedural fairness, and transparency,” a Hikvision spokesperson told Reuters. “Instead of evaluating our technology on its cybersecurity merits, the decision appears to be driven by the parent company's country of origin, reflecting broader geopolitical tensions and an unjustified bias against Chinese companies.” The company, which calls itself the world's biggest maker of video surveillance equipment, said last year it had exited contracts in Xinjiang through five subsidiaries that were added to a U.S. trade blacklist in 2023. The Chinese government has denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and has criticized or targeted companies for removing Xinjiang firms from their supply chains. Canada said last year it was reviewing an application to impose sanctions against Chinese surveillance equipment companies, including Hikvision, after rights advocates alleged the firms were aiding repression and high-tech surveillance in Xinjiang. Joly said Canada was also banning the purchase of Hikvison's products in government departments and agencies, and reviewing existing properties to ensure that legacy Hikvision products were not used in the future. She said the order does not extend to the company's affiliate operations outside Canada but “strongly” encouraged Canadians “to take note of this decision and make their own decisions accordingly.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>
