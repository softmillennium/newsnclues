            The Israeli military detained six settlers in the occupied West Bank overnight after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say the suspects attacked security forces.
    


            The IDF says they spotted Israeli civilians driving toward a closed military zone near the Palestinian village of Kafr Malik, where days earlier settlers set fire to homes and vehicles in an attack Palestinian officials say killed three people.
    


            When Israeli forces approached the group, the IDF says the soldiers were physically assaulted and verbally abused. In addition, the suspects vandalized and damaged the security forces' vehicles and attempted to ram the forces.
    


            Six suspects were apprehended and transferred to police, the IDF said.
    


            “The IDF and Israel Police condemn any act of violence against security forces and will act firmly against any attempt to harm security personnel carrying out their duty to protect Israeli citizens,” the IDF said in a statement.
    


            Israeli politicians condemned the settler attacks against Israeli security forces.
    


            In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for a thorough investigation and for the people who attacked the security forces to be brought to justice.
    


            “These individuals are a small minority who do not represent the vast majority of settlers, who respect the law and serve in the IDF and the security forces,” Netanyahu said.
    


            Head of the opposition Yair Lapid said in a statement on social media, “The extremists who attack IDF soldiers who are guarding the security of the State of Israel during these difficult days are dangerous criminals who are aiding our enemies.”

            Yair Golan, the head of the left-wing Democrats party, who had called earlier settler attacks in the area a “violent Jewish pogrom,” said the violence from “the Kahanist, nationalist, and fantastic Israel is deliberately working to dismantle the Jewish and democratic Israel.” Golan referenced Meir Kahane, an extremist rabbi whose political party was banned outright in Israel under anti-terror laws.
    


            “This is not a marginal occurrence. This is a dangerous current that has taken deep roots. Even around the government table,” Golan said, a reference to the far-right ministers that prop up the coalition government, including Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, both of whom were sanctioned earlier this month by the UK, Canada, and other Western allies. Smotrich has called for formal annexation of West Bank settlements, while Ben-Gvir's party consists of followers of Kahane's banned political party.
    


            In a statement, Defense Minister Israel Katz called on law enforcement authorities to act immediately to locate all those who resorted to violence and bring them to justice “as is done everywhere.”
    


            On Friday, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for the Palestinian Authority presidency, said the settler attacks are part of a plan by Israel's “extremist right-wing government” to drag the West Bank into a larger confrontation, according to the Palestinian news agency WAFA. Abu Rudeineh held Israel fully responsible for “the consequences of this bloody aggression,” WAFA said.
    


            Israel has been ramping up military operations in the West Bank alongside the offensive in Gaza and attacks on Iran and its proxies, displacing thousands of Palestinians and razing entire communities as it targets what it says are militants operating in the territory.
    


            Earlier this week, Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian teenager in the West Bank, Palestinian health authorities said. The Israeli military said that “terrorists hurled explosive devices at IDF forces.”
    


            In late-May, Israel approved a massive expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank in a move decried as de facto annexation of large swaths of the territory. Peace Now, an Israeli non-governmental organization that tracks settlements, said it was the largest expansion of settlements since the signing of the Oslo Accords more than 30 years ago.
    


            Israel plans to establish 22 new settlements, including deep within the West Bank and in areas from which the country had previously withdrawn. Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, as well as in East Jerusalem and the occupied Golan Heights, are considered illegal under international law.

            Los Angeles Angels manager Ron Washington will sit the rest of the season out due to an unspecified medical issue, the team has announced.
    


            “He's in good spirits,” Angels general manager Perry Minasian said in a press conference Friday – the same day the Angels suffered a 15-9 loss to the Washington Nationals.
    


            “He understands what needs to be done. I'm not going to go into details. That's for him to tell, if he decides to. But for me, I'm excited for him to do what he needs to do,” Minasian said.

            “Forget about the baseball stuff, just get healthy because he's a great human being.”
    


            “He's somebody that you want around,” Minasian added.
    


            The announcement comes after Washington, 73, stepped away from his managerial duties on June 20 over health concerns.
    


            Ray Montgomery, who has been with the Angels since 2021, will take over as interim manager, and Ryan Goins will step up as bench coach.
    


            “It's obviously tough news and the focus is on Wash and making sure he gets what he needs right now,” Montgomery said, per MLB.com. “Honestly, it's like a transactional piece. I'm looking at it as we have a game to play today. A week ago, when this started, we had the same mindset, and nothing's really changed. And again, relative to what I was doing prior, it's a lot of the same stuff.”
    


            Washington was hired as Angels manager prior to the 2024 season and, before that, coached for seven seasons with the Atlanta Braves. He led the Texas Rangers to two World Series appearances, managing the team from 2007-14.

A suicide bomber has rammed a vehicle packed with explosives into a military convoy in the North Waziristan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. No group has taken responsibility so far, but the area has experienced frequent violence and attacks by a terrorist organization previously linked to the Taliban.

The attack on Saturday killed 13 soldiers and injured 29 people, including ten army personnel and 19 civilians, an unnamed local official told AFP. According to a local police officer, the roofs of two houses collapsed due to the explosion, injuring six children.

This suicide bombing comes amid an increase in militant assaults across Pakistan. Senior military and political leaders have attributed the increase in violence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants conducting cross-border attacks from Afghanistan. They allege that Kabul is providing shelter and support to these militants, a claim that the Afghan authorities have denied.

Earlier in June, TTP terrorists killed a policeman in the Lakki Marwat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. When the militants attempted to escape, local residents and security forces chased after them, resulting in one being killed during a shootout, according to police.

According to the Global Terrorist Index, TTP was among four terrorist groups responsible for the most deaths last year. Deaths attributed to TTP nearly doubled from 2023 to 2024.

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has accused US President Donald Trump of showing disrespect to the country's leadership, warning that his barbs undermine any potential for renewed negotiations.

In a statement posted on Saturday, Araghchi said that if Trump is sincere about pursuing a nuclear deal with Iran, he must “put aside the disrespectful and unacceptable tone towards Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and stop hurting his millions of heartfelt followers.”

Araghchi further warned that Iran would not tolerate threats and insults, asserting: “If illusions lead to worse mistakes, Iran will not hesitate to unveil its real capabilities, which will certainly end any delusion about the power of Iran.” The foreign minister added that as a result of Iran's recent standoff with Israel, the latter “had NO CHOICE but to RUN to ‘Daddy' to avoid being flattened by our missiles.”

His comments came in response to Trump's claim that he had “saved [Khamenei] from a very ugly and ignominious death.” He also accused the Iranian leader of “blatantly and foolishly” lying about prevailing in the conflict with Israel. On top of that, the US leader warned Iran that he would “absolutely” bomb the country again if he decides that Tehran is developing nuclear weapons.

The war of words followed a 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran that began on June 13 when Israel launched a series of strikes targeting Iran's nuclear sites and top military leadership, triggering a wave of retaliatory attacks by Tehran. 

The US joined the hostilities on June 22, deploying heavy bombers against key Iranian nuclear facilities. Trump has since said that the nuclear sites have been “completely obliterated,” although several media reports have disputed this assessment. While a ceasefire has since been reached, Iran has dismissed the notion of immediately returning to negotiations.

The key stumbling block remains the US demand that Iran completely refrain from uranium enrichment, which Tehran has dismissed as a deal-breaker. Iran maintains it does not seek nuclear weapons and insists the country's nuclear program is solely for peaceful energy purposes.

US President Donald Trump has said Russian President Vladimir Putin has regained respect for America, whose international standing was damaged by the previous administration.

Trump was responding to comments made by Putin during a visit to Belarus on Friday, where the Russian leader described the US president as a “courageous man.”

“Vladimir Putin made some very nice statements today,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that these remarks would have been impossible under former President Joe Biden.

“He respects our country again. He didn't respect it a year ago, I can tell you that,” Trump said, claiming that Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un also respect the US since his return to the White House.

“We had a president that was incompetent. We had bad people circulating around this desk – this beautiful, Resolute desk. They had, I guess, evil intentions,” Trump said.

He has repeatedly described his predecessor's foreign policy as weak and damaging to America's global reputation, arguing that the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza would not have erupted under his leadership.

Speaking to reporters in Minsk, Putin said he holds “deep respect” for Trump and praised him for overcoming numerous challenges, including surviving an assassination attempt last year. He added that he believes Trump is “sincerely seeking” to help broker an end to the Ukraine conflict.

Trump has revived direct contact with Moscow, which was cut off during the Biden administration, and has held five phone calls with Putin since returning to office in January.

Scientists left scrambling amid hurricane season after irreplaceable program is slotted to be shuttered

A critical US atmospheric data collection program will be halted by Monday, giving weather forecasters just days to prepare, according to a public notice sent this week. Scientists that the Guardian spoke with say the change could set hurricane forecasting back “decades”, just as this year's season ramps up.

In a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) message sent on Wednesday to its scientists, the agency said that “due to recent service changes” the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) will “discontinue ingest, processing and distribution of all DMSP data no later than June 30, 2025”.

Due to their unique characteristics and ability to map the entire world twice a day with extremely high resolution, the three DMSP satellites are a primary source of information for scientists to monitor Arctic sea ice and hurricane development. The DMSP partners with Noaa to make weather data collected from the satellites publicly available.

The reasons for the changes, and which agency was driving them, were not immediately clear. Noaa said they would not affect the quality of forecasting.

However, the Guardian spoke with several scientists inside and outside of the US government whose work depends on the DMSP, and all said there are no other US programs that can form an adequate replacement for its data.

“We're a bit blind now,” said Allison Wing, a hurricane researcher at Florida State University. Wing said the DMSP satellites are the only ones that let scientists see inside the clouds of developing hurricanes, giving them a critical edge in forecasting that now may be jeopardized.

“Before these types of satellites were present, there would often be situations where you'd wake up in the morning and have a big surprise about what the hurricane looked like,” said Wing. “Given increases in hurricane intensity and increasing prevalence towards rapid intensification in recent years, it's not a good time to have less information.”

The satellites also formed a unique source of data for tracking changes to the Arctic and Antarctic, and had been tracking changes to polar sea ice continuously for more than 40 years.

“These are some of the regions that are changing the fastest around the planet,” said Carlos Moffat, an oceanographer at the University of Delaware who had been working on a research project in Antarctica that depended on DMSP data. “This new announcement about the sea ice data really amounts to blinding ourselves and preventing us from observing these critical systems.”

Researchers say the satellites themselves are operating normally and do not appear to have suffered any errors that would physically prevent the data from continuing to be collected and distributed, so the abrupt data halt might have been an intentional decision.

“It's pretty shocking,” Moffat said. “It's hard to imagine what would be the logic of removing access now and in such a sudden manner that it's just impossible to plan for. I certainly don't know of any other previous cases where we're taking away data that is being collected, and we're just removing it from public access.”

The loss of DMSP comes as Noaa's weather and climate monitoring services have become critically understaffed this year as Donald Trump's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) initiative has instilled draconian cuts to federal environmental programs.

A current Noaa scientist who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation said that the action to halt the DMSP, when taken in context with other recent moves by the Trump administration, amounted to “a systematic destruction of science”.

The researcher also confirmed that federal hurricane forecasters were left unprepared for the sudden change with only a few days of notice.

“It's an instant loss of roughly half of our capabilities,” said the scientist. “You can't expect us to make accurate forecasts and warnings when you take the useful tools away. It frankly is an embarrassment for the government to pursue a course with less data and just pretend everything will be OK.”

Scientists said the decision to halt the DMSP will result in immediately degraded hurricane forecasts during what is expected to be an above-average season as well as a gap in monitoring sea ice – just as Arctic sea ice is hitting new record lows.

“This is a huge hit to our forecasting capabilities this season and beyond, especially our ability to predict rapid intensification or estimate the strength of storms in the absence of hurricane hunters,” said Michael Lowry, a meteorologist who has worked at Noaa's National Hurricane Center and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “The permanent discontinuation of data from these satellites is senseless, reckless and puts at risk the lives of tens of millions of Americans living in hurricane alley.”

The DMSP dates back to 1963, when the Department of Defense determined a need for high-resolution cloud forecasts to help them plan spy missions. The program, which had been the longest-running weather satellite initiative in the federal government, has since evolved into a critical source of information not just on the inner workings of hurricanes, but also on polar sea ice, wildfires, solar flares and the aurora.

In recent years, the DMSP had struggled to maintain consistent funding and priority within the Department of Defense as it transitioned away from its cold war mission. The only other nation with similar satellite capability is Japan, and messages posted earlier in June indicate that scientists had already been considering a switch to the Japanese data in case of a DMSP outage – though that transition will take time.

Neither Noaa nor the Department of Defense specified exactly which service changes may have prompted such a critical program to be so abruptly halted.

In a statement to the Guardian, Noaa's communications director, Kim Doster, said: “The DMSP is a single dataset in a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools in the National Weather Service portfolio. This routine process of data rotation and replacement would go unnoticed in past administrations, but the media is insistent on criticizing the great work that Noaa and its dedicated scientists perform every day.

“Noaa's data sources are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.”

One Noaa source the Guardian spoke to said the loss of DMSP's high-resolution data could not be replaced by any other existing Noaa tool.

A statement from an official at US space force, which is part of the Department of Defense, said: “The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) operates the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) for the DoD on behalf of the US Space Force, who has satellite control authority.”

The official went on to say that Noaa receives the data from the US navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC) and added: “While the Space Force does provide DMSP data and processing software to DoD users, to include the US Navy, questions about the reasons for FNMOC's changes to DMSP data processing should be directed to the Navy.

“Even as FNMOC is making a change on their end, the posture on sharing DMSP data has not changed. Noaa has been making this DMSP data publicly available, and many non-DoD entities use this data that is originally processed by FNMOC.

“DMSP satellites and instruments are still functional. The data provided to FNMOC is just one way the DoD uses DMSP data. DoD users (including the Navy) will continue to receive and operationally use DMSP data sent to weather satellite direct readout terminals across the DoD.”

The Guardian is approaching the US navy for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Venue drops gig under pressure from campaigners and local MP, who said show was against ‘city's values'

Heavy metal star Marilyn Manson, has had the first UK concert of his One Assassination Under God Tour cancelled after pressure from campaign groups and an MP.

The first leg of the tour was due to kick off at the Brighton Centre on Wednesday, 29 October. Ticketmaster have since informed customers that the event will no longer go ahead as planned and they will be refunded.

An online campaign group, No Stage for Abusers, called on the Brighton Centre and Brighton and Hove city council, which owns the venue, to cancel the performance.

Four women had sued Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, accusing him of rape, sexual assault and bodily harm. However, after a year-long investigation, the case against him was dropped in January.

Prosecutors in California found that the statute of limitations had been exceeded and argued they would not be able to bring charges that prove Warner was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

The identities of the women were not revealed, but Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco, who sued Warner in a case that has now been settled, stated that she was part of the criminal investigation.

In 2021, Manson's former fiancee, the Westworld actor Evan Rachel Wood, also named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post. Warner has dismissed the allegations as “falsehoods”.

Last week, Green Party MP Siân Berry expressed her concerns about Warner's scheduled performance in her constituency in Brighton, writing an open letter to the leader of Brighton and Hove city council, Bella Sankey.

In Berry's letter, which was co-signed by a host of groups and the University of Sussex students' union, she made the case for cancelling the concert, saying it went against “the city's well-renowned values”.

Berry wrote: “Many survivors in Brighton and Hove, and organisations supporting them, will have serious concerns about this booking and its wider impact on other people visiting the city centre, local residents and the wider community.”

She added: “The council has a responsibility to take action where there are risks of discrimination, harassment and victimisation.”

Supporters of Warner point out that Warner has not been found guilty of allegations against him. Others said the decision infringes on freedom of speech.

One person told The Argus: “This is cancel culture, nothing more, and it'll backfire when artists don't add a Brighton and Hove date to their tours and stick to London, which incidentally hasn't banned Marilyn Manson from their city.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Prosecutors allege more than a million Medicare recipients had their information stolen and used by the defendants for fraudulent claims

US federal prosecutors charged 11 people on Friday in a Russia-based scheme to bilk Medicare – the American health insurance program for the elderly and disabled – out of $10.6bn through fraudulent billing for expensive medical equipment.

The “transnational criminal organization” orchestrated a “multi-billion-dollar health care fraud and money laundering scheme” that included purchasing dozens of medical equipment companies from prior legitimate owners to perpetrate the fraud, according to the indictment dated 18 June.

More than a million Medicare recipients had their personal information stolen and used by the defendants to file for billions of dollars in claims from Medicare and its supplemental insurers, prosecutors said in the filing.

The claims were filed through medical equipment providers that the group had purchased, but no equipment was ever sent out for the payments.

Medicare paid “approximately $41 million as a result of the fraudulent submissions” and supplemental insurers are estimated to have paid out $900m more between 2022 and 2024, prosecutors wrote.

The scheme was organized by Imam Nakhmatullaev, who is based in Russia, officials said, and managed the other defendants who were in Estonia, the Czech Republic and the US.

The fraud was identified after “hundreds of thousands of Americans reported their concerns to Medicare and its contractors after receiving explanation of benefit forms that reflected them purportedly receiving” equipment that they neither sought or received, the indictment said.

The organization moved its proceeds through shell companies to bank accounts in countries such as Singapore, Pakistan and Israel and laundered it using cryptocurrency, according to the indictment, the New York Times reported.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Brazil's Barcelona forward Raphinha regretted that the players were not consulted about extending their season to play at the Club World Cup, adding that nobody should be obliged to give up their vacation time.

The first expanded edition of the Club World Cup started on June 14 and is to run until July 13. The competition followed the European league season, which concluded late last month, and an international window at the beginning of this month.

“Speaking particularly as someone who plays for a European team, we would [currently] be on vacation,” Raphinha said.

“Marquinhos and Beraldo, from Paris Saint-Germain, won the Champions League and didn't even get to celebrate properly. They came to the national team and then went to the Club World Cup. They still haven't stopped,” he said.

“Many say that this is an excuse. It may or may not be, but having to give up our vacations out of obligation is very complicated. It's our right. Everyone deserves at least a month of vacation. And many of them won't get it,” he added.

Most of the major European leagues would be back in action in mid to late August, with the pre-seasons starting early in the month.

“If PSG reach the Club World Cup final, they will have the Super Cup right away. It doesn't stop,” Raphinha added.

“It depends on your point of view. From my point of view, it's very bad to give up your vacation to play something that you are forced to do. At no point did they ask the players if they wanted to,” he said. “It [should be] up to us to accept it. Having to give up your vacation to play in a new tournament is very complicated.”

PSG are to face Tottenham Hotspur for the Super Cup on Aug. 13.

A record number of people were expected to attend yesterday's Pride march in Budapest, defying a ban that marks an unprecedented regression of LGBTQ rights in the EU.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling coalition amended laws and the constitution earlier this year to prohibit the annual celebration, justifying his years-long clampdown on LGBTQ rights on “child protection” grounds.

While Orban has been emboldened by the anti-diversity offensive of US President Donald Trump, his own initiatives have drawn protests at home and condemnation from the EU and rights groups.

Orban on Friday said that while police would not “break up” the 30th edition of the Pride march, those who took part should be aware of “legal consequences.”

Despite the risk of a fine, more than 35,000 people were expected to gather at 2pm near Budapest's city hall, an hour before the march was to begin.

Ministers from several EU countries and dozens of European lawmakers are expected to attend in defiance of the ban, reminiscent of that in Moscow in 2006 and Istanbul in 2015.

“We are not just standing up for ourselves... If this law is not overturned, eastern Europe could face a wave of similar measures,” Pride organizer Viktoria Radvanyi said.

Earlier this week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on Hungarian authorities to reverse the ban.

Thirty-three countries have also spoken up in support of the march.

While parade organizers risk up to a year in prison, attendees can face fines up to 500 euros (US$585.95). The latest legal changes empower the authorities to use facial-recognition technology to identify those who take part. Freshly installed cameras have appeared on lamp posts along the planned route of the march.

However, opposition Budapest Mayor Gergely Karacsony has insisted that no attendee can face any reprisals as the march — co-organized by the city hall this time — is a municipal event and does not require police approval.

“The police have only one task tomorrow, and it is a serious one: to ensure the safety of Hungarian and European citizens attending the event,” Karacsony said during a briefing with visiting EU equalities commissioner Hadja Lahbib.

Far-right groups have announced multiple counterprotests along the planned route of the procession.

Hungarian Minister of Justice Bence Tuzson this week sent a letter to EU embassies cautioning diplomats and staff against participating, because of the police ban.

Several EU countries have informed their citizens of the potential of fines through travel advisories. 

Since Orban's return to power in 2010, the country of 9.6 million people has been steadily rolling back LGBTQ rights.

Legal changes have effectively barred same-sex couples from adopting children, prevented transgender people from changing their name or gender in official documents and a 2021 law forbade the “display and promotion” of homosexuality to those younger than 18.

In March, lawmakers passed a bill targeting the annual Pride march, amending the 2021 law to prohibit any gathering contravening its provisions. A month later, parliament also adopted a constitutional change to bolster the legal foundations for the ban.

“Orban is employing a tried-and-tested recipe ahead of next year's election by generating a conflict,” political analyst Daniel Mikecz said, adding that Orban was “polarizing society.”



                                                                                Drug lord Jose Adolfo Macias Villamar, alias “Fito,” was Ecuador's most-wanted fugitive before his arrest on Wednesday, more than a year after he escaped prison from where he commanded the country's leading criminal gang.
The former taxi driver turned crime boss became the prime target of law enforcement early last year after escaping from a prison in the southwestern port of Guayaquil.
Ecuadoran President Daniel Noboa's government released “wanted” posters with images of his face and offered US$1 million for information leading to his capture.
In a country plagued by crime, members of Fito's gang, Los Choneros, have responded with violence, using car                                    



                                                                                Canada and the EU on Monday signed a defense and security pact as the transatlantic partners seek to better confront Russia, with worries over Washington's reliability under US President Donald Trump.
The deal was announced after a summit in Brussels between Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa.
“While NATO remains the cornerstone of our collective defense, this partnership will allow us to strengthen our preparedness ... to invest more and to invest smarter,” Costa told a news conference. “It opens new opportunities for companies on both sides of the

Humanity must wake up to the climate crisis or face extinction, Taiwanese Nobel Prize laureate and National Climate Change Committee Adviser Lee Yuan-tseh (李遠哲) said yesterday in a call for urgency in the nation's transition to renewable energy. 

He made the remarks at a renewable energy forum at the National Taiwan Science Education Center in Taipei, saying that humans are on a path to destroying their society and the planet. 

Forest fires and extreme weather events occurring globally have made it clear that humanity would face extinction if it does not wake up to the threat posed by climate change, said Lee, a former Academia Sinica president.

The international effort to ban chlorofluorocarbons patched the ozone hole, showing that collective action could work, he said. 

Humans must reject consumerism to rediscover value in frugality, cease the mindless building of large-scale constructions that harm the environment and forge a rational social order to live in harmony with nature, he said. 

“Global warming and the future of our species is what keeps me up at night,” he said, adding that global challenges require an organized global response. 

Humans should find a different developmental model, improve the technology to capture and store solar energy, and share it across national lines, he said. 

The UN had said global warming should be limited to 1.5°C from preindustrial levels — which the world surpassed last year, Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy chairman Eugene Chien (簡又新) said at the same event. 

Taiwan is one of the main culprits for the global failure to contain warming within that threshold, he said. 

The nation releases large amounts of carbon gases, is not self-sufficient in energy and has not built enough renewable energy resources, he said. 

Taiwan reduced carbon emissions by 4.6 percent in 2023 and aims to cut emissions by 28 percent by 2028, while the UK reduced carbon emissions by 52.7 percent in 2023 and aims to cut them by 68 percent by 2050, he said. 

Taiwan would likely prioritize its advantages in chipmaking and artificial intelligence development over the next 10 years, National Climate Change Committee Deputy Convener Tung Tzu-hsien (童子賢) said. 

The nation must deal with its energy dependency problem by transitioning to green energy while it still can, he added.



                                                                                Prosecutors in New Taipei City yesterday indicted 31 individuals affiliated with the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) for  allegedly forging thousands of signatures in recall  campaigns targeting three Democratic Progressive Party  (DPP) lawmakers.
The indictments stem from investigations launched earlier  this year after DPP lawmakers Su Chiao-hui (蘇巧慧) and  Lee Kuen-cheng (李坤城) filed criminal complaints  accusing campaign organizers of submitting false signatures  in recall petitions against them.
According to the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office,  a total of 2,566 forged recall proposal forms in the initial  proposer petition were found during the probe.
Among those                                    


ECHOVIRUS 11: 
                                        The rate of enterovirus infections in northern Taiwan increased last week, with a four-year-old girl developing acute flaccid paralysis, the CDC said                                        Two imported cases of chikungunya fever were reported last week, raising the total this year to 13 cases — the most for the same period in 18 years, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday.
The two cases were a Taiwanese and a foreign national who both arrived from Indonesia, CDC Epidemic Intelligence Center Deputy Director Lee Chia-lin (李佳琳) said.
The 13 cases reported this year are the most for the same period since chikungunya was added to the list of notifiable communicable diseases in October 2007, she said, adding that all the cases this year were imported, including 11 from

The US' ongoing conflict with Iran is not merely an act of retaliation or a “delaying tactic,” but a strategic military campaign aimed at dismantling Tehran's nuclear capabilities and reshaping the regional order in the Middle East, said National Defense University distinguished adjunct lecturer Holmes Liao (廖宏祥), former McDonnell Douglas Aerospace representative in Taiwan.

WAKAYAMA — Visitors to Adventure World theme park said goodbye to all four giant pandas housed there as they departed for China from Shirahama, Wakayama Prefecture, on Saturday morning.

The four pandas were placed in cages and carried onto two trucks as part of their journey to China. The pandas left the park as about 300 people, including staff and their families, waved flags and bid farewell.

“I hope they will stay healthy and show their good health to people in China and those coming from Japan,” said Koji Imazu, the park's director.

The pandas will be kept at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in China's Sichuan Province. After their return to China, there will be only two pandas in Japan. These two pandas, kept in Ueno Zoo in Tokyo, are set to be returned to China on Feb. 20 next year.

Russia is returning outdated T-62 tanks to service due to mounting equipment losses in its full-scale war against Ukraine and a shortage of modern military equipment, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) said on June 28.

""The key factors limiting the ability to produce modern armored vehicles in Russia are a lack of industrial capacity and a shortage of imported high-tech components,"" the agency said.

According to HUR, the restoration of T-62 tanks is primarily carried out at a facility in the village of Atamanovka in Russia's far-eastern Zabaykalsky Krai. 

Russia transferred 21 T-62 tanks from its eastern military district to the European part of the country, the intel claimed.

HUR said that Russia's stockpile of Soviet-era tanks from the 1970s is being depleted, while most T-62s are even in worse condition after decades of open-air storage without maintenance.

Some of these tanks can also be used at the front as stationary firing points to reinforce defensive positions.

""Due to a severe shortage of modern main battle tanks such as the T-90M and T-72B3M, the deployment of T-62s is seen as a temporary but necessary measure,"" the statement read.

Since the start of its full-scale war in February 2022, Russia has lost 10,970 tanks, Ukraine's General Staff said in its latest update on June 28. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these numbers.

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on June 28 that he does not intend to meet directly with President Volodymyr Zelensky, claiming that the Ukrainian president ""hates"" him, as relations between the two countries continue to sour. 

The incident adds to a series of aerial provocations reported by NATO allies since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 as Moscow is suspected of using the aircraft to spy on the alliance's positions.

""Andrzej has been with Ukraine since the first days of the war, always side by side, a reliable ally and a true friend. This is undoubtedly the level of relations we want to preserve and strengthen with Poland,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The attack destroyed Mi-8, Mi-26 and Mi-28 attack helicopters, and a Pantsyr-S1 self-propelled anti-aircraft missile and gun system, the Security Service of Ukraine told the Kyiv Independent.

""The key factors limiting the ability to produce modern armored vehicles in Russia are a lack of industrial capacity and a shortage of imported high-tech components,"" Ukraine's military intelligence said.

Ukrainian forces downed 21 out of the 23 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported.

Russian drones hit a 21-story building, causing a fire on the 7th, 8th, and 9th floors that left residents trapped in their apartments. A couple was killed and 14 others were injured, including three children. 

The number includes 1,000 casualties that Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

The Atesh partisan group set fire to a signal cabinet that helps control traffic on a railway line near the Russian-occupied city of Yasynuvata in Donetsk Oblast, a route used for Russia's military logistics, the group claimed on Telegram on June 28.

Yasynuvata lies some 22 kilometers (12.5 miles) from the occupied city of Donetsk and is considered to be a major railway junction in the region.

According to the group, the sabotaged section is located near Russian military units, warehouses, and industrial facilities.

Atesh said the attack disrupted the delivery of a train carrying fuel for Russian forces.

""On Ukraine's Constitution Day, we remind the occupiers that this is an independent and free country. And Donetsk will always be Ukrainian,"" the statement read.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims.

The Atesh partisan group regularly conducts sabotage attacks in Russia and Ukraine's Russian-occupied territories.

In early June, Atesh claimed to have destroyed a signal cabinet on the new Volnovakha-Mariupol railway, which had been recently built by occupying Russian forces.

Russia launched its new Grom-1 bomb missile at Dnipropetrovsk Oblast for the first time on June 28, but it was shot down by Ukrainian air defenses, Governor Serhii Lysak said.

The attack comes as Russian troops continue their offensive in neighboring Donetsk Oblast, pushing closer to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast — a major industrial region in central Ukraine.

In mid-June, Ukraine's military denied reports that Russian troops had entered the region, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying that Ukrainian troops had intercepted Russian reconnaissance units attempting to breach Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. 

Explosions in Dnipro were heard around 11:30 a.m. local time, shortly after the Ukrainian Air Force reported that Russia had launched guided aerial bombs.

The strike was later confirmed to have been launched from the Russian-occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

""The target flew more than 100 kilometers and was shot down by air defense outside the city of Dnipro,"" the statement read.

Authorities are verifying the wreckage of the downed weapon.

To date, neither Russian guided aerial bombs nor the Grom-1 bomb missile had previously reached the city of Dnipro.

The Grom-1 is described to be a hybrid of a guided aerial bomb and a missile, developed from the Kh-38 missile platform, with an estimated range of up to 120 kilometers.

Russia regularly uses guided aerial bombs to attack front-line areas in Ukraine's east and south, as well as regional centers such as Kharkiv, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhia.

As Moscow intensifies its attacks on Ukrainian cities, earlier this week on June 24, Russian forces struck civilian infrastructure and a passenger train with ballistic missiles, killing at least 21 people and injuring more than 300 others.

The incident adds to a series of aerial provocations reported by NATO allies since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 as Moscow is suspected of using the aircraft to spy on the alliance's positions.

""Andrzej has been with Ukraine since the first days of the war, always side by side, a reliable ally and a true friend. This is undoubtedly the level of relations we want to preserve and strengthen with Poland,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

The attack destroyed Mi-8, Mi-26 and Mi-28 attack helicopters, and a Pantsyr-S1 self-propelled anti-aircraft missile and gun system, the Security Service of Ukraine told the Kyiv Independent.

""The key factors limiting the ability to produce modern armored vehicles in Russia are a lack of industrial capacity and a shortage of imported high-tech components,"" Ukraine's military intelligence said.

To date, neither Russian guided aerial bombs nor the Grom-1 bomb missile had previously reached the city of Dnipro.

The Atesh partisan group set fire to a signal cabinet that helps control traffic on a railway line near the Russian-occupied city of Yasynuvata in Donetsk Oblast, a route used for Russia's military logistics, the group claimed on Telegram on June 28.

Ukrainian forces downed 21 out of the 23 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported.

Russian drones hit a 21-story building, causing a fire on the 7th, 8th, and 9th floors that left residents trapped in their apartments. A couple was killed and 14 others were injured, including three children. 

The number includes 1,000 casualties that Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

In a YouGov survey conducted June 12-16, 24% of U.S. adults said they ""strongly support"" sanctioning Russian energy buyers while 25% said they ""somewhat support"" secondary sanctions against these countries. 

The government and Ukrainian businesses now provide over 40% of the weapons used to defend the nation's independence against Russia's full-scale invasion, Zelensky said on June 27. 

The moratorium is intended to ""protect businesses from any pressure by unscrupulous individuals in various government positions,"" the president said at the State and Business Forum in Kyiv on June 27. 

Pokrovsk remains the ""hottest spot"" along the front line but ""the situation is under control"" and Russia has not crossed the administrative border from Donetsk to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Hikvision has faced numerous sanctions and restrictions by the U.S.Reuters

The federal government has ordered Chinese surveillance camera manufacturer Hikvision to cease operations in Canada over national security concerns, Industry Minister Melanie Joly said late on Friday.

Hikvision, also known as Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co, has faced numerous sanctions and restrictions by Canada's neighbour, the United States, over the past five and a half years for the firm's dealings and the use of its equipment in China's Xinjiang region, where rights groups have documented abuses against the Uyghur population and other Muslim communities.

“The government has determined that Hikvision Canada Inc's continued operations in Canada would be injurious to Canada's national security,” Joly said on X, adding that the decision was taken after a multi-step review of information provided by Canada's security and intelligence community.

Her statement did not mention China or Xinjiang or specify how Hikvision would harm Canada's national security.

“We strongly disagree with this decision and view it with deep concern, as we believe it lacks a factual basis, procedural fairness, and transparency,” a Hikvision spokesperson told Reuters.

“Instead of evaluating our technology on its cybersecurity merits, the decision appears to be driven by the parent company's country of origin, reflecting broader geopolitical tensions and an unjustified bias against Chinese companies.”

The spokesperson said the company “urges the Canadian government to base its actions on facts rather than prejudice, and to uphold a fair, transparent environment for all businesses and investors.”

The company, which calls itself the world's biggest maker of video surveillance equipment, said last year it had exited contracts in Xinjiang through five subsidiaries that were added to a U.S. trade blacklist in 2023.

The Chinese government has denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and has criticized or targeted companies for removing Xinjiang firms from their supply chains.

Canada said last year it was reviewing an application to impose sanctions against Chinese surveillance equipment companies, including Hikvision, after rights advocates alleged the firms were aiding repression and high-tech surveillance in Xinjiang.

Joly said Canada was also banning the purchase of Hikvison's products in government departments and agencies, and reviewing existing properties to ensure that legacy Hikvision products were not used in the future.

She said the order does not extend to the company's affiliate operations outside Canada but “strongly” encouraged Canadians “to take note of this decision and make their own decisions accordingly.”

Much of the chatter following Mr. Sabia's June 11 appointment has been about personnel changes, but that only scratches the surface of what's needed to get things rolling.Jenna Muirhead/The Globe and Mail

Michael Sabia is being asked to reverse, in a matter of months, an inertia that has taken hold in the nation's capital over decades.

Since Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that the erstwhile chief executive officer of Hydro-Québec will serve as Clerk of the Privy Council – the country's top bureaucrat – Ottawa has been rife with speculation about how Mr. Sabia will try to light a fire under a federal public service accustomed to moving more slowly and cautiously than is demanded by the current moment. 

But while much of the chatter following Mr. Sabia's June 11 appointment has been about personnel changes to the bureaucracy's highest ranks – through an expansive shuffle of deputy ministers, the most senior civil servants in each ministry, expected this summer – that only scratches the surface of what's needed to get things rolling. 

Hanging in the balance is an agenda, put forward by Mr. Carney to assert Canada's economic sovereignty, that's at odds with the government's implementation capacity to date. It includes fast-tracking energy and infrastructure projects, scaling homegrown technologies, diversifying exports, building housing, reorienting immigration, developing self-reliant supply chains and leveraging industrial gains from increased defence spending.

Opinion: Michael Sabia faces an uphill climb in reforming Canada's civil service

The scale of the challenge – and what sorts of structural, cultural and personnel changes could be required – were conveyed to The Globe and Mail in recent interviews with two dozen people closely familiar with the bureaucracy's workings, including current and former deputy ministers and senior political officials. 

Although there was recognition that some departments have functioned better than others (and some have stepped up in other times of crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic and 2008 global financial meltdown), they highlighted an array of overarching barriers that have taken root since the 1990s, if not earlier. 

Among them are a depletion of talent despite the bureaucracy's total ranks growing; particular lack of implementation expertise in some economic areas and policy mechanisms Mr. Carney is prioritizing; disconnect between the public and private sectors; a lack of clear lines of accountability; failure to make use of modern technologies; and severe aversion to taking risks. 

Mr. Sabia's suitability to tackling all of that, if anyone can, is a subject of considerable debate.

Over a late-career run that has included heading pension giant Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, serving as deputy finance minister and then leading Hydro-Québec, he's earned a reputation as a creative policy maker and architect of big, ambitious projects. Among them are the Canada Infrastructure Bank, the Canada Growth Fund and a new hydroelectricity relationship between Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador. He is also, like Mr. Carney, a rare Canadian executive who has moved fluidly between government and the private sector, giving him an unusual combination of institutional knowledge and outside perspective.

At the same time, with his federal experience limited mostly to the Finance department, he may have less knowledge of government-wide dynamics than previous clerks who were career bureaucrats. Sharing some of Mr. Carney's suffer-no-fools reputation, it's an open question how he'll fare at bringing others along. And with a recent pattern of staying in jobs long enough to set big plans in motion and then moving on, it's not clear how much emphasis he'll place on long-term systemic reforms.

But If ever there were a time for impatience to be a virtue, this might be it.

While there are widespread calls around Ottawa for a formal, government-wide program review to comprehensively reallocate resources and modernize rules and processes – the sort of effort last seriously undertaken by Jean Chrétien's government in the '90s – that push could take most of Mr. Carney's mandate to complete. By then, the opportunity to seize on Canada's elbows-up moment with a transformative economic agenda, in response to U.S. President Donald Trump, might have passed.

The hope among some reform-minded government veterans is that Mr. Carney and Mr. Sabia land on a two-track approach – in which they set in motion long-term structural overhaul, to leave the government in better shape than they found it, but more immediately send whatever signals and create whatever workarounds are needed to get stuff done now.

That may not be a viable pathway to overcoming every obstacle. There may, for instance, be few quick fixes for Ottawa's reliance on outdated technologies and information systems.

But three of the biggest potential obstacles to implementing Mr. Carney's agenda are instructive, in terms of how it could work.

A common perception in Ottawa is that high-level bureaucratic talent has diminished over the past couple of decades.

More specifically, there are widely acknowledged expertise gaps. In a government that has traditionally done most spending through grants and transfer payments, that includes lack of comfort with more complex financial tools that Mr. Carney may be looking to deploy in industrial strategies. And lack of employment mobility, between the public and private sectors, has contributed to a perceived disconnect between career bureaucrats in Ottawa and policies' real-world impacts.

There are many fundamental ways to address those shortcoming – new strategies around recruitment and career advancement, changing pay structures, using technology to expedite glacial hiring processes. Most contentiously, but increasingly whispered about, Ottawa could loosen bilingualism requirements to broaden its pool.

Canada has ‘ambition deficit' and regulations that are scaring away investment, Sabia says

In the near term, the most obvious lever is the anticipated deputy-minister shuffle, following a small shuffle that took place this month. It could see Mr. Sabia bringing in some new faces, and perhaps more so trying to elevate younger talent already in the bureaucracy, even if they have not worked their way up as gradually as has been customary.

But many people interviewed for this story also suggested Ottawa may have to get more creative about bringing in people from industry – and possibly provincial governments – to work on policy priorities of Mr. Carney's for which they have specific expertise.

That could potentially be done under Interchange Canada, an underutilized federal program enabling exchanges between the public and private sectors. It could also see people seconded from outside government, forming hybrid teams with bureaucrats to advance key files. 

Navigating conflict-of-interest considerations would be a challenge – but not, by most accounts, an insurmountable one. And Mr. Sabia's unusual history straddling the public and private sectors could help convince others to do so.

A near-universal lament is that civil servants feel incentivized to keep their heads down and avoid risks – in putting forward new ideas, or taking ownership of moving policies forward. 

That's partly because of additional rules and guidelines layered on after any sort of spending or ethics controversy. Paring those down, to maintain but simplify accountability, is seen as a long-term play. 

But it's also because of a common perception that politicians are prepared to throw bureaucrats under the bus – or shove them in front of parliamentary committees – at the first sign of trouble, rather than taking heat themselves. And that's where there may be an opportunity to quickly pursue culture change.

Mr. Sabia could help by sending a signal across the bureaucracy that people who take initiative and move quickly will be valued. 

Much will come down to Mr. Carney. His tone, early on, has suggested that expedience and ambition are the priority. But bureaucrats tend to say that the real message about risk tolerance will come from how tolerant he and his ministers prove when moving fast causes something to go wrong.

Another oft-cited reason for slowness and lack of individual initiative is that there are too many cooks in the kitchen. 

While recent growth of the total federal workforce (well above 300,000 people) is likely to be targeted by Mr. Carney for cost savings, ballooning upper ranks – assistant deputy ministers, associate deputy ministers, directors-general, etc. – have particularly bogged down decision-making by creating hierarchical confusion.

So too, bureaucrats counter, has an excess of political staff – numbering around 800, by the end of former prime minister Justin Trudeau's tenure, far more than in other Westminster democracies – dipping in and out of files. Not to mention decisions notoriously getting log-jammed in the Prime Minister's Office.

That crowdedness is crying out for a review aimed at paring back and simplifying lines of authority. But some of that could be done informally, for now. 

While a small number of top priorities will inevitably have heavy involvement from the PMO – and the Privy Council Office, the (also enlarged) bureaucratic department that supports it – the rest could be delegated to ministries with minimal central interference. And deputies there could be pushed to identify a small number of their top performers to push things through, bruised egos be damned.

As with other possible quick fixes, it could be inelegant. 

But Mr. Carney has been elected, and Mr. Sabia appointed, with promised focus on results. 

Those results may include a dramatically restructured federal government. But they may not have time to wait for it, if they want to get everything else done.

Local authorities said the soldiers were killed in a suicide attack in north-western Pakistan. The attack was claimed by a faction of the Pakistani Taliban.

At least 16 Pakistani soldiers were killed in a suicide attack that was claimed by the Pakistani Taliban, local government officials and police officers told AFP on Saturday.

The attack in north-western Pakistan also left 29 people injured, including 10 army personnel and 19 civilians.

""A suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a military convoy,"" said a local government official in North Waziristan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

A police officer informed AFP that the explosion had also caused the roofs of two houses to collapse, injuring six children.

Meanwhile, Reuters reported that a suicide bombing had killed at least 13 soldiers, while AP mentioned 8 casualties. 

According to AP sources, the attack targeted a military vehicle in North Waziristan at around lunchtime.

The attack was claimed by the suicide bomber wing of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur armed group, which is affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban, AFP said.

Since the Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021, violence has increased significantly in the Pakistani regions bordering Afghanistan.

Pakistan's meterological department has said there is a risk of severe rainfall and more flash floods up until Tuesday.

Flash floods in Pakistan's northwest mountanious province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have killed 11 people, including four children, the country's disaster management officials said.

""In the past 24 hours, flash floods and landslides have claimed the lives of 11 people — including four children and three women — while six others have been injured,"" the Provincial Disaster Management Authority said in a report released late Friday.

One person was killed in the Malakand district while the 10 others were killed in the Swat Valley, according to the report.

Local media reported that families had been swept away and that the flooding had damaged 56 houses along the Swat river. 

Pakistan's local daily newspaper Dawn reported that rescue operations were underway in several other districts with people trapped in the water. 

Meanwhile the national meterological department warned of heavy rainfall and a possibility of more flash floods until Tuesday.

Pakistan is among the world's more vulnerable countries to the effect of climate change with an increasing frequency of flash floods and other climate-related events impacting its 240 million inhabitants.

In May, some 24 people were killed in severe storms in Pakistan. In August 2022, a third of the country was flooded due to unprecedented monsoon rainfall with more than 33 million people affected. Scientists from across the globe have since said that the climate crisis was to blame and that rising global temperatures will only make monsoons more intense in future.

Pakistan's former climate change minister Sherry Rehman took to X, saying that the nation continued to ""sleepwalk"" on climate change and the threat it posed.

She pointed to regular alerts issued by the national disaster management agency and said that local authorities had failed to take them seriously. 

""Not only did the provincial administration fail to understand the magnitude of the crisis, I keep repeating, so did denialist tourists. This is endemic to a system that thinks that climate change can just be put on a back burner,  or that crises will not multiply in scale and intensity,"" she wrote.

""These are not ""natural disasters"" which absolve all actors of responsibility, local, national and global. Super monsoons and flash floods are not the norm. They have been intensifying for decades,"" she added, urging the country to ""wake up"" the to the issue.

German federal prosecutors have charged a teenager with aiding in the preparation of a suspected terrorist attack targeting a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna last summer.

Germany's Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe on Friday said judges had indicted a teenager accused of having helped to plot a foiled attack on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna last year,

The US pop star canceled three scheduled concerts in Vienna as part of her Eras tour in August 2024 after the arrest of two young men suspected of planning a terrorist attack.

The teenager in Germany, a Syrian national, is accused of translating a bomb-making manual from Arabic and connecting the Austrian man with a member of the so-called ""Islamic State"" (IS) abroad.

He also allegedly provided a template for an oath of allegiance to IS, which the Austrian suspect is believed to have used to declare his membership in the terrorist organization. 

According to prosecutors, the teen is not in custody.

The Austrian suspect is accused of planning to drive a car loaded with explosives into the crowd of Swift fans waiting to enter the stadium ahead of the concert.

In August 2024, three of Taylor Swift's scheduled concerts in Vienna were canceled due to security concerns. The cancellations followed the arrest of two suspects, including a 19-year-old who, according to Austrian police, was planning attacks in the Vienna area.

The German Federal Prosecutor has filed charges before the state security senate of the Berlin Court of Appeal. The teenager is accused of supporting a foreign terrorist organization and preparing a serious act of violence endangering the state. He allegedly maintained contact with the Austrian suspect between mid-July and August 2024.

The Berlin court must now determine whether to proceed with a trial.

Meanwhile, Austrian authorities continue to investigate the main suspect, who remains in pretrial detention. According to Vienna's public prosecutor, no other accomplices are currently known to investigators in Austria.

I'm always consumed by the same question: How will this endless, brutal spectacle of killing finally end?

Will it be like a movie — justice prevailing, liberation won, goodness triumphing over evil?

Will the ending even be worthy of the horrors we've endured? Or will it all fade away in an open-ended scene, full of unknowns, unanswered questions, and the absence of closure?

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

Will I make it to the final scene? Or will my story be abruptly cut short, lost before the credits even roll?

But this isn't a movie. This isn't a nightmare I'll wake up from.

This is Gaza.

And this is our reality — where every day, our lives are silently severed, not even properly documented in the ledger of Israel's war crimes.

On June 8, Israeli forces bombed the core internet infrastructure in both the north and south of Gaza. The Strip went dark. We were cut off completely. No messages in, no messages out.

Here, we've become experts in sensing when something monstrous is coming — when death lurks under the stillness.

Our minds raced, our bodies — exhausted, broken, starved — could barely keep up. Every possible ending ran through my head: Would we be massacred quietly, all at once? Would we be erased without anyone ever knowing? Does the world even realize we're vanishing? And if they do, do they care enough to stop it? Will they ever try to wipe our blood off their hands with real action, not hollow statements?

It didn't end with internet blackouts. Israel jammed all telecommunications. For us, the internet wasn't a luxury — it was a lifeline, a way to transfer funds during the liquidity crisis, a fragile system holding back hunger.

When even that collapsed, desperation surged.

Crowds gathered at what was called a “humanitarian aid” point in Gaza — praying, not for salvation, but for a box of food. But the gates were shut. And above, Israeli warplanes circled. Without warning, they opened fire. Snipers targeted anyone who dared raise their head. It was like a game — a deadly squash match. Dozens were killed. Hundreds wounded.

Some bled to death on the ground because every call for help was met with the same cold, mechanical response: “No network. Please try again.” But there was no “again.” Only death. Slow. Certain. Inevitable.

One survivor said he heard voices from the drones above: “We told you not to come.” That same day, Israel's military spokesperson posted on Facebook that the distribution point had been closed. No explanation. No apology. Just a death trap dressed as relief.

Instead of food bags, people were shattered. Torn apart. Their remains brought back home in plastic bags.

That very evening, our neighbor's home was bombed. Their screams haven't left my ears. We tried calling the fire department, the ambulances — anyone. Nothing.

So we ran barefoot into the inferno, trying to pull them out with our hands. But one by one, their voices faded. And then, silence.

Explosions thundered in the background. We huddled together, not just out of fear — but because it was the only thing left to do. My heart thudded painfully. My mind was blank, numb. My frail body couldn't bear more. But I couldn't stop thinking of the people who'd just died — unseen, unmourned. It could have been someone I loved. But I couldn't even check my phone to know.

Even mourning is a privilege denied to us.

Another airstrike.

I curled up in the corner. And a voice inside me whispered: This is the last fall, Hend. You're going to die in limbo.

Two days passed. Nothing changed — except our deepening isolation. Hunger became background noise. We've learned to live with gnawing emptiness. But we cannot live without connection. That fragile internet line — it's our only thread to the rest of humanity.

Nearly two years of televised carnage. Still, the world can't name it. Genocide. Democide. Deliberate starvation. Systematic annihilation.

It's all been documented — war crimes, crimes against humanity — coldly and clearly. Yet no sanctions. No accountability. No international court willing to enforce its own laws. No Geneva Convention. No ICC. No ICJ. Nothing but silence.

And so the question remains: Are we still pleading — after all this — to be seen as victims? To prove that our blood is not less valuable? That our children deserve to live, just like yours?

If no one is listening, maybe we should stop screaming. Maybe we should keep the last shred of dignity we have — turn off the cameras — and let the world go on, uninterrupted.

But that's not what we want.

We want to be seen as humans — not corpses. As dreamers — not headlines. We want you to pressure your governments to end this slaughter — not to sip your coffee and scroll past another mass grave.

This is not “too political.” This is your humanity on trial. Gaza is the litmus test. How you respond will define your legacy.

At 3 am on June 14, a phone rang. It felt like a bomb in the dark. We had no cell service — so how was this happening?

I feared it was the Israeli military — an order to evacuate. But it wasn't.

It was my sister, Intimaa, calling from abroad. “Are you okay?” she asked. Her voice cracked with fear. “I've been calling nonstop.”

Then she shared news I hadn't heard: “Israel attacked Iran. Twenty commanders killed. Tehran is in ruins.”

She went on: “The Sumud Convoys — the ones meant to break Gaza's siege — were blocked by Egyptian forces. Hundreds of activists arrested. Some deported.”

Then the line went dead.

That brief call brought no comfort, just more evidence that the world is burning. But still — her voice. Her voice was life.

I lay awake, watching the dark sky erupt with bombs.

I used to believe in those convoys, filled with a thousand people who traveled from across North Africa to try to make it through the Rafah crossing. But they were met with batons and detentions — not solidarity. And, Israel's assault on Iran was a tactic — to distract, while they accelerate our annihilation.

The journalists who once told our stories are gone — killed or silenced. The massacres are hidden behind fake aid and polished lies. The struggle here is unbearable.

And yet, the sun rose again. I told my family about Intimaa's call. Their eyes went blank.

So much horror, and we — trapped, starving, displaced — stayed in place.

We passed the news on to neighbors, like stories passed in ancient times. No phones. No news bulletins. Just mouths, and voices, and pain.

My father, determined, charged a single battery through a flimsy solar panel — just to turn on our battered TV. We watched images of Tel Aviv and Tehran — but not a word about Gaza. Not a breath about the massacre at the aid point. Not a whisper about our dead.

We — who are bleeding — were watching another conflict unfold, as if we had already died.

Eventually, workers from the telecom company managed to negotiate access to fix the broken lines. They risked everything. One technician lost his leg to an airstrike.

But on June 15, the internet returned. And with it, a flood of messages. Relatives checking in. The simple miracle of: “You're still alive.”

It didn't last. By June 16, the connection failed again. And this time, Israeli forces struck the main service point. Another blackout. Another gag order by bombs.

The telecom company sent a message: “We're doing everything we can.” And they were — working under death's shadow.

On June 18, my mother was washing dishes when an airstrike hit our neighbor's house.

She saw a man fly into the air — and crash to the ground. He died instantly.

She screamed. She still can't stop trembling. His family is still buried beneath the rubble.

No rescue. No equipment. No time.

And so I write this, in the hope that you are reading it. If you are, then I've broken through the blackout — for just a moment.

The silence isn't accidental. It's strategy. It's the tool they use to erase us quietly.

Being Palestinian from Gaza means carrying trauma as identity. And we carry it always — inside and out. From this genocide, from 1948, from everything in between.

Nothing will ever truly heal us. But if our voices still reach you, maybe we haven't been completely erased.

Not yet.

Marsha P. Johnson has become an icon of gay, trans, and queer liberation, and yet little is known about her life beyond her participation in the Stonewall Uprising of 1969 and the decadeslong controversy after her lifeless body was found floating in the Hudson River in 1992. In Marsha: The Joy and Defiance of Marsha P. Johnson, Tourmaline, an award-winning Black trans artist, filmmaker, and activist who has dedicated her life to uplifting Marsha P. Johnson's legacy, recuperates her life from the flatness of postmortem deification.

Here we find a fully embodied story of a 1950s New Jersey kid; a 1960s Times Square Hustler and den mother; a fiercely talented performer; and a dedicated activist and AIDS care worker whose unconventional way of thinking and being paved the way for generations of street queens and trans people. Her influence looms large, and Tourmaline is intent on presenting the full range of her choices, inspirations, limitations, and visionary imaginings for us to learn from today.

Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore: This is a biography of Marsha P. Johnson, but it's also a story about friendship as a resource for trans survival, political engagement, personal transformation, and communal care. What role did friendship play in Marsha's life, and how does looking at her life's work through the lens of friendship enrich her legacy?

Tourmaline: Friendship almost doesn't feel like a big enough word for the depth and breadth of love Marsha offered to and received from her dear ones. We talk a lot in the queer community about “chosen family,” and the relationships that Marsha built in NewYork City starting when she moved to Manhattan in 1963 didn't just shape her life, they shaped history. Marsha's ability to be a beacon of power and joy was fueled by, nurtured in, and shaped among the community that she built with her fellow street queens, the wider queer community, and the bicoastal and transatlantic connections she made in a period of immense cultural change.

Two friendships really stand out to me in very different ways — Marsha's relationship with Sylvia Rivera, and her relationship with Randy Wicker. Could you speak to the ways these relationships both challenged and enriched Marsha's life, and the lives of Rivera and Wicker?

I feel so lucky to have been able to become friends with Randy myself over 15 years ago while archiving Marsha's life. Then in the process of writing this book and my other work on Marsha's legacy, including my film Happy Birthday, Marsha, Randy has been incredibly generous in sharing source material related to Marsha, as well as his own memories and reflections. They supported each other in so many ways, pushing each other to see the world more expansively and lovingly, and offering each other really concrete, material support too.

Of course, Marsha's friendship with Sylvia was also an extraordinary source of mutual power and motivation. The two of them came together when Sylvia was just 13 years old, hustling in Times Square, and Marsha at times played a role of mother figure to the young street queens — offering guidance, love, and unconditional support that many had never had access to before. Together they engaged in what we might call, in the words of Robin D.G. Kelley, “freedom dreaming” — seeing through the challenge of their circumstances to a bigger, more beautiful world that they knew they could build together.

Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera are now hailed as icons of gay, queer, and trans liberation, but when they were alive they were often dismissed and marginalized by the gay establishment. What realities does their postmortem deification hide, and what possibilities does it limit?

Authentic individual expression that disrupts binaries, coercive control, or the established flow of power is inherently threatening to the systems that be. Marsha, Sylvia, and other people who were committed to living authentically and deliberately demonstrated a new way of being that many people weren't ready for — it felt destabilizing to see so much freedom in action. But Marsha actually didn't focus very much of her time or energy on any kind of direct, oppositional conflict. There were occasions when it was a necessary result of her existence — for instance, at Stonewall — but I think often of her middle initial: P, which she said stood for “pay it no mind.” Her ability to look beyond, through, and even past daily circumstances of dismissal or marginalization was a huge source of strength and power allowing her to dream up the world she wanted and desired. She was too busy falling in love, making art, inspiring others, traveling, resting, relaxing, and honoring her own joy to pay any mind to attempts to make her smaller.

Stonewall has become romanticized as a place where everyone belonged, but you show how actually it was a Mafia-run, segregated gay bar where street queens were most often not even allowed inside. White gay men were in the front, and everyone else in the back — what does telling the actual story of this space where the Stonewall Uprising emerged help us to understand?

Nuance and complexity are hard to hold when our culture often operates in binaries. Stonewall was a hugely important community gathering place, and it was also reflective of all of the realities of its time. It was not a perfect utopia of total collective welcome; but what it was was a gathering place where people found their way towards each other, even across some of the limitations you described. And that moment of collective uprising in 1969 — even coming out of an imperfect hub for gathering and building community — might help us learn the power of broad-based coalitions for freedom and joy. Stonewall can teach us how strong we can be when we ignore what would keep us apart, and double down on our desire to be together, free from fear and shame.

You quote poet and disability justice author and activist Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha as saying that a riot is a “powerful place of madness.” So, if we want to reinvoke the spirit of Stonewall, should we be invoking madness?

Absolutely. Marsha was open with herself and others about the ways that trauma, violence, and her own unique humanity led her to perceive the world differently than others. Sylvia Rivera reflected on this quality in her friend too, and she observed that it was a huge source of freedom — Marsha had a different way of seeing the world, and it was one that invited and encouraged freedom and a wider lens.

By applying a disability justice lens to Marsha's story, you're able to show how her mental health challenges were also part of how she was able to imagine a different world, to conjure this in everyday experience, in spite of abuse from her mother, from people on the street, from the cops — talk more about what this enabled her to do.

Marsha looked beyond and through the harsh circumstances she endured. She saw the world as it could be, instead of narrowly as it was. She invested in a vision of the world that others found improbable or even impossible. Her belief in her own sight — and the spiritual fuel she found in her relationship with the divine —  empowered her to bring her visions into reality over and over again.

You really bring STAR House, the trans youth shelter that operated briefly in lower Manhattan in 1970 and 1971, to life — this collective experiment in trans self-determination and communal care. They managed to do so much with so little resources. Now we have funded nonprofits that often do much less. Is there a lesson here? 

Marsha's relentless pursuit of her dreams was antithetical to the narrow understanding of logic that many of our institutions use today. Her logic was sound, but perhaps unfamiliar to many people. She knew that she could glimpse the world she wanted to live in in the midst of harsh circumstances that surrounded her. She knew that by leaning into her own vision, her faith, her love, and her joy, it was entirely possible to build the types of spaces she wanted to experience. For me, the book is the story of her and her community doing that over and over again.

You write that Marsha P. Johnson was “disinterested entirely in respectability and assimilation.” What can this teach us today?

In my two decades of researching, learning from, and diving into Marsha's life story, I've learned over and over again that turning the volume up on what makes us feel authentically alive and joyful can be a powerful antidote to structures and systems that would try to reduce our power. Marsha taught us that being authentically and unapologetically yourself can be a guiding light that leads us closer to the world of freedom, ease, love, and joy that we deserve to live in.

Follow:


            As the Trump administration looks to quickly pivot from military strikes to a diplomatic deal on Iran's nuclear program, the final military and intelligence assessment on the recent US strikes will be critical in informing what the Trump administration needs to accomplish in future Iran negotiations.
    


            Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff will need to use that final battle damage assessment – including a detailed summary of the facilities' damage and the locale of the nuclear material – to help formulate the US strategy for diplomatic efforts to completely halt the regime's ability to develop a nuclear weapon in the future, current and former US officials explained.
    


            “You're not going to the negotiation assuming that the other side is going to tell you everything you need to know about the state of their program,” explained Pranay Vaddi, a former senior official for nonproliferation at the National Security Council.
    


            “We need to have a baseline that is established by the US intelligence community before that,” Vaddi added. “If the Trump administration is committed to some kind of deal still – which it makes statements on – they need to know what they were able to get through military action, compared to what they need to get through the diplomatic process.”
    


            President Donald Trump continues to claim that Iran's nuclear program has been “fully obliterated,” which does not mirror an early assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency, finding that the attack did not destroy the core components of the country's nuclear program. The early assessment has split lawmakers on the effectiveness of the strikes. And Trump's absolutist pronouncements could also complicate Witkoff's job, officials said.
    


            Even if the facilities themselves have been badly damaged, it does not mean that the nuclear program itself has been wholly destroyed. Prior to the US strikes, experts and former officials had expressed skepticism about the idea that the nuclear program could be militarily destroyed, noting that there would still be people with the knowledge to support it.
    


            “The basic problem is that the equivalency between the success of the bombing and the success of ending the nuclear program is putting pressure on having this narrative that there isn't a threat,” said Beth Sanner, former deputy director for national intelligence. “If you think that you've eliminated the nuclear program then you are not dealing with the fact that there is some residual of that program.”
    


            And while the final battle damage assessment will be important to take into account, future negotiations with Iran should prioritize getting the UN's nuclear watchdog back on the ground in Iran, said former officials who worked on previous Iran negotiations.
    


            “I don't know that there will be any assessment that I think is fully viable until there are inspectors on the ground,” said a former senior US official who worked on past Iran negotiations. “We must recreate the kind of intrusive verification and monitoring that was in the 2015 deal.”
    


            The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had a presence in Iran before the 2015 nuclear deal signed during the Obama administration – a deal which Trump pulled the US out of during his first term – but the presence of IAEA inspectors in the country drastically increased as a result of that deal.
    


            “The deal meant there were inspectors on the ground 24/7, there was electronic monitoring, there was a process by which – that didn't exist anywhere else in the world – that if there was intelligence about a suspected site, if Iran, over a period of some days, couldn't satisfy the IAEA that there was a reason the IAEA could go and inspect,” the official explained, citing some benefits of the IAEA inspection efforts.
    


            But this week the Iranian parliament this week suspended its work with the IAEA, because of the “regrettable role” played by the agency's chief Rafael Grossi, Iran's foreign minister said. Iran accused Grossi of facilitating the US and Israeli strikes in Iran, citing an IAEA report a day prior to the Israeli strike, which declared Iran was violating its nuclear non-proliferation obligations.
    


            This move follows years of Iran making moves to restrict the agency's oversight of it's program. For example, in 2022 Iran responded by removing surveillance cameras from key sites after IAEA censured Iran over uranium particles found at the undeclared sites.
    


            The steps that would need to be taken as part of any verifiable deal on Iran's nuclear program would likely include: destroying elements of the program that still exist, monitoring any further activity, blending highly enriched uranium, and declaring parts of the program that are in use.
    


            In order to prepare to take those steps, inspectors on the ground would be essential, former officials pressed.
    


            “I think it's been a long time since the US intelligence assessments have been accepted globally as authoritative when it comes to Iran's nuclear program. They would certainly be challenged by Iran. In order to have a successful negotiation everybody needs to at least agree on the source of facts,” said Laura Holgate, the former US Ambassador to the United Nations International Organizations in Vienna.
    


            “The IAEA will be needed to develop a new baseline of what exactly Iran has, where it is, and what its condition is in, and that's going to take time, and it will be based on Iran's cooperation,” Holgate added.
    


            With the IAEA access being diminished over the years and virtually nonexistent at this moment, the world now has large gaps in its knowledge of Iran's nuclear inventory. That is particularly true when it comes to the locale of Iran's enriched uranium.
    


            Trump administration officials have said in recent days that the stockpile was not moved ahead of the US strikes but the IAEA said Iran may have moved some of the enriched uranium out of the sites before they were attacked. Vice President JD Vance said the day after the strikes that working on what to do about that fuel would be a priority for the US.
    


            “We're going to work in the coming weeks to ensure that we do something with that fuel. And that's one of the things that we're going to have conversations with the Iranians about,” Vance said.
    


            Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, cited the importance of having “a full accounting” following an all-member classified briefing on Capitol Hill earlier this week.
    


            “There is enriched uranium in the facilities that moves around, but that was not the intent or the mission,” McCaul said. “We need a full accounting. That's why Iran has to come to the table directly with us, so the IAEA can account for every ounce of enriched uranium that's there, I don't think it's going out of the country, I think it's at the facilities.”
    


            The final US military “battle damage assessment could take days or even weeks to complete,” multiple sources familiar with the Pentagon's process told CNN. CIA Director John Ratcliffe on Wednesday said the agency underscored that a broad intelligence community effort is ongoing to determine the impact of the US strikes on three of the country's nuclear sites on Saturday.
    


            The Trump administration was already working on possible terms to offer Iran to bring them back to the able for nuclear deal talks before the US military strikes occurred. But if they are able to pull Iran back to the table, they will have to then enter into much more technical talks to put a legitimate and verifiable deal into place.
    


            “I think that you want to strike while the iron is hot, to try and get them to the table while they're feeling weak,” Sanner said. “One of the key requirements for the negotiation is setting mechanisms for cataloging Iran's residual capabilities in order to have that conversation and ultimately a deal that is worth the paper it is written on.”

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris will join the mourners Saturday at the funeral for former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, who was killed in a pair of attacks that authorities have called an assassination and that also left her husband dead and a state senator and his wife seriously wounded.

Biden also paid his respects Friday as Hortman, her husband, Mark, and their golden retriever, Gilbert, lay in state in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda in St. Paul, a few hours after the man charged with killing them while disguised as a police officer June 14 made a brief court appearance in a suicide prevention suit.

The couple's private funeral, at the Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis, is set for 10:30 a.m. Saturday. It will be livestreamed on the Department of Public Safety's YouTube channel.

Neither Biden nor Harris is expected to speak. Harris expressed her condolences earlier this week to Hortman's adult children, and spoke with Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate on the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, who extended an invitation on behalf of the Hortman family, her office said.




Hortman, a Democrat, was the first woman and one of fewer than 20 Minnesotans to lay in state at the Capitol. It was the first time a couple has been accorded the honor, and the first for a dog. Gilbert was seriously wounded in the attack and had to be euthanized. The Hortmans' caskets and the dog's urn were arranged in the center of the rotunda, under the Capitol dome, with law enforcement officers keeping watch as thousands of people filed by. Many fought back tears as they left.

Among the first to pay their respects were Walz, who has called Hortman his closest political ally, and his wife, Gwen. Biden, a Catholic, visited later in the afternoon, walking up to the velvet rope in front of the caskets, making the sign of the cross and spending a few moments by himself in silence. He then took a knee briefly, got up, made the sign of the cross again and walked off to greet people waiting in the wings of the rotunda.

Lisa Greene, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park like Hortman did, but in a different House district, said she came to the Capitol because she had so much respect for the former speaker.

“She was just amazing. Amazing woman. And I was just so proud that she represented the city that I lived in,” Greene said in a voice choked with emotion. “She was such a leader. She could bring people together. She was so accessible. I mean, she was friendly, you could talk to her.” 

But, she went on to say admiringly, Hortman was also “a boss.” 

“She just knew what she was doing and she could just make things happen,” she said.

The man accused of killing the Hortmans at their home and wounding Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home in nearby Champlin, made a short court appearance Friday for what the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, Joseph Thompson, has called “a political assassination.” 

Vance Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest search in Minnesota history.

An unshaven Boelter was brought in wearing just a green padded suicide prevention suit and orange slippers. Federal defender Manny Atwal asked Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko to continue the hearing until Thursday. He agreed. She said Boelter has been sleep deprived while on suicide watch in the Sherburne County Jail, and that it has been difficult to communicate with him as a result.

“Your honor, I haven't really slept in about 12 to 14 days,” Boelter told the judge. And he denied being suicidal. “I've never been suicidal and I am not suicidal now.”

Atwal told the court that Boelter had been in what's known as a “Gumby suit,” without undergarments, ever since his transfer to the jail after his first court appearance on June 16. She said the lights are on in his area 24 hours a day, doors slam frequently, the inmate in the next cell spreads feces on the walls and the smell drifts to Boelter's cell. 

The attorney said transferring him to segregation instead, and giving him a normal jail uniform, would let him get some sleep, restore some dignity and let him communicate better.

Boelter did not enter a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first. According to the federal complaint, police video shows Boelter outside the Hortmans' home and captures the sound of gunfire. And it says security video shows Boelter approaching the front doors of two other lawmakers' homes.

His lawyers have declined to comment on the charges, which could carry the federal death penalty. Thompson said last week that no decision has been made. Minnesota abolished its death penalty in 1911. Boelter also faces separate murder and attempted murder charges in state court that could carry life without parole.

Friends have described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.

Guatemala President Bernardo Arévalo said Friday he has not signed an agreement with the United States to take asylum seekers from other countries, pushing back against comments from U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Guatemala President Bernardo Arévalo said Friday he has not signed an agreement with the United States to take asylum seekers from other countries, pushing back against comments from U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Noem and Arévalo met Thursday in Guatemala and the two governments publicly signed a joint security agreement that would allow U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers to work in the capital's airport, training local agents how to screen for terrorism suspects.

But Noem said she had also been given a signed document she called a safe third country agreement. She said she reached a similar deal in Honduras and said they were important outcomes of her trip.

“Honduras and now Guatemala after today will be countries that will take those individuals and give them refugee status as well,” Noem said. “We've never believed that the United States should be the only option, that the guarantee for a refugee is that they go somewhere to be safe and to be protected from whatever threat they face in their country. It doesn't necessarily have to be the United States.”

Asked about Noem's comments Friday during a news conference, Arévalo said that nothing new was signed related to immigration and that Guatemala was still operating under an agreement reached with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in February. That agreement stipulated that Guatemala would continue accepting the deportation of its own citizens, but also citizens of other Central American nations as a transit point on their way home.

Arévalo said that when Rubio visited, safe third country was discussed because Guatemala had signed such an agreement during U.S. President Donald Trump's first term in office. But “we made it clear that our path was different,” Arévalo said.

He did add that Guatemala was willing to provide asylum to Nicaraguans who have been unable to return to their country because of the political situation there out of “solidarity.”

The president's communications office said Noem had been given the ratification of the agreement reached through diplomatic notes weeks earlier.

During Trump's first term, the U.S. signed such safe third-country agreements with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. They effectively allowed the U.S. to declare some asylum seekers ineligible to apply for U.S. protection and permitted the U.S. government to send them to those countries deemed “safe.”

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California should pause Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to penalize oil companies if their profits climb too high, a top energy regulator said Friday while unveiling proposals aimed at addressing high gas prices.

The Democratic governor signed a law in 2023 giving the California Energy Commission the authority to penalize oil companies for excess profits, declaring the state had “finally beat big oil.” More than two years later, the commission hasn't imposed a single penalty or determined what counts as an excessive profit.

Now, Siva Gunda, the energy commission's vice-chair, says the state should pause the effort in favor of pursuing other policies to lower prices and maintain a steady oil supply — all while pushing to phase out reliance on fossil fuels over the next two decades.

“Together, we will evolve California's strategy to successfully phase out petroleum-based fuels by 2045 while protecting communities, workers, and consumers, and foster market conditions that support the industry's ability to operate safely, reliably, and successfully to meet demand through the transition,” Gunda wrote in a letter to Newsom.

Gunda's recommended pause of the penalty would have to be agreed upon by the full commission. Newsom has pitched the penalty as a way to rein in profits by oil companies, but critics said it would only raise prices. 

California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.61 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.




The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance, Gunda said. That proposal came out of a law Newsom signed last year after convening a special session aimed at preventing gas price spikes.

Gunda's recommendations come months after Newsom in April directed energy regulators to work with refiners on plans to ensure the state maintains a reliable fuel supply as it transitions away from fossil fuels.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in an email that the governor would review the recommendations and “advance solutions that maintain a safe, affordable, and reliable supply of transportation fuels for California.”

Two major oil companies announced plans over the past year to shut down refineries in the state, further driving uncertainty about how the state should maintain a stable fuel supply as California transitions toward renewable energy. Phillips 66 announced plans to shut down its Los Angeles-area refinery, and Valero said it would cease operations at its Benicia refinery. The two refineries combined account for more than 17% of the state's refining capacity, according to the energy commission. 

A group of about 50 environmental and consumer groups penned a letter to Newsom and legislative leaders Friday criticizing the proposal to pause implementing a penalty on oil company profits.

“California oil refiners do not need a bailout,” they wrote, adding that the state should “finish the job” it started to prevent prices at the pump from spiking.

Padraig Harrington does not take the unwritten rules of golf lightly. That was apparent after the three-time major winner got into a heated conversation with former PGA Tour pro Roger Maltbie during the second round of the U.S. Senior Open on Friday. 

The dispute between the two golfers was captured on video and appeared to be a matter of golf etiquette.

Harrington's caddie, Ronan Flood, then walked into the conversation in an attempt to defuse the situation, but Harrington continued on. 

""You don't stand looking at somebody looking for a ball.""

For his part, Maltbie didn't appear to disagree with the sentiment of good sportsmanship, but as he explained it, he had a job to do. 

""I understand, but I have a company that pays me,"" he began before Harrington interrupted. 

The confrontation carried on without any resolution. Maltbie said he believed Harrington was ""dead wrong,"" and reminded the pro, ""I'm not a player.""

Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins reports on the Trump administration's latest efforts to crack down on cartels on 'Fox News Live.'

A hacker working for the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico was able to obtain an FBI official's phone record information in 2018 and used Mexico City's surveillance camera system to track and kill informants and witnesses, the Justice Department said in a report. 

The 2018 incident was disclosed in the Justice Department Inspector General's audit of the FBI's efforts to ""Mitigate the Effects of Ubiquitous Technical Surveillance.""

The report said the FBI was working on the case of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, the former leader of the infamous cartel who was extradited to the United States in 2017, when someone tipped the FBI that the drug-trafficking organization hired a hacker ""who offered a menu of services related to exploiting mobile phones and other electronic devices.""

The hacker was able to identify an FBI assistant legal attaché (ALAT) at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City and was able to use the attaché's phone number ""to obtain calls made and received, as well as geolocation data.""

""According to the FBI, in addition to compromising the ALAT's phone, the hacker also accessed Mexico City's camera system, used the cameras to follow the ALAT through the city, and identified people the ALAT met with,"" the report states. ""According to the case agent, the cartel used that information to intimidate and/or kill potential sources or cooperating witnesses.""

The buildup and aftermath of the unprecedented U.S. military operation targeting three of Iran's nuclear facilities has seemingly laid bare President Donald Trump‘s skepticism, or even mistrust, of the U.S. intelligence community.

Trump has had a famously rocky relationship with the intelligence community, especially when it does not align with his viewpoint, dating back to before his first term in office. He still rails against the investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 campaign and the Kremlin, and 51 former intelligence officials who inaccurately claimed that the laptop belonging to Hunter Biden had been Russian disinformation.

He picked two allies in John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard to lead the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, respectively, both of whom have said it is a part of their mission to root out what they believe has been the politicization of the intelligence community.

While it is not necessarily unusual for a president to question intelligence presented to him, the disagreements have played out in public, with Gabbard in particular getting the brunt of it.

“Intelligence people strive to live in a world as it is, describe the world as it is, where politicians are all about describing the world as they want it to be,” Larry Pfeiffer, a former CIA chief of staff and senior director of the White House Situation Room, told the Associated Press.

“I don't think we've seen another president push back as strong as this guy has,” Pfeiffer added.

Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have been at pains to describe the mission as an overwhelming success. Their anger at how the mission is being characterized has been stoked by the leak of a “preliminary” finding from the Defense Intelligence Agency that indicated the Iranian facilities were only damaged, not destroyed, and that it only set back Iran's nuclear ambitions by a matter of months.

Hegseth on Thursday took the media to task during a fiery press conference after CNN and the New York Times initially reported the assessment.

“I mean specifically you, the press corps, because you cheer against Trump so hard, it's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer against Trump,” Hegseth charged as his boss cheered on from the sidelines.

The crux of the dispute is over how long it would take Iran to rebuild its nuclear program if it chooses to do so. The DIA analysis, which was preliminary and is still being refined, indicated that it could be months, while Hegseth said Thursday that it would be an “untold number of years.”

“Anyone with … two eyes, some ears, and a brain can recognize that kind of firepower with that specificity at that location and others is going to have a devastating effect,” Hegseth said, but a major unknown is what happened with Iran's enriched uranium and whether it was in the facilities at the time of the attacks.

Trump called the intelligence “inconclusive” on Wednesday, even though he simultaneously maintained it was “complete obliteration.”

“The intelligence was very inconclusive,” he said from the NATO summit on Wednesday. “The intelligence says we don't know. It could have been very severe. That's what the intelligence says. So I guess that's correct. But I think we can take the we don't know — it was very severe. It was obliteration. It was a complete obliteration.”

In order to further strengthen their case, the White House sent out a statement from the Atomic Energy Commission of Israel that said the U.S. strikes “had set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons for many years to come,” and pointed to comments from Iran's own foreign ministry.

Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that while the strikes went as planned, it is the intelligence community, not the military, that conducts battle damage assessments.

“A point that I want to make here, the joint force does not do [battle damage assessment]. By design, we don't grade our own homework,” Caine said Thursday. “The intelligence community does.”

Caine said the operation had origins dating back 15 years to when it tasked officers to track the Iranian project in the mountainous area near the city of Qom. The Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs hit exactly where the United States wanted them to, down the ventilation shafts, at the right speed for their desired effect.

The U.S. carried out its bombings of three Iranian nuclear sites — Isfahan, Natanz, and Fordow — over the weekend using B-2 bombers from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, which dropped the GBU-57 MOP bombs. The U.S. military had never operationally used the 30,000-pound bomb, which is designed to penetrate hardened facilities.

The Fordow facility is buried underground beneath a mountain, making it very difficult for it to be targeted. Israel wanted the U.S. to get involved in the conflict to target Fordow in particular because it does not possess the MOPs.

“All of the evidence of what was just bombed by 12 30,000-pound bombs is buried under a mountain,” Hegseth said Wednesday, adding, “If you want to make an assessment on what happened at Fordow, you better get a big shovel and go really deep because Iran's nuclear program is obliterated.”

Gabbard said Wednesday that “new intelligence” has led her to the assessment that “Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed,” but she did not specify what it was that led her to that conclusion.

Neither the White House, Defense Department, ODNI, nor CIA has provided details as to what changed from the DIA's initial assessment to the position Trump, Hegseth, Gabbard, and Ratcliffe have now shared.

Gabbard has reportedly been on the outside of the president's inner circle over the last couple of weeks regarding the Israel-Iran war and possible U.S. involvement. She was not at a meeting with the president's national security team on June 8 at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, to discuss tensions between Israel and Iran.

Around the time of that Camp David meeting, Gabbard posted a video on social media warning that “political elite and warmongers” are “carelessly fomenting fear and tensions between nuclear powers,” and she said the world is “on the brink of nuclear annihilation.”

Trump reportedly expressed his disapproval of the video to her directly, according to Politico.

She told lawmakers in March that the intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, and Supreme Leader [Ali] Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003,” though she also noted that Iran's enriched uranium stockpile “is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons.”

Trump, when asked about the intelligence community's assessment a day before the U.S. operation, said, “Well then, my intelligence community is wrong.”

“I don't care what she said,” Trump said in a separate moment when questioned about her March testimony.

Gabbard insisted that they were on the same page following Trump's remarks and blamed the media for portraying her comments as different from the president's assessment.

“There's no question that when the U.S. president makes a statement that our intelligence assessments are wrong and doesn't believe our own intelligence, that creates a very dangerous moment,” former CIA Director Leon Panetta told the I Paper.

DAN CAINE PRAISES OFFICERS WHO STARTED FORDOW OPERATION PLANNING 15 YEARS AGO

“It creates a real problem for the president because if he rejects the intelligence he's receiving, then what will be the basis for the decisions that he makes in the future, and that is a very scary prospect,” Panetta added. “The fundamental question is: Did they make a decision to proceed with developing a weapon? And I think our intelligence indicates that that still was not the case.”

The disagreement over whether Iran was working toward a nuclear weapon is now largely a moot point given the military's bombings.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

New York City mayoral Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa is under pressure to drop out of the race to consolidate support behind incumbent Mayor Eric Adams against socialist Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani.

Mamdani's victory has sent shock waves throughout the country. His opposition is currently split between Sliwa, Adams, who is running as an independent, and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who lost the Democratic nomination but may run as an independent. Some Republican and business leaders are hoping to push Sliwa to drop out and get behind Adams, several people familiar with the matter told Politico and the New York Post.

Though he didn't confirm that he wanted Sliwa out of the race, Republican billionaire John Catsimatidis told Politico that he's supporting Adams as the most viable candidate.

“The only people who are going to help Eric Adams is Washington, whether it's [border czar] Tom Homan, whether it's Donald Trump,” Catsimatidis said. “And Tom and Donald Trump want a safe New York.”

He remained diplomatic about Sliwa, however, stressing they were still friends and that the candidate “has to make up his own mind.”

Sliwa doesn't appear pliable. He suggested he would rather die than drop out.

“I'm not getting out of this race unless they figure out a way to put me in a pine box and bury me 6 feet under,” he said.

In an interview with the New York Post, Sliwa said he was running to save New York City from “the corruption and collapse” created by Adams. He also suggested he was the only one capable of defeating Mamdani.

A unity ticket appears out of the question.

“Absolutely,” he responded sarcastically when asked in an interview with Fox News if he would consider running in a joint ticket with Adams. “Eric, you have been the best nightlife mayor we've ever had. You party to the break of dawn. You can take over the shift at 12 midnight. I'll get a little bit of sleep, come back at it at 6, I'll be the mayor, and you, the swagger man, can be the nightlife mayor. How about that unity?”

“I mean, that's all he's ever done as mayor!” he added.

Elsewhere, Sliwa has blasted Adams over his corruption allegations.

“He's a crook,” he said in an interview with Politico. “A lot of good men and women lost their careers who happened to be Republican conservative prosecutors because of Eric Adams, and he's the luckiest man alive because he should be in a jail cell right now with Bobby Menendez.”

OFFICIAL MAMDANI MEMO SUGGESTS SHIFTING TAX BURDEN TO ‘WHITER NEIGHBORHOODS'

Another scheme, proposed by some sources familiar with the matter to the New York Post, involves giving Sliwa a position in the Trump administration to get him out of the race. Sliwa preemptively turned that down as well.

“If the president were to call, I, very respectfully, would say, ‘President Trump. I'm interested in only one job: being mayor of the city of New York,'” Sliwa said. “I'm the Republican nominee. I'm the ‘protecting animals' independent party nominee, and I'm running 'til November 4, until the vote to figure out who our next mayor is.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

An award-winning Washington Post reporter has been charged with the possession of child pornography, including on his work computer.

Thomas Pham LeGro, 48, was arrested on Thursday after FBI agents raided his property on a search warrant. They seized several of his electronic devices and discovered fractured pieces of a hard drive in his hallway. Agents found a folder that contained 11 videos depicting child sexual abuse material on his work laptop, the Department of Justice said.

According to the outlet, LeGro worked at the Washington Post for 18 years in two stints since 2000. He was working as a video editor at the time of his arrest.

According to FBI charging documents viewed by the outlet, LeGro was first tied to child sexual abuse material in a 2005 investigation into E-Gold, a payment company used by child pornography websites. It's unclear what triggered a renewed investigation into him, but a search warrant was approved on Tuesday.

He was part of the Washington Post team that won the Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of Roy Moore's Georgia Senate campaign, during which they uncovered sexual assault allegations that helped tank his campaign.

LeGro's case is being handled by the FBI Washington Field Office's Child Exploitation and Human Trafficking Task Force. The charges against him carry a maximum of 20 years in prison.

The discomfiting spectacle of RFK Jr.'s new vaccine-advisory committee

The past three weeks have been auspicious for the anti-vaxxers. On June 9, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. purged the nation's most important panel of vaccine experts: All 17 voting members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which sets recommendations for the use of vaccines and determines which ones must be covered through insurance and provided free of charge to children on Medicaid, were abruptly fired. The small, ragtag crew of replacements that Kennedy appointed two days later met this week for the first time, amid lots of empty chairs in a conference room in Atlanta. They had come to talk about the safety of vaccines: to raise concerns about the data, to float hypotheses of harm, to issue findings.

The resulting spectacle was set against a backdrop of accelerating action from the secretary. On Wednesday, Kennedy terminated more than $1 billion in U.S. funding for Gavi, a global-health initiative that supports the vaccination of more than 65 million children every year. Lyn Redwood, a nurse practitioner and the former president of Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization that Kennedy used to chair, was just hired as a special government employee. (She presented at the ACIP meeting yesterday.) A recently posted scientific document on the ACIP website that underscored the safety of thimerosal, an ingredient in a small proportion of the nation's flu vaccines, had been taken down, a committee member said, because the document “was not authorized by the office of the secretary.” (A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told me in an email that this document was provided to the ACIP members in their meeting briefing packets.)

What's clear enough is that, 61 years after ACIP's founding, America's vaccination policy is about to be recooked. Now we've had a glimpse inside the kitchen.

The meeting started with complaints. “Some media outlets have been very harsh on the new members of this committee,” said Martin Kulldorff, a rangy Swedish biostatistician and noted COVID contrarian who is now ACIP's chair. (Kuldorff was one of the lead authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, a controversial proposal from the fall of 2020 to isolate seniors and other vulnerable people while reopening the rest of society.) In suggesting that he and Kennedy's other appointees are opposed to vaccination, Kulldorff said, journalists were misleading the public, weakening trust in public health, and fanning “the flames of vaccine hesitancy.”

This was, in fact, the most pugnacious comment of the two-day meeting, which otherwise unfolded in a tone of fearmongering gentility. Robert Malone, a doctor and an infectious-diseases researcher who has embraced the “anti-vaccine” label and published a conspiracy-theory-laden book that details government psyops against the American people, was unfailingly polite in his frequent intimations about the safety of vaccines, often thanking CDC staff for their hard work and lucid presentations. With his thick white beard, calm affect, and soldierly diction—Malone ended many of his comments by saying “Over” into the microphone—he presented less as a firebrand than as, say, the commanding officer of a submarine.

When Malone alluded to the worry, for example, that spike proteins from the mRNA-based COVID vaccines linger in the body following injection, he did so in respectful, even deferential, language, suggesting that the public would benefit from greater study of possible “delayed effects” of immune-system activation. The CDC's traditional approach—its “world-leading, rigorous” one, he clarified—might be improved by examining this question. A subject-matter expert responded that the CDC has been keeping tabs on real-world safety data on those vaccines for nearly five years, and has not detected any signs of long-term harm.

Later, Malone implied that COVID or its treatments might have, through some unspecified, bank-shot mechanism, left the U.S. population more susceptible to other illnesses. There was a “paradoxical, sudden decrease” in flu cases in 2020 and 2021, he noted, followed by a trend of worsening harm. A CDC staffer pointed out that the decrease in flu during those years was not, in fact, a paradox; well-documented shifts in people's health behavior had temporarily reduced the load of many respiratory illnesses during that same period. But Malone pressed on: “Some members of the scientific community have concern that they're coming out of the COVID pandemic—exposure to the virus, exposure to various countermeasures—there may be a pattern of broad-based, uh, energy,” he said, his eyes darting up for a moment as he said the word, “that might contribute to increased severity of influenza disease.” He encouraged the agency to “be sensitive to that hypothesis.”

Throughout these and other questions from the committee members, the CDC's subject-matter experts did their best to explain their work and respond to scattershot technical and conceptual concerns. “The CDC staff is still attempting to operate as an evidence-based organization,” Laura Morris, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Medicine, who has attended dozens of ACIP meetings in the past and attended this one as a nonvoting liaison to the committee from the American Academy of Family Physicians, told me. “There was some tension in terms of the capacity of the committee to ask and understand the appropriate methodological questions. The CDC was trying to hold it down.”

That task became more difficult as the meeting progressed. “The new ACIP is an independent body composed of experienced medical and public health experts who evaluate evidence, ask hard questions, and make decisions based on scientific integrity,” the HHS spokesperson told me. “Bottom line: This process reflects open scientific inquiry and robust debate, not a pre-scripted narrative.” The most vocal questioner among the new recruits—and the one who seemed least beholden to a script—was the MIT business-school professor Retsef Levi, a lesser-known committee appointee who sat across the table from Malone. A scruffy former Israel Defense Forces intelligence officer with a ponytail that reached halfway down his back, Levi's academic background is in data modeling, risk management, and organizational logistics. He approached the proceedings with a swaggering incredulity, challenging the staffers' efforts and pointing out the risks of systematic errors in their thinking. (In a pinned post on his X profile, Levi writes that “the evidence is mounting and indisputable that mRNA vaccines cause serious harm including death”—a position entirely at odds with copious data presented at the meeting.)

Shortly before the committee's vote to recommend a new, FDA-approved monoclonal antibody for preventing RSV in infants, Levi noted that he'd spent some time reviewing the relevant clinical-trial data for the drug and another like it, and found some worrying patterns in the statistics surrounding infant deaths. “Should we not be concerned that maybe there are some potential safety signals?” he asked. But these very data had already been reviewed, at great length, in multiple settings: by the FDA, in the course of drug approval, and by the dozens of members of ACIP's relevant work group for RSV, which had, per the committee's standard practice, conducted its own staged analysis of the new treatment before the meeting and reached consensus that its benefits outweighed its risks. Levi was uncowed by any reference to this prior work. “I'm a scientist, but I'm also a father of six kids,” he told the group; speaking as a father, he said, he personally would be concerned about the risk of harm from this new antibody for RSV.

In the end, Levi voted against recommending the antibody, as did Vicky Pebsworth, who is on the board of an anti-vaccine organization and holds a Ph.D. in public health and nursing. The five other members voted yes. That 5–2 vote aside, the most contentious issue on the meeting's schedule concerned the flu shots in America that contain thimerosal, which has been an obsession of the anti-vaccine movement for the past few decades. Despite extensive study, vaccines with thimerosal have not been found to be associated with any known harm in human patients, yet an unspecified vote regarding their use was slipped into the meeting's agenda in the absence of any work-group study or presentation from the CDC's staff scientists. What facts there were came almost exclusively from Redwood, the nurse who used to run Kennedy's anti-vaccine organization. Earlier this week, Reuters reported that at least one citation from her posted slides had been invented. That reference was removed before she spoke yesterday. (HHS did not address a request for comment on this issue in its response to me.)

The only one of Kennedy's appointees who had ever previously served on the committee—the pediatrician Cody Meissner—seemed perplexed, even pained, by the proceedings. “I'm not quite sure how to respond to this presentation,” he said when Redwood finished. He went on to sum up his concerns: “ACIP makes recommendations based on scientific evidence as much as possible. And there is no scientific evidence that thimerosal has caused a problem.” Alas, Meissner's warnings were for nought. Throughout the meeting, he came off as the committee's last remaining, classic “expert”—a vaccine scientist clinging to ACIP's old ways—but his frequent protestations were often bulldozed over or ignored. In the end, his was the only vote against the resolutions on thimerosal.

Throughout the two-day meeting, Kuldorff kept returning to a favorite phrase: evidence-based medicine. “Secretary Kennedy has given this committee a clear mandate to use evidence-based medicine,” he said on Wednesday morning. “The purpose of this committee is to follow evidence-based medicine,” he said on Wednesday afternoon. “What is important is using evidence-based medicine,” he said again when the meeting reached its end. All told, I heard him say evidence-based at least 10 times during the meeting. (To be fair, critics of Kuldorff and his colleagues also love this phrase.) But the committee was erratic in its posture toward the evidence from the very start; it cast doubt on CDC analyses and substituted lay advice and intuition for ACIP's normal methods of assessing and producing expert consensus. “Decisons were made based on feelings and preferences rather than evidence,” Morris told me after the meeting. “That's a dangerous way to make public-health policy.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Capitalism's operating system is due for a major upgrade. How that turns out depends on enormously consequential political choices.

The world economy is like a supercomputer that churns through trillions of calculations of prices and quantities, and spits out information on incomes, wealth, profits, and jobs. This is effectively how capitalism works—as a highly efficient information-processing system. To do that job, like any computer, capitalism runs on both hardware and software. The hardware is the markets, institutions, and regulatory regimes that make up the economy. The software is the governing economic ideas of the day—in essence, what society has decided the economy is for.

Most of the time, the computer works quite well. But now and then, it crashes. Usually when that happens, the world economy just needs a software update—new ideas to address new problems. But sometimes it needs a major hardware modification as well. We are in one of those Control-Alt-Delete moments. Against the background of tariff wars, market angst about U.S. debt, tumbling consumer confidence, and a weakening dollar watched over by a heedless administration, globalization's American-led era of free trade and open societies is coming to a close.

The global economy is getting a hardware refit and trying out a new operating system—in effect, a full reboot, the likes of which we have not seen in nearly a century. To understand why this is happening and what it means, we need to abandon any illusion that the worldwide turn toward right-wing populism and economic nationalism is merely a temporary error, and that everything will eventually snap back to the relatively benign world of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The computer's architecture is changing, but how this next version of capitalism will work depends a great deal on the software we choose to run on it. The governing ideas about the economy are in flux: We have to decide what the new economic order looks like and whose interests it will serve.

Read: Americans want to be rich

The last such force-quit, hard-restart period was in the 1930s. In the United States, the huge liquidity crunch caused by the 1929 Wall Street crash combined with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 to kill commercial activity and trigger the Great Depression. Bank failures swiftly turned into a mass failure of firms and industries; wages tumbled and unemployment shot up, in some areas to a quarter of the workforce. Despite the state interventions of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program, the economic situation stabilized and returned to sustained growth only in the '40s, when wartime re-armament delivered a huge industrial stimulus.

The computer built for the postwar period was solving to avoid a repeat of the '30s. The software update was a new governing idea of full employment. Achieving that aim as the central raison d'être of the economy also entailed several hardware modifications. One was a policy of forcing wealth owners to use their capital locally by limiting their ability to move it out of the country. To maintain their profits, they were obliged to invest in technology that would increase productivity. In this virtuous cycle, high productivity allowed for high wages, which the state could then tax to fund social transfers. Combined with the government-spending power of revenues raised by high marginal taxes, America's welfare state was born. Labor unions were seen more as partners in business enterprises, and political parties needed to appeal to the median, middle-income voter. These changes produced a political system in which the two main parties competed over a centrist consensus so bipartisan that people struggled to see the difference between Democrats and Republicans.

The New Deal did indeed avoid a repeat of the '30s, but its software had a bug. If full employment meant running the economy hot to keep unemployment down, then eventually employers' ability to keep their profits up by augmenting productivity would fail as workers' demand for higher wages outstripped firms' ability to pay them. By the mid-'70s, profits were falling as wages and inflation rose, so the U.S. investor class reached for the reboot switch. Holders of capital founded political-action committees, funded think tanks and media outlets to promote free enterprise, and helped get Ronald Reagan elected in 1980. Reagan busted unions and deregulated markets, accelerating the movement of capital from union strongholds to “right to work” states, which was effectively an onshore tryout of offshoring. Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker raised interest rates to almost 20 percent to squeeze inflation, a measure that induced a harsh recession, which disciplined labor further by raising unemployment.

As all of that implies, full employment ceased to be the governing economic idea. The software rewrite of this era instead made price stability, capital mobility, and the restoration of profits via globalization the new priorities. The hardware modification was to make central banks more independent—the better to enforce price stability and enable the recovery of profits. These new priorities were justified by Margaret Thatcher's famous nostrum that “there is no alternative.” This reboot has come to be known as neoliberalism.

Read: The debate that will determine how the Democrats govern next time

The computer was humming along again when I arrived from Scotland to attend graduate school in New York in the summer of 1992. The U.S. had entered a period that Ben Bernanke, then a Federal Reserve governor (and later Fed chair), called the “Great Moderation.” Globalization was good; finance was the future. Central banks had delivered sustainable prosperity, and the investor class saw its profits restored on a transnational scale.

Once again, however, the system had a bug. The increase in profitability came not only as a result of improved domestic productivity but also at the expense of once-stable industrial regions of the U.S., as jobs, skills, and capital flowed out. Meanwhile, the authorities had presided over the deregulation of financial markets, which supplied the economy with copious credit. But one effect of this credit was to mask a chronic lack of wage growth and a rising level of inequality.

That turned out to be a major hardware issue: Neoliberalism's financialized solutions to economic problems became liabilities when the next crash came, in 2008, as a tsunami of credit became an earthquake of debt. The hardware modification of the era—independent central banks—saved the system with colossal bailouts of the private sector, paid for by the public sector in the form of ever greater debt and more stringent fiscal policies. This liquidity dump enabled the economy to stagger on through the slowest-ever recovery from a recession—but only by pushing the bulk of the costs of those bailouts onto those least able to bear them. Signs of profound public disaffection in Western countries started to show in 2016: first with the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom, then with Donald Trump's rise in the U.S.

Trump has acted as a catalyst for the next reboot. His hostile takeover of the Republican Party was leveraged by a new, more working-class electoral coalition based on a populist politics of resentment. His antipathy toward China may lack analysis, but by articulating a sense that American workers had lost out in the neoliberal era, it gave voice to authentic grievance. Trump's chaotic first term made only limited progress in forcing another reboot, but his second term seems likely to foreclose on the Biden administration's interim solution of keeping the neoliberal system running with a limited New Deal–like reindustrialization in new sectors such as renewable energy. The Inflation Reduction Act was a significant reinvention of industrial policy, something not seen for decades outside a national-security context, but Trump is abandoning this sort of intervention. Instead, he has chosen tariffs as his singular tool for reshoring industry.

To the extent that the Trumpian approach coheres, the economy's new goal is to benefit native workers by restoring carbon-heavy industrial jobs while removing immigrants from the labor pool and encouraging women to have more children and become homemakers. This is not so much the building of a new computer system as the retrofitting of several old ones—a version of what a critic of Thatcherism once called “regressive modernisation.” The MAGA economic ideal derives from a blend of the 1950s, which saw a huge expansion of manufacturing jobs for men, and the '40s, when women were pushed out of the wartime jobs and back into the home, and immigration was tightly restricted. This boost for the native labor force is in turn yoked to a 19th-century, mercantilist “spheres of influence” foreign policy.

This hodgepodge of historical impulses speaks to the unsettled nature of Trumponomics. No new economic order is discernible, because the governing idea is still contested. The national-conservative movement, which seeks to rebrand the GOP as a workers' party, has one vision, but other forces are also trying to shape this moment. The “Dark Enlightenment” wing of the tech sector is a player, too. Overinvested in AI and keen to grab government funding that was earmarked for elite research universities, the Silicon Valley billionaires imagine an economy that runs not as a return to hard-hat industry's glorious past but as a posthuman future of automation and space exploration.

The problem with such projects is that we cannot go back, any more than we can leap into the future; we can live only in the present. The populist-right reset will fail because tariffs may spur some reindustrialization, but robots will be the main producers, not working-class men on an assembly line. And little suggests that most women will relish the return to hearth and home that is planned for them. The techno-futurist update has nothing to offer the great mass of humanity and would benefit only the tech lords most invested in its realization.

Read: What Chris Murphy learned from the new right

So we seem to be stuck, which is why this moment is so perplexing. The system upgrade is pending: The right is offering its regressive modernization as the update. The left has yet to figure out which one of three paths it wants to take.

One possibility is to stay put with the gerontocracy of the Democratic Party and wait for Trumpism to implode. That might happen, and the Democrats' current position as the party of the institutionalist status quo makes this the most likely path. But this will be a losing proposition if no reversion to the mean of the pre-MAGA American politics occurs.

The effort by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders to rally an anti-oligarchy movement advocates for a second option, of left-wing populism. But whether this appeals to young men who have been drawn to Trump, as well as young women who poll as more progressive, and can create a broad-enough coalition remains to be seen.

A third approach is the “abundance” agenda, promoted recently by Ezra Klein and The Atlantic's Derek Thompson, which proposes a progressive political program based on lower-regulation, pro-growth policies as a spark for renewed economic growth—though critics on the left accuse this approach of failing to confront corporate power.

To develop an alternative to the regressive modernization underpinning Trump's reelection, the left must come up with a governing economic idea that can compete. Technocratic fixes of the old system look very unlikely to inspire a broad-enough coalition to defeat the potent, if unstable, electoral alliance that reelected Trump. The most promising avenue—one that could address the needs of millions of Americans who feel shut out of growth and prosperity and alienated from America's governing elite—might be a fusion of AOC/Bernie populism with a more political, less technocratic version of abundance.

Regardless of whether such a project can materialize, we have to accept that a transformation is under way. A new economic order is forming—which means that it is not yet fixed and can still be shaped. But time is running out. As jumbled as the regressive modernization is, it could win the day if we do not come up with a different governing idea of what the economy is and whom it is for. And we need enough people in our democracy to agree that this new purpose is the right one. The ideas are there to be found. They just need politicians with the courage to try them.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

That isn't the disaster for birthright citizenship that some fear.

Yesterday, in a 6–3 decision in Trump v. Casa, the United States Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration in a case involving an executive order that purports to eliminate birthright citizenship.

Confusingly, the Court's decision wasn't about the constitutionality of the birthright-citizenship order. Instead, the case proceeded on the assumption that the order was unconstitutional. The only question for the justices was about remedy: What kind of relief should federal courts provide when a plaintiff successfully challenges a government policy?

The lower courts had, in several birthright-citizenship cases across the country, entered what are known as “universal” or “nationwide” injunctions. These injunctions prevented the executive order from applying to anyone, anywhere—even if they were not a party to the case. The Trump administration argued that nationwide injunctions were inappropriate and impermissible—injunctions should give relief only to the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit, no one else.

In a majority opinion by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration and put nationwide injunctions to the torch. That's a big deal. Not only does it represent a major setback to the states and advocacy groups that brought the lawsuit, it also amounts to a revolution in the remedial practices of the lower federal courts.

Nicholas Bagley: The birthright-citizenship case isn't really about birthright citizenship

But it is not, as the dissenting Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson would have it, “an existential threat to the rule of law.” It won't even mean the end of sweeping injunctions in the lower federal courts. To the contrary, the opinion suggests that relief tantamount to a nationwide injunction will still be available in many cases—including, in all likelihood, in the birthright-citizenship case itself.



Barrett's opinion for the Court begins and ends with history. In 1789, the first Congress gave the federal courts jurisdiction over “all suits … in equity.” That conferral of authority allowed the courts to grant equitable remedies, one of which is the injunction. But that grant of power was not originally understood to give courts the power to enter injunctions extending beyond the parties to the suit—still less to cover the whole nation.

Instead, the courts hewed to a more traditional conception of judicial power. They sat to resolve disputes among parties, nothing more. That tradition held sway for more than 200 years. It only started to break down in the late 20th century as courts grew more comfortable with universal relief and became more concerned about executive overreach. By the time President Barack Obama took office, nationwide injunctions had become commonplace.

For Barrett, the novelty was enough on its own to condemn the practice. “The universal injunction was conspicu­ously nonexistent for most of our Nation's history,” she wrote. “Its ab­sence from 18th- and 19th-century equity practice settles the question of judicial authority.” The federal courts thus lack the power to issue nationwide injunctions. Period. Full stop.

In my book, that's a positive development. In 2020 testimony to the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate, I argued that nationwide injunctions “enable opportunistic behavior by politically motivated litigants and judges, short-circuit a process in which multiple judges address hard legal questions, and inhibit the federal government's ability to do its work. By inflating the judicial role, they also reinforce the sense that we ought to look to the courts for salvation from our political problems—a view that is difficult to square with basic principles of democratic self-governance.”

Although the Supreme Court divided along partisan lines, with the liberal justices dissenting, I don't see this as a partisan issue. (The outrageous illegality and sheer ugliness of President Donald Trump's executive order that lies underneath this fight may go some distance to explain why the three liberals dissented.) Nationwide injunctions are equal-opportunity offenders, thwarting Republican and Democratic initiatives alike. Today, it's Trump's birthright-citizenship order and USAID spending freezes. Yesterday it was mifepristone, the cancellation of student debt, and a COVID-vaccine mandate. Why should one federal judge—perhaps a very extreme judge, on either side—have the power to dictate government policy for the entire country? Good riddance.



Even as it ended nationwide injunctions, the Supreme Court left the door open for other forms of relief that are not nationwide injunctions—but that look a whole lot like them. That's good news for opponents of the birthright-citizenship order.

First, Barrett confirmed the equitable principle that the federal courts can award “complete relief” to plaintiffs, even if that relief also incidentally protects third parties. She uses the example of a lawsuit in which “one neighbor sues another for blasting loud music at all hours of the night.” An order that tells the noisy neighbor to stop would also help others on the block. That's totally okay.

Barrett even signals that the principle of complete relief might—might!—support an injunction that applies nationwide. The state plaintiffs, led by New Jersey, argued that they needed the order frozen across the whole country because people are mobile. If someone's citizenship blinks on and off depending on whether they entered a state that was or wasn't subject to a judicial injunction, states such as New Jersey would struggle to administer burdensome and confusing rules governing citizenship in their state programs.

The Court didn't say that the state plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction that covered the whole country. But it didn't rule it out either. Instead, the Court punted—“we decline to take up these arguments in the first instance”—and told the lower federal courts to resolve the question.

Second, Barrett clarified that parties who want expansive relief can still file a class action. Not every putative group of plaintiffs will be eligible to form a class: Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, class actions are appropriate (and thus can be “certified”) only when certain conditions are met, including that class members are making very similar legal or factual claims. What's more, the Court has tightened those restrictions in recent decades.

But class actions will be available in a substantial number of cases challenging government action. That's certainly the case when it comes to the birthright-citizenship order, which harms hundreds of thousands of people in identical ways. The Court has also confirmed recently that class-wide injunctions can be secured even before a class is certified—which is to say, right at the outset of proceedings.

Third, the Supreme Court declined to take up the Trump administration's request to reconsider rules governing “associational standing.” Those rules allow an association to sue on behalf of all of its members—even if the association has hundreds of thousands of such members. (One of the plaintiffs in the birthright-citizenship case, CASA, has more than 155,000 members.) The persistence of associational standing will give large membership organizations the ability to secure relief that extends very widely—so widely, in fact, that the administration may be left with no practical choice except to put its policy on hold across the whole country.

Fourth, and finally, the Supreme Court left open the possibility that nationwide relief would still be available in lawsuits that challenge government action under the Administrative Procedure Act. As I explained for this magazine two years ago, “as nationwide injunctions get a bad odor, ‘universal vacatur' under the APA is taking its place.” The APA wasn't at issue in the birthright-citizenship case, but it's central to the large majority of lawsuits that challenge government policy. If nationwide injunctions are dead, but universal vacatur is alive, then Trump v. CASA will only rarely make a difference on the ground.



All of which is to say that the end of nationwide injunctions is unlikely to usher in a new era of judicial minimalism and restraint. Nor will it massively curtail litigants' ability to protect their rights. That shouldn't be surprising. Nationwide injunctions are a symptom of a legal culture that affords judges a central role in American policy making. Without changing that legal culture, and the many different laws and doctrines that underwrite it, any single change—even one as significant as ending nationwide injunctions—will yield only a modest course correction.

Amanda Frost: The question the Trump administration couldn't answer about birthright citizenship

That's not to diminish the importance of Trump v. CASA. Ending nationwide injunctions will matter in some cases, some of the time. Perhaps most important, the case represents a stark rejection of a conception of the judiciary as a free-roving expositor of federal law. That may, in time, orient judges to a healthier understanding of their (limited) role in our constitutional system.

It would be easy to read Trump v. CASA as a victory for the defenders of the executive order ending birthright citizenship. I think that would be a mistake. On this, I agree with Samuel Bray, the University of Chicago law professor who led the academic attack on universal injunctions and whom Barrett cites in her opinion more than a dozen times: “I do not expect the President's executive order on birthright citizenship will ever go into effect.”

Why? Because the flagrantly unconstitutional order is a prime candidate for expansive relief that is not a nationwide injunction. Barrett closed her opinion with an instruction that the lower courts “move expeditiously” to rewrite their injunctions while keeping in mind the principle that injunctive relief typically provides plaintiffs with complete relief. That's one avenue for a broad injunction. She likewise clarified that the Court's decision would not take effect for 30 days, affording advocacy groups an opportunity to file class actions and seek immediate relief. That's another.

It's remotely possible that the birthright-citizenship order will take effect in some states and will affect some people after those 30 days. But I doubt it. Even if it does, I'd expect the Supreme Court to invalidate it in relatively short order. For all its breadth, Trump v. CASA won't meaningfully set back the fight to preserve birthright citizenship. It matters much more for what it says about federal judicial power—even if what it says is somewhat ambivalent.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

F1 threads the nitty-gritty details of racing into a traditional underdog drama.

The stakes are almost embarrassingly simple: A man needs to win a race. F1 is a loud sports epic that thrusts the viewer into the high-octane, technocratic world of Formula One racing. These competitions are decided by complex car engineering and tactical pit stops; individual drivers are only as important as the car companies they work for. The film's director, Joseph Kosinski, best known for the box-office sensation Top Gun: Maverick, accounts for this system's intricacies by stripping the plot of any complications. Instead, in collaboration with Formula One's regulating body, he creates a straightforward underdog tale, made compelling by its fidelity to the world's fastest races.

Brad Pitt plays Sonny Hayes, an over-the-hill, salt-of-the-earth gearhead who washed out of Formula 1 decades ago and has since taken on any racing challenge that he can. (He even drives a New York City cab at one point.) He returns to the sport when another former competitor, Ruben Cervantes (played by Javier Bardem), recruits Sonny to bolster the flailing, upstart team that Cervantes now owns. If his crew doesn't win at least one race this season, the governing board can fire Cervantes, so Sonny joins up for one last rodeo.

In real life, Formula One is defined by the companies (known as “constructors”) that sink seemingly unlimited resources into getting to the top year after year—well-known brands such as Ferrari and Mercedes. F1 sticks them in the background (alongside actual racers such as Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen) while focusing on the fictional crew run by Cervantes, called APX. “I wanted to tell the story of the team at the bottom,” Kosinski told me. And rather than villainize any particular corporation—as James Mangold did in his period piece Ford v Ferrari—the director said that he was more intrigued by a quirk of Formula One, where constructors have multiple drivers in the field for each race. The big competition, then, is an internal one.

Read: Ford v Ferrari: A rollicking tale of fast cars and capitalism

That means Sonny's biggest obstacle isn't trying to overcome a champion such as Hamilton (who is listed as a producer on the film). His struggle is learning to work alongside one of his younger peers, Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris). “This notion of your teammate being your enemy, to me, that's great for drama,” Kosinski told me, defining it as “that meta thing of a veteran and a rookie.” Whereas in Top Gun: Maverick, he explained, he was exploring a father-son dynamic, in F1, he sought to examine the relationship between two rivals.

This clever conflict helps the film upend the usual, dull stakes that have befouled so many works of its ilk in the past. The most successful racing movies of late have leaned more artistic than mainstream, while more extravagant attempts have failed either commercially or critically. F1 doesn't quite slot into either category; it's more of a long-shot sports saga with the peaks and valleys of joy and despair that come with it. (Think Hoosiers or Rocky, except with scenes set in Monaco and Abu Dhabi.) It's familiar, but pleasantly so. 

The film still manages to dig into the peculiarities of Formula One within its big, meaty character study. The sport is well suited for that type of intimate storytelling. “I can't think of another sport like that, where the sport is literally engineered to create that internal team conflict,” Kosinski said. “That sense of internal competition brings the best and worst out of people.” The director discovered Formula One by watching the popular documentary series Formula 1: Drive to Survive, which brought greater visibility to the sport. He recalled how the first season focused on the last-place finishers, not the top ones: “What's it like to be the team that goes and knows they're going to lose every weekend?”

Read: How Netflix made Americans care about the most European of sports

Questions like this one seem to undergird much of Kosinski's work. The director has long struck me as something of an under-sung auteur of big-budget features; he takes on brand-name franchises that are huge, technical challenges (such as his debut feature, Tron: Legacy), injecting humanity wherever possible. Top Gun: Maverick followed a plot befitting a legacy sequel—the growth of Tom Cruise's protagonist into someone older and wiser—but Kosinski made it seem like it was, on a deeper level, about Cruise's superhuman desire to stay relevant in Hollywood. The director similarly molds F1 around his star's more reluctant image: Pitt portrays a man of few words who seems nostalgic for simpler times in his industry.

The specifics of Formula One border on arcane, and Kosinski gleefully plunges the viewer into all of its minutiae: the balance between aerodynamics and engine power in building the cars; the strategies behind taking a pit stop or passing another driver. Sonny is the viewer's tether to reality; he's happy to practice his steering-wheel grip using a common object—tennis balls—instead of an expensive contraption. (Joshua, meanwhile, employs a more intricate workout device.) Kosinski wanted to accurately depict the sport without losing viewers who are unfamiliar with or even intimidated by it. “It's not just about people going around in circles,” he told me, pushing back against the mainstream image of Formula One as a bunch of rocket cars zooming around a track. “It really is chess at 200 miles an hour.”

F1 succeeds when it emphasizes that side of the sport, and as long as you can accept the well-trod beats of its plot. Pitt is there to glower and exude experience, and Idris brims with youthful, charismatic arrogance. Kosinski handles the racing scenes with the mechanical prowess he showed off in Top Gun: Maverick, mounting cameras to cars and highlighting their velocity in surprising ways. Sonny's quest to prove his doubters wrong resembles the arc of many a sports drama. But Kosinski elevates that journey by capturing racing in all of its gorgeous, peculiar glory—there's never been a portrait of Formula One quite like it.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The surest way for the party to end its prolonged slump is to jump straight to 2028.

Yesterday marked one year since Joe Biden's debate meltdown against Donald Trump. Happy anniversary to those who observe such things, or are triggered by such things. Please celebrate responsibly.

For Democrats, the debacle was a harsh awakening and the start of an ongoing spiral. Prior to that night, they could hold on to the delusion that the party might somehow eke out one last victory from Biden's degraded capacity and ward off another four-year assault from Donald Trump. But that all exploded into the gruesome reality of June 27, 2024. Every interested viewer that night remembers where they were, their various feelings (depending on their perspectives) of revulsion, grief, glee, or disbelief.

I was watching at home, thinking for some reason that Biden might exceed his humble expectations. He had managed to do this periodically on big stages during his presidency—including the feisty State of the Union address he'd turned in a few months earlier. But by the time Biden walked to his podium in Atlanta, it was clear that was not happening. Something was off. The elderly president looked visibly stiffer than usual, like he was wrapped in cardboard. As co-moderator Jake Tapper of CNN unfurled his opening question—about rising grocery and home prices—Biden's eyes bugged out, as if he was stunned. His face was a drab gray color. I remember thinking there was something wrong with my TV, until the texts started rolling in. A friend observed that Biden looked “mummified” on the stage. “Is he sick?” my wife asked as she entered the room.

Not a great start.

And this was before Biden had even said a word. Then he spoke—or tried to. Biden's voice didn't really work at first. It was raspy; he kept stopping, starting, dry-coughing. After a few sentences, everything was worse. “Oh my god,” came another text, which was representative of the early returns. “My mother told me she's crying,” read another. (This person's mother is evidently not a Trump supporter.) My wife left the room.

Mark Leibovich: Where is Barack Obama?

Now here we are a year later. Democrats have been battered by events since. First among them was Trump's victory in November, in which traditional Democratic constituencies such as Black, Hispanic, and young voters defected to the GOP in large numbers. This was followed by the onslaught of Trump's second administration. Democrats keep getting described (or describing themselves) as being “in the wilderness,” though at this point “the wilderness” might be a generous description; it at least offers peace and quiet—as opposed to, say, your average Democratic National Committee meeting in 2025.

Or, for that matter, the aftermath of this week's Democratic primary in the New York City mayor's race. Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist state assemblyman from Queens, became an instant It Boy with his upset of scandal-soiled former Governor Andrew Cuomo. As happens with many progressive sensations these days, Mamdani's victory was immediately polarizing. New York Democrats seem split over the result: On one side are lukewarm establishment titans such as Senate and House Minority Leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries; on the other are progressive demigods such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders.

The usual Democratic divides revealed themselves: insurgent versus establishment, socialist-adjacent versus moderate, young versus old (except for Bernie, the ageless octogenarian forever big with the kids). The deeply unpopular incumbent, Eric Adams, who was elected as a Democrat in 2021, is running for reelection as an independent; despite getting trounced in the primary, Cuomo plans to stay in the race—running on something called the “Fight and Deliver” ballot line. Mamdani is the clear favorite to prevail in November. But no one knows anything for sure, except that everything feels like a muddled mess, which has pretty much been the Democrats' default posture since the Abomination in Atlanta a year ago.

The party's grass roots are showing genuine energy these days. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez drew five-figure crowds at their “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies this spring. The nationwide “No Kings” protests two weekends ago were indicative of a galvanized protest movement eager to be led. Yet these signs of Trump resistance are mostly happening separate from the Democratic apparatus. As my colleague David Graham recently wrote, the “No Kings” spectacles were themselves, paradoxically, a sign of how rudderless the party now finds itself. With a few exceptions, the Democratic leadership ranks have been largely AWOL. They toggle and flail between quiet paralysis and loud frustration, especially with one another.

Mark Leibovich: The week that changed everything for Gavin Newsom

Democrats have spent an inordinate amount of time and energy relitigating Biden's tenure in the White House—whether he was fit to be there and how frail he had become. The phrase cognitive decline still comes up a lot, for obvious reasons, none of them fun or especially constructive. The 2024 campaign has also come in for a spirited rehash—especially among factions of Biden world, the Kamala Harris–Tim Walz campaign, and the various PACs and outside groups ostensibly designed to support them. Republicans have of course relished every chance to revisit Biden's deterioration. The media have hammered this theme as well, most notably Tapper and his co-author, Alex Thompson of Axios, whose blockbuster autopsy, Original Sin, has been at or near the top of The New York Times' nonfiction best-seller list for several weeks.

The surest way for Democrats to move on would be to jump straight to the future: Look to 2028, as quickly as possible. Presidential campaigns at their best can be forward-looking, wide-open, and aspirational. Yes, local elections—and certainly the 2026 midterms—are important, and maybe even promising for the party. But not as important as picking a new national leader, something the Democrats have not really done since Barack Obama was first elected in 2008. Among the many tragedies of Biden's last act was that he delayed his party, indefinitely, from anointing its next generation.

Trump himself might not be on the ballot in 2028, but he's still giving his opposition plenty to run against. So Democrats might as well take the show national and start now, if for no other reason than to escape from fractures of the present and circular nightmares of the recent past. Which began, more or less, on June 27 of last year. When Democrats stop dwelling on that disaster and what followed, that might signal that they're finally getting somewhere.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Is this the start of the Democrats' Tea Party?

The signs have been bubbling up for months: The Democratic base is fed up with the status quo of their party. Democratic voters believe their party leaders are out of touch, and they don't think they're rising to meet this moment. They want more confrontation with President Donald Trump, and they're hungry for an inspiring, forward-looking economic vision. 

That sentiment comes through in just about all the polling of the party, in focus groups with voters, and in anti-Trump protests and populist rallies since Trump's inauguration.

The latest sign of this frustration might just be the stunning result of New York City's mayoral primary this week. The victory of a self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani over the embodiment of the Democratic establishment, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, all with high turnout and a comfortable margin of victory, suggests Democratic voters are open to radical change. Of course, there are plenty of peculiarities that make a New York City primary contest a bit of a unique case: a toxic early front-runner, ranked-choice voting, and an open field of candidates during an off-year election. These specifics all make it risky to try to draw national implications from a local race.

But there's at least one big warning for national Democrats from this upset: the kind of anti-establishment energy that boosted Mamdani exists in Democratic enclaves around the country. It feels familiar — reminiscent of 2009 and the rise of the Tea Party among the Republican Party's conservative base that ended up remaking the GOP. The energy also feels similar, but more widespread, than what boosted progressive victories during primaries in Trump's first term. And that energy suggests that the forces that remade the GOP could be aligning for Democrats to face a Tea Party moment of their own. 

It remains to be seen whether this revolt will turn into a leftward shift of the party's ideological positions. But it appears at least likely to result in targeting older and established incumbents, replacing the party's leadership, or, at a minimum, forcing those leaders to be more aggressive against Trump, accommodating of younger leaders, and less complacent when faced with populist anger. 

So as the national Democratic Party continues its post-2024 soul-searching, its incumbents and leaders are getting a clear warning. The ingredients are here for a populist revolt within the Democratic Party. Will leaders adjust and listen?

This year's Democratic rage is very different from the last time Trump was elected president: The base wants not just confrontation with Republicans but to replace the party's leadership entirely.

Consider a June Ipsos poll of Democrats, the latest of many surveys showing the Democratic base is unhappy with the state of their party. About half of Democrats are “unsatisfied with current leadership,” and 62 percent said “party leaders should be replaced.” This dissatisfaction is historic. Going back to 2009, Democrats haven't been this upset with their party before. As noted, the last time a party's base was worked up was during the Republicans' Tea Party movement, which culminated in Trump's GOP takeover.

Unlike previous moments of Democratic infighting, this divide isn't primarily about ideology. That same June poll found that Democrats want their party to focus more on affordability, on getting the wealthy to pay more on taxes, and health care expansion. Older and younger Democrats are broadly in agreement about prioritizing economic concerns over social issues — and there aren't that many differences between what younger and older Democrats want to prioritize.

Instead, it's a fight over priorities. There's a huge gulf between what each cohort of Democratic voters think their party does focus on and what it should focus on, particularly because younger Democrats are more progressive and think their leaders don't care enough about universal health care, affordability, or taxing the rich.

On this front, age is becoming the big dividing line within the party. Previous polls have shown that overwhelming shares of Democratic voters want their party to run “younger candidates that represent a new generation of leadership” and “encourage elderly leaders to retire and pass the torch to the younger generation.” Dissatisfaction with “the establishment” is overwhelming. 

The result of these combined feelings may lead to more Mamdani moments, according to some activists and strategists. Already a handful of younger candidates have announced primaries of longtime incumbents in California, Illinois, and Indiana. More are expected in blue states like Massachusetts and New York, including in the New York City region. Even party activists have announced that primarying older incumbents should be a party priority.

And there are signs this energy exists at every level of politics. At the grassroots, liberal, anti-Trump energy is still bubbling up through smaller but more frequent protests. Though it may seem like the 2017–18 #Resistance protests were more visible than those of 2025, various tracking efforts show that protests this year are happening more often and in a more localized manner. One metric from Harvard, for example, finds that there have been more than 15,000 protests since Trump's second inauguration. In that same time in 2017, the number was smaller: over 5,000 protests.

As far as turning this energy into political action, there are also clear signs. Since Tuesday's primary, the progressive political organization Run for Something, which recruits and supports young people who want to run for office, is reporting a surge in candidate recruitment, with more than 2,700 people signing up to explore campaigns as of Friday afternoon.

The organization's president, Amanda Litman, says it's one of the biggest spikes in interest since Trump's election, mirroring the grassroots intensity generated after the Elon Musk-backed Department of Government Efficiency began to make cuts across the federal government and when Democrats helped avoid a government shutdown this spring. And it brings the number of young potential candidates who have expressed interest in running for office since Trump's election to more than 50,000 people.

“We are seeing more young people than ever before raise their hands to run, not in spite of the chaos, but because of it. They are bringing urgency, boldness, energy, and their lived experience to the table. They are ready to change what leadership looks like in this country,” Litman said.

How successful these efforts at generational change will be remains to be seen.

The GOP's internal revolt back in 2009 and 2010 contributed to the party's takeover of the House by boosting conservative and Republican enthusiasm, but Tea Party candidates had more success in winning primaries than winning general elections. (That dynamic shifted some after Trump's total takeover of the party.)

Similarly, calls for the Democrats to move left, and embrace a more progressive agenda, seem to resonate with a party whose membership has become much more liberal over the last 20 years. But that might be a misreading of a national electorate's mood, particularly after a presidential election that showed large segments of the electorate were hostile to Democrats' “liberal” identity.

Insurgent populist candidates have many steps ahead to win primaries and then prove they can win general elections. But it's not inconceivable to think they can do it. There was a time when the GOP's populist wing was considered fringe — extreme, even. We all know how that turned out.

This new telescope lets you hold 10 million galaxies in your hand.

Last Thursday, I took my son to the Rose Center for Earth and Space at New York's Museum of Natural History. In the Hayden Planetarium, we watched a simulation of the Milky Way bloom above us, while the actor Pedro Pascal — who truly is everywhere — narrated the galactic dance unfolding on the screen. 

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

It was breathtaking. But it didn't compare to what was blasted around the world just a few days later, as the new Vera C. Rubin Observatory began broadcasting its “first light” — its inaugural images of the cosmos. I found myself pinching-to-zoom through a picture that contains roughly 10 million galaxies in a single frame, a vista so vast it would take 400 4-K TVs to display at full resolution. I could hold the universe itself on my screen.

Perched 8,660 feet up Cerro Pachón in the Chilean Andes, where the crystal-clear nights provide an exceptionally clear window into space, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory began construction in 2015 with funding from the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the US Department of Energy. Named for the pioneering astronomer Vera Rubin, whose work on galaxy rotation helped prove the existence of dark matter, the observatory was built to run a single, audacious experiment: the 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time. 

It will photograph the entire Southern Hemisphere sky every few nights to tackle four grand goals: unmask dark matter and dark energy, inventory the Solar System's asteroids and comets, chart the Milky Way's formation, and capture every transient cosmic event.

What makes Rubin so special is its eye, which is a marvel. At its core is a 27-foot-wide dual mirror cast from 51,900 pounds of molten glass that is still light enough to sweep across the sky in seconds. The mirror directs a flow of light from the cosmic depths to the 3.2-gigapixel LSST Camera, a 5-by-10-feet digital jumbotron that is the largest digital camera ever made. It's like a massive magnifying glass paired with the world's sharpest DSLR: Together they capture a swath of the night sky equivalent to 45 full moons every 30 seconds. 

And those images, which will be continuously shared with the world, are jaw-dropping. The headlining shot from Rubin's debut, nicknamed “Cosmic Treasure Chest,” stitches together 1,185 exposures of the Virgo Cluster, our nearest major collection of galaxies, some 55 million light-years away. 

But the Rubin Observatory is about much more than producing pretty cosmic wallpaper. Its unprecedented scale gives it the ability to search for answers to grand questions about space science. The NSF notes that Rubin will gather more optical data in its first year than all previous ground telescopes combined, turning the messy, ever-changing sky into a searchable movie. 

As I've written before, the world has made great strides in planetary defense: Our ability to detect and eventually deflect asteroids that could be on a collision course with Earth. Rubin has already begun paying dividends toward that goal. 

In a mere 10 hours of engineering data, its detection software identified 2,104 brand-new asteroids — including seven near-Earth objects, heavenly bodies whose orbit will bring them near-ish our planet. 

That haul came from just a thumbnail-sized patch of sky; once Rubin begins its nightly scan of the whole Southern Hemisphere, it's projected to catalog over 5 million asteroids and roughly 100,000 NEOs over the next decade, tripling today's inventory. That will help NASA finally reach its congressionally mandated target of identifying 90 percent of the 25,000 city-killer-class NEOs (those over 140 meters) estimated to be out there. 

How powerful is Rubin's eye? “It took 225 years of astronomical observations to detect the first 1.5 million asteroids,” Jake Kurlander, a grad student astronomer at the University of Washington, told Earth.com. “Rubin will double that number in less than a year.”

And the images that Rubin captures will go out to the entire world. Its Skyviewer app will allow anyone to zoom in and out of the corners of space that catch Rubin's eye, including celestial objects so new that most of them don't have names. Looking at the app gives you a sense of what it must have been like to be one of the first human beings, gazing up at a sky filled with wonder and mystery. 

It might seem strange to highlight a telescope at a moment when the world feels as if it is literally on fire. But the Vera Rubin Observatory isn't just a triumph of international scientific engineering, or an unparalleled window on the universe. It is the ultimate perspective provider.

If you open the Virgo image and zoom all the way out, Earth's orbit would be smaller than a single pixel. Yet that same pixel is where thousands of engineers, coders, machinists, and scientists quietly spent a decade building an eye that can watch the rest of the universe breathe, and then share those images with all of their fellow humans. 

Seeing Rubin's images brought to mind the lines of Walt Whitman's “When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer.” 

I wander'd off by myself,

In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,

Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.

On days when life on our little world feels chaotic, Rubin's first-light view offers a valuable reminder: We're just one tiny part in a tapestry of 10 million galaxies, looking up from our planet at the endless stars.

Key tax incentives for US wind and solar projects would face a more aggressive phase-out in the Senate's latest version of President Donald Trump's spending package. 

The tweak, which follows pushback by Trump on the Inflation Reduction Act credits, would sharply limit the number of solar and wind farms that qualify for incentives, appeasing opponents while risking the ire of moderate members who argued for a slower phase-out.

State officials and legal experts warn the arrangement could lead to a patchwork quilt of outcomes.

A US Supreme Court ruling is stoking fears that the babies of many noncitizen parents could be treated differently depending on the state in which they're born, as legal challenges unfold against President Donald Trump's order ending birthright citizenship. 

The justices didn't rule on the constitutionality of Trump's restrictions. But in a divided decision Friday, they paused nationwide injunctions in three cases that had blocked the policy from taking effect. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Keir Starmer's landslide UK general election win last July delivered to the House of Commons what was supposed to be a hand-picked army of loyalists molded in his image, a cadre that earned the moniker “Starmtroopers.” As the prime minister's first anniversary in power approaches next week, the troops have mutinied, and some now have him and his chancellor in their sights.

Backbench Labour Members of Parliament on Thursday forced the government into a humiliating U-turn on its flagship welfare reform policy, canceling some £3 billion ($4 billion) of planned disability benefit cuts which had enraged the left-leaning party's ranks. Downing Street had little choice but surrender: without concessions, Starmer faced the prospect of a parliamentary defeat Tuesday that would have been extraordinary for a government with a 165-seat majority, calling his premiership into question.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz needs to move fast before headwinds derail his turnaround plans.

Merz's spending package has potential to add more than €400 billion to Germany's annual output by 2030.

With hundreds of billions of euros in state financing at hand, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has Germany poised for a historic leap. His window of opportunity is real, but it could start closing within a few months.

A debt-fueled spending package — which Merz secured before taking power last month — has potential to add more than €400 billion ($470 billion) to annual output by 2030, according to the German government's panel of economic advisers. That could boost the average growth rate by 1.6% over that period — slightly more than the trend since reunification in 1990.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

In upholding a Texas law requiring age verification to access porn websites, the court overturned a precedent that stood for more than two decades. 

This isn't enough anymore. 

Photographer: Leon Neal/Getty Images

In a landmark 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court upheld age-verification requirements for accessing online pornography sites, effectively overturning a precedent that had stood for more than 20 years. Alongside its January decision on TikTok, the ruling marks a new era in the court's online First Amendment jurisprudence: the justices are increasingly willing to uphold government suppression of free speech for policy reasons.

The opinion in the case, Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, was written by Justice Clarence Thomas, who, until recently, was something of a free speech absolutist. Thomas made it extremely clear that his goal was to find a way to uphold the Texas age-verification law at issue, regardless of precedent.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

China's dominance of the global supply chain is starting to hurt automakers.

On April 4, the country cut off exports of a class of minerals called ""heavy rare earth elements,"" and it sent the global auto industry into a panic.

Rare earths are a class of 17 elements that have become indispensable in all kinds of applications — everything from fighter jets and submarines, to smartphones and appliances. You can even find them in sports equipment, like tennis rackets and baseball bats.

They are also, of course, essential to the modern automobile. Gas burning cars use them to filter pollution through the vehicle's catalytic converter. Electric vehicles use them in motors and batteries.

""Rare earths are really critical, and not just for electric vehicles,"" said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""They are in your seat belt, your steering wheels, various parts of your electrical components. You are not going to manufacture a car without rare earths.""

Rare earths are split into further categories, based on their atomic weight. Light rare earths are easier to source. It's the medium and heavy ones that China has totally monopolized. China controls about 70% of the world's rare earth mines. But where it really dominates is in processing.

The name ""rare earth elements"" is a bit misleading — the elements themselves are not that rare in nature. What makes them ""rare"" is the complex and difficult process of separating them from the rock they are embedded in, and from each other. China controls about 90% of the world's rare earth processing, and has a total monopoly on the processing of heavy rare earths.

Since at least 2023, China has been tightening its grip on several of the key critical minerals it provides for the world, Baskaran said.

Still, the April 4 export restrictions shocked the automotive world.

""It came out of nowhere,"" said Dan Hearsch, managing director at AlixPartners. ""Nobody had any time to react to it. I mean, within a matter of weeks, all of the material in the pipeline was out.""

European automakers shut down factories. Ford had to idle production of its popular Explorer SUV.

This month, China started permitting some access to companies that supply parts to some automakers. And this week the Trump administration said it had reached a deal to expedite rare earth and magnet shipments to the U.S.

Still it is unclear how durable these deals will be.

""We're not out of the woods yet,"" Baskaran said. ""There is a lot of volatility in the U.S.-China relationship in between tariffs and mineral restrictions. We've seen China ramp up restrictions over two years. Rare earths are just the newest one.""

There are longer-term solutions if China cuts off access again: recycling, developing other sources and innovation, for example. This crisis may even spur the industry to take action that reduces dependence on China.

But this rare earths crisis is just the latest in a series of supply disruptions over the last several years. Hearsch said it will likely get worse.

""Today it's rare earths,"" Hearsch said. ""But tomorrow it can and will be something else that maybe we're not thinking about, that maybe isn't even all that valuable and suddenly will be.""

The U.S. Department of Justice has settled its lawsuit challenging server maker Hewlett Packard Enterprise's all-cash acquisition of Juniper Networks for $14 billion, according to court filings.

The settlement requires the combined company to divest HPE's Instant On wireless networking business and license the source code for Juniper's Mist AI software used in Juniper's WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) products.

The joint settlement, filed late on Friday, requires approval by a judge and would avoid the need for a trial scheduled for July 9.

The Department of Justice (DOJ), HPE and Juniper did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside business hours.

The DOJ sued to block the deal in January, arguing that it would stifle competition and lead to only two companies — Cisco Systems and HPE — controlling more than 70% of the U.S. market for networking equipment.

In February, Juniper denied the DOJ's allegations, saying in a filing that the complaint does not correctly represent the market dynamics for wireless network solutions and the companies' rationale for the deal.

HPE said more than a year ago that it would acquire Juniper, as it looks to spruce up its artificial intelligence offerings.

Bitcoin has bounced back in recent weeks, surging as serious U.S. dollar collapse fears drive billionaire interest in bitcoin.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has soared toward its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, with traders betting a looming Federal Reserve flip will turbo-charge the crypto market.

Now, as U.S. president Donald Trump issues a surprise crypto prediction, bitcoin and crypto are braced for a “huge” BlackRock crypto market bombshell that has suddenly appeared on the “horizon.”

In-kind redemptions for the bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have taken Wall Street by storm over the last 18 months could be coming soon, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Hester Peirce.

“I can't prejudge, but we hear that there's a lot of interest,” Peirce, who heads up the SEC's crypto task force, said on stage at a Bitcoin Policy Institute event, adding that in kind bitcoin and crypto ETFs are now “on the horizon.”

In-kind redemptions allow investors to exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying asset rather than receiving cash, which is currently the case for the spot bitcoin and crypto ETFs approved by the SEC in early 2024—a change described as “huge” by Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

In-kind redemptions for bitcoin and crypto funds would make it cheaper and quicker for traders to buy and sell ETF shares, potentially making them more attractive to institutional investors on Wall Street.

Earlier this year, BlackRock, which has dominated the spot bitcoin ETF market with its $75 billion IBIT fund, asked the SEC to permit in-kind creations and redemptions for bitcoin ETFs, instead of having to use cash, with the likes of Fidelity and other smaller bitcoin and crypto ETF providers following suit.

""Those (forms) are going through the process now,"" Peirce said.

BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street's campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024 that now hold 1.4 million bitcoin worth $152 billion.

BlackRock's fund alone holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth almost $75 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

Meanwhile, the combined bitcoin price and crypto market is on the verge of a “turning point” as it hits $3.4 trillion, according to one analyst.

“The $3.4 trillion to 3.55 trillion range is a turning point, which has activated sellers and prevented the market from consolidating higher,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, said in emailed comments.

“Since the end of Wednesday, bitcoin has been testing the $108,000 mark, but it will sell off when it touches this level. Over the past couple of days, we have seen a smooth but steady intraday uptrend, accompanied by heavy buying from medium—and long-term investors. We see this as a sign of buying by professional market participants and link it to strengthening stocks, which increases the likelihood of reaching $110,000 or even $112,000 as early as this week.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, a Canadian firm focused on bitcoin-related services, has wrapped up the first leg of its bitcoin buying campaign, adding 478.57 bitcoin BTC$107,354.31 for CAD $70 million ($51 million) and boosting its total holdings to 771.37 BTC.

The accumulation works out to roughly 0.0000634 BTC per fully diluted share, the company said in a Friday press release. The Toronto-based firm plans to lend part of its BTC treasury to trading desks and other counterparties that need ready access to the cryptocurrency.

The approach mirrors that of numerous other companies adopting bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. 

Publicly-traded companies now hold a total of 841,715 BTC worth over $90 billion, according to Bitcointreasuries data, while private firms are estimated to hold 290,878 BTC worth over $31 billion.

As investors prepare for what many believe will be the next major crypto bull run, altcoins — cryptocurrencies that aren't Bitcoin — are once again in focus.

Tools like Best Wallet are making it easier to track, research, and invest in promising projects with a feature-rich experience built for both newcomers and seasoned traders.

The non-custodial app offers multi-chain support, no KYC onboarding, in-app token discovery, access to exclusive presales, staking integrations, and real-time portfolio management — all designed with a strong emphasis on user security and privacy.

Best Wallet also includes curated market insights, a Web3 launchpad, and social tools that help users follow top-performing wallets and trending tokens. With everything from token swapping to asset tracking in one sleek interface, it's becoming a go-to platform for anyone looking to get an edge in the altcoin space.

Still, picking winners remains as much art as science. We asked leading figures across the blockchain ecosystem how to spot the best altcoins, which tokens they're watching, and how newcomers can gain an edge.

Identifying promising altcoins starts with looking beyond hype and understanding real-world use.

“The best formula always will be finding the confluence of teams with a proven history of execution building in a vertical that has strong growth tailwinds,” Douglas Colkitt, contributor to Initial Fogo, a high-performance blockchain, told The Post.

That emphasis on proven execution is echoed by others in the space — with a growing focus on real-world application and long-term utility.

“When it comes to investing in Altcoins, I'm always going to be thinking about real usability,” said Mike Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs and a core contributor to the Pyth Network.

“The ones that stand out have true use cases, growing user adoption, sustainable tokenomics, and are powering new financial infrastructure.”

Mike Marshall, head of research at analytics firm Amberdata, echoed that view, telling The Post: “Try to look beyond hype to spot altcoins with a clear utility, credible teams and a healthy balance of community support and institutional interest — real substance beats speculation every time.”

Musa Hakim Jr., CEO and co-founder of LazyMoose.co, added that network infrastructure matters more than noise.

“For everyone else, the best way to identify valuable altcoins is developer community and organization or network infrastructure strength,” Hakim told The Post.

“Those two things drive utility which define value. Buy coins that you want to buy, not your friends.”

Not every expert is ready to offer a list of 10 altcoins, but many shared their highest-conviction picks.

Hakim added that his top picks were Solana, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin and USD Coin — with the last two interchangeable depending on market sentiment.

Rounding out Hakim's list are Cardano, Tether, Binance Coin, Bitcoin Cash and Uniswap.

“These 10 all have strong organizational credibility and heavy developer support,” said Hakim.

Marshall, who prioritizes foundational blockchain infrastructure, highlighted ten altcoins he believes are well-positioned both technically and commercially.

His picks include Ethereum, noted for its “ecosystem dominance”; Solana, praised for its “speed and adoption”; Arbitrum, a leader in “Layer 2 scaling”; Optimism, which experiencing “fast ecosystem growth”; Chainlink, known for its “oracle infrastructure”; Uniswap, a “DeFi cornerstone”; Aave, trusted for “lending”; MakerDAO, advancing “real-world asset adoption”; Ondo Finance, a “RWA yield pioneer”; and Fetch.ai, gaining traction for its “AI integration momentum.”

Cahill favored projects with clear usage and ecosystem momentum. The list he provided to The Post includes: “Hype, Pyth, Kamino, Drift, Raydium, Jito, Pendle, Helium, Jupiter, and Pumpfun (when it launches).”

Colkitt preferred to keep his list lean. He told The Post that he prefers Hype “just because it's a runaway category winner and expanding into a full fledged ecosystem.”

Colkitt said his second choice was Berachain, especially at its current price. His third-best option is Jito, which is “basically essential to Solana continuing to function and not much of the market has realized it yet.”

What makes an altcoin worth buying now? Many experts say real usage is more important than speculative buzz.

“Altcoins with proven usage are the best value in my mind,” Cahill noted.

Hakim recommended watching changes in who is leading major projects and which cryptocurrencies are gaining attention.

He told The Post that some of his top picks for the next rally include XRP and Solana — noting that some investors now see Solana as a smarter bet than Ethereum, especially since former Blockchain Association head Kristin Smith recently took over at the Solana Foundation.

He also pointed to Dogecoin as a meme-driven coin worth watching, saying, “There's something there, very good or very bad.”

Colkitt emphasized risk management. He told The Post that since Bitcoin “won't 10X overnight,” the best course of action would be to adopt “a barbell strategy” of Bitcoin and altcoins “further out on the risk curve.”

For serious investors, research is key.

“It's still hard to beat DefiLlama and Dune dashboards for data driven exploration,” said Colkitt.

“And of course, stay active on Crypto Twitter. Coins will get talked about there before they blow up.”

“You can find new altcoins by following new projects and tracking their testnet launches,” added Cahill.

“Most of these launches can be found on crypto-native news sites like The Block, Coindesk, and Cointelegraph.”

Hakim said that it would be best to compare top tens on exchanges as well as “observing the community on the social platforms you frequent.

“Don't buy a coin who's founder you can't quote,” Hakim advised.

Spotting the next big thing requires watching early traction and developer momentum.

“Finding promising altcoins early requires staying at the forefront of reliable data and analytics,” said Marshall.

“I personally use Amberdata to track on-chain metrics, liquidity trends, and unusual transaction activity.”

Cahill stressed the value of developer signals and ecosystem growth.

“It's important to watch for early community traction and smart developer activity over time to try and gauge the success of the project,” Cahill told The Post.

Hakim said Layer 2s (L2s), which help blockchains grow by handling more transactions quickly and cheaply, and regulatory clarity are key indicators.

“Follow the money,” said Hakim. He cited Polygon, a blockchain scaling solution designed to make transactions on Ethereum faster and cheaper, as an L2 that people should keep an eye on.

“The American coins are probably the best to start digging,” he added.

“Recent SEC guidance makes all of these projects that are compliant hot commodities globally.”

Bitcoin and Ethereum still dominate market cap — but that doesn't mean altcoins can't outperform.

“Bitcoin is still a great benchmark, especially for new investors,” said Cahill.

“But I believe that the next wave of meaningful growth will come from altcoins that power financial infrastructure and help drive institutional capital.”

“BTC and ETH still anchor the market and deserve core holdings,” added Marshall, “but select altcoins offer compelling upside, especially in sectors like tokenized real-world assets, AI, and L2 scaling.”

“Altcoins have much higher upside,” said Colkitt. “BTC won't 10X overnight.”

As momentum builds toward the next bull market, experts agree that finding the right altcoins involves a blend of research, real-world usage and community strength.

With platforms like Best Wallet making access easier, and data tools from DefiLlama to Amberdata offering deeper insights, investors now have more tools than ever to make informed decisions — and avoid chasing hype.

The US House of Representatives has advanced a new bipartisan crypto legislation to promote Blockchain adoption in different areas and boost the nation's competitiveness with federal support.

On Thursday, policy tracking platform Bitcoin Laws reported that the US House of Representatives passed a bill directing the US Secretary of Commerce to lead the national efforts to promote the competitiveness of the United States and the adoption of blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies (DLT).

In February, Republican Representative Kat Cammack introduced HR 1664, also known as the Deploying American Blockchains Act of 2025, to establish a Blockchain Deployment Program, aiming to develop best practices and explore the adoption of blockchain in multiple areas.



According to the bill, co-sponsored by Democratic Representative Darren Soto, the Secretary would be required to serve as the President's principal advisor for the deployment, use, application, and competitiveness of blockchain and other DLT, and take the actions necessary and appropriate to support the US leadership in this sector.

These activities include developing policies and recommendations on blockchain deployment risks, while helping promote the national security and economic security of the United States concerning blockchain technology.

Additionally, it establishes that the US Secretary of Commerce must encourage and improve coordination among Federal agencies for the deployment of these technologies to offer federal support.

If signed into law, HR 1664 would also require the establishment of advisory committees to support the adoption of blockchain technology in the first 180 days after the date of the Act's enactment.

Following its bipartisan support, the crypto legislation was received by the Senate earlier this week to continue the legislative process.

HB 1664's passage follows the steps of other crucial crypto legislations in Congress, which have received significant bipartisan support in the two chambers. Recently, the stablecoin-related bill, the GENIUS Act, passed the Senate's full vote and advanced to the House of Representatives.

Meanwhile, the House's crypto market structure bill, CLARITY Act, passed its two committee markups at the start of the month. However, the future of both legislations seemed uncertain as some lawmakers pushed to package the two bills together.

As reported by Bitcoinist, House leaders were reportedly pushing to merge the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act to increase the bills' chances of passing Congress and being sent to US President Donald Trump's desk before the August recess deadline.

Nonetheless, Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott revealed a new timeline for the crypto market structure framework at a press event on Thursday, suggesting an effort to keep the bills separate.

According to White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks' summary of the new timeline, the legislation will be introduced before the August recess, followed by a Markup during the first week of September, and its final passage scheduled by the end of that month.

Sacks stated that “President Trump supports CLARITY on market structure as well as GENIUS on stablecoins,” adding that “July will be a big month, with a bill signing for GENIUS, and CLARITY going to the Senate!”

Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) has raised over $2.6 million in its ongoing presale, now in its fourth stage. With strong growth and the Layer 2 blockchain ecosystem, Little Pepe is quickly becoming more popular than big meme coins like SHIB and PEPE.

The Little Pepe project shakes up the meme coin industry in ways no one expected. As SHIB and PEPE continue to ride their wave of past successes, $LILPEPE is defining a new trajectory: a meme coin supported by real infrastructure, scalability, and low transaction cost.

What makes $LILPEPE truly stand out is its use of Layer 2 blockchain technology. This unique positioning is setting it apart from first-generation meme giants like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE).

The integration of an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible protocol ensures seamless interoperability which in turn opens up a broad spectrum of use cases for $LILPEPE, ranging from decentralized finance to meme-themed marketplaces – all within an ecosystem designed to be both fun and functional. Unlike SHIB and PEPE, which exist primarily as speculative tokens, $LILPEPE serves as the meme token of a fully operational network focused on four core technical pillars: meme culture integration, ultra-low transaction fees, enhanced security protocols, and fast finality.

$LILPEPE is the native token of Little Pepe and is built on the ERC-20 standard with a total supply of 100 billion tokens. The project has already raised over $2.6M so far in its ongoing $LILPEPE presale and is gaining unstoppable momentum. The project's third presale stage sold out at lightning speed, and Stage 4 is already drawing major investor interest.

However, both SHIB and PEPE saw their most explosive growth after listings and viral moments but LILPEPE is attracting serious capital even before hitting major exchanges. This early presale performance speaks volumes. The buzz is no longer just about memes, it's about opportunity.

In terms of tokenomics, 30% of tokens are reserved for chain operations and reserves. Additional allocations include 13.5% for staking rewards and community incentives, 10% each for marketing initiatives, liquidity provision, and centralized exchange reserves. This distribution model prioritizes operational sustainability and community rewards over team allocations.

The project has undergone a comprehensive smart contract audit covering;

The $LILPEPE token offers real utility within a growing Layer 2 ecosystem, giving it long-term viability that meme projects often lack. Investors aren't just buying into hype; they're positioning themselves within an ecosystem with ambitious goals and solid technological developments.

Little Pepe project leans into meme culture while giving it a technological upgrade. Where old meme coins were seen as short-term pumps, $LILPEPE is setting the stage for lasting relevance. Its developers envision a digital realm where memes don't just entertain- they empower.

“Enter the new world order with $LILPEPE, where the unstoppable force of memes meets their home in a low-cost, lightning-fast Layer 2 EVM protocol,” reads the project's vision. This vision is resonating across online communities.

In this new meme-powered kingdom, $LILPEPE is more than a cryptocurrency. It's the engine driving the cultural and technological convergence happening in Web3. With a strong community forming around its mission, $LILPEPE is one of the most compelling meme coin projects of 2025. This isn't just another token, it's a Layer 2 revolution wrapped in a meme space.

Little Pepe is a next-gen Layer 2 blockchain designed to blend the meme culture with high-speed, low-cost decentralized infrastructure. Built for scalability, security, and accessibility, Little Pepe Chain helps EVM-compatible applications and is powered by the $LILPEPE token. The project's mission is to create a meme coin environment wherein utility meets virality, empowering users through cutting-edge technology and lightning-fast transactions.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Immutable, a leading platform in the non-fungible token (NFT) sector, has recently achieved a notable milestone by surpassing Ethereum in weekly NFT sales volume. This development underscores Immutable's growing influence in the Web3 technology landscape. The network's NFT sales volume reached $34.9 million, driven by the success of projects like Guild of Guardians, which saw a 21% increase in sales to over $20 million. Additionally, Guild of Guardians Avatars NFTs and Gods Unchained Cards experienced significant growth, with sales rising by 18% to $8.1 million and 41% to $6.5 million, respectively.

Despite these positive indicators, there are concerns within Immutable's ecosystem. The number of unique active wallets interacting with Immutable's games has declined by 17% over the past 30 days, dropping to 1 million. This decrease has positioned Immutable as the fifth-largest player in the gaming industry, trailing behind other platforms. Furthermore, the supply of IMX tokens on exchanges has surged in recent months, with the circulating supply increasing to 174 million from 136 million in March. This influx of tokens on exchanges could potentially exert downward pressure on the token's price.

Technical analysis of the IMX token reveals a downtrend over the past few months, with the price dropping to a critical support level at $0.3458. However, the formation of a double-bottom pattern indicates a potential bullish reversal. If the support holds, the token could see a 98% surge toward the pattern's neckline at $0.8100. Conversely, a drop below the double-bottom point would invalidate this bullish outlook. As of the latest check, the IMX token was trading around $0.415, reflecting a slight rebound from recent lows but still significantly below its peak values from May and the previous year.

Immutable's achievement in surpassing Ethereum in NFT sales volume highlights its growing prominence in the Web3 space. The bullish double-bottom pattern in the IMX token suggests a potential rebound, but concerns over declining active wallet engagement and increasing token supply on exchanges cast shadows over this optimistic outlook. The future performance of the IMX token will depend on whether support levels hold and if the network can address the challenges within its ecosystem.

Immutable's IMX token is flashing a bullish double-bottom pattern just as the network overtakes Ethereum in weekly NFT sales—a major milestone in the race for Web3 dominance. 

With Immutable's (IMX) volume topping $34.9 million, driven by hits like Guild of Guardians, the token has rebounded slightly off recent lows. However, declining active wallet engagement and a sharp increase in IMX token supply on exchanges cast shadows over the rally. For now, bulls are eyeing a possible 98% surge toward the pattern's neckline at $0.8100—if support holds.

Immutable was trading at $0.419 on Friday, June 27 — above the double-bottom point at $0.3458. It remains 50% below the highest point in May and 90% below last year's high. 

At last check on Saturday, Immutable was trading around $0.415.  

CryptoSlam data shows that Immutable has become the biggest player in the NFT space, flipping popular chains like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Mythos.

Immutable's NFT sales rose by 23% in the last seven days to over $34.9 million, while buyers jumped by nearly 20% to 11,080. In contrast, Ethereum's volume jumped by 33% to $25.8 million.

Immutable's Guild of Guardians Heroes saw sales jump by 21% to over $20 million. Sales of Guild of Guardians Avatars NFTs rose by 18% to $8.1 million, while Gos Unchained Cards soared by 41% to $6.5 million. 

Still, not all parts of Immutable's ecosystem are doing well. The number of unique active wallets interacting with Immutable's games dropped by 17% in the last 30 days to 1 million. This drop now makes it the fifth-biggest player in the gaming industry, after Sei, BSC, Skale, and WAX.

Additionally, the supply of IMX tokens on exchanges has jumped in the past few months. Santiment data indicates that the number of IMX tokens in circulation has increased to 174 million, up from 136 million in March.

The daily chart shows that the IMX price has been in a downtrend in the past few months. It dropped to the important support at $0.3458, its lowest point since April.

Immutable has formed a double-bottom pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. This pattern comprises two swings and a neckline, which is at $0.8100. 

Therefore, the token will likely bounce back, and possibly retest the neckline at $0.8100, up by 98% above the current level. A drop below the double-bottom point at $0.3458 will invalidate the bullish view.

Crypto World News

June 28, 2025 by Abbas Zagham 

Pepe NFT projects linked to original Pepe the Frog creator Matt Furie have suffered a devastating cyberattack, reportedly orchestrated by North Korean hackers. The breach, which resulted in over $1 million in losses, has shaken the NFT community and exposed serious security gaps in Web3 project management.

1/  Multiple projects tied to Pepe creator Matt Furie & ChainSaw as well as another project Favrr were exploited in the past week which resulted in ~$1M stolenMy analysis links both attacks to the same cluster of DPRK IT workers who were likely accidentally hired as developers. pic.twitter.com/85JRm5kLQO

The incident centers around Matt Furie, the visual artist who created the widely recognized Pepe character over two decades ago. While Furie has publicly distanced himself from the meme coin movement that adopted his artwork without consent, he recently sought to enter the NFT space on his terms. Partnering with Chainsaw, an NFT startup, Furie helped launch several official Pepe NFT collections, including one called Replicandy.

However, according to leading blockchain investigator ZachXBT, that partnership turned disastrous after Chainsaw inadvertently hired a North Korean operative for a key IT role. The hacker, posing as a legitimate candidate, was granted back-end access. 

In a stealth move executed during off-hours, the individual transferred the minting contract for Replicandy, a critical control point that allowed them to mint countless NFTs and tank the floor price of the collection.

The same hacker repeated this attack on three other Chainsaw-backed NFT collections, ultimately draining around $310,000. Just days later, a similar breach hit another NFT platform, Favrr, resulting in $680,000 in losses. This time, the infiltrator had been hired as Favrr's Chief Technology Officer, highlighting a severe lack of background checks and basic operational security.

10/ DPRK ITW consolidation 0x477 received payroll from the project Favrr which was exploited for $680K+ on June 25, 2025I suspect they have a second ITW on payroll as well because the exploiter address is tied to a Gate deposit address 0xab7 which ITW 2 sent payroll to. Favrr… https://t.co/mRRYNgj7kl pic.twitter.com/1KKDNwGsID

By analyzing transaction patterns and laundering methods on the blockchain, ZachXBT traced the attacks back to a small group linked to North Korea, likely associated with the infamous Lazarus Group, which has previously been responsible for some of the largest hacks in crypto history.

8/ Other indicators revealed from internal logs point out irregularities in a suspected DPRK IT workers resume. Why would a developer who claims to be living in the US have a Korean language setting, Astral VPN usage, and have an Asia/Russia time zone?

Despite the scale of the damage, Chainsaw and Matt Furie have remained largely silent. Chainsaw briefly posted a warning to its social media channels before deleting it. Furie has issued no statement and has disabled his direct messages on X (formerly Twitter). In contrast, Favrr has at least acknowledged the breach publicly.

This series of attacks not only underscores the growing threat of state-sponsored crypto crime but also serves as a wake-up call to NFT creators and blockchain firms. In an increasingly high-stakes environment, basic due diligence, robust hiring practices, and multi-layered security protocols are no longer optional; they are essential.

With Pepe NFT projects now caught in the crossfire, this incident serves as both a cautionary tale and a stark reminder that the human element remains the biggest vulnerability in Web3.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","[Money 20/20 Europe 2025] Fireblocks' Ran Goldi on the state of stablecoins","https://www.thepaypers.com/crypto-web3-and-cbdc/interviews/money2020europe2025-fireblocks-rangoldi-on-the-state-of-stablecoins","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 12:46:36 GMT","



In this video interview, Goldi explains why stablecoins are more than a buzzword—they're ‘another payments rail… an infrastructure upgrade to whatever it is we have today'. Fireblocks now works with 300+ payment firms worldwide, and its latest survey shows 90 % of 300 financial institutions are already strategising, running POCs, or rolling out stablecoin solutions. Regulatory anxiety has plummeted, with concerns dropping from 84 % two years ago to just 18 % today.

 

Goldi's guidance for newcomers is blunt: ‘First of all, don't believe the hype… If you go on LinkedIn today, it seems like stablecoins maybe can cure cancer, right? It's not. Sometimes PIX is better —choose the right rail for the job.'

He recommends a staged path ‘from crypto‑remote to crypto‑inside', starting with trusted partners and gradually bringing the infrastructure in‑house. Champions in the space care less about cost and more about ‘that velocity of money'.

Beyond speed and savings, programmability is the real game‑changer: ‘We can say, only move my dollars to Mexican pesos if the rate is underneath that specific rate. That's just one example'.

 

The panel Goldi joined at Money 20/20 concluded that every company needs a stablecoin strategy. Remote.com already pays 1 % of its global freelancers in stablecoins—and wishes the figure were higher—while shielding users from the technical jargon of USDC vs USDT.

Watch the full interview to hear exactly how stablecoins are reshaping cross‑border payments, B2B flows, and corporate treasuries—and what your first steps should be.

As the financial world grapples with the evolution of payment technologies, stablecoins have emerged as a transformative force in the global money movement.

The webinar's discussions, called Stablecoin Payments in Action: Adoption & Use Cases and moderated by Jelmer Koster - Senior Consultant at INNOPAY, revealed that stablecoins represent more than just another payment method – they're an infrastructure upgrade that's fundamentally changing how businesses and individuals move money across borders.

 

Jelmer opened the discussion by defining stablecoins as digital currencies on blockchain networks that are pegged to reference values, typically fiat currencies like the US dollar. However, Ran Goldie SVP of Payments from Fireblocks provided a more nuanced perspective, describing stablecoins as an infrastructure upgrade rather than a replacement for existing financial systems. 



Kene Ezeji-Okoye, Co-Founder and CEO at Millicent Labs and Advisor for Ubyx, compared modern stablecoins to historical instruments like traveller's checks – bearer instruments that are fully collateralised and denominated in stable currencies but built on global digital ledgers rather than paper.

Julia Morrongiello, Global Head of Strategy & Corporate Development from BVNK, emphasised three key advantages that make stablecoins compelling: speed, cost efficiency, and accessibility. Traditional cross-border payments, particularly to emerging markets, can take days to complete, while stablecoin transactions settle in minutes and operate 24/7. The cost advantages come from removing traditional intermediaries, though as Julia noted, effectiveness varies significantly by corridor. 



Perhaps most importantly, stablecoins provide global accessibility to dollar-denominated assets without requiring traditional banking relationships.

 

Contrary to popular belief, the panel revealed that cost reduction isn't the primary driver of stablecoin adoption. Goldie shared findings from a survey of 300 payment companies and banks, showing that revenue generation – not cost savings – was the top motivation for exploring stablecoins. This revenue comes from serving audiences in regions where customers want to receive stablecoins and from merchant demand for these payment options.

The discussion highlighted real-world applications, such as the use of stablecoins to pay thousands of contractors monthly (e.g. Starlink services) who prefer USD-pegged stablecoins over volatile local currencies like Argentinian pesos. Julia explained that this demand stems from individuals in emerging markets seeking exposure to stable currencies as a hedge against local economic volatility. Goldie noted the velocity of money as a crucial factor, citing import-export scenarios where faster payment settlement allows businesses to optimise cash flow and serve more clients efficiently.



Henri de Jong, Chief Business Development Officer at Quantoz added another dimension by highlighting programmability as a key differentiator. He described scenarios where payments could be automatically executed when specific conditions are met, such as when goods are delivered or bills of lading are transferred, creating efficiencies impossible with traditional payment systems.

 

According to Kene, banks increasingly recognise the need for a stablecoin strategy. ‘If we are not off-ramping, we are creating a closed-loop system. And if we don't have connectivity, we are fragmented', he explained. While many current use cases focus on B2B retailers, Kene pointed out that for enterprises, stablecoins can be ‘a hot potato' due to the need to manage significant counterparty risk. Looking ahead, he predicted a future with multiple stablecoin issuers and a different market structure—but emphasised that, ‘we need to connect them to make sense in the future'.

On the topic of connectivity, Henry highlighted the growing number of DeFi platforms and exchange pairs emerging between stablecoins. ‘We're seeing ramp on/off options between stablecoins—but not yet between stablecoins and traditional banking', he noted. This trend is currently more prominent within the Web 3 ecosystem.

 

Despite the advantages, significant challenges remain. Julia identified regulatory uncertainty as historically the biggest barrier, though recent developments like Europe's MiCA regulation and the proposed US Genius Act are providing much-needed clarity. Goldie confirmed this trend, noting that regulatory concerns among North American respondents dropped by 60% in recent surveys, while only 18% of European respondents now view regulation as a barrier.

Technical challenges persist, particularly around security and key management. Henry pointed out that users still need to manage wallets and private keys, making security breaches a continued concern. Nevertheless, as Julia stressed out, with crypto ‘you have more visibility/traceability, and you can see what happens at the level of transactions.'

All in all, as a stablecoin provider, it is crucial to offer solutions across a spectrum of engagement – from ‘crypto remote' services where clients don't touch the assets directly, to fully integrated ‘crypto inside' implementations, Goldi concluded.

Kenny from Ubyx addressed a critical infrastructure gap: the need for interoperability between different payment systems. He argued that without connectivity between stablecoins, tokenized deposits, and traditional banking systems, the industry risks creating fragmented closed-loop systems. His vision involves a clearing infrastructure similar to traditional check-clearing systems, where the specific issuer or backing mechanism becomes less relevant to end users.

 

Looking ahead, the panellists identified several key trends shaping the stablecoin landscape. Henry highlighted the potential for tokenized money market funds, enabling treasurers to generate yield on cash surpluses over weekends or short periods – something impossible with traditional instruments due to settlement delays.

Goldie outlined a clear adoption progression: payment service providers were early adopters, followed by fintech companies like Revolut and Robinhood, and now banks are beginning to embrace stablecoins. He predicts that widespread bank adoption will ultimately enable every business to use this technology. The panel also anticipates growth in non-USD stablecoins, with Kenny noting that 99% of current stablecoins are dollar-denominated, but other currencies are gaining traction.

Addressing the integration of emerging technologies, Goldie acknowledged that while combining AI and stablecoins might seem like buzzword bingo, programmable money is actually ideal for autonomous agents that need to make instant, irreversible payments. Henry drew parallels to IoT devices that require microtransactions to be economically viable.

 

The stablecoin revolution is not about replacing traditional finance but upgrading its infrastructure for the digital age. As regulatory frameworks solidify and interoperability solutions emerge, stablecoins are positioned to become as ubiquitous as internet-based communications replaced traditional phone calls. The key to success lies in building bridges between old and new systems, ensuring that the benefits of programmable, instant, global money movement can be realised without fragmenting the financial ecosystem. For businesses considering their digital asset strategy, the message is clear: start your stablecoin journey now, beginning with solutions that match your risk tolerance and gradually building capabilities as the technology matures and regulatory clarity continues to improve.

The platform, named Mion, supports extreme numerical precision, handling up to 20 digits before and 18 after the decimal point, to accommodate the technical requirements of assets such as Ethereum. 

The creation of Mion was prompted by a request from a US-based cryptocurrency custody and infrastructure provider. The client encountered difficulties reconciling crypto asset balances due to the limitations of existing systems, which were not designed to manage the high-precision calculations required in digital asset environments. AutoRek's development team responded by designing a new platform architecture over a six-month period, enabling full-scale performance without rounding errors or data truncation. 

According to a representative from AutoRek, the issue initially appeared to be a single client's concern but was quickly recognised as a wider industry gap. Financial institutions adopting digital assets face reconciliation challenges that conventional systems, typically configured for 2 to 8 decimal places, cannot address. Mion was introduced to ensure firms can apply the same financial controls used in traditional markets to high-precision digital environments. 

Mion is capable of accurately processing large volumes of transactions involving highly granular figures, making it suitable for a range of digital assets. The platform is built to reconcile transaction, account, ledger, and balance data across currencies, without compromise on accuracy due to system limitations. 

A technical lead at AutoRek explained that simply increasing the number of decimal places displayed was not sufficient. The platform required a complete architectural rebuild and the development of custom-coded functionality to bypass limitations in database technology. This includes proprietary mechanisms for advanced numerical operations, ensuring support for tasks such as FX conversions, valuations, and complex data aggregation in the crypto space.

 



 

As the cryptocurrency market surpasses USD 3 trillion in global capitalisation, financial institutions are dealing with operational infrastructure needs that differ sharply from those in traditional finance. The increased adoption of crypto has coincided with greater regulatory scrutiny, particularly in jurisdictions such as the UK and the EU. Frameworks such as the FCA's DP23/4 and the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) highlight the necessity of robust reconciliation and safeguarding processes.  

Mion is intended to support financial institutions in adapting to these evolving requirements by offering: 

The platform incorporates standard features such as automated data ingestion, rule configuration, interactive dashboards, API support, and workflow management capabilities. It will be updated regularly in line with AutoRek's broader release schedule.

As calls grow for Beijing to embrace digital currencies, e-payment giants seen as aiding yuan's global push

“From an economic perspective, money based on third-party payment platforms functions much like stablecoins – and China holds a comparative advantage in this area, having already built a relatively mature regulatory framework,” said Peng Wensheng, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, in a research note published on Friday.

According to Peng, platform-based digital money is an extension of legal tender, with safeguards in place to maintain a 1:1 peg with fiat currency.

“Its stability is underpinned by stricter safeguards – customer funds are backed by central bank base money, and regulatory oversight imposes tighter limits on its financial expansion,” he said.

As stablecoins move to the forefront of global economic and financial debate, Chinese state media has urged policymakers to stay ahead of the curve.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin briefly climbed back above $100,000 this month, pushing close to the $108,000 level before a new pullback. The move looks strong on the surface. But based on reports from Glassnode, much of that surge came from traders using borrowed funds, not fresh buyers piling in.

According to on-chain data, late-June's volume on Bitcoin futures stayed high as prices marched upward. Traders betting on short-term gains drove the market, even as the excitement behind the rally faded. Funding rates and the three-month futures basis both moved lower, signaling less bullish conviction. In other words, fewer people were making big, long bets on Bitcoin these days.



Spot trading did not follow the futures boom. At its $111,910 peak in May, daily spot volume hovered around $7.65 billion. That's well below the previous cycle highs, which topped $20 billion on some days. Based on reports, new cash from retail or long-term holders stayed on the sidelines instead of flooding in.

Big firms did keep buying. This week saw Michael Saylor's Strategy, Metaplanet and ProCap BTC together pick up about $1 billion worth of Bitcoin. At the same time, US-listed Bitcoin ETFs bought over $1.5 billion in fresh supply. Those steady purchases hint at genuine interest from institutions, even if short-term traders set the pace recently.



Glassnode now shows just 7 million BTC left freely available on exchanges. Roughly 14 million BTC are held by people who haven't moved their coins in ages. That supply squeeze could support prices if demand holds up. But it also means any sudden sell-off might hit hard when exchange wallets run low.

All in all, the recent jump above $100,000 feels more like a sprint by margin players than a marathon fueled by new believers. Corrections often follow rallies driven by heavy margin activity. Yet, the ongoing buying by big companies and ETFs offers a buffer. If they keep at it, Bitcoin may need a breather now but could rally again later.

As of June 28, Bitcoin traded at $106,500, down 0.85% on the day. Market watchers will be looking for a return of fresh spot demand or a stabilizing of futures bets before declaring the uptrend back on solid ground.

Industry figures are seeing beyond the ‘illusion of invisibility' after series of investor kidnappings

Cryptocurrency traders such as Mohammed Arsalan are prepared to watch their online assets expand and explode if they miss the right moment, making or breaking their fortunes in just minutes. All in a day's work on the internet. Offline, though, they have found themselves less equipped for the consequences of affluence. A string of kidnappings has plagued the industry over the past year and left traders across the globe paranoid, fearful and keen to invest in physical security measures.

Arsalan grew up working class in Karachi, Pakistan. He hustles in any setting. At 14, he started a business exporting T-shirts overseas. By 17, the pandemic swept it all away. Inside, online and penniless, the booming world of Bitcoin beckoned him.

To learn how to trade digital coins, he would record himself explaining how the markets worked. His phone didn't have enough storage to keep the videos, so he'd upload them onto Facebook groups. To his surprise, people were watching.

Arsalan says he went from $24 to $340,000 in five years. Along the way, the 23-year-old amassed more than 160,000 followers across various social media channels.

“Crypto is my bloodline,” he says. “It's the only business that accepted me when I was poor.”

But a knock at the door on Christmas Day, 2024, would reveal the price of his audience. A group of men bundled him into the back of a flashing police car. They darted through checkpoints with ease, driving further away from Karachi and into the night. After an hour, they stopped. With a gun to his temple, Arsalan was ordered to take out his phone, reset its passwords, and hand it over. Holding the keys to his kingdom, the car sped away.

Once home, Arsalan ran to the computer and opened his Binance wallet. It was empty. As he stared at the zeroes on the screen, five years of sacrifice washed over him. 16-hour days alone in his office. Parties unattended. Purchases never made. Life as Pakistan's cryptocurrency posterboy was over.

“I made this money from very, very hard work,” he says. “After this case, I will not trust anyone.”

Arsalan's abduction is not an isolated event; kidnappings of cryptocurrency industry figures have surged in the past 18 months. There have been at least 231 physical attacks against digital asset holders to date, according to news reports. Almost a third of these have taken place since the start of 2024.

This year, a single French gang cut off the finger of an entrepreneur, doused an influencer's father in gasoline and tried to snatch a CEO's daughter from the streets of Paris, according to French police. An Italian investor was tortured with a chainsaw and taser for weeks in a New York City townhouse, local police said. A British trader was allegedly held captive in a Spanish hotel room. A popular influencer in Houston, Texas, was held at gunpoint and pistol-whipped in her own home while her three assailants demanded millions in cryptocurrency, according to local news reports. The list goes on.

As the industry matures, so does the cybersecurity guarding exchanges and wallets. The value stored within these digital vaults is soaring. The result: hacks are becoming heists. Cryptocurrency has long suffered from sophisticated and devastating digital attacks. Now, however, thefts are manifesting in the offline world, too. For the industry's high-rollers, the targets on their backs have never felt heavier.

“Everybody's a bit on edge,” says Louis d'Origny, the founder of FTXCreditor, a platform that buys bankruptcy claims. “In five minutes, you can find someone's address. You can see our wallets online. You can see millions of dollars a day transacting out of these wallets. You'd be very tempted to show up at a house with a machete.”

Recent attacks have even led his co-founder to move house, after realizing his home address was available online.

Navigating an increasingly dangerous offline world, the industry is on edge, feeling as though securing their empires now falls to them as law enforcement struggles to keep up.

Building one's fortunes on blockchains entails novel risks.

Firstly, blockchains, the technology on which cryptocurrency is based, create public ledgers, so balances and transactions are visible. Every online wallet corresponds with an address in the form of a randomly generated series of characters. To avoid hacking, bigger sums are typically stored offline, on a small piece of hardware called a “cold wallet”, which also corresponds to a public address. Assailants invade homes to steal devices or force hostages to unlock their online wallet at gunpoint.

Criminals have started to find who owns which wallet, by using illicit software to analyze blockchain data. Other times, they will hack exchanges to access personal data, as was the case last month, when Coinbase support agents in India were bribed to leak the data of 70,000 users.

“A lot of these [crypto] guys thought they were moving around in silence. But, people are now able to find out that they are actually some of the richest guys in their cities,” says says a US-based founder and trader, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 

Secondly, transactions are instant and permission-less – kidnappers don't need a bank to approve their withdrawal. This can also make looted funds easier to hide. Assets are swiftly sent to various decentralized exchanges, which do not require know-your-customer information. Once there, funds can't be frozen by centralized entities like Binance or Coinbase.

In Karachi, Arsalan's kidnappers were found within 48 hours. The two policemen among them had been bribed to help orchestrate the plan. Following the attack, Arsalan was offered protection from three other officers and a police car. But, fearing this could actually endanger him further, he declined.

For many of crypto's kings and queens, unfettered access to one's money via blockchains can feel buffered from institutional corruption. “There is no justice in Pakistan if you're poor,” says Arsalan. “But decentralization means there are no institutions, no people, no banks … I own this money.”

But self-custody comes with a downside: there are fewer middlemen deterring a thief. This means taking matters into their own hands – or a pair they've hired.

“I used to like my space away from my [bodyguards], but now I want them closer,” says the anonymous US-based founder and trader, who doesn't reveal his security arrangements to anyone, even his close circle. “In crypto, no one trusts anybody. Half of these guys are scammers,” he says. Over the past month or so, his two guards have not left his sight – even for walks around the block. “Everyone's being a lot more cautious.”

Over the past six months, Jethro Pijlman's global security services firm, Infinite Risks International, has seen a rise in cryptocurrency investors from western cities wanting protection. Requests range from safeguarding team meetings to guarding entire families around the clock.

Paris leads when it comes to new requests, says Pijlman, as France emerges as a hotspot for attacks, particularly after the high-profile kidnapping in January of David Balland, the entrepreneur whose finger was severed. In mid-June, an investor was abducted from a Paris suburb, while his partner was ordered to deposit the key to his cryptocurrency account.

The Ethereum Community Conference takes place at the end of June in Cannes, but the mood will be different from last year. It will feature the “most comprehensive security effort in the event's history”, conference organizers said in a statement. For the first time, local police, special forces and the coast guard are being deployed to the site. Prepping security began almost a year ago, taking three times longer than usual, according to Bettina Boon Falleur, head of EthCC.

Companies are also taking measures to protect their staff.

Kraken, the second-largest exchange in the US, has deployed armed guards to accompany its top executives at all times, including outside their homes, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Matthew Liu, co-founder of the cryptocurrency Origin Protocol, was among the attendees of Donald Trump's private gala for the top owners of his token last month, a guest list which was leaked to the New York Times. Liu says his company is evaluating hiring a team of bodyguards for trips.

“It's a cost, but the cost of getting kidnapped or dealing with violence? It's very, very scary,” says Liu. He's also begun learning how to shoot a firearm and using a multi-signature wallet, whereby multiple people across the world need to sign-off on a payment.

His company has also introduced a new rule when the team goes to conferences: no posting until after the event.

“Many crypto investors are increasingly conscious of their exposure, especially after publicly sharing – or oversharing – details of their success and affluent lifestyles online,” says Pijlman in regards to his clients. Indeed, for an industry that's chronically online, its titans have often built large social media followings, while their wealth stays encrypted in anonymous blockchains. “This illusion of invisibility may have led to a false sense of security.”

For Arsalan, he watched his savings be chopped up and sprinkled across the cryptographic abyss. Over the next four months, he fell into a deep depression. He went offline and relied on whatever handouts his father could afford to give him. He considered ending his life, he says.

As Arsalan's case demonstrates, kidnappers haven't exclusively targeted only multimillionaires or only westerners.

Between 2020 and 2023, a Florida-based gang accessed the personal data of everyday cryptocurrency investors, and were able to steal from their wallets remotely.

The gang then carried out four home invasions against the same victims, spanning North Carolina, Texas and Florida, according to the US Department of Justice. Account holders were forced to unlock their wallets at gunpoint, while their families were tied up. One man's mother was tortured. Another man was abducted and found 120 miles from his home.

Two of the attacks targeted seniors, court documents show.

“I always dreamed of having a good retirement. I worked for it. I feel like I deserved it,” one victim, 70, told the court during the sentencing. Her husband has Parkinson's. They'd hoped to take one last trip together – “to have at least some good years, good times”, she said. The couple lost $3m in cryptocurrency at 2022 prices via wire fraud. Wanting more, the gang invaded their home and held them at gunpoint to claim whatever was left. Their portfolio would be worth nearly $10.7m today.

“One whole life of savings and you just took it all,” she said.

In the case of the retirees, the judge ordered the defendants to pay restitution to the victims. Receiving it looks unlikely.

Despite the burgeoning risks, only 10% of cryptocurrency holders across the world have coverage on their digital assets, according to a report by insurance firm GlobalData. Only two insurers offer kidnapping and ransom (K&R) coverage for crypto companies: Aon and Canopius. Glenn Morgan, SVP, head of digital assets at Aon, says he's seen an increase in clients asking about coverage in recent months. Amid the surge, insurers may be on the eve of a windfall: last month NBC News reported that three crypto-specific insurance companies are working on K&R policies.

From the moment Arsalan checked his balance, he knew any chance of recovery would fall to him. Without the help of law enforcement, he's been able to trace and recover about $160,000 of cryptocurrency, while the police have seized $60,000 in cash and a luxury car. It's all now held by local police as case property. He thinks it'll be at least six years before it's returned to him, given the pace of Pakistan's courts.

He says seven people have reached out to him with similar ordeals they didn't report. Trading digital assets in Pakistan is a legal gray area, as banks are forbidden from facilitating transactions. When asked why they targeted crypto traders, the kidnappers said they thought victims wouldn't have legal recourse, according to Arsalan.

In the meantime, Arsalan trades on. He wants to rebuild within a year: “They grabbed my money but they did not grab my brain.”

He's also returned to social media, posting his first video in May. No amount of threats will make him give up crypto, he says. Despite all of its risks, public ledgers still feel safer to him than institutions.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, a Canadian firm focused on bitcoin-related services, has wrapped up the first leg of its bitcoin buying campaign, adding 478.57 bitcoin BTC$107,397.14 for CAD $70 million ($51 million) and boosting its total holdings to 771.37 BTC.

The accumulation works out to roughly 0.0000634 BTC per fully diluted share, the company said in a Friday press release. The Toronto-based firm plans to lend part of its BTC treasury to trading desks and other counterparties that need ready access to the cryptocurrency.

The approach mirrors that of numerous other companies adopting bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. 

Publicly-traded companies now hold a total of 841,715 BTC worth over $90 billion, according to Bitcointreasuries data, while private firms are estimated to hold 290,878 BTC worth over $31 billion.

“Traditional financial rails are hard to access and in need of modernization,” Gemini said in a statement on Friday.

“Tokenized stocks solve this problem by giving investors greater access with fewer restrictions,” it added. 

Traditional stock markets come with several restrictions, including limited trading hours tied to market time zones, higher fees for international investors, and limited access for investors in certain regions.

Gemini said, “onchain stock trading solves these problems by offering a frictionless experience in one place.” 

Gemini said investors could hold crypto and stocks onchain without having to sell on one platform to use another for trading stocks. 

Gemini partnered with US public securities provider Dinari to provide the service. “By leveraging Dinari's tokenization-on-demand model, we can offer customers greater liquidity, transparency, and the same economic rights as the backing security, where permitted,” it said.

While MSTR is the only tokenized stock currently available on Gemini, the exchange said that more tokenized stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are expected to launch “in the coming days.”

Strategy (MSTR) stock is up 3.84% over the past 30 days, trading at $383.88, according to Google Finance data. 

On Wednesday, financial analyst Jeff Walton said that Strategy has a high chance of qualifying for the S&P 500 as long as Bitcoin (BTC) doesn't drop below $95,240 before the end of the second quarter.

This comes amid growing interest from other crypto platforms in bringing US-tokenized equities to the European market. Tokenized equities are not currently available to be traded in the US.

On May 8, reports emerged that brokerage fintech Robinhood is reportedly developing a blockchain network enabling European retail investors to trade US securities.

Just weeks later, on May 23, crypto exchange Kraken said it plans to offer non-US customers the option of trading tokenized US stocks, as part of the company's push to offer more traditional assets via tokenization.

Meanwhile, crypto exchange Coinbase is trying to get the green light in the US. On Tuesday, Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, reportedly said the company was seeking the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer tokenized equities.

Crypto executives are hopeful that tokenized equities will grow big. Arnab Naskar, STOKR's CEO, recently said it is difficult to project but is “definitely a bigger trillion-dollar market.”

 XRP spiked on Friday after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the company is “closing this chapter once and for all” in its legal battle with the US regulator that began in December 2020. 

XRP's price jumped over 3% on Friday just hours after Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the company is dropping its cross-appeal against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and expects the regulator to do the same.

“Ripple is dropping our cross-appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they've previously said,” Garlinghouse said in an X post on Friday. XRP (XRP), the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple Labs, spiked 3.36% to $2.18 just five hours after the post, according to CoinMarketCap data.

“We're closing this chapter once and for all and focusing on what's most important – building the internet of Value. Lock in,” Garlinghouse added.

The announcement comes a day after the US district court denied a joint motion from the SEC and Ripple requesting an indicative ruling to reduce a $125 million civil penalty and reverse an order defining primary sales of XRP to institutional investors as securities transactions under Article 5 of the Securities Act.

“Ultimately, the Court granted in part the SEC's request for an injunction and a civil penalty because the Court found that 'Ripple's willingness to push the boundaries of the [Summary Judgment] Order evinces a likelihood that it will eventually, if it has not already, cross the line,” Judge Analisa Torres said.

After the ruling, Ripple chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty said, “The ball is back in our court.”

“The Court gave us two options: dismiss our appeal challenging the finding on historic institutional sales — or press forward with the appeal,” Alderoty said.

“Either way, XRP's legal status as not a security remains unchanged,” he said, adding:

If the SEC also drops its appeal, it could bring to an end the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US regulator that has lasted for more than four years.

In December 2020, the SEC filed the lawsuit against Ripple Labs, Chris Larsen and CEO Brad Garlinghouse. 

The SEC's central claim was that Ripple had raised $1.3 billion by selling XRP as an unregistered security, violating federal securities laws. 

In August 2024, Garlinghouse argued that Torres' decision to fine Ripple Labs $125 million was “a victory” for the firm, pointing out that it was a 94% reduction from the SEC's initial plan to fine Ripple for $2 billion in damages.

Did cameras finally spot the ocean's most elusive monster?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Humans spend nearly their entire lives on land, but the Earth we call home is really a water world. With 71 percent of the Earth's surface covered by water, this expansive ecosystem has been difficult to study, and many animals of the deep ocean remain a complete mystery. One of the most spellbinding of these animals is the colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni). When full-grown, this creature is about as long as a bus and weighs nearly 1,100 pounds. 

Believed to live in the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, this immense cephalopod—the largest invertebrate species on the planet— has never been observed in its natural habitat. Scientists only get a good look at these animals when trawlers accidentally catch them in their nets. But a new kind of oceanographic study seems to have struck gold last year when international research team and non-profit called Kolossal appeared to have stumbled across a juvenile colossal squid during one of its four trips to Antarctica from December 2022 to March 2023.

The team used a novel approach for imaging the ocean—outfitting a polar tourism vessel called the Ocean Endeavor with a deep-sea camera. Thankfully, the research team released the footage, which the website IFLScience promptly posted to YouTube. 

“Antarctica is experiencing rapid and complex change, and it is critical to have a better understanding of these changes for the region's ocean ecosystems,” the Kolossal team wrote in a paper detailing the method in 2024. “The costs and logistical challenges to operate scientific research vessels prohibits the scaling of crucial science and discovery in the region. Yet, the tourism industry in Antarctica is growing rapidly, and collaboration between tourism companies and researchers provides important access to the region.”

While leveraging tourism for marine exploration is a logistical win-win, finding verified footage of a colossal squid is as hard as ever. Even the short clip of the above specimen isn't confirmed, as the video could be capturing an adult glass squid Galiteuthis glacialis or perhaps even a species completely unknown to science. The video is being peer-reviewed by experts, but it's unlikely that scientists will ever know for sure. But because footage of any squid species in the Southern Ocean is rare, the footage is a huge victory for marine biologists studying these famously elusive animals regardless of its contents. 

“The two known Cranchiidae taxa seen in the Antarctic are Galiteuthis glacialis and Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni,” Aaron Evans, who is peer reviewing the footage, told IFLScience. “The squid seen here could belong to different life stages of either of those taxa—and is an exciting example of wild cranchiid behavior, as I cannot think of existing video footage of either of those squid in their natural environment.”

Although the team's stated goal is to capture footage of an adult colossal squid in its natural environment, according to IFLScience, the camera filmed nearly 80 species. Among them were giant volcano sponges, Antarctic sunflower stars, and many other marine invertebrates. 

For now, the world's largest invertebrate species frustratingly remains one of the animal kingdom's largest mysteries. But as marine biologists team up with tourism vessels to explore the oceans, some of the our water planet's biggest questions could slowly be answered.

Scientists at Ca' Foscari University of Venice, in collaboration with researchers from Japan, China, Switzerland, and Italy, have developed an innovative method to produce and rapidly analyze a vast array of macrocyclic peptides, molecules increasingly used in modern medicine. The research, published in Nature Communications, harnesses the familiar brewer's yeast, turning billions of these tiny organisms into miniature fluorescent factories, each capable of creating a unique peptide with potential therapeutic applications.

Macrocyclic peptides are promising drugs because they combine precision targeting, stability, and safety, offering fewer side effects than traditional drugs. However, conventional methods for discovering and testing these peptides are often complex, difficult to control, slow, and environmentally unfriendly.

To overcome these limitations, the researchers engineered common brewer's yeast cells to individually produce different macrocyclic peptides. Each yeast cell acts like a tiny factory that lights up when prod-ucing the compound, allowing scientists to swiftly identify promising peptides. Using advanced fluorescence-based techniques, the team screened billions of these micro-factories in just a few hours, a process that is significantly faster and more ecofriendly than existing methods.

Sara Linciano, lead author and postdoctoral researcher at Ca' Foscari's Department of Molecular Sciences and Nanosystems, explains: ""We manipulated yeast cells so that each one functions as a 'micro-factory' that becomes fluorescent when producing a specific compound. This allowed us to analyze 100 million different peptides rapidly and effectively.""

Ylenia Mazzocato, co-leader of the study, highlights the sustainability of their approach: ""By exploiting the natural machinery of yeast, we produce peptide molecules that are biocompatible and biodegradable, making them safe for health and the environment, a truly 'green pharma' approach.""

The team also clarified how these peptides precisely bind to their targets. Zhanna Romanyuk, who contributed to the structural analysis, says: ""Using X-ray crystallography, we demonstrated the excellent binding properties of these peptides, confirming their precision and potency.""

This new method offers significant advancements for drug discovery, especially for challenging targets that conventional drugs cannot easily address. Alessandro Angelini, associate professor and study coordinator, emphasizes: ""We are pushing the boundaries of this technology to create macrocyclic peptides that can deliver advanced therapies directly to specific cells, potentially revolutionising treatments. This could greatly benefit patient health and have substantial scientific and economic impacts.""

This work was part of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), supported by the European Union's Next Generation EU initiative, involving multidisciplinary teams from Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Kyoto Institute of Technology (KIT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Padova, and École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), including experts in chemistry, biophysics, biochemistry, and computational sciences.

Part of this technology has already been patented by Ca' Foscari and was recently acquired by the startup Arzanya S.r.l. ""Seeing our technology gain international recognition makes me proud,"" Angelini concludes. ""I I hope Arzanya S.r.l. can provide our talented young researchers with the opportunity to pursue their passions here in Italy, without necessarily needing to move abroad.""

The pristine samples from asteroid Ryugu returned by the Hayabusa2 mission on December 6, 2020, have been vital to improving our understanding of primitive asteroids and the formation of the Solar System. The C-type asteroid Ryugu is composed of rocks similar to meteorites called CI chondrites, which contain relatively high amounts of carbon, and have undergone extensive aqueous alteration in their past.

A research team at Hiroshima University discovered the presence of the mineral djerfisherite, a potassium-containing iron-nickel sulfide, in a Ryugu grain. The presence of this mineral is wholly unexpected, as djerfisherite does not form under the conditions Ryugu is believed to have been exposed to over its existence. The findings were published on May 28, 2025, in the journal Meteoritics & Planetary Science.

""Djerfisherite is a mineral that typically forms in very reduced environments, like those found in enstatite chondrites, and has never been reported in CI chondrites or other Ryugu grains,"" says first and corresponding author Masaaki Miyahara, associate professor at the Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Hiroshima University. ""Its occurrence is like finding a tropical seed in Arctic ice -- indicating either an unexpected local environment or long-distance transport in the early solar system.""

Miyahara's team had been carrying out experiments to understand the effects of terrestrial weathering on Ryugu grains. While observing the grains by field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM) for effects of weathering, they found djerfisherite in the number 15 grain of sample plate C0105-042.

""The discovery of djerfisherite in a Ryugu grain suggests that materials with very different formation histories may have mixed early in the solar system's evolution, or that Ryugu experienced localized, chemically heterogeneous conditions not previously recognized. This finding challenges the notion that Ryugu is compositionally uniform and opens new questions about the complexity of primitive asteroids,"" Miyahara elaborates.

Ryugu is a part of a larger parent body that formed between 1.8 to 2.9 million years after the beginning of the Solar System. This parent body is thought to have originated in the outer region of the solar system, where water and carbon dioxide existed in the form of ice. Inside the parent body, heat generated by the decay of radioactive elements caused the ice to melt around 3 million years after its formation. The temperature during this process is estimated to have remained below approximately 50℃.

In contrast, the parent bodies of enstatite chondrites, which are known to contain djerfisherite, are believed to have formed in the inner region of the solar system. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that djerfisherite in enstatite chondrites formed directly from high-temperature gas. In addition, hydrothermal synthesis experiments have shown that djerfisherite can also form through reactions between potassium-bearing fluids and Fe-Ni sulfides at temperatures above 350 ℃.

This led the team to propose two hypotheses for its presence in the Ryugu grain: either it arrived from another source during the formation of Ryugu's parent body; or, it was formed intrinsically when the temperature of Ryugu was raised to above 350 ℃.

Preliminary evidence indicates that the intrinsic formation hypothesis is more likely to be true. The next steps will be to conduct isotopic studies of this and other Ryugu grains, to determine their origins. ""Ultimately, our goal is to reconstruct the early mixing processes and thermal histories that shaped small bodies like Ryugu, thereby improving our understanding of planetary formation and material transport in the early solar system,"" Miyahara concludes.

Bright colors, fruit imagery, and labels like ""locally made"" or ""vegan"" might seem harmless -- but when used on cannabis edibles, they can send misleading messages to teens.

That's according to a new Washington State University-led study examining how adolescents perceive the packaging of cannabis-infused products such as gummies, chocolates and sodas. Despite regulations barring packaging that targets youth, many teens in the study found these products appealing -- often likening them to everyday snacks or health foods.

The research, conducted in collaboration with Public Health - Seattle & King County, is part of a broader effort to reduce accidental cannabis exposure among teens. The findings could help shape new rules aimed at limiting underage appeal.

""What surprised us was how often these products were interpreted as healthy or natural,"" said Jessica Willoughby, associate professor in WSU's Murrow College of Communication and co- author of the study, published in the Journal of Health Communication. ""When you combine that with vibrant packaging and familiar fruit flavors, it's easy to see how these items start to look like snacks -- not something potentially harmful or illegal for teens.""

Researchers conducted virtual focus groups and interviews with 28 Washington teens, ages 13 to 17, using real product photos from stores to prompt discussion. With parental permission, participants shared which packaging elements caught their eye and why.

The teens consistently pointed to bright, colorful designs and packaging that resembled healthy snacks as particularly appealing. Some said they'd display the packaging in their rooms or use it in social media posts. Others said terms like ""locally made"" and ""vegan"" made the products feel more aligned with their personal values -- even if they knew the items contained cannabis.

""Our findings suggest that teens are drawn not just to the look of these packages, but to what the design represents,"" said Stacey Hust, a professor in WSU's Murrow College and the study's lead author. ""They saw these products as trendy, natural and aspirational -- qualities that resonate with their identities and beliefs.""

The study also showed that teens with greater familiarity with cannabis -- either through personal use or family exposure -- were more likely to notice warning labels and dosage information. Those with less knowledge often overlooked health warnings or didn't recognize cannabis symbols at all.

The results raise concerns for health educators and policymakers as cannabis edibles become more prevalent. The researchers recommend incorporating teen perspectives into regulatory discussions and increasing cannabis literacy through targeted education efforts.

""Teens are telling us what speaks to them -- and sometimes it's not what adults expect,"" said Sarah Ross-Viles, youth cannabis prevention manager with King County and study co-author. ""If we're serious about making cannabis packaging less appealing to youth, we need to use their insights to guide smarter, more effective regulations.""

The WSU team recently worked with Public Health - Seattle & King County health officials and the Washington State Liquor & Cannabis Board to conduct a follow-up quantitative study exploring how packaging elements correlate with perceived teen appeal and intent to use.

While broad changes like plain packaging may ultimately be difficult to implement, the researchers say practical updates -- such as clearer warnings and limiting branding that mimics health food -- could help reduce youth attraction.

""We're not calling for a marketing ban,"" Hust said. ""We're asking for thoughtful regulations that balance the rights of adult consumers with the need to protect kids.""

Ross-Viles agreed: ""This is about ensuring cannabis packaging serves its real purpose -- informing adult consumers -- without confusing or enticing teens. And now, for the first time, we are getting direct feedback from Washington youth to help make that possible.""

Astronomers have uncovered a vast cloud of energetic particles -- a 'mini halo' -- surrounding one of the most distant galaxy clusters ever observed, marking a major step forward in understanding the hidden forces that shape the cosmos.

The mini-halo is at a distance so great that it takes light 10 billion years to reach Earth, making it the most distant ever found, doubling the previous distance known to science.

The discovery demonstrates that entire galaxy clusters, among the largest structures in the universe, have been immersed in high-energy particles for most of their existence.

Such a mini-halo consists of highly energetic, charged particles in the vacuum between galaxies in a cluster, which together emanate radio waves which can be detected from Earth.

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, with the pre-print version of the paper published today. the findings show that even in the early universe, galaxy clusters were already shaped by energetic processes.

The international team of researchers behind the discovery was co-led by Julie Hlavacek-Larrondo of Université de Montréal and Roland Timmerman of the Institute for Computational Cosmology of Durham University, in the U.K.

The researchers analysed data from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) radio telescope, a vast network of over 100,000 small antennae spanning eight European countries. While studying a galaxy cluster named SpARCS1049, the researchers detected a faint, widespread radio signal.They found that it did not emanate from individual galaxies, but from a vast region of space filled with high-energy particles and magnetic fields.

Stretching over a million light-years, this diffuse glow is a telltale sign of a mini-halo,a structure astronomers have only been able to observe in the nearby universe up until now. ""It's as if we've discovered a vast cosmic ocean, where entire galaxy clusters are constantly immersed in high-energy particles,"" said Hlavacek-Larrondo.

Added Timmerman: ""It's astonishing to find such a strong radio signal at this distance. It means these energetic particles and the processes creating them have been shaping galaxy clusters for nearly the entire history of the universe.""

Two likely explanations

There are two likely explanations behind the formation of the mini-halo.

One is that there are supermassive black holes at the hearts of galaxies within a cluster that can eject streams of high-energy particles into space. However, astronomers are still trying to understand how these particles would be able to migrate away from the black hole to create such a gigantic cloud of particles, while maintaining so much of their energy.

The second explanation is cosmic particle collisions. This is when charged particles within the hot plasma of the galaxy cluster collide at near-light speeds, smashing apart into the highly energetic particles that can be observed from Earth.

This new discovery provides a rare look at what galaxy clusters were like just after they formed, the astronomers say.

It not only shows that galaxy clusters have been infused with these high-energy particles for billions of years more than previously known, but it also allows astronomers to study where these high-energy particles come from.

It suggests that black holes and/or high-energy particle collisions have been enriching the environment of galaxy clusters much earlier than expected, keeping them energized over billions of years.

With newer telescopes being developed such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), scientists will be able to detect even fainter signals and further explore the role of magnetic fields, cosmic rays, and energetic processes in shaping the Universe, the astronomers say.

""We are just scratching the surface of how energetic the early Universe really was,"" said Hlavacek-Larrondo. ""This discovery gives us a new window into how galaxy clusters grow and evolve, driven by both black holes and high-energy particle physics.""

Spinal cord injuries are currently incurable with devastating effects on people's lives, but now a trial at Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland offers hope for an effective treatment.

Spinal cord injuries shatter the signal between the brain and body, often resulting in a loss of function.""Unlike a cut on the skin, which typically heals on its own, the spinal cord does not regenerate effectively, making these injuries devastating and currently incurable,"" says lead researcher Dr Bruce Harland, a senior research fellow in the School of Pharmacy at Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland.

Before birth, and to a lesser extent afterwards, naturally occurring electric fields play a vital role in early nervous system development, encouraging and guiding the growth of nerve tissue along the spinal cord. Scientists are now harnessing this same electrical guidance system in the lab.An implantable electronic device has restored movement following spinal cord injury in an animal study, raising hopes for an effective treatment for humans and even their pets.

""We developed an ultra-thin implant designed to sit directly on the spinal cord, precisely positioned over the injury site in rats,"" Dr Harland says.

The device delivers a carefully controlled electrical current across the injury site. ""The aim is to stimulate healing so people can recover functions lost through spinal-cord injury,"" Professor Darren Svirskis, director of the CatWalk Cure Program at the University's School of Pharmacy says.

Unlike humans, rats have a greater capacity for spontaneous recovery after spinal cord injury, which allowed researchers to compare natural healing with healing supported by electrical stimulation.

After four weeks, animals that received daily electric field treatment showed improved movement compared with those who did not.

Throughout the 12-week study, they responded more quickly to gentle touch.

""This indicates that the treatment supported recovery of both movement and sensation,"" Harland says. ""Just as importantly, our analysis confirmed that the treatment did not cause inflammation or other damage to the spinal cord, demonstrating that it was not only effective but also safe.""

This new study, published in Nature Communications, has come out of a partnership between the University of Auckland and Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden.

""Long term, the goal is to transform this technology into a medical device that could benefit people living with these life-changing spinal-cord injuries,"" says Professor Maria Asplund of Chalmers University of Technology.

""This study offers an exciting proof of concept showing that electric field treatment can support recovery after spinal cord injury,"" says doctoral student Lukas Matter, also from Chalmers University.

The next step is to explore how different doses, including the strength, frequency, and duration of the treatment, affect recovery, to discover the most effective recipe for spinal-cord repair.

Before Duolingo wiped its videos from TikTok and Instagram in mid-May, social media engagement was one of the language-learning app's most recognizable qualities. Its green owl mascot had gone viral multiple times and was well known to younger users—a success story other marketers envied.

But, when news got out that Duolingo was making the switch to become an “AI-first” company, planning to replace contractors who work on tasks generative AI could automate, public perception of the brand soured.

Young people started posting on social media about how they were outraged at Duolingo as they performatively deleted the app—even if it meant losing the precious streak awards they earned through continued, daily usage. The comments on Duolingo's TikTok posts in the days after the announcement were filled with rage, primarily focused on a single aspect: workers being replaced with automation.

The negative response online is indicative of a larger trend: Right now, though a growing number of Americans use ChatGPT, many people are sick of AI's encroachment into their lives and are ready to fight back.

When reached for comment, Duolingo spokesperson Sam Dalsimer stressed that “AI isn't replacing our staff” and said all AI-generated content on the platform would be created “under the direction and guidance of our learning experts.” The company's plan is still to reduce its use of non-staff contractors for tasks that can be automated using generative AI.

Duolingo's embrace of workplace automation is part of a broad shift within the tech industry. Leaders at Klarna, a buy now, pay later service, and Salesforce, a software company, have also made sweeping statements about AI reducing the need for new hires in roles like customer service and engineering. These decisions were being made at the same time as developers sold “agents,” which are designed to automate software tasks, as a way to reduce the amount of workers needed to complete certain tasks.

Still, the potential threat of bosses attempting to replace human workers with AI agents is just one of many compounding reasons people are critical of generative AI. Add that to the error-ridden outputs, the environmental damage, the potential mental health impacts for users, and the concerns about copyright violations when AI tools are trained on existing works.

Many people were initially in awe of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools when they first arrived in late 2022. You could make a cartoon of a duck riding a motorcycle! But soon artists started speaking out, noting that their visual and textual works were being scraped to train these systems. The pushback from the creative community ramped up during the 2023 Hollywood writer's strike, and continued to accelerate through the current wave of copyright lawsuits brought by publishers, creatives, and Hollywood studios.

Right now, the general vibe aligns even more with the side of impacted workers. “I think there is a new sort of ambient animosity towards the AI systems,” says Brian Merchant, former WIRED contributor and author of Blood in the Machine, a book about the Luddites rebelling against worker-replacing technology. “AI companies have speedrun the Silicon Valley trajectory.”

Before ChatGPT's release, around 38 percent of US adults were more concerned than excited about increased AI usage in daily life, according to the Pew Research Center. The number shot up to 52 percent by late 2023, as the public reacted to the speedy spread of generative AI. The level of concern has hovered around that same threshold ever since.

Ethical AI researchers have long warned about the potential negative impacts of this technology. The amplification of harmful stereotypes, increased environmental pollution, and potential displacement of workers are all widely researched and reported. These concerns were often previously reserved to academic discourse and online leftists paying attention to labor issues.

As AI outputs continued to proliferate, so did the cutting jokes. Alex Hanna, coauthor of The AI Con and director of research at the Distributed AI Research Institute, mentions how people have been “trolling” in the comment sections of YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels whenever they see AI-generated content in their feeds. “I've seen this on the web for a while,” she says.

This generalized animosity towards AI has not abated over time. Rather, it's metastasized. LinkedIn users have complained about being constantly prompted with AI-generated questions. Spotify listeners have been frustrated to hear AI-generated podcasts recapping their top-listened songs. Reddit posters have been upset to see AI-generated images on their microwavable noodles at the grocery store.

Tensions are so high that even the suspicion of AI usage is now enough to draw criticism. I wouldn't be surprised if social media users screenshotted the em dashes in this piece—a supposed giveaway of AI-generated text outputs—and cast suspicions about whether I used a chatbot to spin up sections of the article.

A few days after I first contacted Duolingo for comment, the company hid all of its social media videos on TikTok and Instagram. But, soon the green owl was back online with a satirical post about conspiracy theories. “I've had it with the CEOs and those in power. It's time we show them who's in charge,” said a person wearing a three-eyed Duolingo mask. The video uploaded right afterwards was a direct message from the company's CEO attempting to explain how humans would still be working at Duolingo, but AI could help them produce more language learning courses.

While the videos got millions of views on TikTok, the top comments continued to criticize Duolingo for AI-enabled automation: “Keep in mind they are still using AI for their lessons, this doesn't change anything.”

This frustration over AI's steady creep has breached the container of social media and started manifesting more in the real world. Parents I talk to are concerned about AI use impacting their child's mental health. Couples are worried about chatbot addictions driving a wedge in their relationships. Rural communities are incensed that the newly built data centers required to power these AI tools are kept humming by generators that burn fossil fuels, polluting their air, water, and soil. As a whole, the benefits of AI seem esoteric and underwhelming while the harms feel transformative and immediate.

Unlike the dawn of the internet where democratized access to information empowered everyday people in unique, surprising ways, the generative AI era has been defined by half-baked software releases and threats of AI replacing human workers, especially for recent college graduates looking to find entry-level work.

“Our innovation ecosystem in the 20th century was about making opportunities for human flourishing more accessible,” says Shannon Vallor, a technology philosopher at the Edinburgh Futures Institute and author of The AI Mirror, a book about reclaiming human agency from algorithms. “Now, we have an era of innovation where the greatest opportunities the technology creates are for those already enjoying a disproportionate share of strengths and resources.”

Not only are the rich getting richer during the AI era, but many of the technology's harms are falling on people of color and other marginalized communities. “Data centers are being located in these really poor areas that tend to be more heavily Black and brown,” Hanna says. She points out how locals have not just been fighting back online, but have also been organizing even more in-person to protect their communities from environmental pollution. We saw this in Memphis, Tennessee, recently, where Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI is building a large data center with over 30 methane-gas-powered generators that are spewing harmful exhaust.

The impacts of generative AI on the workforce are another core issue that critics are organizing around. “Workers are more intuitive than a lot of the pundit class gives them credit for,” says Merchant. “They know this has been a naked attempt to get rid of people.” The next major shift in public opinion will likely follow previous patterns, occurring when broad swaths of workers feel further threatened and organize in response. And this time, the in-person protests may be just as big as the online backlash.

Not so long ago, direct aisle access along with the ability to lie horizontally were the hallmarks of comfort on airplanes if on entering you happened to be turning right and not left. Fast-forward a decade and the prevailing new high-water mark is now the private suite with sliding doors, expansive entertainment screens and even double beds.

Qatar Airways' Qsuite allows four passengers to dine together face-to-face, while Virgin Atlantic's Retreat Suite offers an oversized version of business class that aims to blur the line between where the suits sit and first. At the very front of the plane, showers and private bedrooms have raised the bar even further.

However, as airlines continue to compete on seclusion, space, and spec, the business appears to have flown itself into a dilemma: If square footage is the ultimate flying luxury, now we live in a world where your sky space can be more akin to a bijou hotel room, what happens when there's no more room left to give?

“Business class used to be all about hardware—the seat, the screen, the privacy door,” Nigel Goode, chairman of design studio PriestmanGoode, says, agreeing that the sky-high space race is coming to a close. “But now it's about human-centred design. The Qsuite that we originally developed for Qatar Airways broke the mold because it gives passengers so much more scope. They can sit as a four, they can be in a family, there's a double bed option. You can adapt your own privacy level.”

Airline cabins are becoming hybrid communal spaces where passengers can decide to be alone or interact with others—but now there's no more room to expand.

This shift is apparently redefining cabin formats around intent rather than hierarchy, and unlocking new revenue models for airlines. Key trends? Technology that supposedly can reflect passenger mood, hybrid layouts that balance solitude with sociability, and sustainability as status with lightweight materials that tell a carbon story. Nippon Airways, for example, has just announced ""THE Room FX"" cubicle coming in 2026 for business travelers that despite the extra kit involved in being a private cabin seat, the whole pod has a comparable weight to the current Boeing 787-9 business class seat.

But as the physical airplane seat is approaching its design limits, it looks like the airline business is being forced to bank on the next wave of upselling innovation being emotional, and so far more nebulous.

NewTerritory, a brand experience studio currently working with LATAM Airlines, over 12 months conducted more than 400 hours of behavioural research with five global airlines surveying 258 passengers. Its findings? Seventy-five percent of business class passengers polled said empathy—in how airlines address fatigue, jet lag and stress—is the strongest driver of loyalty. “Passengers want to feel like valued guests, not just ticket holders,” says founder Luke Miles. “Just as we expect comfort and care in a high-end hotel, travellers now expect the same in the sky.”

“The future of business class isn't about seats or service in isolation,” Miles says. “It's a composite, symphonic experience where every element—from preflight to landing—works in harmony to create something emotionally resonant and brand authentic.”

So in other words, as innovation in hardware levels out, brands are being forced to lean into hoping differentiation will come from journeys that feel personal, restorative, and intentional. This, however, is hardly groundbreaking thinking. The luxury world is awash with such watchwords.

And, according to Mariel Brown, director of foresight at design agency SeymourPowell, this next leap in air travel will be all about another overused luxury watchword: customization. “Luxury in 2035 won't be about square footage. The new differentiator will be control—the ability for passengers to tailor their environment effortlessly. From climate and lighting to when and how they eat or connect, seamless personalization will matter more than physical boundaries.” Well, as long as those physical boundaries still include a double bed and sliding doors.

Expect to see embedded, adaptive tech—smart armrests, modular wellness trays, mood-sensitive lighting—replacing one-size-fits-all features. “The magic is in the margins,” Brown says. “A light that softens as you close your eyes. A seat that remembers how you slept last time. These don't have to be expensive innovations, just well-considered ones.” Inexpensive innovations or not, if self-softening lights do start appearing on planes, they'll almost certainly be for the expensive seats, initially at least.

Qatar Airways' Qsuite broke new ground by allowing four passengers to dine together face-to-face.

Wellness is apparently becoming foundational to the premium cabin experience. Brown sees a future in biometric responsiveness—seats that passively monitor hydration and posture or adjust lighting to your circadian rhythm (Collins Aerospace has introduced its Hypergamut lighting system that purports to do just this.) “Designing with neurodivergent travellers and limited mobility in mind should be standard, not a bonus,” Brown says. “When that happens, everyone benefits.”

Goode cites the Finnair AirLounge—a business-class seat that his team developed with, again, Collins Aerospace—as a more lifestyle-led response. ""It's a nonmechanical seat, more like a sofa. Lighter, more flexible and built for movement. It reflects a domestic mindset, not just an aviation one.”

Of course, the problem for airlines is that innovation in this tightly regulated, risk-averse space isn't easy. “Airlines often have to offer the same thing—but just a bit better,” Goode says. But that hasn't stopped experimentation. PriestmanGoode's latest concept, Maya—developed with Collins Aerospace and Panasonic Avionics Corporation—features curved wraparound screens, 3D-knitted materials, and seats embedded with sound-absorption and haptic vibration. “Passengers won't just be watching entertainment,” Goode says. “They'll be interacting with their own micro-environment.”

So it seems set that because there's no more cabin floor space to conquer, the next game-changing business class features will not be bigger berths or screens. Not onboard bars. Not mood lighting. The airline industry is banking on a technological leap that will yield cabins that learn, adapt, and respond. Where personalization is functional, not performative. Where the best tech is hidden, not on display. And where luxury is measured not just in inches, but in the degree of emotional impact the airline can impart as you favorite those movie choices and peruse the wine list.

But until we get to a reality where your lie-flat pod knows who you are as you approach the single-digit seats, here is a rundown of what the major airlines have planned for pimping their plane service in 2025.

Debuting in May 2025, United's eight “VIP” Polaris Studio suites with 25 percent more space than a standard Polaris seat are located at the front of each business class cabin. With 27-inch 4K OLED screens (up from 19 inches), privacy doors, companion ottomans, and high-speed Starlink Wi-Fi, the new studios have been designed to try and cater for both work and downtime. There's also a new caviar service and a retro-style sundae cart with Tillamook flavours elevate the onboard experience.

United Airlines' new “VIP” suites—caviar service and a retro-style sundae cart not pictured.

From July this year, Air France will be rolling out new Sofitel MY BED mattress pads from the French hotel brand. The newest iteration of the airline's business class seats are upholstered in natural wool and full-grain French leather (for a more organic sensory feel, apparently.) On the culinary front, triple Michelin-starred chef Régis Marcon and pastry chef Nina Métayer have drawn up a menu of dishes inspired by the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region (think Royale of salmon and prawns in a ""tangy sauce"" with snow peas and yellow carrots.)

Air France has turned to Sofitel hotels to get their seat mattresses worthy of return flights.

Launching on Boeing 777-9 aircraft this year, the Qsuite Next Gen features nearly 4.75-foot suite walls and sliding doors—among the tallest in the sky. Passengers can opt to sit in a quad layout around a shared table or convert two central seats into a double bed. Qsuite passengers also get manoeuvrable 4K OLED HDR 10+ Panasonic Astrova screens (a world-first, apparently) and PIN-lockable storage for valuables, these suites marry innovation with intimacy.

Qatar's Qsuite Next Gen pods feature world-first 4K OLED HDR 10+ Panasonic Astrova screens.

Set to take off by the end of 2025, this new Saudi airline benefits heavily from generous investment from the country's sovereign wealth fund. With no expense spared, the cabin itself has been designed by British firm PriestmanGoode. Business class seats are Safran's Unity model, and have integrated Devialet speakers in the headrest so travellers don't need to wear headphones. At the front of the cabin, four Business Elite suites come with 32-inch 4K OLED screens (10 inches bigger than in the rest of business class), and can also be made up as double beds for couples.

Riyadh Air's business class seats boast integrated Devialet speakers in the headrest so travellers don't need to wear headphones.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The World Is Producing More Food than Ever—but Not for Long","https://www.wired.com/story/the-world-is-producing-more-food-than-ever-before-but-not-for-long/","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

This story originally appeared on Vox and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Globally, humanity is producing more food than ever, but that harvest is concentrated in just a handful of breadbaskets.

More than one-third of the world's wheat and barley exports come from Ukraine and Russia, for example. Some of these highly productive farmlands, including major crop-growing regions in the United States, are on track to see the sharpest drops in harvests due to climate change.

That's bad news not just for farmers, but also for everyone who eats—especially as it becomes harder and more expensive to feed a more crowded, hungrier world, according to a new study published in the journal Nature.

Under a moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario, six key staple crops will see an 11.2 percent decline by the end of the century compared to a world without warming, even as farmers try to adapt. And the largest drops aren't occurring in the poorer, more marginal farmlands, but in places that are already major food producers. These are regions like the US Midwest that have been blessed with good soil and ideal weather for raising staples like maize and soy.

But when that weather is less than ideal, it can drastically reduce agricultural productivity. Extreme weather has already begun to eat into harvests this year: Flooding has destroyed rice in Tajikistan, cucumbers in Spain, and bananas in Australia. Severe storms in the US this spring caused millions of dollars in damages to crops. In past years, severe heat has led to big declines in blueberries, olives, and grapes. And as the climate changes, rising average temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are poised to diminish yields, while weather events like droughts and floods reaching greater extremes could wipe out harvests more often.

“It's not a mystery that climate change will affect our food production,” said Andrew Hultgren, an agriculture researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. “That's the most weather-exposed sector in the economy.”

Farmers are doing what they can—testing different crop varieties that can better withstand changes in the climate, shifting the timing of when they sow, tweaking their use of fertilizers and water, and investing in infrastructure like water reservoirs.

The question is whether these adaptations can continue to keep pace with warming. To figure this out, Hultgren and his team looked at crop and weather data from 54 countries around the world dating back to the 1940s. They specifically looked at how farmers have adapted to changes in the climate that have already occurred, focusing on maize, wheat, rice, cassava, sorghum, and soybean. Combined, these crops provide two-thirds of humanity's calories.

In the Nature paper, Hultgren and his team reported that in general, adaptation can slow some crop losses due to climate change, but not all of them.

And the decrease in our food production could be devastating: For every degree Celsius of warming, global food production is likely to decline by 120 calories per person per day. That's even taking into account how climate change can make growing seasons longer and how more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can encourage plant growth. In the moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario—leading to between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100—rising incomes and adaptations would only offset one-third of crop losses around the world.

“Looking at that 3 degrees centigrade warmer [than the year 2000] future corresponds to about a 13 percent loss in daily recommended per capita caloric consumption,” Hultgren said. “That's like everyone giving up breakfast … about 360 calories for each person, for each day.”

The researchers also mapped out where the biggest crop declines—and increases—are likely to occur as the climate warms. As the world's most productive farmlands get hit hard, cooler countries like Russia and Canada are on track for larger harvests. The map below shows in red where crop yields are poised to shrink and in blue where they may expand:

Some of the biggest crop-growing regions in the world are likely to experience the largest declines in yield as the climate changes.

The results complicate the assumption that poor countries will directly bear the largest losses in food production due to climate change. The wealthy, large-scale food growers may see the biggest drop-offs, according to the study. However, poor countries will still be affected, since many crops are internationally traded commodities, and the biggest producers are exporters. A smaller harvest means higher food prices around the world. Less wealthy regions are also facing their own crop declines from disasters and climate change, though at smaller scales. All the while, the global population is rising, albeit much more slowly than in the past. It's a recipe for more food insecurity for more people.

Rice is an exception to this trend. Its overall yields are actually likely to increase in a warmer world: Rice is a versatile crop, and unlike the other staples, it benefits from higher nighttime temperatures. “Rice turns out to be the most flexibly adapted crop and largely through adaptations protected from large losses under even a high warming future,” Hultgren said. That's a boon for regions like South and Southeast Asia.

Decreasing the available calories isn't the only way climate change is altering food, however. The nutrition content can change with shifts in rainfall and temperature too, though Hultgren and his colleagues didn't account for this in their study. Scientists have previously documented how higher levels of carbon dioxide can cause crops like rice to have lower levels of iron, zinc, and B vitamins. So the food we will be eating in the future may be more scarce and less nutritious as well.

And while climate change can impair our food supply, the way we make food in turn harms the climate. About one-third of humanity's greenhouse gas emissions stem from food production, just under half of that from meat and dairy. That's why food production has to be a major front in how we adapt to climate change, and reduce rising temperatures overall.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Here's the Biggest Benefit of Buying a Mattress Online","https://www.wired.com/story/online-vs-store-mattress-shopping/","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 12:08:00 GMT","

All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.

You can buy pretty much anything online these days, even mattresses. But mattress stores still exist, and there are reasons to prefer in-person shopping for a product you'll spend roughly a third of your life on. The reasons to shop either online or in person are mostly obvious. What you might not have considered, however, are the fine-print details on warranty coverage that may skew you one way or the other. Saatva is a brand that sells both online and in its viewing rooms across the country, so I asked Michael Gale, a VP who leads retail at Saatva, to shed some light on the pros (and cons) of both mattress-buying approaches.

For my fellow homebodies, online mattress shopping is very appealing. When my social battery is out, it's gone, and I'll take any opportunity to not deal with salespeople. Plus, there's no need to leave my house and battle traffic or find a parking spot. With the advent of roller-packed bed-in-a-box mattresses that can be delivered to your house by FedEx and unfurled in your bedroom, you don't even have to schedule delivery or clean up your living room.

In addition to avoiding the pressure or a salesperson, there are a lot of additional benefits to buying online. You can often find a better deal because you're not underwriting retail space or paying a salesperson's salary. Additionally, most online sellers include a guaranteed sleep trial, and depending on the brand, extras like white glove delivery or free pillows with purchase. Some our our favorite mattress brands are only available online.

Probably because shoppers are generally leery of making a major financial commitment to a product they haven't personally touched, almost all online mattress sellers offer a sleep trial period and warranty. “Sleep trial” periods refer to the amount of time you can sleep on it and determine if it's a good fit for you. Most sellers give you between 90 days and a year to decide the purchase wasn't right for you and get a refund. But here's where the fine print starts to kick in.

Many brands will not let you initiate a return until 30 nights have passed. The reasoning is that this “break-in” period gives you enough time to get used to the feeling of your new bed. There are also limitations to how many returns you can do with a brand. Let's say the bed doesn't work out, and you opt to return and get a refund or replacement. You can usually only go that route once, as the company isn't going to let you trial-and-error its full repertoire of beds.

Next comes warranty coverage, or in the case of a faulty mattress, the kind of repair, refund, or replacement you're entitled to as part of the original purchase. Mattresses are going to break down over time and with use. But let's say you spot something going awry pretty quick off the bat, like memory foam weirdly sagging in some spots or cracking. This would fall under “material defect” and should be covered under warranty.

For stains, cracking, sagging, dents, or anything of that nature that happen over time, you're probably out of luck, as this is very much in the early-on sort of scenario. Similarly, let's say that the stitching of the cover comes undone or it's clear that the bed wasn't put together the way it should've been, as it's falling apart. This would be considered a “manufacturing defect” and also should be covered.

Here's one very important piece of information to keep in mind if you find yourself dealing with one of these two categories: Be ready to prove it. Outlined in the fine print, and depending on the brand, you may notice that customer service mentions that images showing defects on the mattress will be needed. Some may go so far as to confirm what kind of bed frame or base you have been using, because warranty coverage does not apply if the mattress slats are spaced too widely apart.

Always use your mattress properly. If there are signs you were using it as your own personal trampoline park, the warranty is most likely void.

Buying in person has its perks, too, and can't be written off completely. The biggest one? Some folks just prefer to lay eyes (and of course, their physical selves) on a bed before buying. That is totally understandable. You may also have the opportunity to negotiate your final price, and it'll likely go home with you that very day instead of taking a few days or even a week. Some companies will also offer sleep trials, like Mattress Firm. If you're going to shop in person, it's very important to consider the reputation of the company behind the brick-and-mortar location.

Plenty of online mattress brands, like Saatva and Casper, have their own storefront locations scattered across the contiguous United States. The beauty of having both an online and physical presence is that the deals can be lateral.

Saatva offers the same discounts online, in stores, and over the phone, so every customer gets the same price, says Gale. And there are often added discounts worth paying attention to: “At Saatva, for example, we offer special discounts to military veterans, teachers, health care workers, and other groups. You might want to ask whether you can get a bundled discount based on the products you're interested in, like a mattress and base combo or a mattress and bedding bundle.” You can also shop at opportune times, and Gale suggests key holidays like the Fourth of July, Labor Day, and Black Friday.

On the other hand, there are some brands that will put their merchandise in third-party storefronts. If you choose to go down the third-party route, make sure it is, in fact, partnered with the brand. Gale warns that unauthorized stores may sell mattresses with limited or no warranty coverage, which increases your risk if something goes wrong. This doesn't always mean that you are covered under the brand's warranty policy if you purchased from a partner store. Instead, you might have to rectify any issues like defects with the store itself. But sometimes, you are good to go. “Verified vendors also typically provide stronger customer support, more flexible return policies, and added transparency—sometimes even enhancing the manufacturer's warranty,” he says. To figure out which of these will be the case for you, read the mattress warranty and policy information thoroughly.

So if you take away nothing else from this, always, always read the fine print of a mattress warranty. It'll help you create a checklist of items to look for regarding the purchasing process. While this is additional work on top of figuring out the particular mattress you're homing in on, it really aims to provide you with peace of mind. But if you're looking for a helping hand, not to worry. Our team regularly tests out new beds—we spend at least a week sleeping on any mattress before recommending it—to scope out what's worth the coin.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is arguing that the digital identification approach being promoted by Sam Altman's World project has real privacy risks.

Previously known as Worldcoin, World was created under Altman and Alex Blania's Tools for Humanity. The organization says it can help distinguish between AI agents and human beings by scanning users' eyeballs and creating a unique identity for them on the blockchain.

In a lengthy post, Buterin noted that World's approach of using zero-knowledge proofs to verify human identity while protecting anonymity is also being explored by various digital passport and digital ID projects. And he acknowledged that “on the surface,” using a “ZK-wrapped digital ID” could contribute to “protecting our social media, voting, and all kinds of internet services against manipulation from sybils and bots, all without compromising on privacy.”

However, Buterin suggested that this approach still boils down to a “one-per-person” ID system, which creates significant risks.

“In the real world, pseudonymity generally requires having multiple accounts … so under one-per-person ID, even if ZK-wrapped, we risk coming closer to a world where all of your activity must de-facto be under a single public identity,” he wrote. “In a world of growing risk (eg. drones), taking away the option for people to protect themselves through pseudonymity has significant downsides.”

As a concrete example of the risks, Buterin noted that the U.S. government recently started requiring student and scholar visa applicants to set their social media accounts to public, so that it could screen those accounts for “hostility.” Similarly, he suggested that even if there's no public link between different accounts created under a single digital ID, “a government could force someone to reveal their secret, so that they can see their entire activity.”

How, then, can governments, online services, and anyone else hope to verify that someone's a real human being without forcing them to compromise their privacy? Buterin is advocating for an approach emphasizing “pluralistic identity,” in which “there is no single dominant issuing authority, whether that's a person, or an institution, or a platform.”

Pluralistic systems can either be “explicit” (they ask users to verify their identity based on testimonials from already-verified users) or “implicit” (relying on a variety of different identity systems) — in his view, these represent “the best realistic solution.”

“In my view, the ideal outcome of ‘one-per-person' identity projects that exist today is if they were to merge with social-graph-based identity,” Buterin concluded.

The FBI and cybersecurity firms are warning that the prolific hacking group known as Scattered Spider is now targeting airlines and the transportation sector.

In a brief statement on Friday shared with TechCrunch, the FBI said it had “recently observed” cyberattacks resembling Scattered Spider to include the airline sector. 

Executives from Google's cybersecurity unit Mandiant and Palo Alto Networks' security research division Unit 42 also said they have witnessed Scattered Spider cyberattacks targeting the aviation industry.

Scattered Spider is a collective of mostly English-speaking hackers, typically teenagers and young adults, who are financially motivated to steal and extort sensitive data from company networks. The hackers are also known for their deception tactics, which often rely on social engineering, phishing, and sometimes threats of violence toward company help desks and call centers to gain access to their networks, and sometimes deploy ransomware. 

The FBI's statement added that the hackers may target large corporations and their third-party IT providers, meaning “anyone in the airline ecosystem, including trusted vendors and contractors, could be at risk.”

The warning comes as at least two airlines have reported intrusions this month. 

Hawaiian Airlines said late Thursday that it was working to secure its systems following a cyberattack. Canada's second largest airline, WestJet, reported a cyberattack on June 13 that remains ongoing and unresolved. Media reports have linked the WestJet incident to Scattered Spider.

This fresh wave of Scattered Spider attacks comes soon after the cybercriminal gang targeted the U.K. retail sector and the insurance industry. The hackers have previously broken into hotel chains, casinos, and technology giants. 

Updated with an additional statement from the FBI.

A scan of jobs listed by Millennium, a rival fund that has recently clashed with Jane Street in court, shows the strength of the latter's position in the job market. Millennium wants engineers experienced in c++, Go, Java and Python, languages that are commonly used across finance and tech. OCaml developers, it seems, are Jane Street's to keep.If someone worked with OCaml at Jane Street I would just take this as a signal that they are smart enough to quickly learn Go, Python, whatever they need, and will probably be more successful after 6 months than a “Python developer” would be.

The thing is, global warming is making UK agriculture more productive, but government policies are hostile to agriculture, obsessed as they are with finance and what Dan Wang dismissively calls the ""sounding smart industries"" like media, which are going to be hit by GenAI like a freight train. The country also needs to get a grip on its water supplies, something that takes long-term investment over decades. The current government is loth to take action against water utilities that were privatized by Thatcher and continuing to be looted by their hedge-fund investors.Similarly the EU's Common Agricultural Policy was originally a subsidies program for French and Italian farmers. It is long past time for it to be reoriented towards food security. The massive food surpluses like the mountains of EEC butter of my childhood are a distant memory now.

Another solution is to increase the sources of funding. For example, in the United States, your Social Security contributions are capped once your income exceeds approximately $160,000. Eliminate that cap, and include income from other sources (i.e., taxes on estates, capital gains, and buy-borrow-die) in the Social Security tax calculation.

The main problem isn't reservoir levels, however, as most agriculture in Iberia doesn't use reservoir water, rather, on-site boreholes - and the groundwater is getting seriously depleted.There's a whole bunch of stuff that folks do here that doesn't help matters, however - olive groves and other arboriculture, which is a large part of agriculture in Iberia, are kept with bare topsoil, as the belief is that the grass steals the water, and irrigation is done with broadcast rather than drip, and it all evaporates almost as fast as they can spray it. We don't plough or irrigate ours, and we get a crop - we just cut the grass at the end of spring to reduce the fire hazard. There's also a tragedy of the commons affair going on, where people pump as much as possible from their boreholes in the spring to keep in open black plastic lined storage ponds, because they feel that if they don't their neighbour will get the water and there won't be any for them - so water which would have been safely stored underground is brought to the surface and put in perfect conditions to evaporate.None of it is sustainable, and it's going to end in tears.

For the last several years, most of us thinking about buying a handheld PC have heard the refrain “just get a Steam Deck.” The reasons are two-fold: one, the OLED version at $550 is the cheapest of its class, and two, it's so damned easy to use thanks to SteamOS. No other company has come close to offering similar bang for the buck—until now.

At $600, Lenovo's Legion Go S with SteamOS is a superior handheld for on-the-go gaming compared to the Windows version released earlier this year, which felt compromised because of Microsoft's desktop operating system. Lenovo also sells an $830 model with a better chip that may seem more enticing, but as you'll see in this review, you shouldn't feel bad about choosing to go cheaper.

Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS

The Lenovo Legion Go S is the only other handheld that comes with SteamOS out of the box, and it's so much better for it.

Pros

Cons

The Legion Go S is a side-grade from the Lenovo Legion Go from 2023. It still has an 8-inch display, but it's a single-body design that doesn't sport the Legion Go's two detachable controllers ala the Nintendo Switch 2. As comfortable as the earlier Legion Go S was, Windows combined with poor performance drastically hampered what it could be. I could tell from the jump that, at $730, the Windows version was relatively overpriced and underpowered—a real “just get a Steam Deck” system. The new version is cheaper and comes with SteamOS, the same small screen-friendly Linux-based operating system made by Valve. I tested the $600 Legion Go S with SteamOS in a beautiful deep “nebula nocturne” purple color that reminds me of the goth kid I wish I was in high school. It comes with a Ryzen Z2 Go processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. That's $50 more than a Steam Deck OLED with the same 512 GB storage capacity. Valve's $400 Steam Deck LCD is the cheapest of its kind, though it comes with only 256GB of storage.

The more powerful Legion Go S with SteamOS, powered by an AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor and 32GB of LPDDR5X-6400 RAM, is close to what you might pay for an Asus ROG Ally X, which boasts a better battery life though slightly worse ergonomics. I have not tested this model, though.

For shits and giggles, I grabbed the $730 white Windows-powered Legion Go S sent to me earlier this year and installed SteamOS on it to see what happens when you add more RAM to the mix, but I didn't experience a significant jump in performance between games. The Ryzen Z2 Go is the lower-power APU, or “accelerated processing unit,” designed specifically for the cheaper-end Legion Go S models. Both the Ryzen Z1 Extreme and Z2 Go are a type of processor that combines the capabilities of a CPU and a GPU, or graphics processor. The Z2 Go is running on AMD's older Zen 3+ microarchitecture and has half the number of cores as the Z1 Extreme running on Zen 4.

Either way, all Legion Go S models share the same IPS LCD display with a max resolution of 1,920×1,200. It doesn't support the deep blacks and contrast of the OLED panel on a Steam Deck, but it's still bright enough for playing indoors or outside. The larger display resolution can eat into performance with fewer GPU cores and less RAM. Few gamers want to drop their resolution specs lower than their display's max for the sake of performance, so the juggling act of in-game performance settings becomes that much more finicky. The important thing is whether the device can achieve a happy medium between playable frame rates and pretty graphics. In my experience, the Z2 Go with SteamOS can achieve a good equilibrium to play some intensive games, and it's so much better thanks to the Valve-made operating system.

I conducted multiple rounds of tests with each Legion Go S plugged in and running at 30W. I set games to the max resolution they could. Both devices can hit 40W of TDP, aka thermal design power, which provides more power to the chip to help them eke out more frames from each game. Still, you likely won't play with higher power unless you plan to keep close to an electrical outlet. Overall, the Legion Go S with a Z2 Go outperformed the same hardware with Windows. Across games like Control and Baldur's Gate III, I saw a performance increase of close to 10 fps after I installed SteamOS. Cyberpunk 2077 at 1200p went from hitting 27 fps in benchmarks to netting nearly 40 fps. Windows introduces a host of background tasks that slow down performance, whereas svelte SteamOS doesn't have that problem.

Comparing the Legion Go S to the Steam Deck's custom AMD APU, Lenovo's SteamOS-powered device has an easy edge thanks to its wider range of TDP beyond the max 15W on Valve's device. With the higher degree of versatility, I could hit the same frame rates at 1200p versus 800p on the Steam Deck across several games, whether they were older, less intensive titles like Weird West or Hades II. In Monster Hunter Wilds benchmarks, the Legion Go S with Z2 Go at 1200p and 30 TDP managed to top the Steam Deck at 800p by a few frames. Of course, doubling the wattage will also affect battery life. If you want to play your games at their best, at the max resolution and graphics setting the system can handle, you'll get less than two hours of playtime. That's not much less than a Steam Deck at half the TDP, but the end result is that you'll need to have a charger handy or else limit your play sessions.

SteamOS offers better frame rates than Windows, and if that wasn't enough, it's so much easier to use. Games are easier to download and faster to load, especially when they're built for Steam Deck and limit the number of extra launchers you need to click through. Unfortunately, the experience between playing on Steam Deck and SteamOS on third-party devices is not one-to-one. The big difference is how Valve calculates whether a game is “SteamOS Compatible” versus “Steam Deck Verified.” While Valve will determine whether a game can run at playable frame rates on a Steam Deck, it will only label whether a game is technically compatible on the Legion Go S. That means you may install a game expecting it to run well but find you can't even control it with thumbsticks.

I managed to install my go-to apps on Steam Deck to the Legion Go S. This included Decky Loader for plugins like Junk Store, which offers easier access to my Epic Games library than going through the trouble of installing Heroic Launcher. I also managed to get EmuDeck operational, which means I could port all my retro games to the new system without any fuss. Did I miss access to apps like Razer Cortex as my preferred way to do PC-to-handheld streaming? Yes, but I would trade access to every Windows app for a clean UI without a second thought. When I'm not worried about popups asking me to sign in to OneDrive or dreading what will happen when I dare put the device to sleep while in-game, I can instead focus on playing my games at their best.

In every way, the Legion Go S can become a Steam Deck, but there are still some major considerations if you're trying to decide between the two. For one, the Steam Deck OLED is lighter at 640g, or 1.41 pounds, versus Lenovo's 740g, or 1.6 pounds. That doesn't sound like much until you're feeling the strain in your arms after an extended play session sprawled out on your bed. The Legion Go S has slightly better ergonomics, but either device conforms to the hands better than most other similar devices on the market. What is missing from Lenovo's design are the Steam Deck's two trackpads. Those haptic trackpads add a surprising amount of versatility in some games, especially in CRPGs or strategy games like Tactical Breach Wizards. The minuscule trackpad on the Legion Go S didn't even seem to work out of the box. I had such a bad experience with it on the Windows version—with it vibrating like a rabbit dipped into a freezing-cold lake—I wasn't keen to fix it.

I would also give the edge in audio quality to the Steam Deck for clear sound, but the Legion Go S' twin 2W speakers offer enough clarity that I didn't immediately feel the need to reach for a pair of headphones. I did experience odd audio bugs with my review unit that led to crackling when in-game, though it was inconsistent, and it wasn't present on the older model even after I installed SteamOS. The real distinction between Lenovo's and Valve's handhelds is the screen. You get close to 8 inches of real estate on the Legion Go S and a higher max resolution, but it's still LCD. If I have both screens sitting side-by-side, I can't help but gravitate toward the device with better contrast and those ever-touted “inky” blacks.

So the Legion Go S is currently your only out-of-the-box Steam Deck alternative, and that alone makes it worth your time, especially if you don't feel like loading an OS other than Windows. That being said, this year's future slate of handhelds is getting more interesting. We've yet to see any devices launch with AMD's Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, but we know they're coming from companies like MSI, Asus, and Lenovo themselves. The other big consideration is how Microsoft can finally make its OS workable on a 7-inch display with the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally. That upcoming handheld will potentially mark a turning point with Windows gaming, not just in performance but overall usability. If you want a handheld now, go with either the Legion Go S or Steam Deck. Either would serve you well. If you're still on the fence, you should wait to see what the future holds.

Astronomers usually keep their eyes on the sky, but on Monday, June 23, the community turned its attention toward Washington, D.C., as scientists from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory unveiled the telescope's first images. Many have waited more than 20 years to see Rubin in action, and its initial findings did not disappoint.

Rubin, a joint initiative of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science, recently conducted its first 10 hours of test observations. In just that short period, the observatory produced dazzling images and discovered more than 2,000 previously unknown asteroids, including seven near-Earth asteroids. None of them pose a threat to our planet, but through this wealth of new data, the observatory has already proved to be a game changer for asteroid hunters working on planetary defense. By conducting unprecedentedly fast and detailed surveys of the entire southern sky, Rubin will allow scientists to find and track more space rocks than ever before.

“As this camera system was being designed, we all knew it was going to be breathtaking in what it delivered, but this has exceeded all our expectations,” Richard Binzel, a professor of planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and inventor of the Torino Scale—a tool for categorizing potential Earth impact events—told Gizmodo.

Data on those 2,000 new asteroids went directly to the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center (MPC), the globally recognized organization responsible for cataloging and disseminating data on asteroids, comets, and other small celestial bodies. It plays an essential role in the early detection and monitoring of asteroids that threaten Earth. The MPC has spent years preparing for the deluge of data from Rubin, ramping up its software to process massive amounts of observations. When the first round officially came flooding in on Monday, it was “nerve-racking and exciting simultaneously,” Matthew Payne, MPC director, told Gizmodo.

This was just a taste of what's to come. In a few months, Rubin will begin the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), a decade-long, near-continuous survey of the southern sky. This will produce an ultrawide, ultra-high-definition time-lapse record of the universe. In terms of asteroids, that means the MPC will receive about 250 million observations per year from LSST, according to Payne. “For us, that's a game changer in the total amount of data that we're getting, because at the moment we get somewhere in the region of 50 to 60 million a year,” he said.

Rubin's remarkable abilities stem from its remarkable instruments. Equipped with a unique three-mirror telescope design and the largest digital camera ever built, this observatory can conduct all-sky surveys while still detecting very faint objects like asteroids. This bridges a key gap between existing technologies, Payne explained.

When hunting space rocks, “you need to go as deep as possible,” Peter Veres, an MPC astrophysicist, told Gizmodo. “That's what the LSST does, and none of the survey telescopes in the world that aim at planetary defense do that.” During this 10-year survey, Rubin will observe the cosmos on an automated schedule using its 27.6-foot (8.4-meter) Simonyi Survey telescope. Each 30-second exposure will cover an area about 45 times the size of the full Moon. Then, the enormous LSST camera will capture wide-field images and stitch them together to create a complete view of the southern sky every three nights. The combination of Rubin's huge field of view, short exposure time, and its ability to rapidly sweep the sky will yield an avalanche of asteroid discoveries, Veres explained.

In 2005, Congress ordered NASA to build a near-Earth object (NEO) survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of all near-Earth asteroids and comets at least 328 feet (100 meters) in diameter. If one of these objects struck our planet, it would cause mass destruction that would decimate life on a continental scale, Payne said. The goal was to find 90% of them by 2020, but current estimates show NASA has only found about 40%, he explained. LSST could help NASA pick up the pace. “It's just going to start revolutionizing our understanding of this population of things,” Payne said.

Binzel agrees. “Those objects are out there, whether we see them or not,” he said. “Now we're going to see them, and we'll be able to determine that most—if not all of them—are going to safely pass by the Earth in the coming decades. But the best news is if an object has our name on it already, we will be able to find it most likely many, many years—if not decades—before it would come toward Earth.”

In theory, that would give NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDOC) time to launch a mission to intercept the asteroid. PDOC is still developing this capability, but in 2022, it launched the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, which sent a spacecraft on a 10-month-long journey to collide with the asteroid moonlet Dimorphos. The collision successfully changed Dimorphos' orbital path, demonstrating NASA's ability to deflect a large asteroid away from Earth if given enough time.

Given Rubin's clear potential to revolutionize planetary defense efforts—and the global attention it has received—one would expect NASA to be singing its praises. That has not been the case. The agency has kept strangely quiet about the observatory's launch—and in fact, it appears to be ignoring Rubin's first discoveries altogether.

“It's a warp drive version of finding asteroids,” Keith Cowing, an astrobiologist and former NASA employee who now serves as editor of NASA Watch, told Gizmodo. “You'd think that the planetary defense people would be in the front row cheering it on, saying, ‘send me the data!'”

NASA did not share any public information about Monday's event and has not promoted the observatory's findings. When Gizmodo reached out for comment on Rubin's contributions to planetary science and defense, NASA declined and recommended reaching out to the observatory instead.

On Tuesday, June 24, the agency's Office of the Inspector General published a report on the implementation and management of NASA's planetary defense strategy. The report only briefly mentions Rubin alongside NASA's forthcoming NEO Surveyor, a space telescope designed to find asteroids that could hit Earth. “These new observatories are expected to find and track significantly more NEOs than current capabilities, which will likely mean a substantial increase in necessary follow-up observations,” the report states.

NASA's PDCO and its planetary science program will undoubtedly use data gathered by the LSST, so what's with the cold shoulder? Cowing thinks it's a symptom of the agency's inner turmoil. “They're jittery at NASA,” he said. “Their budgets are being cut from all sides—they don't know what the final budget will be, but the White House wants to slash it—and they're having to react to this with whatever is at hand.”

Indeed, President Donald Trump's 2026 budget proposal would cut NASA's science funding by a whopping 47%, potentially killing more than 40 missions, according to The Planetary Society. “The only good news is what didn't get shot,” Cowing said.

He suspects that most NASA employees—including planetary defense personnel—are in survival mode. “What do you do when you simply don't know if you'll have a job, if the person next to you will have a job, or if you're gonna need to compete for the same job?” Cowing asked. “That's what's at the heart of this. It's just this general malaise and fear, and people are simply not doing the routine, professional, collaborative, collegial work that they would do across agencies and countries.”

As NASA science crumbles, it's unclear whether the agency will have the resources and personnel to take full advantage of Rubin's data. Though the PDCO currently leads the world's planetary defense efforts, that could soon change. Binzel, however, is optimistic. “Great nations do great science,” he said. “I continue to have faith that our nation will continue to do great science.

Elon Musk's Tesla has dropped a 30-minute video designed to electrify fans and stir debate. Posted on June 28, the clip shows what Musk claims is a historic milestone: the first Tesla Model Y to drive itself from factory to customer home, without a person inside, and without remote operation.

“The first fully autonomous delivery of a Tesla Model Y from factory to a customer home across town, including highways, was just completed a day ahead of schedule!!” Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter) on June 27.

The Model Y, the world's best-selling vehicle, navigates parking lots, highways, intersections, and city streets, following traffic signals and stopping for pedestrians. The destination? A very happy owner's home about 30 minutes away from Tesla's Austin Gigafactory.

Come hang out with us & Model Y for 30 mins

Full drive in 1x speed below https://t.co/lcClc85Hsn pic.twitter.com/3Ki7StYhsA

— Tesla (@Tesla) June 28, 2025



Musk didn't hold back: “There were no people in the car at all and no remote operators in control at any point. FULLY autonomous!” He continued: “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully autonomous drive with no people in the car or remotely operating the car on a public highway.”

There were no people in the car at all and no remote operators in control at any point. FULLY autonomous!

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully autonomous drive with no people in the car or remotely operating the car on a public highway.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 27, 2025



 

Fans on X were ecstatic. “Thank you for changing the world and how we function” wrote one.

Thank you for changing the world and how we function — truly phenomenal to witness history being made. Just curious: if Tesla now has the tech where a car can drive itself fully autonomously from factory to a customer's home across the city (even on highways!), could you help us…

“Fantastic to see this happening,” said another.

Fantastic to see this happening and just shy of the 5th anniversary of the start of construction of Giga Texas! Historic!

It's the kind of video that makes you believe the future has finally arrived. But this is Elon Musk and Tesla we're talking about—a company with a long history of over-promising and under-delivering on self-driving technology. To understand what's really going on, you need to understand the high-stakes, multi-billion-dollar race to build a truly autonomous car.

At the heart of the self-driving race are two fundamentally different philosophies.

On one side, you have Tesla. Its “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) system relies almost exclusively on cameras and AI. The approach, known as “Tesla Vision,” argues that if humans can drive with just two eyes, a car should be able to do the same with eight cameras providing a 360-degree view. The car's computer “sees” the world and makes decisions based on an immense amount of video data it has been trained on. It's a visually impressive and lower-cost approach, as it avoids expensive hardware.

On the other side, you have companies like Waymo (owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet). Waymo's system also uses cameras and radar, but its key sensor is LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). LiDAR units spin around, shooting out millions of laser beams per second to create a hyper-accurate, real-time 3D map of the car's surroundings. This gives the car a superhuman ability to “see” distances, shapes, and objects with precise detail, day or night. It's more expensive but is widely considered by many in the industry to be a more robust and redundant system.

The stakes are colossal: the company that cracks true, Level 5 autonomy—where a car can drive itself anywhere, anytime, without any human intervention—will not just dominate the auto industry, but will also revolutionize logistics, transportation, and urban life.

With that background, let's look at Tesla's video again. The Model Y impressively handles various real-world scenarios. But Musk's claims of a historic first are, characteristically, exaggerated. A few days ago, on June 22, Tesla launched a very limited version of its robotaxi service in Austin. Not only did it involve a small number of cars and hand-picked customers, but every vehicle had a human supervisor in the passenger seat and was restricted to a “geofenced” (geographically limited) area.

Furthermore, Musk's claim that this is the “first fully autonomous drive with no people in the car… on a public highway” is demonstrably false. Waymo already offers driverless rides that include highway travel to its employees in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. While not yet available to the public, the capability has been operational for some time. The key difference is that Waymo has spent years collecting data and validating its safety in these areas with its LiDAR-equipped fleet, while Tesla seems to be rushing to create a public perception of leadership.

This Tesla video is a PR win. But given Musk's track record, a healthy dose of skepticism is warranted. It's highly probable this specific 30-minute route was meticulously mapped and tested by Tesla under ideal conditions to ensure a flawless performance for the video. The real test of autonomy isn't whether a car can complete one perfect, pre-planned trip; it's whether it can handle thousands of unpredictable trips, safely, over millions of miles.

The most telling question remains: If Tesla's system is truly “fully autonomous” as claimed in this video, why do its commercial robotaxis still require a human supervisor?

Musk is a brilliant salesman, and this video is his latest, most compelling ad. It sells a vision of the future that is tantalizingly close. But as we've seen time and again, with Tesla, the gap between a promotional video and everyday reality can be vast. Until these cars are navigating countless cities without a human safety net, this “historic” first is little more than a brilliant, but likely brittle, piece of marketing.

CPUs with parts fabricated in space may be coming soon, assuming the ForgeStar-1 experiment succeeds

Manufacturing advanced computer components of the future may take place in space rather than on Earth. Space Forge, a UK-based startup, had its ForgeStar-1 satellite launched into orbit via SpaceX, paving the way for the satellite to ignite its forge and begin producing semiconductors in space.

ForgeStar-1 is officially the UK's first ever in-space manufacturing satellite, enabling the company to build semiconductors in space. The satellite was entirely designed and built in Cardiff, Wales, and launched into space as part of SpaceX's Transporter-14 rideshare mission. The satellite waited for approvals in the United States since April before finally entering orbit today.

ForgeStar-1 has yet to ignite its forge, with the timetable for when this will happen not yet public. ""We've built and launched Britain's first manufacturing satellite, and it's alive in orbit. That's a massive technical achievement,"" shared Space Forge CEO Joshua Western. ""Now, we take the next step: proving that we can create the right environment for manufacturing in space. This is the start of a new era for materials science and industrial capability.""

In-space manufacturing is a relatively new field that seeks to utilize the unique characteristics of outer space and/or low-Earth orbit to achieve fabrication methods not possible on Earth. Space Forge's primary goals are to produce semiconductors for data center, quantum, and military use cases, using ""space-derived crystal seeds"" to initiate semiconductor growth, utilizing unlimited vacuum and subzero temperatures for manufacturing, and then returning the chips to Earth for packaging.

The ForgeStar-1 satellite will not bring the cargo it manufactures back to Earth at the completion of its mission. Acting more as a proof-of-concept and prototype for a litany of technologies engineered by Space Forge, the satellite will be tasked with running through the successful application of key technologies for in-space manufacturing, and will end its mission with a spectacular fireball.

Space Forge plans to test both the best-case and worst-case scenarios for the satellite's recovery. First, it will deploy its proprietary Pridwen heat shield and on-orbit controls to steer the satellite, and then test its failsafe mechanism, which involves disintegrating the craft in orbit.

The company's roadmap from 2022 shows that ForgeStar-1's successor, ForgeStar-2, will be the first craft from the company to develop semiconductors that will be returned safely to Earth. The craft will develop enough chips so that the ""value of the material manufactured in space exceeds the cost of placing the satellite into orbit"", and will be joined eventually by a full stable of Space Forge satellites. The company eventually hopes to build 10-12 satellites per year, reusing craft after the completion of their one- to six-month fabrication missions. Eventually, the company aims to surpass 100 satellite launches per year.

While the craft may not ever reach terra firma safely again, the prospect of space-based manufacturing is attractive for several reasons and to a variety of clients. Materials crucial to the bleeding-edge of semiconductor fabrication, including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC), can now be worked with to create new chips with the unlimited vacuum of space, in subzero temps without the need for cryogenics, and in a near-weightless environment. If in-space manufacturing catches on, it may become an interesting part of the semiconductor supply chain.

The new wave of Asus BTF 2.5 GPUs has arrived.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Asus has announced its newest GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5070 Ti under the BTF 2.5 branding, aiming to compete with the best graphics cards. The lineup includes the TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 BTF White Edition and the ROG Astral GeForce RTX 5090 32GB GDDR7 BTF Edition, along with their respective overclocked versions. BTF 2.5 graphics cards feature a removable GC-HPWR power connector rated for up to 1,000W.

Everyone appreciates a neat build. A few years ago, manufacturers became obsessed with concealing motherboard connectors and cables. Soon, each vendor developed its unique approach. For example, Asus has continually advanced its Back to the Future (BTF) standard. The newest version, BTF 2.5, introduces a key feature: the proprietary GC-HPWR power connector can now be removed when not in use.

Asus introduced the GC-HPWR power connector as an alternative to the 16-pin (12VHPWR) connector. The problem with the previous version was that the power connector couldn't be detached in earlier BTF revisions. This meant that when a consumer purchased into the BTF ecosystem, they had to buy a compatible Asus BTF motherboard and graphics card. With BTF 2.5, users can now remove the GC-HPWR power connector and use the graphics card on a standard motherboard, expanding their options for motherboard choice.

So far, Asus has only released four BTF 2.5 graphics cards: two from the TUF Gaming series and two from the higher-end ROG series. The overclocked versions feature modest factory boosts, increasing clock speeds by up to 6% over the standard models. This slight increase justifies a small price premium for these variants, such as the ROG Astral GeForce RTX 5090 32GB GDDR7 BTF OC Edition and TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 BTF White OC Edition.

The power requirements for Asus's BTF 2.5 graphics cards exhibit slight variations in comparison to the Founders Editions, attributable to factory overclocks. Consequently, Asus recommends a marginally higher minimum power supply capacity. The manufacturer advises consumers to utilize a 1,000W power supply unit for the ROG Astral GeForce RTX 5090 32GB GDDR7 BTF Edition and an 850W unit for the TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 BTF White Edition.

Asus tests have demonstrated the feasibility of powering a BTF 2.5 graphics card using both the 16-pin and GC-HPWR power connectors; however, the company advises that only one interface should be utilized. When not in use, the GC-HPWR power connector may be detached and properly stored utilizing the provided tool.

Although the GC-HPWR power connector seems like a good idea, some have questioned if it's safer than the traditional 16-pin power connector. The GC-HPWR power connector still draws power through a 16-pin power cable, but instead of connecting directly to the graphics card, the cable connects to the power connector on the back of the BTF motherboard. Only time will reveal whether Asus' GC-HPWR alternative proves more dependable than the 16-pin power connector.

Asus has previously announced plans to introduce its BTF graphics cards in the U.S. market, so the new BTF 2.5 models are expected to follow. Although the pricing for these models remains unknown, the inclusion of the GC-HPWR power connector suggests that the BTF 2.5 versions will likely be priced higher than the standard versions.

It's surprisingly cheap and cheerful.

Cheap, counterfeit hard drives have proliferated across the internet, with many customers falling victim, even on legitimate platforms like Amazon. We've seen this in action, such as an external drive claiming to have an NVMe SSD inside but actually containing only microSD cards. Even prominent brands like Seagate have been affected by scandals due to unofficial sellers selling used drives as new. Because of this, data recovery firm Secure Data Recovery has been testing affordable drives, says Ars Technica, and it came across a surprisingly affordable but legitimate item.

The UnionSine DataPocket 500GB 2.5-inch slim portable external hard drive is the item in question, which was priced at $28.28 on Amazon at the time of writing (although its regular price is $33.27). It's also available in other sizes, which are similarly priced attractively — 250GB for $25.49, 320GB for $22.94, 750GB for $39.89, 1TB for $47.38, and 2TB for $69.47. This puts its per GB dollar cost at about $0.03 to $0.10, unheard of pricing at these relatively small capacities. By comparison, Western Digital's My Passport costs $65.54 for the 1TB drive and $82.99 for the 2TB one — about 16% to 28% more than the competition.

When Secure Data Recovery tested the drive, the team was surprised to find that its read and write speeds worked as advertised. The Amazon page says that the UnionSine drive has a theoretical read speed of 110 MB/s to 133 MB/s and a write speed as high as 103 MB/s, and CrystalDiskInfo returned similar numbers. Inside the enclosure was a Toshiba MQ01ABD050V hard drive from 2016, meaning it was hosting a nine-year-old storage drive.

There's no proof that the drive was refurbished or brand new, especially as the company said that the drive's power-on hours information can be reset. But given that it's nearly a decade old, we cannot be sure how much longer it will last. There's an anecdotal report of a UnionSine external drive failing on Reddit, with the drive using a Western Digital one. Therefore, it is possible that the company is purchasing old and used drives, refurbishing them, and then selling them on Amazon and other platforms as external storage devices.

Despite those reports, one could say that you're getting a good value for the UnionSine hard drive, especially as it works as expected. It's probably an okay buy if you need something cheap and quick. But given the alleged age of the drives used in them, they're best avoided if you want a drive for long-term storage and archival purposes.

The WHO Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO), a panel of 27 independent, international, multidisciplinary experts, today published its report on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.

SAGO has advanced the understanding of the origins of COVID-19, but as they say in their report, much of the information needed to evaluate fully all hypotheses has not been provided.

I thank each of the 27 members of SAGO for dedicating their time and expertise to this very important scientific undertaking over more than three years. As things stand, all hypotheses must remain on the table, including zoonotic spillover and lab leak. We continue to appeal to China and any other country that has information about the origins of COVID-19 to share that information openly, in the interests of protecting the world from future pandemics.""

 Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General

In its report, SAGO considered available evidence for the main hypotheses for the origins of COVID-19 and concluded that ""the weight of available evidence…suggests zoonotic spillover…either directly from bats or through an intermediate host.""

WHO requested that China share hundreds of genetic sequences from individuals with COVID-19 early in the pandemic, more detailed information about the animals sold at markets in Wuhan, and information on work done and biosafety conditions at laboratories in Wuhan. To date, China has not shared this information either with SAGO or WHO.

SAGO published its initial findings and recommendations in a report on 9 June 2022. Today's report updates that evaluation based on peer-reviewed papers and reviews, as well as available unpublished information and field studies, interviews, and other reports including audit findings, government reports and intelligence reports. SAGO convened in various formats 52 times, conducted briefings with researchers, academics, journalists, and others.

""As the report says, this is not solely a scientific endeavor, it is a moral and ethical imperative,"" said Dr. Marietjie Venter, Chair of the group and Distinguished Professor and One Health Research Chair in Vaccines and Surveillance for Emerging viral threats at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. ""Understanding the origins of SARS-CoV-2 and how it sparked a pandemic is needed to help prevent future pandemics, save lives and livelihoods, and reduce global suffering.""

At a Special Session of the World Health Assembly in late 2020, WHO Member States adopted a resolution asking WHO to study the origins of SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, a joint mission between international and Chinese experts travelled to China in January and February 2021, and published their report in March of that year.

In July 2021, Dr Tedros launched SAGO with two mandates: first, to design a global framework to investigate the origins of emerging and re-emerging pathogens, which it published last year, and second, to apply that framework to evaluate scientific evidence to determine the origins of COVID-19.

The work to understand the origins of SARS-CoV-2 remains unfinished. WHO welcomes any further evidence on the origins of COVID-19, and SAGO remains committed to reviewing any new information should it become available.

Breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality due to its aggressive nature and limited therapeutic targets. Metabolic reprogramming, a hallmark of cancer, enables tumor cells to adapt to environmental stresses and fuel rapid proliferation. While the Warburg effect initially emphasized glycolysis, recent research highlights the critical role of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in cancer progression. Mitochondria, dynamic organelles regulated by fission, fusion, and mitophagy, are central to metabolic plasticity, supporting tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy resistance. This review explores the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics in breast cancer metastasis, their diagnostic and prognostic potential, and emerging therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.

Metabolic heterogeneity is a defining feature of breast cancer, with TNBC exhibiting heightened reliance on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and mitochondrial respiration to meet its energetic and biosynthetic demands. Key adaptations include:

Lipid metabolism: Elevated FASN (fatty acid synthase) and ATP citrate lyase drive de novo lipogenesis, supporting membrane biogenesis and signaling.

Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS): Despite glycolytic dominance in primary tumors, metastatic lesions show increased TCA cycle flux and ATP production, underscoring mitochondrial metabolic flexibility.

Metabolic shifts: Hypoxia and nutrient scarcity further rewire mitochondrial function, promoting survival and chemoresistance.

These adaptations highlight mitochondria as central hubs of metabolic reprogramming, offering vulnerabilities for therapeutic intervention.

Mitochondrial dynamics-governed by fission (Drp1, Fis1) and fusion (MFN1/2, OPA1) proteins-regulate cellular homeostasis and are dysregulated in cancer:

Fission: Promotes proliferation, stemness, and metastasis. Drp1 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and is linked to Notch1-mediated chemoresistance in TNBC.

Fusion: Enhances OXPHOS and mitigates ROS. MFN2-PKM2 interactions suppress glycolysis, while OPA1 inhibition reduces tumor aggressiveness.

Mitophagy: Balances quality control and survival. PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy eliminates damaged mitochondria, but its dual role-suppressing ROS or enabling stress adaptation-depends on context.

For example, BRCA1 deficiency disrupts mitophagy, elevating ROS and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which drives metastasis. Conversely, mitophagy induction by compounds like polyphyllin I or silibinin triggers apoptosis in TNBC.

Targeting mitochondrial dynamics shows promise in preclinical models:

Fission inhibition: Mdivi-1 (Drp1 inhibitor) and P110 peptide reduce metastasis and restore chemosensitivity.

Fusion promotion: Enhancing MFN2 activity suppresses glycolytic flux and tumor growth.

Mitophagy modulation: Compounds like warangalone and kaempferol induce lethal mitophagy, while others (e.g., cepharanthine) block pro-survival pathways.

Despite progress, challenges remain:

Heterogeneity: Mitochondrial adaptations vary by tumor subtype and stage, necessitating personalized approaches.

Drug resistance: Metabolic plasticity may undermine targeted therapies, requiring combinatorial strategies.

Translational gaps: Standardizing mitochondrial biomarkers (e.g., Drp1 levels) and improving drug delivery (e.g., nanoparticle carriers) are critical for clinical adoption.

Future research should integrate multi-omics to unravel metabolic-immune crosstalk and explore mitochondrial transplantation as a novel therapy.

Mitochondrial dynamics are pivotal in breast cancer metastasis, influencing metabolic flexibility, stemness, and therapy resistance. Targeting fission, fusion, and mitophagy offers a transformative approach to disrupt tumor adaptability. While challenges persist, advancing mitochondrial-directed therapies-combined with precision medicine tools-holds immense potential to improve outcomes for aggressive breast cancer subtypes.

A team of scientists at the MRC Laboratory of Medical Sciences (LMS) has uncovered a previously unknown mechanism that controls how genes are switched ‘on' and ‘off' during embryonic development. Published today in Developmental Cell, their study sheds light on how diverse cell types are produced in developing embryos.

The research was led by Dr. Irène Amblard and Dr. Vicki Metzis from the Development and Transcriptional Control group, in collaboration with LMS facilities and the Chromatin and Development and Computational Regulatory Genomics groups. 

All cells contain the same DNA but must turn specific genes 'on' and 'off' – a process known as gene expression – to create different body parts. The cells in your eyes and arms harbour the same genes but 'express' them differently to become each body part. The work focused on the gene Cdx2. The duration of Cdx2 expression helps to determine where and when a cell produces spinal cord progenitors. The researchers wanted to understand what processes control this brief window. 

The team discovered a DNA element they termed an 'attenuator', which reduces gene expression in a time and cell type-specific manner – unlike enhancers or silencers, other types of DNA elements that broadly switch genes on or off. By altering this element, they could tune how long or how strongly Cdx2 was expressed, effectively acting like a 'genetic dimmer switch'. Disrupting the 'switch' in mouse embryos also confirmed its essential role in shaping the developing body plan. 

This breakthrough paves the way towards programmable gene expression, offering the ability to precisely control gene activity in space and time. The findings not only deepen our understanding of developmental biology but may inform new therapeutic strategies targeting the non-coding genome. Such approaches could one day enable treatments that selectively adjust gene expression in specific tissues, with implications for diseases caused by gene misregulation. 

Vicki emphasized the potential: ""We're excited because previous research suggests that our genome may harbour many different types of elements that finely tune gene expression, but they've not been easy to identify. If we can address this challenge, this holds enormous potential for unlocking new ways to treat diseases by fine-tuning gene expression where and when it's needed."" 

The study, funded by Wellcome, with support from the Medical Research Council, adds to a growing body of work exploring how non-coding DNA governs gene regulation – an area with profound implications for medicine, from designing new gene therapies to improving treatments.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is known to be associated with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but how and why they are connected remains unknown. Researchers from Mass General Brigham discovered that HBV does not cause liver inflammation or cancer on its own, but worsens liver inflammation and may make patients more susceptible to early cancer development caused by environmental carcinogens. Limiting carcinogen exposure or reducing inflammation could mitigate this risk. The results are published in Nature Communications. 

Our research sheds light on the intricate interplay between HBV infection and carcinogen exposure to generate immune dysregulation in the liver that leads to cancer development. We propose the potential of combining statin therapy with conventional HBV treatments like entecavir to improve patient outcomes."" 

Shawn Demehri, MD, PhD, corresponding author of the Demehri Lab and Krantz Family Center for Cancer Research at Massachusetts General Hospital

Using a mouse model, the researchers found that HBV did not directly cause liver inflammation or cancer. However, when the HBV models were exposed to a carcinogen found in tobacco smoke, fried foods, processed meats, and alcoholic drinks, they developed an extreme liver cancer phenotype. This carcinogen, also known as diethylnitrosamine (DEN), caused an increase in interleukin-33 (IL-33), an inflammatory molecule, which is required for the development of liver cancer. The researchers then treated the models with pitavastatin, a statin drug, to suppress the expression of IL-33. This treatment was effective in reducing the risk of chronic hepatitis and liver cancer. 

The researchers then extended their findings into humans, finding higher levels of IL-33, especially in patients with HBV-associated hepatitis, compared to healthy controls. They then looked at data from more than 200 million patients, finding that the risk of hepatitis and liver cancer were significantly reduced in patients treated with a statin compared with those treated with another cholesterol-lowering drug.

Emergency department (ED) presentations are associated with higher cancer mortality. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, frequency, and risk factors in Australian patients diagnosed with malignant skin cancers.

This data-linkage cohort study examined adult patients presenting to the ED at the Royal Melbourne and Western Health hospitals within 12 months of a malignant skin cancer diagnosis. Multivariable logistic and Poisson regressions were used to analyze factors influencing the prevalence and frequency of ED presentations.

A total of 3,873 patients were diagnosed with skin malignancies between 2010 and 2018, of which 631 were diagnosed with melanoma. The prevalence of ED presentation was 29%, representing 2,119 episodes of care (median: 0; range: 0–14). Risk factors for a higher prevalence and frequency included: age ≥75 years (odds ratio (OR) = 1.78 [95% confidence interval 1.47–2.15]; incidence risk ratio (IRR) = 1.52 [1.35–1.70]); male (OR = 1.17 [1.01–1.36]; IRR = 1.23 [1.12–1.35]); socioeconomic status levels of 0–30% (OR = 1.59 [1.24–2.03]; IRR = 1.69 [1.45–1.96]) and 71–100% (OR = 1.30 [1.07–1.58]; IRR = 1.27 [1.12–1.45]); preferred language other than English (OR = 1.47 [1.17–1.84]; IRR = 1.49 [1.32–1.69]); and experience with any systemic therapy or radiotherapy (OR = 3.77 [2.12–6.71]; IRR = 2.36 [1.82–3.05]). Age < 65 years was protective (OR = 0.72 [0.59–0.89]; IRR = 0.78 [0.68–0.90]). Other preferred languages and cancer treatment experience were also risk factors in the sub-cohort with melanoma.

This study provides the first prevalence and frequency data on post-diagnosis ED presentations in patients with skin malignancies, including melanoma. Notably, male patients, those of older age, individuals with both lower and higher SES levels, those primarily speaking a language other than English, and those undergoing systemic therapy or radiotherapy, had a higher risk of ED presentation within 12 months after their skin cancer diagnosis.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Organ chip technology accurately predicts chemotherapy response in esophageal adenocarcinoma patients","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250627/Organ-chip-technology-accurately-predicts-chemotherapy-response-in-esophageal-adenocarcinoma-patients.aspx","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 01:53:00 GMT","

Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), one of two major forms of esophageal cancer, is the sixth most deadly cancer worldwide for which no effective targeted therapy exists. Patients need to rely on chemotherapy as a standard-of-care, which is started ahead of surgical interventions as a so-called ""neoadjuvant chemotherapy"" (NACT) in the hope to shrink or control tumors. However, most patients become resistant to certain NACTs, leading to poor outcomes.

Given the utter lack of therapeutic alternatives, responders and non-responders alike, continue to receive one of the available chemotherapies without knowing whether it will work. Even in responders, the chemotherapy of choice may not completely stop their tumors from progressing and metastasizing, and it can have toxic side effects on the body. The availability of a personalized, patient-specific precision oncology model that can accurately predict a patient's response to different NACTs in a timely manner is a critical unmet need.

Researchers had grown so-called ""organoids"" from biopsied EAC cells, which are 3D esophageal mini-organs formed with tissue-specific stem cells that exhibit critical features of the esophageal epithelial lining. However, these lack important components of a patient's specific tumor microenvironment (TME), such as the stromal fibroblasts and collagen fibers, and thus, they do not show the same responses to NACT as actual tumors.

Now, a research collaboration led by Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., Founding Director at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University and Lorenzo Ferri, M.D., who heads the Division of Thoracic and Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery at the McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, has advanced a personalized medicine solution with the potential to improve chemotherapy for EAC patients. 

The researchers leveraged the Wyss Institute's human Organ Chip microfluidic culture technology and used it to co-culture EAC organoids next to stromal cells isolated from the same biopsies that the McGill team obtained from EAC patients in a clinical cohort study to create patient-specific, TME-inclusive Cancer Chip models. By recapitulating some of the inherent TME complexity in vitro, the team was able to predict patients' tumor responses to the standard NACT much more accurately than more static, less complex 3D organoid models. Since the approach can produce results within 12 days from starting the model, it enables the rapid stratification of EAC patients into responders and non-responders, and investigation of non-standard NACTs based on different chemotherapy agents for resistant patients in a clinically useful timeframe. The findings are reported in Journal of Translational Medicine.

This patient-centered approach strongly builds on our previous successes using human Organ Chip technology to recapitulate each individual cancer patient's TME outside their body so that we can identify the drug combination that will work best for that very patient. This new way to approach personalized medicine could be implemented at clinical centers focusing on the care of patients suffering from many different types of cancer, such as the one run by our collaborators with patients who have esophageal cancer. Perhaps equally important, it can also be used as a pre-clinical testbed to break new ground in the development of tumor- or stroma-targeted therapies for cancer patients and enable the discovery of biomarkers that could be used to monitor and optimize drug effects in these patients.""

Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D., Founding Director at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University

 Ingber is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital and the Hansjörg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

Ingber's and Ferri's teams started to collaborate already in 2023 on an earlier study in which they modeled Barrett's esophagus in a microfluidic Organ Chip with vital support by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Cancer Research UK. Barrett's esophagus can be a malignant precursor of EAC, which is thought to be the result of a series of pathological changes that the epithelial lining of the lower esophagus is undergoing. These start with inflammation, which most commonly is induced by acid reflux, continue via the transformation of esophageal tissue into hyper-proliferating stomach and small intestine-like tissue (Barrett's esophagus), to ultimately lead to the conversion of these highly proliferating abnormal cells into cancer cells. Importantly, these malignant changes are not only driven by molecular and cellular processes in the esophagus' epithelial lining, but also in its underlying ""stroma,"" which is made up of fibroblast cells that communicate with the cancer cells through a constant exchange of molecules, and it also contains immune cells and blood vessels.

""Whereas in our earlier work, we faithfully recapitulated the earlier stages of the pathological process potentially leading to EAC, namely Barrett's esophagus, in our new study we fast-forwarded to its cancerous end result,"" said second-author Elee Shimshoni, Ph.D., who was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Ingber's team during both studies. ""Only by reconstituting key components of the TME and mimicking some of its fluid flows, which normally is provided by the fluid surrounding cells (interstitial fluid) and supporting blood vessels, were we able to achieve physiologically relevant drug exposure, and to accurately predict patient-specific responses to NACT in personalized EAC Chips. This could not be done using cancer organoids.""

The team engineered their TME-mimicking EAC Chip by first generating personalized EAC organoids from biopsies they endoscopically obtained from patient who were newly diagnosed with EAC but hadn't been treated yet. First-author Sanjima Pal, Ph.D. and other members in Ferri's team at the McGill University Health Care Centre where Ferri treats patients with esophageal cancer, had mastered the ability to create patient-matched esophageal organoids with high consistency. Next, the team removed the organoids from the culture dish, broke them up into their constituent cells, cultured the cells in one of two parallel-running channels of a microfluidic chip the size of a memory stick. and added tumor-associated fibroblasts from the same patients to the other channel to form an adjacent tumor stroma. Both channels are separated by a porous membrane, which allows the cancer and stromal tissues to freely exchange molecules as they would do in an actual tumor. Finally, the researchers spiked a docetaxel-based triplet chemotherapy cocktail into the nutrient fluids that flow through the stromal channel, using drug concentrations and exposure times that replicate a cycle of chemotherapy in EAC patients.

For a cohort of eight patients, all EAC Chips accurately predicted their responses to NACT within 12 days. In four of the chips, the chemotherapy caused the EAC cells to die, while in the other four chips, the EAC cells survived the chemotherapy. These results perfectly correlated with the patients' responses to the same chemotherapy and their survival rates following surgical resection of EAC tumors. 

Other authors on the study were Salvador Flores Torres, Mingyang Kong, Kulsum Tai, Veena Sangwan, Nicholas Bertos, Swneke Donovan Bailey, and Julie Bérubé. It was funded by a Cancer Research UK Grand Challenge STrOmal ReprograMing (STORMing Cancer) grant that enabled a consortium of researchers, including Ingber and Ferri, to focus on the role of stroma in the pathology of various diseases, as well as the Montreal General Hospital Foundation (LF), and an Impact Grant award from the Department of Defense-Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (Award # CA200572).

Gliomas are among the deadliest brain tumors, with limited treatment options and poor survival rates. Scientists from China identified FAM111B, a DNA-repair-associated protein, as a key driver of glioma progression. The study shows that FAM111B overexpression enhances tumor growth and aggressiveness by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. This is the first research to link FAM111B to gliomas, offering a promising new biomarker and therapeutic target for this intractable disease.

Gliomas are the most prevalent and aggressive form of primary brain tumors in adults, with dismal survival rates despite surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Scientists continue to search for molecular drivers that could serve as new therapeutic targets. Now, researchers led by Dr. Quan Du from Zhejiang Chinese Medical University and Westlake University in China have identified a promising candidate: a protein known as FAM111B.

""Our findings revealed that FAM111B affected glioma malignancy by modulating the PI3K/AKT pathway,"" highlights lead researcher Dr. Du. ""This presents a new potential avenue for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of glioma.""

The study, published on May 19 2025, in the Chinese Neurosurgical Journal, is the first to examine the role of FAM111B in gliomas. Prior research had linked FAM111B to cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and fibrosis-related diseases. However, its function in brain cancer was previously unknown.

Using genomic databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), the research team found that FAM111B expression is significantly elevated in glioma tissues compared to healthy brain tissue. Moreover, higher expression levels correlated with older patient age, more advanced tumor grade, and poorer clinical outcomes—including reduced overall survival and disease-free survival. The authors confirmed these findings experimentally. Glioma cell lines and tumor samples showed significantly higher levels of FAM111B protein compared to normal tissues. When FAM111B was overexpressed in glioma cells, their proliferation, invasion, and migration dramatically increased. Conversely, knocking down FAM111B suppressed these malignant traits.

Further, in vivo experiments using mice confirmed FAM111B's role in promoting tumor growth. Mice injected with glioma cells overexpressing FAM111B developed significantly larger and heavier tumors than controls.
To uncover the molecular mechanism behind these effects, the team conducted pathway enrichment analysis. Results pointed strongly to the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade—a pathway long associated with tumor growth and resistance to therapy. Further tests showed that FAM111B overexpression increased phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT, while silencing the protein had the opposite effect.

""FAM111B regulates glioma cell malignant features via the PI3K/AKT pathway,"" the Dr. Du wrote. ""These results support the hypothesis that FAM111B influences the malignant features of glioma cells primarily through the PI3K/AKT pathway.""Treatment with a PI3K inhibitor reversed the aggressive behavior caused by FAM111B overexpression, strongly suggesting a direct regulatory role. This not only strengthens the case for FAM111B as a key driver of glioma but also highlights it as a promising therapeutic target. The study's strength lies in its comprehensive approach, combining bioinformatics, cell culture, animal modeling, and molecular assays. However, the authors acknowledge the study's limitations, particularly the small patient sample size and the need for broader validation across multiple research centers.
Nonetheless, the implications are significant. Identifying FAM111B as an independent prognostic marker and a key modulator of a known cancer pathway adds a valuable tool to the glioma research arsenal.

While therapies targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway already exist, this research may pave the way for more precise, FAM111B-guided interventions. ""FAM111B has emerged not only as a critical biomarker for the development of glioma,"" Dr Du concludes, ""but also as a promising novel target for therapeutic intervention.""

As researchers work to solve the complex puzzle of brain cancer, FAM111B may soon take center stage.

Announcing a new publication for Acta Materia Medica journal. The prevalence of diabetes is increasing and expected to become a major global health burden. Various pharmaceutical approaches have been used to manage diabetes and reduce the associated risks. Subcutaneous insulin injection remains the primary treatment due to the physicochemical properties of insulin, which limit oral absorption.

The gastrointestinal tract presents further challenges, including enzymatic degradation and harsh environmental conditions, resulting in oral insulin bioavailability < 1%. As a result, alternative delivery routes, such as transdermal delivery, have been extensively explored. However, this approach is also challenging due to the structural barriers of the skin, which hinder drug absorption. The high molecular weight of insulin further limits permeation across the skin.

To address these limitations, various formulation and delivery strategies have been investigated to improve transdermal drug delivery of insulin and are the subject of this review. Approaches, including penetration enhancers, lipid-based carriers, microemulsion, polymeric systems, and physical enhancement technologies, have demonstrated potential for enhancing skin permeability.

However, the potential adverse effects and patient discomfort associated with these conventional methods highlights the need for more user-friendly alternatives. Microneedles have emerged as a promising transdermal delivery system, offering a painless, simple, and user-friendly approach to overcome challenges, thus improving adherence and treatment efficacy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Blood test can reveal early signs of leukemia without bone marrow sampling","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250627/Blood-test-can-reveal-early-signs-of-leukemia-without-bone-marrow-sampling.aspx","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 00:27:00 GMT","

What if a blood test could reveal the pace of our aging – and the diseases that may lie ahead? The labs of Profs. Liran Shlush and Amos Tanay at the Weizmann Institute of Science have been conducting in-depth studies into the biology of blood to better understand the aging process and why some people become more susceptible to disease over the years. Their research teams, made up of physicians, biologists and data scientists, have been tracking changes in the blood-forming stem cells, including the emergence of genetic changes in these cells in about one-third of people over the age of 40. These changes not only increase the risk of blood cancers such as leukemia, but have also been linked to heart disease, diabetes and other age-related conditions.

In a new study published today (Friday) in Nature Medicine – just days after their labs were severely damaged in an Iranian missile attack – Shlush and Tanay present findings that may lead to an innovative blood test for detecting a person's risk of developing leukemia. This test may potentially replace the invasive diagnostic procedure of bone marrow sampling.

The study focused on myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), an age-related condition in which blood stem cells fail to properly mature into functional blood cells. Diagnosing MDS and assessing its severity is crucial, as it can lead to severe anemia and may progress to acute myeloid leukemia, one of the most common blood cancers in adults. Until now, diagnosis has relied on bone marrow sampling, a procedure that requires local anesthesia and can cause discomfort or pain.

In the new study, a research team led by Dr. Nili Furer, Nimrod Rappoport and Oren Milman, in collaboration with physicians and researchers in Israel and the United States, showed that rare blood stem cells – which occasionally exit the bone marrow and enter the bloodstream – carry diagnostic information about MDS. The researchers demonstrated that with a simple blood test and advanced single-cell genetic sequencing, it is possible to identify early signs of the syndrome and even assess a person's risk of developing blood cancer.

The researchers also discovered that the migrating stem cells can serve as a clock for our chronological age, and that in males, their population changes earlier than in women in a way that increases the risk of cancer. This finding may explain the higher prevalence of blood cancers among men. The scientists believe that using the test to diagnose MDS and leukemia is only the beginning, and that in the future it could be applied to a range of other blood-related disorders. The current findings are already being tested in a large-scale clinical trial at several medical centers around the world.

In addition to his laboratory research, Shlush is also a senior physician at Assuta Medical Center in Ashdod and at Maccabi Healthcare Services, and he heads the newly established Miriam and Aaron Gutwirth Medical School at the Weizmann Institute. The school was founded to address the emerging needs and challenges of the worlds of medicine and research and to bridge, as much as possible, the gap between today's science and tomorrow's medicine. Unlike existing programs around the world that combine medicine with research, the new program is expected to unify and intertwine the clinical and research components. The school is scheduled to open its doors for the first time this coming October and aims to train the next generation of physician-scientists.

Scientists at The University of Texas at Arlington have identified a new enzyme that can be ""turned off"" to help the body maintain healthy cholesterol levels-a significant development that could lead to new treatments for diseases that affect millions of Americans.

We found that by blocking the enzyme IDO1, we are able to control the inflammation in immune cells called macrophages. Inflammation is linked to so many conditions-everything from heart disease to cancer to diabetes to dementia. By better understanding IDO1 and how to block it, we have the potential to better control inflammation and restore proper cholesterol processing, stopping many of these diseases in their tracks.""

Subhrangsu S. Mandal, lead author of a new peer-reviewed study and professor of chemistry at UT Arlington

Inflammation plays a crucial role in the immune system, helping the body fight infections and heal injuries. But when inflammation becomes abnormal-due to stress, injury or infection-it can damage cells, disrupt normal functions and increase the risk of serious diseases. During these periods, macrophages can't absorb cholesterol properly, which can lead to chronic disease.

The team-Dr. Mandal, postdoctoral researcher Avisankar Chini; doctoral students Prarthana Guha, Ashcharya Rishi and Nagashree Bhat; master's student Angel Covarrubias; and undergraduate researchers Valeria Martinez, Lucine Devejian and Bao Nhi Nguyen-found that the enzyme IDO1 becomes activated during inflammation, producing a substance called kynurenine that interferes with how macrophages process cholesterol.

When IDO1 is blocked, however, macrophages regain their ability to absorb cholesterol. This suggests that reducing IDO1 activity could offer a new way to help prevent heart disease by keeping cholesterol levels in check.

The researchers also found that nitric oxide synthase (NOS), another enzyme linked in inflammation, worsens the effects of IDO1. They believe that inhibiting NOS could provide another potential therapy for managing cholesterol problems driven by inflammation.

""These findings are important because we know too much cholesterol buildup in macrophages can lead to clogged arteries, heart disease and a host of other illnesses,"" Mandal said. ""Understanding how to prevent the inflammation affecting cholesterol regulation could lead to new treatments for conditions like heart disease, diabetes, cancer and others.""

Next, the research team plans to dig deeper into how IDO1 interacts with cholesterol regulation and whether other enzymes play a role. If they can find a safe way to block IDO1, it could open the door for more effective drugs to prevent inflammation-related diseases.

An 8-year HonorHealth Research Institute clinical trial, using non-surgical techniques, showed 86% of patients with a type of usually fatal low blood pressure known as 'structural shock' survived at least 3 months, while 73% survived at least 6 months, according to a study presented here at a major heart convention.

That's a spectacular improvement. This appears to be a monumental step forward.""

David G. Rizik, M.D., head of the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Research Institute's Cardiovascular Research Division

Dr. Rizik presented the study's findings today at New York Valves 2025: The Structural Heart Summitheld at New York's Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. In only its second year, New York Valves is already the world's premier meeting of structural heart disease, which refers to conditions affecting the heart's valves, walls, chambers and muscles.

While ultra-low blood pressure, or cardiogenic shock, is often caused by a heart attack due to blockages in the arteries that feed the heart muscle, there is a growing recognition that this condition is also caused by structural shock, which usually involves damage to two major heart valves:

""Most of these patients are not surgical candidates. These are patients who come into our emergency departments in what is referred to as 'cardiogenic shock.' These patients are generally too sick to have an operation (open-heart surgery) to replace the mitral valve,"" said Dr. Rizik, lead author of a paper, Mitral Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair and Mandatory Mechanical Circulatory Support in Patients With Structural Shock, (doi: 10.1016/j.jscai.2025.102626) published in the Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (JSCAI).

Instead, structural shock patients at HonorHealth were diverted to the Institute's cardiovascular catheterization laboratory, where specialists - using devices guided through large blood vessels to enter the heart - performed two procedures:

Dr. Rizik said that, on average, more than 90 percent of cardiogenic shock patients do not survive.

""This is a brand new area of clinical investigation,"" he said, adding that the success of the HonorHealth clinical trial resulted from an unprecedented collaboration of heart specialists at the Institute, including cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons, and specialists in imaging, critical care and intensive care.

""This represents one of the largest single-center prospective experiences examining transcatheter edge-to-edge repair in this high-risk population,"" according to the paper published in JSCAI.

Dr. Rizik plans to build on the initial study of 30 cases by working with other medical centers to refine non-surgical techniques through a larger clinical trial involving hundreds of patients.

Structural shock can be caused in younger patients from genetic susceptibility, and in older patients from progressively worsening valves and chronic damage to the heart muscle.

New York Valves 2025 features live-case demonstrations, interactive debates, and hands-on training for professionals in the field, including interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, clinical cardiologists, cardiac imagers, heart failure specialists, catheter lab professionals and nurses.

Fatty liver disease, caused by the accumulation of fat in the liver, is estimated to affect one in four people worldwide. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer, making it crucial to detect early and initiate treatment. 

Currently, standard tests for diagnosing fatty liver disease include ultrasounds, CTs, and MRIs, which require costly specialized equipment and facilities. In contrast, chest X-rays are performed more frequently, are relatively inexpensive, and involve low radiation exposure. Although this test is primarily used to examine the condition of the lungs and heart, it also captures part of the liver, making it possible to detect signs of fatty liver disease. However, the relationship between chest X-rays and fatty liver disease has rarely been a subject of in-depth study. 

Therefore, a research group led by Associate Professor Sawako Uchida-Kobayashi and Associate Professor Daiju Ueda at Osaka Metropolitan University's Graduate School of Medicine developed an AI model that can detect the presence of fatty liver disease from chest X-ray images. 

In this retrospective study, a total of 6,599 chest X-ray images containing data from 4,414 patients were used to develop an AI model utilizing controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) scores. The AI model was verified to be highly accurate, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ranging from 0.82 to 0.83. 

The development of diagnostic methods using easily obtainable and inexpensive chest X-rays has the potential to improve fatty liver detection. We hope it can be put into practical use in the future.""

To overcome the inherent challenge of translation termination interference caused by stop codon reprogramming in mammalian cells, researchers from Peking University led by Chen Peng from College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering and Yi Chengqi from School of Life Sciences have developed a novel codon expansion strategy that enables precise incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) without perturbing natural genetic codes. This innovative approach utilizes post-transcriptionally modified RNA codons-distinct from all 64 standard genetic codons-within targeted transcripts to encode ncAAs in mammalian systems. This work establishes a versatile platform for expanding the genetic code in mammalian cells, paving the way for advanced protein engineering and functional studies in complex biological systems. These findings were published in Nature on June 25, 2025, under the title ""RNA codon expansion via programmable pseudouridine editing and decoding.""

The site-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) provides new opportunities to tailor protein functions with custom chemistries. Traditional genetic code expansion (GCE) strategies achieve ncAA incorporation by reassigning stop codons as ""blank"" codons, which is not fully orthogonal to endogenous translation termination, limiting its precision and scope in cellular contexts. This RCE method utilizes bio-orthogonally assigned pseudouridine-modified codons (ΨCodons: ΨGA, ΨAA, or ΨAG) at designated mRNA transcripts for ncAA incorporation in mammalian cells. The RCE platform integrates a programmable guide RNA, an engineered decoder tRNA, and a specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to achieve highly selective decoding of ΨCodons. These advances establish a robust strategy that employs pseudouridine as a post-transcriptional ""letter,"" creating new RNA codons for targeted protein engineering and expanding the genetic code in eukaryotic systems.

In this study, researchers established an RNA codon expansion (RCE) platform to assign pseudouridine (Ψ)-modified RNA codons (ΨCodons: ΨGA, ΨAA, ΨAG) as novel ""blank"" codons for non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) incorporation in mammalian cells, independent of endogenous codon usage. The RCE system is comprised of three essential components: a programmable guide RNA for targeted ΨCodon installation, a specifically engineered decoder tRNA ((ΨGA)-tRNAPyl, (ΨAA)-tRNAPyl, or (ΨAG)-tRNAPyl) for ΨCodon recognition, and a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for decoding. Each decoder tRNA demonstrated a strong preference for its corresponding ΨCodon over native codons, ensuring orthogonality within the mammalian translatome.

Ribosome profiling and proteomic analyses revealed that RCE(ΨGA) achieves high specificity for ncAA incorporation, while preserving the endogenous UGA stop codon, which constitutes approximately 52% of stop codons in the human genome. Furthermore, the three ΨCodon–decoder tRNA pairs were shown to be mutually orthogonal, enabling the site-specific incorporation of multiple ncAAs with distinct side chains into mammalian proteins. Importantly, the RCE platform was also compatible with conventional GCE systems, allowing for dual ncAA incorporation within single cells.

- The RCE system enables programmable encoding and decoding of modified RNA codons, achieving high translatome-wide specificity for ncAA incorporation and minimizing disruption to endogenous translation termination.
- Each ΨCodon–decoder tRNA pair operates orthogonally, facilitating the precise incorporation of multiple, chemically diverse ncAAs into proteins of interest in mammalian cells.
- This methodology offers new opportunities for the precise investigation and modulation of protein function, supporting both fundamental research and potential therapeutic applications.

This study establishes RCE as a robust and versatile platform for programmable genetic code expansion in eukaryotic systems, enabling precise site-specific protein modification and functional studies in complex biological settings.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New study supports non-surgical approach for select cases of acute subdural hematoma","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250627/New-study-supports-non-surgical-approach-for-select-cases-of-acute-subdural-hematoma.aspx","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 01:06:00 GMT","

Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is a common brain lesion resulting from traumatic brain injuries and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Emergency surgery is the most common intervention for these patients; however, in some cases, patients refuse to undergo surgery owing to social, religious, economic, or psychological reasons. In these cases, ASDH transitions to sASDH, and non-surgical interventions should begin immediately. However, there is no consensus in the medical community as to how to treat these patients non-surgically. To address this issue, researchers from Capital Medical University, Beijing, and Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China, set out to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of the drugs atorvastatin and dexamethasone in five patients who reported sASDH. This study was conducted under the guidance of Professor Rongcai Jiang and was published in the prestigious Chinese Neurosurgical Journal on April 2, 2025.

Previous phase-II randomized proof-of-concept trials had reported that atorvastatin plus low-dose dexamethasone was effective in patients with chronic SDH. Based on this, Prof. Jiang explains the rationale of their study ""Considering that sASDH and chronic SDH share highly similar pathological and clinical characteristics, we speculate that atorvastatin combined with low-dose dexamethasone may be safe and effective for sASDH patients initially selecting nonsurgical therapy"". Of the five patients, four were females, aged between 30 and 85 years old. The male patient was a 97-year-old who presented with convulsions and atrial fibrillation. The medical histories of these patients were also varied, ranging from hemophilia to rectal and bladder cancers. Two female patients reported post-operative and post-fall SDH. All patients received 20 mg/day oral doses of atorvastatin along with a low-dose dexamethasone, where 2.25 mg/day was administered in the first 2 weeks, 1.5 mg/day in the third week, and 0.75 mg/day in the fourth week. After receiving this treatment regimen of atorvastatin plus low-dose dexamethasone treatment, patients' symptoms improved significantly, with no cases of recurrence or progression of symptoms even up to 6 months post-treatment.

The authors next searched research databases like PubMed and Google Scholar for literature regarding safety and efficacy of non-surgical treatments for patients with ASDH/sASDH. They pooled the results of these studies to record a total of 1374 patients with ASDH/sASDH who received initial non-surgical treatment. Of this, 13.1% patients had deteriorating symptoms and had to undergo delayed surgical treatments. 19.2% of the patients had poor prognosis, with 7% of the patients eventually dying. However, ""more than 80% of the patients did not need delayed surgery; this further illustrates that patients with ASDH/sASDH can have a good prognosis with conservative treatment in certain cases"", comments Prof. Jiang on the literature survey performed by the team.

The mechanism of how atorvastatin improves ASDH symptoms still remains unclear. Rats with sASDH/ASDH when treated with atorvastatin showed significant reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines present in the hematomas, removing local inflammation, promoting proliferation and maturation of blood vessels, and contributing towards the absorption of SDH. Further, this study reports that atorvastatin reverses edema in the dural lymphatic vessels of the brain, restores the damages in the membranes of the blood vessels in the brain, thereby promoting discharge of the hematoma rapidly.

The lack of an optimal non-surgical treatment for sASDH prompted this study. The literature review suggests a high mortality rate of 7% which calls for an urgent non-surgical treatment plan for these patients. This study, although conducted in a small local pool of patients with sASDH, shows that atorvastatin with low-dose of dexamethasone successfully resolves symptoms and removes hematomas without recurrence during a six-month follow-up period.

Overall, ""the nonsurgical treatment strategy of atorvastatin plus dexamethasone is safe and effective. It is recommended to conduct further randomized proof-of-concept clinical trials to verify its efficacy"" Prof. Jiang concludes about the study.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Newly discovered target may re-energize exhausted immune cells in the fight against cancer","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250627/Newly-discovered-target-may-re-energize-exhausted-immune-cells-in-the-fight-against-cancer.aspx","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 00:53:00 GMT","

Van Andel Institute scientists and collaborators have discovered a potential treatment target that may re-energize dysfunctional or ""exhausted"" immune cells in their fight against cancer.

The target is an immune checkpoint called PTGIR, which regulates the number and cancer-fighting powers of T cells, the soldiers of the immune system. Too much PTGIR puts a brake on T cells and reduces their ability to release cancer-killing molecules.

The findings, published in the journal Nature Immunology, could help improve cancer immunotherapies by paving the way for new immune checkpoint inhibitors or engineered T cell therapies that block PTGIR signaling and re-invigorate T cells.

Immunotherapies are game changers for cancer treatment, but they don't work for everyone or for all cancers. Blocking PTGIR offers another opportunity to develop more targeted treatments that help the immune system fight disease.""

Michael Dahabieh, Ph.D., study's first author and postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Russell Jones, Ph.D., at VAI

Immune checkpoints are molecules that pepper the outside of T cells and some cancer cells. In immune cells, checkpoints help the immune system do its job without accidentally attacking healthy cells. In cancer, checkpoints allow malignant cells to evade immune attacks. Medications that block checkpoints, called immune checkpoint inhibitors, have become powerful tools for treating cancer.

Most known immune checkpoints rely on interactions between proteins, which can limit treatment options. The new checkpoint is based on a protein (PTGIR) and a lipid (prostacyclin), which creates new prospects for leveraging the checkpoint to fight cancer. To date, only a few similar protein-lipid interactions have been described in T cells.

Prostacyclin is found in and around tumors and contributes to T cell exhaustion by interacting with PTGIR. The amount and availability of PTGIR is regulated by another protein called NRF2. More NRF2 means more PTGIR - which results in widespread T cell exhaustion.

""The more PTGIR, the more opportunities there are for it to interact with prostacyclin,"" Jones said. ""This increased activity slams the brakes on T cell activity and makes it more difficult for them to continue fighting cancer cells. Shutting down this interaction offers an opportunity to bolster the immune system and treat cancer.""

Depression affects 1%-2% of children younger than 13 in the U.S. and can arise as early as age 3, but a specialized therapeutic intervention can help preschool-aged children find relief from this condition - with benefits lasting at least four years, according to a new study led by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

The researchers, led by Joan Luby, MD, the Samuel and Mae S. Ludwig Professor of Psychiatry at WashU Medicine, and Mei Elansary, MD, an attending developmental behavioral pediatrician at Boston Medical Center, measured the long-term effects of a dyadic (parent-child), 18-week intervention developed by Luby. They found the treatment to be effective in achieving long-term remission in a majority of children. Luby and Elansary also found that the children in remission had lower rates of mental health service and psychiatric medication use compared to kids who didn't achieve remission from depression after treatment.

The results were published June 27 in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

""The beauty of this therapy is that it's a short-term, parent-child interaction therapy that's delivered by a master's level clinician, so it's very accessible, very low risk, and it's literally changing the trajectory of mental health over four years,"" said Luby, who also directs the Department of Psychiatry's Early Emotional Development Program at WashU Medicine. ""From a public health perspective, it's a really good early investment, and, in terms of return on investment, it's huge.""

Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Emotion Development (PCIT-ED), which Luby developed and applied in this study, is the first and only psychotherapeutic intervention designed to treat depression in preschoolers that has been rigorously tested in a large-scale trial. PCIT-ED was modified from PCIT, which is a standard intervention for treating children experiencing behavioral difficulties. In PCIT-ED, therapists coach caregivers in real-time interactions with their children, helping them reinforce positive behaviors, develop effective parenting skills and build a supportive and nurturing environment. The focus is on improving the child's emotional awareness and expression, fostering a secure parent-child relationship and mitigating early symptoms of depression.

Prior work by Luby's team has shown children receiving PCIT-ED had remission rates of 73% after the 18-week intervention compared to 23% of children who were on a waiting list for treatment. Several months after treatment, the vast majority of children remained in remission.

This latest study is the first follow-up examining the long-term effects of PCIT-ED for children and their families. It included 105 children who received a full course of PCIT-ED in the earlier trial and were reassessed four years after the end of treatment, at which point they were 8 to 12 years old. To measure depression, the researchers conducted diagnostic interviews with the children and their primary caregivers. The interviewers assessed symptoms of major depressive disorder, such as guilt, sadness, aggression and sleep problems. They also looked at other family characteristics, such as parenting strategies and whether caregivers had depression.

They found that 57% of 3- to 7-year-olds with major depressive disorder were in remission four years later, without any follow-up or booster sessions.

One of the reasons why this therapy has such enduring efficacy is because it trains the parent to interact differently with the child in the emotional domain. After the treatment ends, the parent continues to interact with the child with greater sensitivity, and that becomes a draw to the child. The truth is there's nothing a child wants more than a validating, nurturing caregiver. It's like the foundation of a house. That's what it's all built on.""

Joan Luby, MD, the Samuel and Mae S. Ludwig Professor of Psychiatry, WashU Medicine

The findings underscore the value of early diagnosis and intervention for young children with depression, said Elansary, who is also an assistant professor of pediatrics at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine. ""Our results offer promising evidence that PCIT-ED can reduce the risk of future mental health challenges into preadolescence,"" she noted. ""Perhaps most strikingly, children who achieved remission required significantly less use of psychotropic medications and intensive mental health services, suggesting a more favorable long-term trajectory.""

Furthermore, parents of preadolescent children in remission reported less parenting stress in Luby and Elansary's follow-up study, highlighting the holistic benefits to the family.

The Hermann Center for Child and Family Development, a research center housed within the Children's Discovery Institute, a collaboration between St. Louis Children's Hospital and WashU Medicine, provides mental and emotional health support to children and families - including PCIT-ED - with a focus on preventive care to decrease psychiatric needs later in life. For the center's co-executive directors Luby and Cynthia Rogers, MD, the Blanche F. Ittleson Professor of Psychiatry, the results of Luby's study validate the founding principle of the center: that early diagnosis and intervention is most effective in achieving the best outcomes.

The Hermann Center blends world-class research with a revolutionary model for whole-family behavioral health care. The Hermann Center, established in 2022 by a $15 million gift from Bob and Signa Hermann, is the first of its kind to adopt a transgenerational approach to reducing the burden of serious behavioral health conditions of childhood, one that engages the whole family and that will track the results of this care for years to come.

With the long-term benefits of PCIT-ED established, Luby said she anticipates that providers nationwide will take advantage of downloadable training materials she has developed and start offering the protocol at their facilities. She also plans to develop additional modules to help people who would benefit from further support, such as extra emotional development for caregivers.

Women's soccer remains in good hands. And good feet. Both nationally and locally.

Watching the U.S. National team blitz the Republic of Ireland 4-0 on Thursday night it provided a soothing balm on concerns. Several top Americans were missing, including Coloradans Mallory Swanson (pregnancy), Lindsey Heaps (rest after European schedule) and Sophia Wilson (pregnancy). Swanson, Wilson and Trinity Rodman, out with a back issue, form the Triple Espresso of USWNT.

But the team remains caffeinated with an infusion of youth. Credit coach Emma Hayes for building out age classes in the federation and debuting 21 players over the last year — creating a bright future.

“Honestly our biggest strength could be our depth. The Ireland coach was saying it the other day, that you could make 15 to 20 changes on the U.S. team and be fine,” Julie Foudy, legendary U.S. player and current analyst for TNT Sports, told The Post. “I would have said a year ago, I don't know if that's true. Now, she is actually right.”

There is something charming about the women's team. While we have been told for five decades how the U.S. men would take over the world, the women continue to do it. They are in a transition period after moving on from high-profile players, yet they should be favored to win the FIFA World Cup in 2027 in Brazil.

“Our standard is always the same. That is what has made this team so good over so many years even with so many new faces coming in,” USWNT standout defender Naomi Girma said. “When you wear this crest, you understand that is your responsibility and you always want to live up to that.”

It is clear women's sports are a movement not a moment. And it goes beyond USWNT. Denver's pro team begins play in the NWSL next March. The franchise, whose ownership group includes Peyton Manning, has secured more than 10,000 season tickets, setting a new league record.

“It's been fantastic. This is such a good soccer community. They are crushing it. I am an owner with Angel City, so I love it,” Foudy said. “It's just buzzing from the go. It's a really good time.”

Nuggets' nuggets: The Nuggets press conference for co-executives Jon Wallace and Ben Tenzer was underwhelming. Nickelback would blush at the amount of clichés spewed. This tandem could work, with Wallace excelling at player relationships and Tenzer crunching numbers. But here is what is important: Teams need to know who to call to get business done. If there is confusion on who is in charge and opposing GMs decide to phone Josh Kroenke instead, then this risky arrangement will backfire.

On the Rox: After advising Walker Monfort to push for the firing of GM Bill Schmidt, a flurry of texts came in, panning the Rockies' business model. The front office is like a hot dog. The more fans know, the tougher it is to swallow. One call I would make is to Dodgers vice president and assistant GM Alex Slater. He is known for his high baseball IQ, while operating with toughness and honesty. He is the type of executive the Rockies need to change their future.

That's not His Name: Mets reliever Richard Lovelady requested to be called by his nickname, Dicky. He later flip-flopped, saying he preferred Richard. Then, the Mets cut him. Time to go back to his first choice, and if the big leagues don't work, join the Savannah Bananas.

When USA faces Costa Rica in Sunday's Gold Cup quarterfinals at U.S. Bank Stadium, the Americans can search for the players they need.

By Jon Marthaler

You might not recognize all the names that will take the field for the U.S. men's national soccer team on Sunday when they take on Costa Rica in the quarterfinals of the Gold Cup at U.S. Bank Stadium.

That also might not be a bad thing.

Yes, the USA is missing some of its biggest names. Christian Pulisic? Not here (and possibly now in a spat with coach Mauricio Pochettino). Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Giovanni Reyna, Antonee Robinson — all not in the squad this time around, for reasons ranging from injury to fatigue to the Club World Cup. Of the 11 players who started last summer's pivotal Copa América loss to Panama, only four are back this summer to try to get the USA back on track.

But that said, the USA hasn't exactly been having success with the first-choice lineup, either. It crashed out of that Copa América in the group stage, despite playing at home. The Americans got beaten twice in this spring's Nations League finals, again at home.

The Gold Cup may not be the most prestigious of tournaments, but it's the last competitive trial run for the American men before the 2026 World Cup. After this, the USA — which doesn't have to qualify for next summer's tournament, since it's hosting — will have only friendlies to try to get the team in game shape.

This Gold Cup knockout round will be the closest thing the Americans get to the usual cauldron of CONCACAF qualifying.

They'll be playing as many as three do-or-die games against motivated opposition, always with the slight undercurrent of chaos that CONCACAF matches bring. It's a challenge that's brought out the best and the worst of previous national teams, sometimes within the same week.

And so it might be good that this USA team has been shorn of a number of players who probably already know they'll be at the World Cup next year, no matter what happens. It's far better to have smaller names with something to prove.

Pochettino's task as manager, since taking over last fall, has changed significantly, even during his short tenure. At the beginning, his goal was to build on what Gregg Berhalter had constructed during his time as manager — a team that had talent and some tactical coherence, but not quite enough to compete with top teams.

As the winter wore on, though, his challenge had seemingly become more basic: find players who are willing to fight.

The men's national teams from the late 1990s and early 2000s are now far enough in the past that the mythologizing has begun. In the re-telling, those teams were short on talent but long on spirit, and that combative, underdog mentality was enough to carry a bunch of college kids into the quarterfinals of the 2002 World Cup.

Loons

Loons

The truth is that the USA — like any team in the world, international or otherwise — needs both talent and spirit. Pochettino is now on a quest to add the latter to the former.

Already, we've seen players who have taken a huge step forward. Diego Luna, from Real Salt Lake, has emerged as the type of ball-first playmaker the USA has seemingly needed — and has paired it with the kind of attitude Pochettino appreciates.

In a January friendly against Costa Rica, Luna had his nose broken in a collision, but making just his second start for the USMNT, he insisted on going back onto the field. With his nose packed with gauze, he rushed back onto the field and immediately provided an assist, dramatically impressing the Argentine manager. 

It's already come to define what Pochettino is looking for in his USA team: players determined enough to be on the field that they'll stay in the game, injured, in a meaningless January friendly.

Forget everything else about the state of the USA, from the ugly losses this spring to the looming glitter of next summer's World Cup. The knockout rounds of the Gold Cup are where the Americans can identify what they really need: players who are good enough to be with the national team, and determined to stay.

The USA won all three games in the group stage, but was expected to have no trouble with Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti, and — to a lesser extent — Saudi Arabia. Now comes the real challenge: making the Gold Cup semifinals for a 13th consecutive time. Costa Rica striker Manfred Ugalde, who has three goals in the tournament, will be suspended for this one due to yellow card accumulation.

3 p.m., Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium

TV: FS1, TUDN (Spanish)

Neither of Canada's two Loons — striker Tani Oluwaseyi or goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair — played in the Canucks' final group-stage match, a win over El Salvador. Canadian coach Jesse Marsch had to sit upstairs for the first two matches of the tournament, after being suspended thanks to some screaming at the officials at March's Nations League finals, but he'll be on the sideline — demonstrative as ever — for this one.

Filed under:

They went unblemished in the group stage, but now it's time to elevate their execution.

The United States Men's National Team are through to the quarterfinals of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, and over the next week they hope to play three more games and walk off the field at NRG Stadium in Houston as Gold Cup champions. The USMNT allowed just 1 goal in the group stage, beating Trinidad & Tobago, Saudi Arabia, and Haiti on their way to winning Group D.

Tomorrow, their first test in the knockout stage begins when they face Costa Rica in the quarterfinals. The USMNT, despite the perfect 3-0-0 record in the group stage, still have some things that they can work on so they can perform better in this win or go home stage. We take a look at 3 things the team needs to do in order to take their game to the next level in this tournament.

The USMNT scored eight goals across the three group stage matches, but five of them came in their opener against Trinidad & Tobago. When they had chances to score, it felt like the connections weren't quite there and the execution fell flat. With a new group of guys, that's going to happen. But, this tournament can be unforgiving, and the United States will not want to look back and have regret at scoring chances they messed up that could have made a difference. 

That means the strikers need to produce. The attacking midfielders and wingers have done pretty well, but everyone on the team has to elevate their finishing and concentrate on executing inside the penalty area to get open space and finish shots.

When a group doesn't have a lot of time together, it takes a while for them to learn each other's tendencies. That's especially true on defense, and it shows when the team attempts to start their offense from deep in their defensive third. Simply put, the USMNT should not be trying to play it out of the back. The lone goal they've conceded came against Haiti when they were trying to play it out of the back and goalkeeper Matt Freese passed it directly to Haiti's Don Louicius, who immediately fired a shot into the net. There have been some more nervy moments on defense where the USMNT failed to quickly get the ball moving forward down the field, which signals that the best option for them is to not let the ball settle in their defensive third where mistakes can cost them.

Each of these players are not just playing for a trophy this year. They're playing to be in the mix for a roster spot next summer at the World Cup. Who on this roster has the juice to elevate their game against Costa Rica and, should they win, in the later rounds of this tournament? The playing time is earned in practice, and future chances are earned through performances on the field. 

The Ticos are going to do everything to knock the United States out of the Gold Cup, and the players have to be ready to individually and collectively take the effort, passion, and execution up to a higher level. Which players will be ready for the bright lights of the Gold Cup knockout stage? If the team isn't prepared for that, they will go home earlier than they want, and the questions will continue to mount about the team's readiness to co-host the 2026 World Cup.

The U.S. are three wins away from something they have done seven times, but not since 2021 - win the Gold Cup

The U.S. men's national team won their Gold Cup group. Their reward? A meeting with some old friends. Miguel Herrera is one. So, too, is the team he coaches, Costa Rica. There's history here and plenty of it.

The history has been kind to the USMNT in this particular scenario. This will be the eighth Gold Cup meeting between the two teams. The U.S. haven't lost a single one. Moreover, the U.S. have never lost in the quarterfinal round of this tournament. This Costa Rica team, meanwhile, isn't a vintage Costa Rica team - it's in the midst of a rebuild, with several members of the old guard still hanging on.

Of course, given the absences of Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie and a virtual starting lineup of others, this isn't a vintage USMNT group, either - as has been the talking point all summer. The group that is here, though, has taken care of business, defeating Trinidad & Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti to top their group. The first of those wins was comprehensive. The second two? Less so. Mauricio Pochettino has plenty to build on, but also plenty of decisions to make following the group stage.

Now it gets serious, with the USMNT three wins away from accomplishing something they have done seven times, but not since 2021 - win the Gold Cup. And that starts against Costa Rica on Sunday, with kickoff at 7 p.m. ET in Minneapolis. A spot in the semifinals is on the line. The rewards and the pressure are only increasing.

Gab Marcotti and Craig Burley explain the struggle to balance making Club World Cup games available for the global audience with making it safe for the players. (2:52)

It's OK, you can admit it. It's just us, don't be embarrassed. If you're a casual fan, you probably knew close to nothing of most of the non-European teams in the Club World Cup unless they were from your region, with the exception of Inter Miami (because, well, Lionel Messi).

LAFC: Isn't that the team David Beckham played for? (No, that's the other team from Los Angeles, the Galaxy ... the one with the two World Cup winners.)

Urawa Red Diamonds: That's from Super Mario, right? (No, they're from Japan and draw almost as many fans per game as Chelsea or Juventus.)

Ulsan HD: Isn't that a brand of TV? (Maybe, but this Ulsan won the past two South Korean league titles.)

You may have heard of Brazil's Flamengo, but might have equally been surprised there's no long-legged pink bird on their crest. (The name comes from the Portuguese word for Flemish and stems from a Rio de Janeiro neighborhood.)

And admit it -- we're among friends -- you probably thought all three teams with the word ""Al"" in the name (Al Ain, Al Ahly and Al Hilal) were from Saudi Arabia, since we in the mainstream media keep talking about how the country is spending billions to attract the world's top players from Cristiano Ronaldo on down. (Actually, Al Hilal is the only Saudi club of the three, as Al Ain are from the United Arab Emirates and -- this may confuse you -- the Saudi Pro League also has an Al Ahly. It's just that this Al Ahly is from Egypt.)

If you're a soccer nerd -- or someone who gets paid to do this, like me -- you know that many of these clubs are massive local institutions, and some were historically among the best in the world. But the Club World Cup isn't designed to attract soccer devotees, who will tune in anyway -- it's meant to reel in the casuals and one day grow into a legitimate little brother of that sporting, cultural and entertainment juggernaut we know as the men's World Cup. That's not easy to do when more than half the teams in it have the global name recognition of the guy who played Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy.

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

That's why it was so important to FIFA that the Club World Cup group phase not degenerate into a series of WWE-style squash-fests in which the European clubs cruised through to a quarterfinal set that looks like the UEFA Champions League, only played over a single set and on a different continent.

While we could still get seven of eight UEFA quarterfinalists, by and large FIFA got its wish. The group stage was generally competitive. My colleague Ryan O'Hanlon took a deep dive into the relative strengths of the teams and the leagues and concluded that, maybe, the gap between Europe's elite and everyone else isn't as big as some thought.

Craig Burley explains why you can't use the Club World Cup to determine which sides are stronger than others.

With the exception of New Zealand semi-pros Auckland City (who nevertheless also grabbed a 1-1 draw against Argentinian giants Boca Juniors), nobody looked woefully out of place -- no more than Southampton looked out of place in the Premier League last year anyway. Take Auckland out of the mix, and if you define blowout as a game decided by more than three goals, well, there were just four matches out of 45 that qualify as blowouts, and one of them was the all-European affair between Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid.

FIFA crowed about it in a news release Friday, noting that the 16 sides in the knockouts come from 10 different countries and that four of the six Confederations are represented in the Round of 16. (It could have been five out of six: Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns came darn close, finishing on four points.) As for those European juggernauts, three of the twelve (Atletico Madrid, Porto and -- ahem -- FC Salzburg) exited in the group stage. All but one of them (Manchester City) dropped points against non-European competition.

In terms of the football itself? Well, this is proof of concept. Contrary to what some insist -- and the impression we in the mainstream media might give -- the rest of the world can in fact hang with Europe.

Yeah, I've heard the argument that some UEFA teams weren't taking it seriously. I'm not sure that was the norm at all. The only ones to rotate their teams significantly were City, Chelsea and Bayern, and all three advanced. I heard other arguments, too, about how it was unfair to the European teams that they had to play in hot conditions and how, for them, this tournament comes at the end of the season while for others it's in mid-season, so the players are fitter and less tired.

The ""Futbol Americas"" crew discusses how Inter Miami should feel after late goals from Palmeiras result in the MLS side facing off against PSG.

The heat factor is kind of nonsense. Sure, it's not fun playing in extreme conditions and the spectacle suffers, but is it really some weird, upset-causing leveler? Every single edition of the Euros is played in the summer, as are most World Cups. We still see the best teams advancing. None of these clubs are accustomed to playing in extreme heat: those from hotter nations tend to play their games at night if they do play in the summer (and most don't).

As for the midseason/end-of-season factor? Sure, maybe it helped the South American sides a bit. But the seasons in Africa and Asia run on a fall-to-spring calendar, just like most of Europe. And most of these teams had a three-week break between the end of their club seasons and the start of the Club World Cup.

I'm a strong believer that the Club World Cup, as a tournament, is a good thing. Europe may have 99% of the world's soccer resources, but step on to the pitch and the gap is nowhere near that big. The soccer world is a smaller place than we previously thought.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Real Madrid are gearing up for their FIFA Club World Cup last 16 showdown with Juventus in Miami on July 1.

Xabi Alonso's side topped Group H with two wins and a draw from their first three games under his leadership.

The Basque coach is starting to put his mark on the squad. despite sticking with a largely unchanged starting XI, as Kylian Mbappe battles to return.

The France international missed all three group games due to illness but confidence is high that he will be ready to start against Juventus.

Alonso is expected to make a late call on Mbappe, but he also has another fresh face in his ranks, after Endrick Felipe landed in Miami.

Alonso named the teenager in his initial squad, despite the Brazilian being forced to remain in Madrid, due to a muscle injury.

The 18-year-old has been working with club physios back in the Spanish capital as he looks to get back to full power before the start of 2025/26 season.

As per reports from Mundo Deportivo, his month-long rehabilitation has now been completed, and Alonso gave the green light for him to join up with the squad out in Florida.

As he was named in the squad before the June 10 FIFA deadline, Endrick Felipe is eligible to feature in the tournament, but he is unlikely to be risked.

The report claims Alonso wants to utilise the camp to test him within his current options to gain a clearer picture of where he fits into the wider plan.

Gonzalo Garcia has been the breakout star for Real Madrid so far in North America, with two goals from three games in Mbappe's absence, but Endrick Felipe will have to wait for his chance to impress Alonso.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Former Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has labelled the expanded Club World Cup the ""worst idea ever implemented in football"" due to its impact on player workload and recovery time.

Klopp, a long-term critic of the ever-expanding football calendar who is now working as head of global soccer for Red Bull, feels the timing and duration of the tournament in its new format heighten the risk of burnout and injuries for players.

""In the end, it's all about the game and not the surrounding aspects - and that's why the Club World Cup is the worst idea ever implemented in football in this regard,"" he told Welt in Germany.

""People who have never had anything to do with day-to-day business or who no longer have anything to do with it come up with something.""

He added: ""Last year we had the Copa America and European Championship, this year the Club World Cup and next year then the World Cup.

""This means no real recovery for the players who are there, neither physically nor mentally.

""An NBA player, who also earns a big salary, has a four-month break every year. This is what (Liverpool defender) Virgil van Dijk got in his entire career.""

This year's Club World Cup, which is taking place in the United States, began on June 14, three weeks after the end of the Premier League season, and concludes on July 13, four weeks before the start of the new top-flight campaign.

The competition features representatives from across the world, including Manchester City and Chelsea this year, and is due to be held every four years.

Before the start of this year's tournament, FIFPro, the representative organisation of global player unions, recommended a mandatory four-week off-season break for players to ease calendar congestion and protect player welfare.

Analysis by Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol:

Jurgen Klopp does have a very valid point, a point a lot of people in football agree with.

But there is another side to the story, and that is that this Club World Cup has not been set up for the benefit of Jurgen Klopp or the big European clubs; it has been set up for the benefit of clubs from all around the world.

If you speak to people from those clubs, they love this tournament, because they don't like their best players having to leave for Europe to play in the Champions League.

They have been asking FIFA to set up a competition which is the equivalent of the Champions League but for clubs all around the world and that is what they have done.

If it wasn't for the Club World Cup, a lot of these big European clubs would be going on big pre-season tours anyway. How many times have we seen Liverpool flying off to the US or the Far East?

That is what clubs do. Football seems to have turned into a 365-day-a-year sport. Jurgen Klopp is unhappy about it but I don't see what can be done about the fact that we are where we are.

Also, don't forget, these modern European sides have big, big squads. Manchester City have brought around 35 players and they seem to be enjoying it. I think it's been a very useful activity for them because they've been able to bed in new signings and new coaches.

At the end of the day, whoever wins this can make around £100m and that is a massive deal for clubs in the era of PSR and FFP.

Finally, I would say to Jurgen Klopp, is it really the worst idea ever implemented in football? Is it worse than Liverpool being one of the clubs who tried to set up a European Super League? Is it worse than VAR, for instance? I'm not so sure.

Yes of course, Jurgen Klopp has a point. But my personal opinion is that football doesn't belong to the big clubs in Western Europe. It belongs to the whole world. And the rest of the world is enjoying this tournament much more than Jurgen Klopp.

AccaFreeze lets you lock in one winning leg of your football acca, so a late goal won't ruin your bet!

Updated 42s ago

Two Brazilian sides Palmeiras and Botafogo are facing off in the first match of the round of 16 at the Club World Cup. 

A place in the quarter-final is the prize after both sides impressed during the group stage. Palmeiras topped their group ahead of Inter Miami, while Botafogo edged out Atletico Madrid to finish second behind PSG.

65' Palmeiras 0-0 Botafogo

We have more changes now as Correa is on for Savarino for Botafogo. 

Meanwhile Allan is off for Palmeiras and Mayke is on in his place.

65' Palmeiras 0-0 Botafogo

Off come Alex Telles and Allan, who picked up a yellow card just before coming off, and on come Montoro and Cuiabano.



62' Palmeiras 0-0 Botafogo

Here come some subs for Palmeiras as Paulinho and Luighi come on for Roque and Estevao.

Botafogo goalkeeper John is on pace to repeat his performance from the last head-to-head showdown against Palmeiras. 

The 29-year-old registered a three-save clean sheet in the 0-0 league draw between the two clubs last March and has done well to keep his side level so far today. As Palmeiras continue to pile on the offensive pressure, expect John to remain busy as the second half goes on.

56' Palmeiras 0-0 Botafogo

This game is opening up as time goes by.

Both teams have had chances and the play is becoming more stretched. 

48' Palmeiras 0-0 Botafogo

Lovely work from the 18-year-old who receives a switch of play on the left, then cuts inside and sees one shot blocked before putting the rebound away.

But the referee had already blown — Estevao was offside in the build-up to that one.

46' Palmeiras 0-0 Botafogo

That's an important stop from Botafogo goalkeeper John! 

He gets down low to his left to palm away a rasping drive from Estevao.

45' Palmeiras 0-0 Botafogo

And we're off and running again in Philadelphia. 

Will we see a winner in regulation time here?

It perhaps isn't surprising then that Palmeiras went without a goal, or a shot on target, in that first half given their record at this Club World Cup so far.

All four of the goals they have scored have come in the second half; they scored in the 49th and 59th minutes against Al Ahly and then in the 80th and 88th minutes against Inter Miami.

Botafogo, meanwhile, are yet to score a second-half goal at this tournament.

This is only the second match of the tournament thus far to see zero shots on target in the first half. 

The other match to do so also featured Palmeiras, their 2-0 win against Al Ahly. 

Yes, this foul did look as bad as it looks in the photo.

In fairness, Agustin Giay did get a touch to the ball first but then wiped out Igor Jesus with a knee to the ribcage.

Something more suited to tonight's UFC action in Las Vegas, I reckon.

This one always felt like it was going to be a feisty one.

It is the first time teams from the same country have met at this Club World Cup and Brazilian teams are no strangers to a crunching tackle.

Alexander Barboza flying into a two-footed tackle in the third minute really set the tone for the match and it has felt like a bad foul has been around the corner at every turn.

There was a slightly interesting moment when Palmeiras captain Gustavo Gomez screamed in the referee's face after being booked for one of the more industrial fouls of this tournament on Allan. Perhaps a reflection of his frustration at realising he will be suspended if he and his team-mates make it to the quarter-final.

I have to say, given the hype, I have been a little underwhelmed by Estevao in this tournament so far.

I do also that realise that, like for a lot of Chelsea fans, expectations should be tempered given he is just 18 years old.

He has looked sharp on the left wing so far today, but it still feels as though as he has been unable to properly affect the game in the final third. If he can add clinical decision making to his game — at this tournament, and beyond — he will be a real threat.

Botafogo manager Renato Paiva cannot have been happy with what his side served up in that first half.

It took them 33 minutes to have their first shot and that was a hit-and-hope job from 25 yards that spun a long way wide of the target.

They were second best all over the pitch in the first half, so the only positive they can take is that the scoreline is still level. Somehow.

They simply have to improve in the second half if they want to extend their stay at this Club World Cup.

We're all square in Philadelphia.

Palmeiras have had the better chances of the two teams but it's all still to play for between two teams who know each other very well.

45+4' Palmeiras 0-0 Botafogo

Half the stadium thought that had gone in — Rios takes a long-range shot which John just manages to tip over the bar.

What a strike!

Advertisement

Renato Paiva will be pleased with his team's strong defensive work in the first half, but ultimately needs a lot more out of his attacking players. 

The trio of Igor Jesus, Jefferson Savarino, and Artur have a combined 28 touches in the first half and one shot attempt. If things don't change, we could see early substitutions in the second half.

45' Palmeiras 0-0 Botafogo

The fourth official has put his board up and we will have six minutes added on to this half. 

It's hardly a surprise given some of the theatrics and hefty tackles we have seen, plus the cooling break. 

44' Palmeiras 0-0 Botafogo

That's more like it from Botafogo!

Vitinho heavily involved in some lovely one-touch build-up play on the right wing sees him slipped in behind and very nearly get a cross in the danger area. 

That's blocked and Palmeiras deal with the resulting corner.","{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","soccer"

On ""The Football Reporters"" podcast, James Olley shares his frustrations with the Club World Cup tournament as it currently exists. (1:41)

The Club World Cup group stage saw a million empty seats in the stands over the 48 games in the tournament so far, a year before the United States hosts the 2026 World Cup.

Nine teams that advanced to the round of 16 are from Europe. Four are from Brazil and one each from Major League Soccer, Mexico and Saudi Arabia.

About 56.7% of publicly listed capacity was filled for the 48 group stage matches, which included crowds of 3,412 and 6,730 in Orlando, Florida; 5,282 and 8,239 in Cincinnati. FIFA did not provide specific capacities for the tournament despite repeated requests from The Associated Press.

Total announced attendance was 1.67 million from 2.95 million capacity, an average of 34,746.

Just 44.9% was filled for five matches at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the site of next year's World Cup final, and 50% at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, where the 1994 championship game was played.

Among other 2026 sites, 81.8% of capacity was filled in Miami Gardens, Florida, 61.6% in Philadelphia, 52% in Seattle and 44.3% in Atlanta.

FIFA issued a statement that said: ""The appetite of the tournament speaks for itself: fans from 168 countries have already purchased tickets ... a clear sign of global anticipation and reach.""

The 12 games televised with English commentary on TNT, TBS and truTV averaged 360,000 viewers through Monday, including 409,000 for seven matches on nights and weekends.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

FIFA Club World Cup

The Athletic has live coverage of Benfica vs. Chelsea at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

The group stage of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup has concluded and 48 of the tournament's 63 matches have now taken place.

The competition, which is being hosted in the United States, drew plenty of criticism in the build-up — including for how many games were being held in large, out-of-town stadiums in cities traditionally lacking in football (or soccer) fandom.

So what have attendances actually been like? How many stadiums have come close to filling all of their seats? How have crowd sizes compared to the American-hosted 1994 men's World Cup and previous Club World Cups? And which have been the most and least-watched teams and groups at the tournament?

Here, The Athletic dives into the numbers and lays out the facts surrounding the attendances so far.

Firstly, this is what the attendance has been at each game so far at the tournament. The figures are based on FIFA's official attendances, which it says records the number of people through the turnstiles at each game (the below table is sortable).






FIFA has confirmed the attendance for both Mamelodi Sundowns vs Fluminense and Urawa Red Diamonds vs Monterrey (both played on June 25) was, by coincidence, exactly 14,312.

The 80,619 fans who watched Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain thrash Atletico Madrid at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California is the highest attendance of the tournament so far.

This match is, for now, the best-attended game in Club World Cup history. The previous highest reported attendances were the 73,000 who watched Manchester United vs Vasco da Gama (group stage) and Corinthians vs Vasco da Gama (final) at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro in the inaugural version of the competition in 2000.

The lowest attendance is the 3,412 present for South Korean side Ulsan HD's clash with Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa at the Inter&Co Stadium in Orlando, Florida on June 17, which was also delayed for 65 minutes given fears of thunderstorms. The nearby Walt Disney World averages that many visitors roughly every 30 minutes.

The last men's World Cup game to have a lower attendance was Wales vs Hungary in a group-stage play-off in Sweden in 1958 (2,823) and the last Premier League match (excluding games during the coronavirus pandemic) to attract a smaller crowd was Wimbledon vs Everton at Selhurst Park in January 1993, with just 3,039 people at the ground.

It is not, however, the lowest-attended Club World Cup match ever (excluding games held during the pandemic). That distinction is held by the second-round match between Mexican club Leon and Japanese side Urawa Red Diamonds at the 2023 tournament in Saudi Arabia. Just 2,525 people (in a 27,000-capacity ground) watched Urawa win 1-0.

The average attendance at the 2025 Club World Cup has been 34,759. The average across the previous 18 — much smaller — editions that were not affected by the pandemic was 32,505. While, at face value, this suggests attendances have been better than usual for the tournament, larger stadiums have been used for this edition, which must be taken into account.



Here is the average attendance for each day of the tournament. The highest figure, on June 14, was set on the first day of the competition, when the only game was between Lionel Messi's Inter Miami and Egyptian side Al Ahly at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.



The lowest was on June 25, when the final games in Groups E and F took place. Three of the four matches were attended by fewer than 15,000 people and just 14,312 people watched Monterrey's victory over Urawa Red Diamonds at the Rose Bowl. That meant more than 75,000 seats — a figure higher than Old Trafford's total capacity — were left empty at the stadium that hosted the 1994 World Cup final.

Looking at the 12 stadiums being used for the tournament, the Hard Rock Stadium tops the list for percentage of seats filled. The ground in south Florida has been, on average, 81.8 per cent full during its six games hosted so far. Notably, two of these matches have involved Messi. The lowest is the Inter&Co Stadium in Orlando, which has only been 19.9 per cent full.



The MetLife Stadium in New Jersey — which will host both the final of this tournament and next summer's World Cup, which the U.S. is jointly hosting with Canada and Mexico — has the third-lowest percentage of seats filled so far, with just under 45.

The club to have played in front of the most fans so far at the tournament are record 15-time European champions Real Madrid with a total of 197,474, averaging 65,825 over their three games. And the side to have been the least-watched are Mamelodi Sundowns, who totalled 31,730 at an average of 10,577 per game.

The group with the highest total attendance was Group B (PSG, Botafogo, Atletico and Seattle Sounders) with 289,725 at an average of 48,288 per match and the one with the lowest total attendance was Group F (Borussia Dortmund, Fluminense, Mamelodi Sundowns and Ulsan HD) with 104,026, averaging 17,338.

So, how does the group stage at the 2025 Club World Cup, with an average attendance of 34,759, compare to the 1994 World Cup in the U.S.? Well, that tournament 31 years ago averaged 67,526 for group-stage attendance — not far off double what we have seen this summer.

As for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, that averaged 51,188 in the groups and the average attendance across the 380 Premier League games in 2024-25 was 40,423.

But a word of caution when comparing different competitions across different eras: this is the first edition of the rebranded Club World Cup and it is far less popular than the World Cup and the Premier League, so the lower attendance figures are to be expected.

So while crowd sizes have not been — on the whole — disastrous so far, FIFA will hope they increase during the knockout stage. And, at next year's World Cup, the sport's governing body will be desperate to avoid the scenes we have seen at several games this summer, with well over 50,000 empty seats in some stadiums.

Even so, the added prestige and global interest in the World Cup will inevitably mean higher attendances in the group stage of that tournament — although ticket prices and difficulty in reaching some out-of-town stadiums could pose a challenge.

FIFA Club World Cup

The Athletic has live coverage of Benfica vs. Chelsea at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

FIFA's newly-expanded Club World Cup has reached the end of its group phase, with two weeks of knockout matches to come ahead of the final on July 13.

Having risen from seven teams to 32 for this summer's tournament in the United States, 16 teams will now compete in the knockouts for the chance to potentially walk away with up to $125million in prize money for less than a month's work.

European giants Real Madrid, Manchester City, Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan, Paris Saint-Germain and Benfica all topped their groups, while Brazilian clubs Palmeiras and Flamengo were also group-winners.

Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Juventus had to settle for runners-up spots, however, while Lionel Messi's Inter Miami, Botafogo, Monterrey, Fluminense and Al Hilal also progressed to the round of 16.

In a feisty group stage – notable for extreme heat, surprise upsets and red cards – three European sides were eliminated: RB Salzburg, Porto and Atletico Madrid.

Diego Simeone's side were surprisingly pipped to second-place in Group B by Botafogo, despite winning two of their three group matches, including a 1-0 victory over the Brazilian side.

Messi helped to ensure Miami finished ahead of Porto in Group A, scoring a brilliant direct free-kick in a 2-1 win over the Portuguese side in Atlanta.

Miami will be the only Major League Soccer representatives in the knockouts after both Seattle Sounders and Los Angeles FC finished bottom of their groups, with just one point between them.

City were the only club to win all three of their group games, including a 5-2 dismantling of Juventus, who finished as group runners-up. Real, Dortmund, Inter, Benfica and Flamengo were all, though, unbeaten across their three group games.

Argentine giants Boca Juniors and River Plate were also eliminated in the group, along with Al Ahly, Auckland City, ES Tunis, Urawa Reds, Mamelodi Sundowns, Ulsan, Al Ain, Wydad AC and Pachuca.

MIAMI GARDENS, FL — You can hear the music thumping inside the stadium, blaring outside of it. It's only natural to feel the anticipation build.

“Let's get down, let's get down to business” is the catchy Tiësto hook that plays before every FIFA Club World Cup match.

This was my sixth time hearing it at Hard Rock Stadium since the tournament began, but my first as a paying patron for a match between Brazil's Fluminense and South Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns on Wednesday, June 25.

My excitement, however, was quickly hit with a snag before I got past the security gates to get my ticket scanned.

FIFA says “fans are welcome to bring empty, transparent, reusable plastic bottles, up to one liter (33.8 oz) into the stadiums.”

A security attendant told me to finish mine before I could enter. Okay, understandable — I thought — since the policy is “empty.” I was three-quarters of the way done with mine. I had bariatric surgery nine months ago, so it was a test to finish my superfood-infused water with a smaller stomach. But I was able to.

Then, another attendant reached for my bottle and tossed it in a garbage can.

“I thought FIFA allows a water bottle,” I said.

“Not here,” she replied as the bottle fell on top of others in the can.

A mistake on the attendant's part, and since the tournament began FIFA has been in communication with stadium staffs to address these misunderstandings and confusion on entry policies.

FIFA also released a statement last week regarding the extreme heat across the United States, which adds to mounting concerns about player safety and fan welfare during the Club World Cup and next year's FIFA World Cup co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

“FIFA's top priority is the health of everyone involved in football,” a spokesman said. “FIFA will continue to monitor the weather conditions to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.”

The noon and 3 p.m. start times to matches have also been an issue at the height of the heat, providing primetime viewing in other parts of the world.

“I think it's part and parcel of football,"" English captain Harry Kane said after Bayern Munich's win over Boca Juniors. You have to be able to adapt. ... There's something special about these World Cup games, and next year will be the same.

""When you come off that pitch and you're sweating and you're dripping and you're cramping and you've given everything on the pitch – there's a special feeling inside, especially when you win.”

Meanwhile, German giant Borussia Dortmund refused to have players sit on the bench directly in the sun in Cincinnati for their June 21 noon match. It was 87°F (30.5°C).

“Our subs watched the first half from inside the locker room to avoid the blazing sun at TQL Stadium – never seen that before, but in this heat, it absolutely makes sense,” the team said, sharing a photo of players in the locker room on social media.

Here are a few things FIFA could consider before the World Cup next year to address the heat concerns:

– Install mist systems and climate-controlled benches, like NFL teams use during late-summer and winter games, at hosting venues. It might not directly help the players on the field, outside of their cooling breaks in the 30th and 75th minutes, when they hydrate, eat an electrolyte chewable and/or apply a wet towel on themselves. But it's a good starting point.

– Only four of the 11 American venues hosting World Cup games are indoors and should be prioritized for day games: Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, AT&T Stadium outside Dallas, TX, Houston's NRG Stadium and SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. Teams should also get a proceeding night match if they play an early game in the sun.

– FIFA should coordinate with stadium vendors to sell water at cheaper price points. MetLife Stadium sells water for $5, while Hard Rock Stadium for $6. Maybe, FIFA and Ticketmaster could consider a nominal water fee on ticket sales, and just give fans water for free at the concession stands. Hey, just thinking out loud.

– Ticketmaster and other ticket-selling platforms should be transparent and communicate to consumers when and where seats are shaded at stadiums, so they can make informed purchases.

I've attended events at Hard Rock Stadium, as a patron and journalist, for nearly 20 years. I bought a resell ticket on Ticketmaster in section 106, row 2 for $37, figuring I could help a seller offload their purchase. My seat was also covered by the stadium's canopy for the entire match.

But not everyone was so comfortable.

Fluminense fan Matt Benac sat with his back braced up against a concrete wall inside the stadium concourse, waving his black hat in front of his face flushed red, trying to relieve himself from the blazing sun at halftime.

Benac was among five sections of Fluminense fans baking in the lower level where there's no escape from the sunlight unless intercepted by a cloud. There weren't any on this day.

“It's too hot for me to handle,” said Benac, who is from Rio de Janiero, where Fluminense plays. “I'm just out here sitting in the shade trying to have a good time. But it's hard with the sun out there. It's getting me exhausted.”

Despite the conditions, football loving fans will still show up for their favorite teams – and pay the price of bottled water multiple times.

Fluminense fan Rafael Daceo held four empty cups under his arm while shirtless, standing next to his girlfriend Carolina Casaes inside the stadium corridor.

They moved from Rio de Janiero seven months ago to be students at Madison College in Wisconsin, and were sunburnt from a trip to the beach a day earlier. More than welcoming the sun, they attended the Fluminense match because being a fan is in their blood.

Daceo said his father is a Fluminense fan, and his grandfather before them. Casaes said her entire family was watching the match back home in Rio.

“I'm feeling like I'm here with my dad, my brother and my step-father because they love Fluminense. I'm feeling like I'm with them. They are watching, too,” Casaes said. “I'm so grateful to be here. I feel like I'm in Brazil. It's not the same, but the energy is the same. We really miss Brazil right now. Here, we feel a little bit of it.”

Just participating in Club World Cup has brought pride to the players and their fans.

The Fluminense fans cheered until the very end, even raising their intensity in the final 10 minutes of the match as they finished a scoreless draw against the Sundowns but advanced to the Round of 16.

Sundowns players even danced on the pitch in front of their supporters in the stands, after the final whistle concluded their participation in the tournament.

Vuyani Makabe, a South African from Vancouver who flew across the continent for the Miami match, was filled with pride watching his team.

“I never thought as a kid my Mamelodi Sundowns, who I grew up supporting, would actually be competing in a World Cup, and me watching them in Miami,” Makabe said. “This is a dream come true.”","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

    It's an all-Brazilian clash in Philadelphia with a place in the quarterfinals up for grabs.
  

The round of 16 at the FIFA Club World Cup gets underway on Saturday as Brazilian rivals Palmeiras and Botafogo clash at Lincoln Financial Field for a place in the quarterfinals. 

Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to watch every match of the tournament as it happens, wherever you are in the world. We'll also explain how to use a VPN if the match isn't available where you are. 

Botafogo come into today's game unbeaten in their last five competitive matches against Palmeiras, having won three and drawing two of those encounters.

Palmeiras are nevertheless seen by many as favourites to progress, having impressed in the group phase with a comfortable 2-0 win against Al Ahly followed by a battling 2-2 draw against Inter Miami which saw them come back from 2-0 down.

Palmeiras takes on Botafogo on Saturday, June 28, at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Kickoff is set for 12 p.m. ET or 9 a.m. PT. That makes it an 5 p.m. BST start in the UK and an 2 a.m. AEST kickoff in Australia on Sunday morning.

Mauricio's late goal earned Palmeiras a 2-2 draw against Inter Miami in their final group phase match. 

The great news for soccer fans is that sports streaming platform DAZN is set to broadcast all 63 matches of the FIFA Club World Cup free in almost every country, with coverage available in multiple languages.

Existing DAZN subscribers or Freemium members can watch every game of the tournament as part of their current membership.

If you're not a member, it's easy to sign up for a free DAZN Freemium account using your email address to watch all the action at no cost through the DAZN app.

As well as dedicated apps for iOS and Android, DAZN offers a range of support for set-top boxes and smart TVs.

If you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the FIFA Club World Cup soccer action while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. 

It encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds. It can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security. 

However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN use to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance. 

If you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN use is crucial.

ExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN that works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100, you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month.

Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Australia has a second option for watching every game of the tournament live. Alongside DAZN's free coverage, pay TV broadcaster Foxtel and its sister streaming service Kayo will also be showing all 63 games. 

A Kayo Sports subscription starts at AU$25 a month and lets you stream on one screen, while its Premium tier costs AU$40 a month for simultaneous viewing on up to three devices.

The service gives you access to a wide range of sports, including F1, NRL, NFL, NHL and MLB, and there are no lock-in contracts. 

Better still, if you're a new customer, you can take advantage of a one-week Kayo Sports free trial.","{'href': 'https://www.cnet.com', 'title': 'CNET'}","soccer"

The summer signing from Ipswich has seized his opportunity in the U.S. with his rival striker suspended for another brainless red card

As Chelsea's Club World Cup quarter-final against Portuguese giants Benfica looms, head coach Enzo Maresca has already had one selection dilemma decided for him. New £30 million ($41m) signing Liam Delap will almost certainly lead the line in North Carolina, after Nicolas Jackson effectively handed him the starting berth.

A figure said to be close to the legendary Argentine has offered a rare insight into his uncomfortable two-year stint in the French capital, revealing he felt alienated and undermined amid internal tensions at the club.

Taylor Fritz captured a record-extending fourth Lexus Eastbourne Open title on Saturday when he overcame Jenson Brooksby 7-5, 6-1.

The American has turned the ATP 250 grass-court event into a personal playground in recent years, lifting trophies in 2019, 2022, 2024 and now 2025. After earning three third-set victories to reach the final once again this week, Fritz rallied from a break down in the first set against Brooksby before he further established his dominance in the second set to triumph after 88 minutes.



With victory against Brooksby, Fritz moved to 2-1 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, while he improved his Eastbourne record to 17-2, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Fritz, a 10-time tour-level titlist, is the first man since Matteo Berrettini in 2022 to win two grass-court trophies heading into Wimbledon. Earlier this month, the No. 5 player in the PIF ATP Rankings won in Stuttgart.

The 27-year-old is also just the second active man to grab five grass-court tour-level titles, trailing only Novak Djokovic (8).

Brooksby was chasing his second ATP Tour title after winning in Houston in April. The 24-year-old leaves Eastbourne up 48 places at No. 101 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Djokovic gives Sabalenka a pep talk — and himself one for Wimbledon glory","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/djokovic-sabalenka-wimbledon-2025-preview","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 15:38:58 GMT","

When it comes to tennis wisdom, there are few more qualified to share it than Novak Djokovic. Just ask Aryna Sabalenka.

The two stars hit the practice courts together this week at the All England Club, where both are chasing their own slice of Wimbledon history. For Sabalenka, the current WTA World No. 1, the opportunity to train alongside Djokovic wasn't just about hitting balls. It was a rare chance to tap into the mind of a legend.

“Novak is the best,” Sabalenka said during her pre-tournament press conference. “First of all, I was able to hit with him, which not every guy would be able to do. Then you can chat with him. He will give his honest advice. It's amazing to hear the opinion of such a legend.”



Djokovic, the 100-time tour-level champion who competed in the iconic ‘Big Three' era, is no stranger to overcoming adversity — something Sabalenka is hoping to master herself. The 27-year-old fell short in the Australian Open and Roland Garros finals this year, but she will hope Djokovic's insights can give her an edge in her pursuit of a first title at SW19.

“If you give Novak an opportunity to talk, he's not going to stop,” Sabalenka joked. “I wish I could stay there for four hours and just keep chatting. We were just chatting about stuff that I'm kind of struggling with a little bit. I'm really thankful for the advice he gave me.”

Right on cue, Djokovic then made a surprise cameo during Sabalenka's press conference, playfully crashing the session before his own media duties began. Taking a seat beside her, the 24-time major winner couldn't resist teasing Sabalenka with a dose of his trademark dry humour.

“I think you have the potential,” Djokovic joked to Sabalenka. “You're a really talented player. You have nice strokes, good technique. Can I be honest? You're lacking intensity on the court. You don't have enough intensity. It's too flat. You've got to lighten up a little bit, put some power in it.”

Of course, Sabalenka's raw power and ferocity are among the defining features of her game, much like Djokovic's own relentless intensity. The banter between the two highlighted their mutual respect, even as they chase different milestones this fortnight.

For Djokovic, the goal is monumental: An eighth Wimbledon title would see him equal Roger Federer's all-time record at the grass-court major. But while doubts are raised over the 38-year-old's continued prowess, he addressed his campaign head on.

“Whether it could be my last dance, I'm not sure, as I'm not sure about Roland Garros or any other Slam that I play next,” said Djokovic when asked if this could be his final appearance at Wimbledon. “My wish is to play for several more years. I would love to be healthy physically and also mentally motivated to keep on playing at the highest level. That's the goal, but you never know at this stage.

“Wimbledon could be the best chance because of the results I had, because of how I feel, how I play in Wimbledon, just getting that extra push mentally and motivation to perform the best tennis at the highest level.”

Djokovic's path to history won't be easy. A new generation has firmly established itself at the top of the game, led by World No. 1 Jannik Sinner and World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz. Sinner holds a narrow 5-4 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead over Djokovic, having defeated him earlier this month in the semi-finals at Roland Garros.

Meanwhile, Alcaraz has conquered Djokovic in back-to-back Wimbledon finals. Yet, true to form, Djokovic remains undeterred by the rising competition.

“In a sense, you're always hunting because you're always going for the titles — in my also privileged position — the records and more history,” said Djokovic, the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “I do feel that I'm always in that position of going for something with the attitude of trying to win rather than trying to defend.

“Even though I have been many times in my career in that position whether it's the defending champion or being No. 1 in the world, you feel slightly different because I feel everyone wants your position.”

In a year already filled with breakthrough moments, Joao Fonseca will check off another milestone at Wimbledon, where he will make his debut. Ahead of his first-round match, the 18-year-old Brazilian fine-tuned his grass-court game in a high-intensity practice session with two-time defending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz.

Alcaraz and Fonseca warmed up on the lawns of Aorangi Park by rallying crosscourt before they shifted gears into a full practise set, which Alcaraz narrowly won 7-5.

The Spaniard was full of praise for Fonseca's game following the session and shared why he believes the Brazilian has the ability to excel on grass.

""I was excited about hitting with him, since the last time that I hit with him [was] in 2023 [at the Nitto ATP Finals],"" Alcaraz said. ""I have been excited to hit with him since he [arrived] on the ATP. He's quite new on grass. I've been talking with him. He's not really an experienced player on grass. But his style, he loves to play aggressively, to hit big forehands, go to the net. So I'm pretty sure he's going to get the level on grass really, really soon.

""Right now, [there are] a few things that he has to learn because he's so young and he is just starting to play the new tournaments. But his level is pretty high so far.""

Earlier this week, Fonseca notched his first tour-level grass-court victory at the ATP 250 event in Eastbourne. The 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion will face Jacob Fearnley in the first round at the All England Club.

Alcaraz, fresh of his Queen's Club title, will try to become just the second man in the Open Era, alongside Bjorn Borg, to complete the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in consecutive years. The Spaniard is also aiming to become just the fifth player in the Open Era to win three consecutive Wimbledon titles.

""I really want to win the title. I really want to lift the trophy,"" Alcaraz said. ""[I'm] not thinking about how many players have done it, winning three Wimbledons in a row. I just want to be ready and just want to prepare myself in the best way possible, just to start the tournament with a lot of confidence. I feel a lot of confidence right now.""

Alcaraz will open Centre Court play on Monday against Fabio Fognini.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Sinner reveals toughest part of grass transition, recovery from Alcaraz epic","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-wimbledon-2025-preview","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 16:46:28 GMT","

Jannik Sinner has cemented his status as one of the dominant forces on the ATP Tour over the past year, but as he returns to Wimbledon, there's still unfinished business.

The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has had time to reflect on his gut-wrenching defeat to Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros, where he let slip three consecutive championship points. Now, his focus shifts to another challenge: the tricky transition from clay to grass.

When asked about the biggest hurdle in adapting to grass-court tennis, Sinner was direct in his response.

“Movement, for sure, because the movement is the most important part for us tennis players,” Sinner said in Saturday's pre-tournament press conference. “If someone moves well, it means that he is a good player. That's how I see tennis from outside.

“You have to cover the spots more, improvise a little bit more on the other sides. It's a very different game style we see on grass.”



Despite the difficulties of switching surfaces, Sinner has already shown he's capable of adjusting. Last season, just two weeks after falling in the Roland Garros semi-finals, the Italian lifted his first grass-court trophy in Halle.

However, his title defence at the German ATP 500 didn't go as planned this year, with Sinner bowing out in the second round to Alexander Bublik. That loss, coupled with his defeat to rival Alcaraz, who now leads Sinner 8-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, might raise doubts over his momentum heading into Wimbledon.

But the top seed is unfazed.

“Honestly, I feel ready to play. We are practising very well,” said Sinner. “What happened in the past is in the past already. I feel good. I feel especially mentally I feel in a very good spot. Halle was a little bit different, because before I haven't had so much time to cut that off. Now it's gone, and I also see the reactions of other players and people. They [said] the level is very, very high. Just privileged to be in this position.

“We are working very hard. I feel like I'm playing great, great tennis on grass. Hopefully I can show this also in the match court. I'm just looking forward to going on court and to compete and enjoy the time.”

Sinner has plenty of positive memories at the All England Club. While Wimbledon remains the only major where he's yet to reach the final, he's enjoyed deep runs — reaching the semi-finals in 2023, losing to Novak Djokovic, and making the quarter-finals in 2022 and 2024.

“It feels good again after one year coming back here,” said Sinner, who faces countryman Luca Nardi in his opener. “I'm very happy. I have some good feelings coming here, even though it's a bit different than last year, coming with the win in Halle.

“But it's good. I had some time off before coming here. We are practicing very well. The days are long. So I feel ready to compete again.”

Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka ended any talk of tension by practicing and dancing together at Wimbledon after their heated Roland Garros final. Sabalenka apologized for her viral post-match remarks, and Gauff made it clear: “We're good.”

Rumors of any bad blood between Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka have been greatly exaggerated. 

The top two players in the PIF WTA Rankings offered proof that all is well between them after heated scenes both during and following their recent Roland Garros final by practicing -- and dancing -- together at Wimbledon on Friday, posting videos on social media.

“TikTok dances always had a way of bringing people together,” Sabalenka wrote on Instagram as the two revealed a choreographed clip to “Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)” by C+C Music Factory after a Centre Court practice session.

Gauff, meanwhile, posted a video of the two on the grounds of the All England Club lip-syncing to an audio track with the words: “OK, guys, we're back. Did you miss us? 'Cause we missed you.”

A post shared by TNT Sports (@tntsports)

After Gauff came from a set down to defeat Sabalenka for her second Grand Slam title in Paris, Sabalenka's emotional post-match comments -- saying she felt she “lost the match more than Coco won it” -- sparked chatter online and in the media about whether tension existed between the pair.

Gauff repeatedly downplayed any notion of a feud, telling ESPN, “She's probably emotional about [the loss], so I'm not going to take it with too much anything, and I hope people give her a bit of slack too.”

Speaking during Wimbledon media day Saturday, Sabalenka clarified she didn't intend to disrespect Gauff, explaining she had messaged her directly to apologize when she wasn't sure if they would cross paths before London.

“I didn't really want to offend her,"" Sabalenka said. ""I was just completely upset with myself, and emotions got over me. I wanted to say it in person to her, but I wasn't sure if she was going to come to Berlin, so I had to message her to apologize and make sure she understood it.”

Gauff quickly accepted the apology, telling Sabalenka it was “all good, don't worry,” which Sabalenka said was a relief.

“As you saw in the video, we are good, we are friends,"" Sabalenka said. ""I hope the U.S. media can be easy on me right now.”

Sabalenka acknowledged that the aftermath of Paris became a moment of reflection.

“Usually after losing, I'm quite good,” she said. “It's just this time it was super tough for me. I don't know why. I wanted it badly, and the emotions took over. I think I realized a lot about myself after Paris, and I really hope it will never happen again.”

She admitted she turned to reading as a way to reset.

“I'm glad I had a book in Mykonos so I could just get distracted by reading,” she said with a laugh. “The lesson is learned.”

A post shared by Wimbledon (@wimbledon)

The sporting scenes were received warmly by fans, and even impressed U.S. Olympic rugby player Ilona Maher. The bronze medalist shared a clip of the dance to her Instagram story with the caption, “Too many legends in one video.""

“We need to make one with you,” Sabalenka wrote in response.

Carlos Alcaraz's victory over Jannik Sinner in the French Open 2025 final is one that will go down as legend in the tennis history books — but their titanic contest was almost missed by one of the greatest tennis players of all time, as Novak Djokovic revealed that he had no intention of tuning in for the first grand slam final between the two players seen as his successors at the top of the sport.

However, Djokovic did tune in to watch Alcaraz's historic come-from-behind victory in which he saved three match points before winning a phenomenal final-set tiebreaker. Speaking to Wimbledon's social media channels while practicing against the Spaniard on Centre Court, Djokovic recited the tale of how his son Stefan and wife Jelena were more interested in the match than he was, leaving Alcaraz smiling with joy.

“To be quite honest with you, I was in my country with my family. My son and my wife wanted to watch the finals badly. I said I didn't want to watch the finals, I got enough of tennis,” explained Djokovic. The Serb former world number one had been easily beaten by Sinner in the semifinal round just days prior. 

Djokovic full of praise for Sinner and Alcaraz showcase“The first part of the match, we spent outside, had lunch. They were very anxious to get back home so they can turn on the TV when the guys were playing. We came back and I was like I don't know if I want to watch,” explained the men's grand slam record holder. However, once he had gotten a sniff of the quality on show between these two remarkable athletes, he was hooked on to watch. “But the match was so captivating that of course we ended up watching for another few hours. They played almost 6 hours, it's incredible,” said the 38-year-old. “Incredible match, I gave huge credit to both of them for producing this battle for not just the tennis world but the sports world to enjoy. It was just one of the most historic matches that we had.” Sinner and Alcaraz, now the number one and two in the world, will be the favourites heading into Wimbledon, where the Spaniard is gunning for a hat-trick of titles. However, seven-time champion Djokovic will be fancying his chances to push the two younger stars, having reached the final each of the last two years and hungry for a record-setting 25th grand slam title. His campaign begins with a first round match against Frenchman Alexandre Muller.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Life lessons from the 2025 French Open","https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/544062/life-lessons-2025-french-open/","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 10:31:00 GMT","

Paris is always a good idea, so said Audrey Hepburn. And in May, in the springtime light and air as crisp as the sun is mild, it's a great idea. Throw in tickets to the French Open at Roland Garros—the women's semifinal and ground passes for the men's semifinal, then for a tennis-playing, tennis fan couple, it is a dream come true, no matter who we were scheduled to see.

While we admit, we harbored hopes that our very own Alex Eala or even former US Open 2021 finalist Leylah Fernandez might still be in the running, we knew these were long shots that none of it mattered. We booked the airfares and the hotel because life is short and you only live once. You have to take your chances, play your game, and go for your shots.

We found ourselves in Paris on a brisk, rainy morning, in fact the forecast indicated rain for the entire week. Still nothing could dampen our spirits. We were in Paris, and we had tickets to the French Open. Not surprisingly, the entire city was like us; tennis on its mind—”Always On Your Mind” was the campaign theme of major sponsor partner Renault. Establishments served up Perrier sparkling water in bottles and cans done in tennis theme and Roland Garros colors complete with “tennis ball” lemons. Roland Garros merch was ubiquitous in multiple pop-up shops on city avenues as well as at the Galleries Lafayette.

In the afternoon, fortified by lunch and a nap, we fumbled with raincoats and umbrellas on our first promenade up Champs-Élysées. When we came upon Tribune Concord, we were transfixed with delight. Here was a free fan zone with two gigantic screens surrounded by deck chairs, bleachers, serviced with food trucks, a bar, and portalets courtesy of Roland Garros and the City of Paris. It was the French Open's first ever effort to extend the electric tennis atmosphere beyond Stade Roland Garros in Porte d'Auteuil to reach the very heart of Paris at the Place dela Concorde, a venue for as many as 5,000 Parisiens, tourists, and tennis enthusiasts.

The husband and I looked at each other with glee. Problem solved. We would see all the other matches including the finals from Tribune Concord!

“What about seeing Paris?” 

“We'll always have Paris. And anyway, right now Paris is Roland Garros.”

Such was the depth of our tennis bug, and despite being late to the ball in our 40s, our love affair has endured. The draw was always well beyond the competing players or indeed, who triumphed and who was vanquished. The sheer play of it was what counted. For when the ball struck the strings, the pop was hypnotic. A return ripped at a wide angle beyond reach never failed to thrill. And the exhilaration of an overhead smash bouncing to heights beyond retrieving? Unmatched. Ultimately, tennis offers rewards beyond the physical. It's an epic novel, a world of play and possibility, a competition between contenders, but also, a primeval conflict between the individual and the self.

With every match, a basket fills to overflowing with insights, lessons and life strategies that have everyday resonance. To be sure, all sports are metaphors for life yet tennis delivers in scores on world view and philosophy. It allows us to cope with human frailty, conquer it, and maybe, just maybe, even transcend it.

So here, a set of my own not so random meditations on life lived fully, wisely, and well, gleaned from Roland Garros in Paris.

Court Suzanne-Lenglen (named for the inaugural French champion and World Number 1 from 1921-1926, winning eight slams in singles) hosted an intense women's doubles match between Legends: Three-time Grand Slam singles champion, former world number 1 in singles and doubles Lindsay Davenport and her partner former top 10 Andrea Petkovic versus 1998 Wimbledon finalist and former world number 3 Nathalie Tauziat and her partner, former world number 2 Annett Kontaveit, who was forced by serious injuries to retire in 2023. Now, a Legends match is by nature an exhibition, but these four athletes brought their game.

There was no fooling around in the play, and even though there were a few moments of mirth, they were few and far between. It was also clear that all the players had still retained more than a measure of their skills. Points were extended by a high level of volley play and shrewd placement of balls on angles. These legends were there to play, but also to compete, and the scores reflected that. The first set ended in a tie-breaker, with Davenport and Petkovic taking it 8-6. In the second set, Tauziat and Kontaveit put up some great plays, with the former demonstrating she still has a deep set of skills. At one point, Tauziat served up a winner that provoked her own delight. She turned to the spectators in the stands and enjoined, both hands raised, to cheer for it. In that moment, she was not a Legend; in that moment, she was right back where she had been. Muscle memory had kicked in. She was a tennis pro.

Davenport and Petkovic kept their focus and movement, and took the second set 6-3 and the win. Done with the match, the pairs congratulated each other with genuine congeniality (often not visible in regular WTA tournaments, which is understandable). But in this competition, not just for their match, not just for their play that day, but for the joy that they all shared, and remarkably, will continue to share: the joy of tennis.

Men and women are different, and the partnerships that triumph are the ones that focus not on the differences that divide them but on what they share and what unites them.

People who play doubles understand that it is a completely different game from singles. With wider court space, extremely angled shots are not only possible, they are necessary. Points tend to be shorter because of the poach at the net and of course, teamwork and communication come into play. These are absent in singles. All these things converge in a powerful combination to set up something that's extraordinarily exciting to watch, one that's not solely dependent on power and baseline interplay, but a variety of shots and a diversity of placement that  makes use of all the court space available.

Finally, because it's mixed doubles, the male-female dynamic is its own force, and chemistry can be electric and always suspenseful to witness. The nature of mixed doubles is likely the reason the US Open upped their ante with Spectacular Remixed—switching up their mixed doubles events and lining up unexpected and thrilling partnerships—among them Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz, Aryna Sabalenka and Grigor Dimitrov, Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe, among many others.

Thank goodness for Court Philippe Chatrier, which of late now has a retractable roof. Here, we were fortunate to see the mixed doubles finals match between veteran doubles champ Sara Errani (five-time Grand Slam doubles champion and 2021 French Open singles finalist) and her young compatriot partner Andrea Vavvasori go up against American contenders Taylor Townsend (two-time Grand Slam doubles champion) and Evan King. 

As much as they tried, the Americans could not get the better of the Italian team, unable to take even a single set. Nevertheless, the action was spectacular and certainly not for the Americans' lack of trying.

With few exceptions, the reality is women and men play different kinds of games, and that is most especially clear when they play together. Men tend to draw on their muscle and firepower and make repeated onslaughts at the perceived weaker player, while the women lean toward more placement, going for open spaces, changing up their shots and switching directions.

Ultimately, Errani was a decisive leader on court, and the Italians were in constant communication. Through many long points, Errani directed her partner to create opportunities she herself seized, patiently waiting for the right moment of vulnerability at which she would suddenly, powerfully put the ball away into regions that were just out of her opponent's reach.

While Townsend and King were powerful and energetic, they did not  stand a chance against the wisdom of experience. That's what Errani had, and her partner simply followed her lead. Townsend did plenty and had fewer errors than King who was often found standing a little too close to the net and making a target of himself for Errani. Meanwhile, Vavvasori followed Errani's lead and made his opponents run for it, not just blasting the ball back at them. While the first set was close at 6-4, the Italians pulled away in the second set and finished the Americans off, 6-2, using the skills they had in common.

Upon accepting her first trophy of the Open, Errani, who was the oldest player on court, said, “I love tennis. I will keep playing as long as I can. It's so good to learn something new every day.”

It's been three years now since Iga Swiatek's 37-match winning streak, the longest in WTA history in this century, which catapulted her from #54 to #1. But the pressure to stay dominant, to keep winning, to keep her place has clearly undermined her. She's been facing an identity crisis of sorts, exacerbated by a doping suspension late last year. These days, the icy focus is sometimes only a thin veneer beneath which lurks anxiety and fear.

 

 

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

Swiatek was defending French Open champion (having defeated Jasmine Paolini in 2024); nevertheless, she was number 5 to Aryna Sabalenka's fairly freshly minted number 1. And though she led their head-to-head, having won eight of the 12 matches they had played thus far, including the last three on clay, she knew Sabalenka was clearly going to be a challenge.  She had power shots, a mighty serve, height and length of reach, and fiery  emotions, which on occasion could be her undoing. It promised to be an exciting, nail-biting match.

We did get a few glimpses of Swiatek's old self as she held her own against Sabalenka's huge serves, coming up from behind in the first set, and getting to 4-4 despite being broken twice, and then forcing a tie-breaker. Unfortunately, uncertainty filtered in, and Swiatek was shaky, losing the tiebreak, 6-1.

Both played aggressively and initially, made a fairly equal number of errors. Swiatek took the second set, 6-4, giving herself another chance. However that final set was disastrous, as she tried to get a grip and find her game. Unfortunately, it was one Sabalenka had already read. With her first serve missing in action, the defending champion was served a bagel in the deciding set. For us, Swiatek fans, it was a hard loss to take.

We had barely caught our breath when it was time for the second match; this time between French qualifier Lois Boisson, who was making her debut Roland Garros semifinal after defeating Elise Mertens, Jessica Pegula, Mirra Andreeva on the way.

 

 

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

Armed with a heavy forehand and a sneaky dropshot, Boisson came out guns blazing against Coco Gauff. She also had the very vocal majority of the crowd at Court Philippe Chatrier cheering her on and chanting her name. But it was not to be. Whether it was pressure or nerves, or both, it was all for naught. Gauff, all calm and cool, played possibly the cleanest match we'd ever witnessed, breaking Boisson's serve, and finishing her off, 6-1, 6-2 in an hour or so, leaving her opponent in tears of frustration and disappointment.

“When you were all chanting her name, I just heard my own name. Because you have to do that…” Gauff said with a grin.

No one really expected Lorenzo Musetti to beat Carlos Alcaraz, and we were not all that familiar with the former's game. But seeing how the Italians had thus far dominated the French Open, what with Paolini and Errani, Errani and Vavvasori, and then of course, Jannik Sinner, we were excited to see what Musetti would offer, and hoped the very least that he would put up a fight.

 

 

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

When Musetti took the first set, I was thrilled, but the husband said: “That's just Alcaraz toying with him.” Sure enough, Alcaraz advanced to win the second and third sets before Musetti retired with an inner thigh injury early in the fourth. All was well. Alcaraz was in the final. 4-6, 7-6, 6-0, 2-0.

The French lady beside me was disappointed. “I know everyone likes Alcaraz, but I'm already tired of him. Things are too easy for him.” I nodded. I shared that feeling myself.

We lucked into Errani and Jasmine Paolini's practice session, and saw their serves up close, observed their easy partnership, all play and smiles and jokes around, but the two had hitting partners with them, and they played actual points at the net. After some time, the Russians 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva and 21-year-old Diana Shnaider came to claim their practice time on the same court.

This in the morning, in preparation for when they meet for the semifinal match at 4 p.m. When Paolini saw them coming, she called out, nicely. “I have four minutes left!” The Russians grinned, and waited for them to finish. Then  they started their session: practicing serves and hitting drives, but no actual points.

Again, 38-year-old Errani proved a leader once again, dictating plays and creating put-away opportunities for Paolini. The Russians didn't stand a chance. They lost 6-0, 6-1 and the Italians went on to take the final.

We know what happened in the second men's semifinal. It was close on all three sets—as close as it could be. Sinner won 6-4, 7-5, 7-6, which meant that Djokovic gave it all he had, matching Sinner—point for point—until he gave way. What are you going to do? That's tennis. Djokovic was applauded off the court, and in the winner's interview, you almost sensed a wistfulness, even a small sadness in the young man, as he took the time to speak about Djokovic as a competitor and all the good he has done for the sport as a role model.  “He is the best player in the history of our sport.”

There are all sorts of reasons Sabalenka could have and should have won this final. But the truth is, she did not play the same match she played against Swiatek. Her emotion in that semifinal was present but not wild and uncontrollable. But on the windy day of the final, Sabalenka allowed her emotions to run away with her, so much so that she completely lost her head.

 

 

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

Even in the sets and points she won, she looked close to tears, as though her very own emotions were unhinging her. She complained about the conditions and blamed them for her errors. Meanwhile, Gauff was calm. She analyzed the situation, and managed her shot selection. She saw that Sabalenka was struggling with high balls on her backhand, and she kept on giving them to her. Even when she was down after the first set, she went back to fundamentals and built her game. She dug her heels in and pulled out the win, 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-4, to earn her first French Open title and her second Grand Slam trophy.

There is truly nothing more to say about the Roland Garros final we happened to witness in the shadow of the mighty Egyptian Luxor Obelisk at the historic Place de la Concorde, the setting calling to mind ancient epic battles. Five suspenseful sets. Sinner was mindful and methodical, taking not just the first set but the second, in a way, echoing his match against Novak Djokovic two days prior. But again, almost as my husband said, he was toying with Sinner even when he was down three match points; Alcaraz summoned his powers, instincts, and sheer brute athleticism in an almost push-button manner. He took the critical third set, at 6-4.

 

 

A post shared by Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros)

Sinner hung in there and gave it his all for five hours, but the knowledge that loomed large, even amid the crowd, was the fact that he had not beaten the Spaniard since 2023 in Beijing. In their head-to-head, Alcaraz defeated Sinner seven out of the last 11 times they played, including the four prior to the French Open. On the other hand, Sinner dug deep and did all he could to switch it up. He did not give his opponent any free points while giving himself new chances in both the fourth and third sets, but the Spaniard thrives on tiebreakers, winning the fourth, 7-6(3), and the fifth set super tiebreaker, 7-6(10-2).

The sun set on Paris, casting the Concorde Tribune in a luminous, orange glow, but it also set on Sinner's hopes for his first French Open title. Five hours: 6-4, 7-6(4), 4-6, 6-7(3),6-7(10-2).

As he spoke, clearly both mentally and physically exhausted, slightly pale, his first words were congratulations to Alcaraz, and he went on to thank his team, admitting how hard it was in that moment, but ever grateful for the privilege of playing the final, and cognizant of his high level of tennis and all he had achieved. Sinner proved himself a class act, and earned the respect and admiration of even those who supported Alcaraz. If anything, this attitude, this mark of character, recalled the past greats, the gentleman champion of tennis himself, Roger Federer. One thing was certain; Sinner was not and would never be a loser, no matter the heartbreak of loss.

We slowly filed out of the gallery along with the other 4,988 people, and walked back to our hotel off Champs Elysee close to 9 p.m. in the evening, quietly musing over the past four days and all the things we'd seen and learned in Paris at the French Open, hopefully things we will never forget.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Carlos Alcaraz told he was ‘very clever' with behavior against Jannik Sinner","https://www.themirror.com/sport/tennis/alcaraz-sinner-french-open-wimbledon-1233245","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 11:37:00 GMT","

The 2025 French Open men's singles final will forever be etched in tennis history as a classic. However, Jannik Sinner's coach has cast the spotlight on a particular aspect of Carlos Alcaraz's triumph that particularly worked in his favor.

In what's shaping up to be a rivalry for the record books, Alcaraz staged a legendary comeback against Sinner in Paris. There, he overcame a two-set deficit to triumph in a five-set tennis thriller at Roland Garros and deny Sinner the crown in agonizing fashion.

The win was all the sweeter for the Spanish sensation as he showcased an extraordinary level of grit to clinch the title. And in fact, theirs was the first final in French Open history to be decided via a tiebreak in the last set.

However, coach Simone Vagnozzi delivered a 13-word summary of Alcaraz's savvy tactics that highlighted how the youngster rallied the crowd in his favor. And it's a strategy that may prove advantageous in future matches, too.

""Alcaraz was also a bit 'smart' to get the crowd on his side,"" said Vagnozzi, via the Daily Express. ""He was down two sets to zero and needed energy. He was good at managing it this way.""

Given his Spanish roots and the legacy of compatriot Rafael Nadal in Paris, it's not that surprising that Alcaraz has a robust fan base in France. Nevertheless, Vagnozzi offered a gracious perspective and suggested that while the crowd's enthusiasm buoyed Alcaraz, it didn't detract from Sinner's performance.

""I think the crowd was key to boosting Alcaraz, but not to penalize Jannik,"" he continued. ""The truth is that Carlos was very clever in seeking people's support and managed it well, but we cannot use that as a key factor for the outcome.

""There are times when playing with people against you can also be good, as extra motivation, and we must not forget that in Rome, Sinner was the one who had most of the support.""

Players can often be boosted or face courtside opposition depending on crowd support at various venues. And it's generally a given that this back-and-forth is intrinsic to conquering the sport's grandest arenas.

The likes of Roger Federer and Scotland's Andy Murray built up heavy affinities at Wimbledon during the course of their careers. Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic's 10 titles at the Australian Open made him a great Down Under.

Alcaraz has tasted victory on all but one elite stage, boasting two French Open victories, two Wimbledon triumphs, and a U.S. Open title. However, the Australian Open crown continues to elude his grasp.

Sinner, on the other hand, has shown a particular affinity for Melbourne and has won two Australian Open titles, in addition to the U.S. Open trophy he lifted last year.

As he gears up for Wimbledon 2025 this week, the young talent knows full well how much sway spectators can have over his performance at the All England Club. However, he can at least hope to win over more of his own supporters on English soil.

In a year already filled with breakthrough moments, Joao Fonseca will check off another milestone at Wimbledon, where he will make his debut. Ahead of his first-round match, the 18-year-old Brazilian fine-tuned his grass-court game in a high-intensity practice session with two-time defending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz.

Alcaraz and Fonseca warmed up on the lawns of Aorangi Park by rallying crosscourt before they shifted gears into a full practise set, which Alcaraz narrowly won 7-5.

The Spaniard was full of praise for Fonseca's game following the session and shared why he believes the Brazilian has the ability to excel on grass.

""I was excited about hitting with him, since the last time that I hit with him [was] in 2023 [at the Nitto ATP Finals],"" Alcaraz said. ""I have been excited to hit with him since he [arrived] on the ATP. He's quite new on grass. I've been talking with him. He's not really an experienced player on grass. But his style, he loves to play aggressively, to hit big forehands, go to the net. So I'm pretty sure he's going to get the level on grass really, really soon.

""Right now, [there are] a few things that he has to learn because he's so young and he is just starting to play the new tournaments. But his level is pretty high so far.""

Earlier this week, Fonseca notched his first tour-level grass-court victory at the ATP 250 event in Eastbourne. The 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion will face Jacob Fearnley in the first round at the All England Club.

Alcaraz, fresh of his Queen's Club title, will try to become just the second man in the Open Era, alongside Bjorn Borg, to complete the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in consecutive years. The Spaniard is also aiming to become just the fifth player in the Open Era to win three consecutive Wimbledon titles.

""I really want to win the title. I really want to lift the trophy,"" Alcaraz said. ""[I'm] not thinking about how many players have done it, winning three Wimbledons in a row. I just want to be ready and just want to prepare myself in the best way possible, just to start the tournament with a lot of confidence. I feel a lot of confidence right now.""

Alcaraz will open Centre Court play on Monday against Fabio Fognini.

On Friday afternoon, multiple news outlets reported that Jannik Sinner had shaken up his coaching staff just a few days before the start of Wimbledon.

In a shocking move, Sinner parted ways with with athletic trainer Marco Panichi and physiotherapist Ulises Badio. Panichi and Badio had been on Sinner's staff for less than a year, and no reason was initially provided for the decision.

However, Sinner faced the media today for his pre-tournament press conference at Wimbledon. Fans can watch the full video on the Wimbledon website. Of course, the first few questions were about Sinner's surprising staff move.

""Nothing major happened, nothing big happened. I parted ways not long ago. But it has not affected me. I feel ready to compete. I feel free. I feel me and my team, we are ready to do the best we can,"" explained Sinner.

""I'm here to play good tennis. That's my main goal. That's my main reason I'm here. We've reached incredible results in the past with them, so obviously huge thanks to them. We made some great job, but I decided to do something different. It's going to be interesting to see what I can do here in London.""

When asked again, Sinner deflected, ""As I said, there is not one specific thing. Nothing crazy happened. For sure, not. We made some great work. For me the final in Roland Garros was an amazing achievement. That's it.""

""In this sport, things can happen. There is nothing incredible odd because sometimes a player feels something different. And that is my case.""

When asked when he made the decision to shake up his staff, Sinner answered straightly, ""Yeah, it was after Halle.""

Sinner lost to Alexander Bublik in the Round of 16 at the Halle Open. The Italian Superstar is still the ATP World No. 1 with a record of 19-3 with one singles title (the Australian Open). He faces Luca Nardi in the first round on Monday, July 1.

Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic are among the favourites for the Wimbledon men's singles title

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage details.

Carlos Alcaraz will begin his bid for a third Wimbledon title in a row when the Grand Slam begins on Monday.

The question is - can anyone stop him?

The Spanish world number two defeated seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in the previous two men's finals on Centre Court at SW19.

The 22-year-old could follow Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer and Djokovic by becoming only the fifth player in the Open era to win three straight Wimbledon men's singles titles.

Following his epic French Open final triumph over world number one Jannik Sinner, Alcaraz clinched the Queen's title to start his grass-court season on a high.

While Jack Draper leads Britain's hopes of a home champion, BBC Sport takes a look at who else could challenge Alcaraz over the coming fortnight.

Alcaraz and the art of court positioning 

Novak Djokovic won Wimbledon for the seventh time in 2022

Age: 38 Country: Serbia Ranking: 6 Strength: Defence

Djokovic had won four Wimbledon titles in a row before losing a five-set thriller to Alcaraz in 2023.

Alcaraz swept Djokovic aside a year later to again deny the former world number one a record-equalling eighth men's title.

Djokovic continues to pursue an outright-record 25th major singles title since drawing level with Margaret Court at the 2023 US Open.

A new era in men's tennis has dawned, with Alcaraz and Sinner sharing the past six slams between them - and seven of the past eight since Alcaraz's first Wimbledon title two years ago.

But Djokovic, behind only Roger Federer for men's titles won at SW19, remains an ever-present threat on the sport's biggest stages - not least on grass - as he pursues yet another historic feat.

Jannik Sinner retained his Australian Open title in January 

Age: 23 Country: Italy Ranking: 1 Strength: Precision

Sinner was devastated by his loss to Alcaraz at Roland Garros, after taking a two-set lead and missing three championship points in the fourth set of what became a five-and-a-half-hour epic.

He has reached at least the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in the past three years, with his best run ended by a semi-final defeat by Djokovic in 2023.

But a surprise second-round loss to Alexander Bublik at the Halle Open this month cut short the world number one's latest competitive preparations.

Sinner has maintained his stranglehold on the top ranking for 12 months, despite serving a three-month doping suspension earlier this year.

It means he can only meet second seed Alcaraz in the final - something that would be eagerly anticipated after their Roland Garros thriller.

Alexander Bublik had never gone beyond the fourth round at a major before this year's French Open

Age: 28 Country: Kazakhstan Ranking: 30 Strength: Drop shot

Bublik's resurgence continues to gather momentum.

The Kazakh's career had stagnated to the point that he considered quitting tennis after losing in the Wimbledon third round last year.

Bublik lost eight of his first 10 matches in 2025 as he fell to 82nd place in the rankings, but his coach's suggestion of a Hangover-style reset in Las Vegas - a reference to the 2009 comedy film - appears to have worked wonders.

After reaching his first Grand Slam singles quarter-final with a superb run at the French Open, the unpredictable Bublik won the Halle Open to rise to 30th in the world.

His victory over Sinner was one of four wins over top-eight seeds on the way to an emotional title triumph - proving that, on his day, he is a match for anyone.

Daniil Medvedev has contested six Grand Slam finals

Age: 29 Country: Russia Ranking: 9 Strength: Return

A Wimbledon semi-finalist in each of the past two years, can Medvedev take the next step this time?

Medvedev is one of just six active men's players to win a singles major, having triumphed at the 2021 US Open - but he has lost his five other major finals.

The former world number one is a hard-court specialist - his six major finals have been split between the Australian Open and US Open - but he has a solid recent record at Wimbledon.

He was stopped by eventual champion Alcaraz in the last four in both 2023 and 2024, winning the first set in last year's meeting on Centre Court before being overpowered.

He prepared for this year's tournament by reaching the Halle final, losing to Bublik in straight sets, and will expect another deep run at Wimbledon.

Jiri Lehecka took Carlos Alcaraz to a deciding set in the Queen's final but lost 7-5 6-7 (5-7) 6-2

Age: 23 Country: Czech Republic Ranking: 25 Strength: Forehand

Lehecka crashed the party at Queen's by beating Draper en route to the final, where he offered admirable resistance in a three-set loss to Alcaraz.

The 23-year-old reached a career-high rank of 22 in February after winning his first eight matches of the year, clinching the Brisbane title before losing to Djokovic in the Australian Open fourth round.

A run to the Madrid Open semi-finals last year - where he beat the great Rafael Nadal and Medvedev - was ended by an unfortunate back injury, which ultimately ruled him out of Wimbledon.

Back to full fitness this year, he demonstrated his grass-court pedigree at Queen's and will look to maintain that momentum to improve on his fourth-round appearance at Wimbledon in 2023.

If you would like to follow The Athletic's Wimbledon coverage, click here and follow our tennis page. 

Is Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff's olive branch a sign of things on court?

Is Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner's dominance of men's tennis about to go up another level?

Is the disappearance of line judges going to cause more problems than solutions?

And will the biggest battle at Wimbledon this fortnight be not on the court, but in it?

Wimbledon 2025 promises to be a cracker. Here, The Athletic's tennis writers, Matt Futterman and Charlie Eccleshare, chart some of the key storylines to follow over the next fortnight.

Sabalenka is having an outrageous season. She is constantly making finals. She has won tournaments in Brisbane, Miami and Madrid. She is more than 2,000 points ahead of world No. 2 Gauff in the WTA rankings race that counts points won this season.

But it also hurts her that she doesn't have the three titles she wanted to win more than all the others: the Australian Open, the French Open and Indian Wells. (And Stuttgart. The one that comes with the Porsche car. She really wanted to win the Porsche. And the lost the final there. Again.)

Sabalenka isn't great at losing, just like most champions. She finds it so crushing to lose these matches that while it's happening, while the world is watching, she's visibly miserable. She's yelling at herself. She's yelling at her box. Every champion who loses feels this way, and only some let it out. It makes Sabalenka one of the most compelling players on the tour, because fans — and her rivals' fans — live every moment with her like it's their career on the line.

After losing to Gauff at Roland Garros, Sabalenka spoke, first on court and then in her news conference, about how horribly she played. She barely gave any credit to Gauff until after the event. Then she apologized for what she called her “unprofessional” comments. Then they came to Wimbledon and made a TikTok or two. Gauff said they were good, so the rest of the world should be too. Then Wimbledon posted that on their own social media, which came off more strangely. Should a tournament be casting its top seeds as best friends? Does the tennis world not want more rivalries?

The grass suits Sabalenka. She's the favorite, hands down. She has the power for it, the serve and the movement, as well as her ever-evolving variety and touch and feel. She's only won Grand Slams on hard courts, and Wimbledon is the Grand Slam that completes a career, so the pressure is there, but she might be far enough ahead of her rivals for that not to matter.

Gauff's forehand grip makes it very difficult for her to win on such a low-bouncing surface. Madison Keys, who beat Sabalenka in Australia, could trouble her. Markéta Vondroušová, a potential third-round opponent, beat Sabalenka in Berlin and has won Wimbledon before. The 2022 champion Elena Rybakina cannot be discounted. Iga Świątek, who uses a similar forehand grip to Gauff, has been making the Bad Homburg grass in Germany her living room this week.

And if Sabalenka does make the final, it's more likely than not that said final will be stressful, that she will not play a perfect match, because no one ever does.

So can she win? And if she can't, can she redirect her energy away from the way it manifested in Melbourne, Indian Wells and Paris? Sabalenka is a big Novak Djokovic fan. Djokovic is an incredible winner — he has 24 Grand Slams. He's also an incredibly gracious loser, in public. That's taken as the thing to be in tennis — even if some needle is good for business and for the sport.

Matt Futterman

Remember what it was like to be a tennis fan this time of year between 2006 and 2008, when Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer contested the final of the French Open and Wimbledon for three consecutive years. Federer won the U.S. Open in each of those years, and the Australian Open in 2006 and 2007.

It was an incredible rivalry and a testament to their dominance of the sport. It was great. Wasn't it?

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have now won every Grand Slam since the start of 2024. It's great. Or is it? And if it isn't, can anyone who's going to be contending in three years (that means anyone not named Djokovic) do anything about it?

This is the question that Holger Rune, Lorenzo Musetti, Jack Draper, Ben Shelton and some players even younger than them are going to have to start answering. Tennis, meanwhile, might have to get better acquainted with the difference between a player's ceiling and their current peak.

Draper has won a Masters 1,000 title, the rung below a Grand Slam. So has Rune. So has Jakub Menšík. Musetti has been in a final at that level. Shelton reserves his best tennis for the majors. But it's João Fonseca who gets the most adulation, who looks the player best positioned to challenge the Alcaraz-Sinner duopoly despite never being ranked inside the top 50.

Why? He's 18, sure, but Menšík is barely 19 and inside the top 20. Draper is No. 4 in the world. How can he be the one and not them, when they have better results?

Now we get to ceilings. Alcaraz and Sinner finished inside the top 40 in their first full seasons on the main ATP Tour. Fonseca is on his way to something like that. He has a cannon forehand. He can direct his backhand down the line almost better than he hits it crosscourt. He can take rackets out of top-10 players' hands. Just not consistently yet, and he hasn't worked out how to grind reliably when his first plan doesn't work. Menšík and Learner Tien, who Fonseca beat to win the ATP Next Gen Finals last year, are more ready for deeper runs than Fonseca is for now. For the long term? The Brazilian is ready for the biggest things in the sport.

So is someone coming into disrupt this duopoly anytime soon? Or will Djokovic have to look at the younger generation and realize that, at least for now, he has to do it himself?

To use a favorite phrase of Sinner and Alcaraz, “Let's see…”

Matt Futterman



When the supposedly impregnable electronic line calling (ELC) malfunctioned at the Eastbourne Open this week, the whoops of delight from the traditionalists might have been heard over the high winds on the UK's south coast.

See, we told you.

At the first sniff of technical trouble at Wimbledon, expect something even more unabashed. For the first time in the event's 148-year history, it has dispensed with human line judges in favor of ELC, which is used at all ATP Tour-level and combined events and two of the other Grand Slams, but is not immune to glitches. At Eastbourne last Monday, a misleading replay image disagreed with the system's call during a first set tiebreak between Fonseca and Zizou Bergs.

Players are overwhelmingly in favour of ELC, because of how it removes doubt and takes away their need to self-officiate. Until this year's Wimbledon, players had to challenge a call they disputed in a timely fashion, meaning that they had to think about their next shot, whether or not to challenge and what their opponent would do on their next shot all at once.

If the technology does fail at Wimbledon, then each court will have a couple of match officials to step in, but assuming all goes to plan, players and fans will have to get used to a relatively bare court, with the elegantly dressed line judges who have been such a feature of Wimbledon throughout its long history absent.

Will that absence be meaningful at this year's event, or will everyone get used to it very quickly and move on? Only time — and perhaps some dubious calls — will tell.

Charlie Eccleshare

Bubbling away in the background at this year's Wimbledon is the All England Lawn Tennis Club's (AELTC) ongoing legal battle over 39 new grass courts. It wants to construct them, including an 8,000-seat stadium, on the old Wimbledon Park golf course. Doing so would almost triple the size of Wimbledon's grounds and allow the AELTC to host qualifying on site, as the other three majors do.

The Greater London Authority (GLA) granted planning permission at a hearing in September 2024, but after appeals led by the Save Wimbledon Park (SWP) group, a judicial review will take place July 8 and July 9, right in the heart of the tournament's second week. During the hearing, the AELTC and SWP will outline their arguments, with a decision expected a few weeks later.

The case is proving to be a major headache for the AELTC, which is desperate to press on with its expansion plans. Not being able to host qualifying on site (and not being able to pull in the revenue that would come with that) sees it, it says, lose ground on the other three majors. At the pre-tournament briefing a couple of weeks ago, Wimbledon chair Debbie Jevans said that the need for the transformation “becomes ever more apparent as we see our fellow Grand Slams staging fully integrated three-week events by welcoming many more spectators and staging charity and community events during the qualifying week and, crucially, providing the players with a stage benefiting their sporting excellence”.

It feels like no Grand Slam is complete these days without high-level discussions going on in the background, and this year's Wimbledon will be no different.

Charlie Eccleshare

For only the second time since 2004, there will be no Andy Murray in either the singles or doubles draws.

Last year's opening week was dominated by questions of whether he would be healthy enough to compete. Murray withdrew from the singles at the last minute on the first Tuesday, then he staggered through his men's doubles match with his brother Jamie two days later. On middle Saturday came Emma Raducanu's decision to jilt Murray at the altar of the mixed doubles event, with the Brit needing to rest her wrist for singles competition.

It's probably a relief for all involved that there is no major Murray storyline this time around. Last year was a painful end in many respects, and the rest of the event got sucked into a vortex by its gravity. The statue of him, which will arrive on the grounds in time for 2027, will have to do stand in his stead: he is not planning to attend at this time.

It will fall to one of the other Brits, like Raducanu and Draper, to step up in his absence.

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full coverage details.

There have been eight different women's singles champions at the past eight editions of Wimbledon, with Barbora Krejcikova a surprise winner 12 months ago.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka arrives as the favourite this year, having reached the past three Grand Slam finals.

However, Sabalenka has won just one of those three majors - and she has not played at Wimbledon since 2023.

The Belarusian, a big server with even bigger groundstrokes, should be well suited to the grass courts at SW19.

But grass is an unpredictable surface - and there are plenty waiting in the wings to shock her.

Coco Gauff beat Aryna Sabalenka in the 2023 US Open final and again in this year's French Open showpiece

Age: 21 Country: United States Ranking: 2 Strength: Athleticism

If Sabalenka is the title favourite, then French Open champion Gauff is one of the few players who can truly disrupt and frustrate her.

An outstanding mover, Gauff can get every ball she faces back, extending the rallies and drawing errors out of the big hitters like Sabalenka.

Wimbledon was where Gauff broke through as a 15-year-old qualifier, reaching the fourth round at her first major.

Gauff lost in her first - and only - grass-court match following her recent Paris triumph, but her title run in France, where she came through a few tricky matches, will serve her in good stead.

Full of confidence, and backed by a slightly tweaked service motion to address her previous troubles, Gauff stands a good chance of going beyond Wimbledon's round four for the first time.

Wimbledon has had seven consecutive first-time women's champions since Serena Williams won for the seventh time in 2016, and Gauff will rival Sabalenka for the chance to join that list. They could meet in the final.

Five men to watch out for at Wimbledon

Elena Rybakina beat Ons Jabeur in the 2022 Wimbledon final

Age: 26 Country: Kazakhstan Ranking: 11 Strength: Serve

Rybakina won her only Grand Slam title at Wimbledon in 2022.

She has a game seemingly made for grass, anchored by her huge serve and flat, punchy forehand. She leads the way in aces on the WTA Tour this season, having hit 235 across 40 matches.

It has not been easy for Rybakina since her Wimbledon triumph. She reached the Australian Open final in 2024 but illness, form and injury have plagued her since then. Her long-time coach Stefano Vukov has also been banned from the WTA Tour following an independent investigation into his behaviour towards her.

She has also struggled with closing out matches, missing four match points in a three-set loss to Sabalenka in Berlin.

But when everything clicks, Rybakina is still one of the best grass-court players on the tour, and a real title contender.

Marketa Vondrousova reached the French Open singles final as a teenager in 2019

Age: 25 Country: Czech Republic Ranking: 73 Strength: Return

Vondrousova made history with her Wimbledon triumph in 2023, where she became the first unseeded player to win the women's singles.

Twelve months later, she was the first women's defending champion in 30 years to lose in the first round after an injury-plagued season.

Shoulder surgery, a lengthy rehab stint and several false starts followed for the Czech, who arrived at June's Berlin Open with just six wins in six months.

She left as the champion, having won five matches in six days, including a stunningly dominant performance against Sabalenka.

Having previously been as high as six in the world, Vondrousova's current ranking means she is not seeded at Wimbledon. She will face American 32nd seed McCartney Kessler in round one, could meet Emma Raducanu in round two, and potentially will take on Sabalenka in the third round.

Mirra Andreeva reached the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2023

Age: 18 Country: Russia Ranking: 7 Strength: Redirection

Andreeva made history in February when, aged 17, she became the youngest player to win a WTA 1,000 title with victory in Dubai.

She then made it two huge titles in almost as many weeks with a stunning comeback to shock Sabalenka and win Indian Wells.

Andreeva has a framed photo of a tweet Andy Murray sent about her in 2024, where he praised her mental strength, and she has already achieved much as a teenager.

She can still battle with her emotions on court, having struggled against a partisan Paris crowd when playing home favourite Lois Boisson at Roland Garros.

But, equipped with a thudding backhand, Andreeva can redirect rallies at will, forcing opponents to go on the defensive, and has good anticipation of their next shot.

Madison Keys beat Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka - the top two players in the world - to lift the Australian Open title

Age: 30 Country: United States Ranking: 6 Strength: Serve

Keys left Wimbledon in tears last year after injuring herself when serving for the match against eventual runner-up Jasmine Paolini.

She had to retire from the fourth-round match but arrives at SW19 this year as a Grand Slam champion after her superb Australian Open victory.

The American beat then world number two Iga Swiatek and two-time defending champion Sabalenka back-to-back to clinch her first, long-awaited major.

Shots may not always land where she intends, but Keys is one of the most exciting and watchable players on the WTA Tour.

A devastating ball striker, Keys' huge serve and equally giant forehand will stand her in good stead on the grass courts.

Twelve days after her Roland Garros title, Coco Gauff arrives at SW19, balancing the weight of history with the practical challenge of a surface that doesn't wait.

WIMBLEDON -- It's been a decade since Serena Williams captured the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back -- the so-called “Channel Slam.”

“Oh, that would be really hard,” said No. 2 seed Coco Gauff, whose victory over Aryna Sabalenka in the Paris final has her halfway there. “I understand why it hasn't been done that often.

“It is a quick turnaround. You go from winning such a high tournament and kind of having to be back to work not even a few days later.”

This, Gauff knows all too well.

Twelve days after her triumph at Roland Garros, she was playing her first -- and it turns out only -- match on grass. She lost to eventual finalist Wang Xinyu in straight sets.

“It's obviously a lot different than clay,” Gauff said. “Just keeping the ball lower. Obviously clay, it's playing with a lot of height, heaviness, and that type of game. [Grass] I feel you need to play a little bit lower and a little bit more aggressive. We have 13 days to completely -- not completely change, because you still have the core of your game, but just change a little bit how you play.”

In a first-round match here six years ago, a 15-year-old Gauff stunned five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams in what felt like a torch-passing moment. 

“I think that moment for me was the start of believing that maybe my dreams could come true,” Gauff said. “I mean, that still feels crazy. It still feels like a dream.

“I had so much belief. I feel now I've kind of regained that belief in myself. I feel like I lost it somewhere along the way, between 15 and 19. At 19 I was able to regain that.”

That was a reference to her US Open title in 2023.

Now, she says, she hopes to take the next step at Wimbledon. It starts Tuesday with a tricky first-round match against Dayana Yastremska.

“The next goal coming up, obviously to have a good result here,” Gauff said. “I've lost in the fourth round [three] times, so I would love to get past that stage. Yeah, I would say that's the next thing I'm looking forward to.

I would love to win this, but I'm a big believer in just conquering one step at a time. If I get past that stage, then I'll start thinking about the winning.”

Taiwan's badminton ace Chou Tien-chen stayed hot as he secured a semi-final berth in the men's singles at the US Open at Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Friday.

Chou entered the Super 300 tournament as the top seed and breezed past Victor Lai of Canada 21-19, 21-8 in 37 minutes, advancing to the semi-finals for the second straight tournament.

Earlier this month, the 35-year-old veteran finished runner-up at the Indonesia Open, becoming the oldest male shuttler to reach a Super 1000-level final.

He was set to face Ayush Shetty of India last night after press time for a spot in the final.

Meanwhile, 22-year-old Taiwanese prospect Liao Jhuo-fu also secured a spot in the men's singles semi-finals by upsetting Japan's second-seeded Kenta Nishimoto 21-18, 21-8.

That victory saw the world No. 76 Liao clinch his first semi-final berth in a Super 300-level tournament. His semi-final opponent is Canada's Brian Yang, ranked No. 33 in the world.

Also on Friday, Taiwanese male duos secured all four semi-final spots, the first time since 2010.

He Zhi-wei and Huang Jui-hsuan saw off US duo Chen Zhi Yi and Presley Smith in a 29-minute quarter-final, ending with a 21-15, 21-15 victory. 

Meanwhile, Lai Po-yu and Tsai Fu-cheng faced fellow Taiwanese Chen Zhi-ray and Lin Yu-chieh, with Lai and Tsai securing the semi-final spot with 21-16, 21-11.

Also that evening, Chiang Chien-wei and Wu Hsuan-yi knocked out the Indian team of Hariharan Amsakarunan and Ruban Kumar Rethinasabapathi in half an hour, securing another Taiwanese semi-final spot with 21-9, 21-19.

Chen Cheng-kuan and Lin Bing-wei followed that up by defeating Danish pair Rasmus Espersen and Andreas Sondergaard 21-19, 21-15.

The feat was matched by three Taiwanese female pairings who advanced to the semi-finals. 

Chang Ching-hui and Yang Ching-tun secured the first slot in the semi-finals by beating fellow Taiwanese Chen Yan-fei and Sun Liang-ching 22-20, 21-14. 

That was quickly followed by Hsu Yin-hui and Lin Jhih-yun holding off Americans Lauren Lam and Allison Lee in a 53-minute 20-22, 21-13, 21-7 best of three. 

The third Taiwanese duo in the women's doubles semi-finals was then secured by Hsu Ya-ching and Sung Yu-hsuan, who defeated US duo Audrey Chang and Jasmine Yeung 21-14, 21-17.

Taiwan's last title in US Open women's doubles was in 2010.

Taiwan also secured one berth in the mixed doubles semi-final after Chen Cheng-kuan and Hsu Yin-hui defeated Germans Marvin Seidel and Thuc Phuong Nguyen 21-16, 21-17.



                                                                                While British star Jack Draper spent the past week trying to find rhythm and comfort in his first grass tournament of the season at the Queen's Club Championships in London, Jiri Lehecka on Saturday bulldozed everything in his path.
After more than two furious hours of battle, their form was reflected in the final scoreline as Lehecka toppled a frustrated Draper, the second seed, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 to reach the biggest final of his career, against Carlos Alcaraz. Lehecka is also the first Czech to reach the men's title match at Queen's since Ivan Lendl lifted the trophy in 1990.

REUNION: 
                                        Former Barcelona players Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Miami coach Javier Mascherano are to face their former coach Luis Enrique                                        Inter Miami's Lionel Messi faces a tantalizing reunion with former club Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup last 16 after both sides on Monday progressed to the knockout phase. 
Miami drew 2-2 with Palmeiras to go through second in Group A, after the Brazilian side fought back from two goals down to seal top spot. 
They now face an all-Brazil clash against Botafogo, who lost 1-0 to Atletico Madrid, but progressed from Group B in second at the expense of the Spaniards. 
Champions of Europe PSG won the group with a 2-0 victory over Seattle Sounders, paving the                                    



                                                                                Dale Earnhardt Jr might already be NASCAR's most popular crew chief. He is certainly an undefeated one.
Pressed into unexpected service, Earnhardt on Saturday called the shots for 18-year-old prospect Connor Zilisch in the No. 88 Chevrolet, as they landed in victory lane in the second-tier Xfinity Series race at Pocono Raceway.
“It felt good to have some input and decisionmaking power,” Earnhardt said. “And then helping Connor understand what our plan was so he knew when to push and what he was expected to do.”
Earnhardt — who won NASCAR's most-popular driver award 15 times — made a pit stop from his

Santiago Gonzalez and Austin Krajicek extended their winning streak to 12 matches on Saturday at the Mallorca Championships presented by ecotrans Group.

The Mexican-American duo saved three match points in a nervy end to their 6-1, 1-6, 15/13 championship-match victory over fourth seeds Yuki Bhambri and Robert Galloway. With their victory, Gonzalez and Krajicek capped a run of three consecutive titles on grass, including wins at the ATP 250 in Stuttgart, the ATP Challenger Tour event in Nottingham and the 250 in Mallorca.

“It feels amazing, it's been a really good stretch,” said Krajicek. “We're excited to get to Wimbledon next week and compete in London, but we will enjoy this for sure. It feels really good to be back in the winner's circle, and we'll hopefully continue that into Wimbledon.”



Gonzalez added: “Winning three titles in a row [gives us] a lot of confidence going into Wimbledon. Hopefully we can keep it going. It's not going to be easy but with the confidence we have, hopefully it will be there for the first match.”

After teaming for the first time in April, Gonzalez and Krajicek are now 10-3 at Tour-level, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. They are the second pair to claim multiple ATP Tour titles on grass this year after the British duo Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool.

Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool continued their stellar grass-court season Friday at the Lexus Eastbourne Open, where they claimed their second consecutive ATP Tour title.

The British duo delivered a 6-4, 7-6(5) championship-match triumph against Ariel Behar and Joran Vliegen in windy conditions to lift its fourth trophy of the season. After reaching the final in ‘s-Hertogenbosch and winning the ATP 500 on home soil at Queen's Club last week, Cash and Glasspool improved to an 11-1 record on grass this year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

“[It's been] a crazy three weeks for us, going three finals in a row,” said Cash. “Thanks to our team for putting in the hours. It's been a tough shift but I'm glad we've been able to pick up some trophies, and this one's a special one.”

After improving to 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Behar and Vliegen, Cash and Glasspool are up to No. 3 in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings. They are aiming to make their team debut at the Nitto ATP Finals after teaming for the first time in Hangzhou last September.

“You guys coming out and being so supportive, it really feels like a home tournament,” added Glasspool. “It's amazing to play in such a great atmosphere, we really do appreciate it.”

Jannik Sinner has cemented his status as one of the dominant forces on the ATP Tour over the past year, but as he returns to Wimbledon, there's still unfinished business.

The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has had time to reflect on his gut-wrenching defeat to Carlos Alcaraz at Roland Garros, where he let slip three consecutive championship points. Now, his focus shifts to another challenge: the tricky transition from clay to grass.

When asked about the biggest hurdle in adapting to grass-court tennis, Sinner was direct in his response.

“Movement, for sure, because the movement is the most important part for us tennis players,” Sinner said in Saturday's pre-tournament press conference. “If someone moves well, it means that he is a good player. That's how I see tennis from outside.

“You have to cover the spots more, improvise a little bit more on the other sides. It's a very different game style we see on grass.”



Despite the difficulties of switching surfaces, Sinner has already shown he's capable of adjusting. Last season, just two weeks after falling in the Roland Garros semi-finals, the Italian lifted his first grass-court trophy in Halle.

However, his title defence at the German ATP 500 didn't go as planned this year, with Sinner bowing out in the second round to Alexander Bublik. That loss, coupled with his defeat to rival Alcaraz, who now leads Sinner 8-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, might raise doubts over his momentum heading into Wimbledon.

But the top seed is unfazed.

“Honestly, I feel ready to play. We are practising very well,” said Sinner. “What happened in the past is in the past already. I feel good. I feel especially mentally I feel in a very good spot. Halle was a little bit different, because before I haven't had so much time to cut that off. Now it's gone, and I also see the reactions of other players and people. They [said] the level is very, very high. Just privileged to be in this position.

“We are working very hard. I feel like I'm playing great, great tennis on grass. Hopefully I can show this also in the match court. I'm just looking forward to going on court and to compete and enjoy the time.”

Sinner has plenty of positive memories at the All England Club. While Wimbledon remains the only major where he's yet to reach the final, he's enjoyed deep runs — reaching the semi-finals in 2023, losing to Novak Djokovic, and making the quarter-finals in 2022 and 2024.

“It feels good again after one year coming back here,” said Sinner, who faces countryman Luca Nardi in his opener. “I'm very happy. I have some good feelings coming here, even though it's a bit different than last year, coming with the win in Halle.

“But it's good. I had some time off before coming here. We are practicing very well. The days are long. So I feel ready to compete again.”

The future is now. The youngest final at the Lexus Eastbourne Open in more than four decades delivered in a big way on Sunday, as Australia's Maya Joint saved four championship points to top Alexandra Eala of the Philippines 6-4, 1-6, 7-6(10) and capture a second title of what's been a breakthrough first professional season.The two unseeded young talents entered the match with a combined age of 39, making Sunday's clash at the longtime tour stop the youngest final since 18-year-old Tracy Austin defeated 16-year-old Andrea Jaeger in 1981. Over two hours and 28 minutes, the second- and third-youngest players in the WTA's Top 100 battled in a back-and-forth affair that ultimately concluded with a dramatic 73-minute final frame that saw both sit in winning positions.After falling behind 4-1 to start her maiden final appearance, Eala wrestled momentum back from Joint in the middle of the match despite dropping the first set. She won eight of nine games to not only take the second, but push ahead 2-0 in the third, as she sought to be not only the first Filipina to claim a WTA singles title, but also become the first qualifier to win Eastbourne since Ekaterina Makarova in 2010.From there, Joint won four straight games, but dropped eight consecutive points to bring the score to 4-4 in a blink. Neither player faced a break point from then on, setting the stage for a dramatic final frame in which saw the inexperience of both players, but also their undeniable talent, shine through.

Eala started the stronger of the two, winning five of the first seven points to stake claim to the early lead. Three in a row for Joint followed, including a lucky escape for the Australian as Eala nearly pulled off a Houdini act by digging out Joint's overhead smash.From there, neither player could win more than two points in a row, with Eala seeing match points slip at 6-5, 8-7, 9-8, and 10-9, while Joint's first chance to win came and went at 7-6. The tense affair finally conclued, though, as the Aussie won the last three points. After two misses by Eala—one forced off the forehand and the second unforced off the backhand—Joint followed up a strong serve with a cross-court backhand winner to put an end to Eala's historic title bid.Only officially turning professional in December, forgoing a commitment to play college tennis at the University of Texas, Joint has now lifted the trophy in two of her last four events played.She swept the singles and doubles titles on the red clay of Rabat, Morocco in May, and will break into the Top 50 of the WTA rankings come Monday.

Lando Norris and McLaren topped Friday practice in Austria, but are they favourites for the rest of the weekend? Or will one of their rivals step forward?

The sound of 20 Formula 1 cars once again reverberated around the Styrian hills on Friday as practice for the Austrian Grand Prix got under way. George Russell clinched victory last year, after Max Verstappen and Lando Norris collided when fighting for the lead, but is the Mercedes racer on course to repeat the feat and back up his Canada win last time out – or are championship leaders McLaren back on song?

The Mercedes of Russell set the pace in morning practice at Spielberg, but as the day progressed, it was McLaren who emerged as the ones to beat with both Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri looking quick around the Red Bull Ring.

The British team brought more upgrades to Austria, including revised shrouds that suit the new front wing that was introduced but not raced in Canada. Norris stuck with the revised geometry – also introduced in Canada – with Piastri sticking with the older spec as it's a set-up option and he prefers it.

A well-known name will return to the Red Bull pit wall at the Austrian Grand Prix as Max Verstappen's race engineer.

Red Bull driver Max Verstappen will be guided by a different race engineer at this weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, with Gianpiero Lambiase unavailable, as Simon Rennie stands in to work with the four-time World Champion.

Also known simply as ‘GP', Lambiase has worked with Verstappen since the Dutchman stepped up from Toro Rosso to Red Bull Racing in the early stages of the 2016 season – their partnership starting with a spectacular victory at the Spanish Grand Prix.

Plenty more trophies have been achieved together over the years, including 65 Grand Prix wins and four world titles – Verstappen now pushing for what would be a record-equalling fifth successive championship crown.

However, Verstappen is preparing to navigate a race weekend at Red Bull without Lambiase next to him for the very first time, as the Italian-British engineer steps aside for personal reasons. He is set to return at the British Grand Prix.

In Lambiase's place comes Simon Rennie, an experienced Red Bull employee who previously served as a race engineer and is currently Group Leader of Simulation Engineering at the team.

Born in North Yorkshire, England, Rennie started his F1 career with Renault in the mid-2000s, working as a Data Engineer for Fernando Alonso during the Spaniard's breakthrough 2005 and 2006 title-winning seasons.

Rennie remained at Renault (later rebranded as Lotus) for several years, gaining promotion to race engineer when Alonso returned from McLaren, while also assisting the likes of Heikki Kovalainen, Robert Kubica, Nick Heidfeld and Kimi Raikkonen.

During the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, which Raikkonen won, a radio exchange between the Finn and Rennie went viral. Informed by Rennie of the gap to the cars behind him, Raikkonen bluntly replied: “Just leave me alone, I know what to do!”

For the 2013 campaign, Rennie made the switch from Renault to reigning Drivers' and Constructors' champions Red Bull, taking over as Mark Webber's race engineer.

Webber's retirement later that year led to Rennie working with promoted junior driver Daniel Ricciardo – their partnership spanning five seasons and yielding several race wins.

Rennie decided to take a non-travelling role ahead of the 2019 season, with Ricciardo subsequently leaving long-time backers Red Bull for a new chapter at Renault.

After a year in the factory, Rennie returned as Alex Albon's race engineer in 2020, but he stepped aside again for 2021 when the Thai-British driver got replaced by Sergio Perez.

Rennie has since been working away in the background at Red Bull's Milton Keynes base, heading up their Simulation Engineering operations to aid the team remotely.

He will be back in the spotlight again this weekend, though, as the 45-year-old replaces Lambiase at the Red Bull Ring and attempts to guide Verstappen to more glory.

George Russell set the pace for Mercedes during Free Practice 1 at the Austrian Grand Prix.

George Russell has topped the timesheets during Friday's opening practice session ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix, the Mercedes driver continuing his run of good form as he led the way from Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri.

There were a couple of new faces joining the action for FP1 at the Red Bull Ring as two teams opted to run a rookie; Formula 2 standings leader Alex Dunne stepped into Lando Norris' McLaren – making him the first Irish driver to take part in an F1 weekend for 22 years as he finished an impressive fourth – while fellow F2 driver Dino Beganovic was at the wheel for Ferrari in place of Charles Leclerc.

Dunne was amongst the first to hit the track when the green light appeared, with the MCL39 sporting aero rakes to kick off a weekend in which several teams have brought upgrades. The Irishman was also the only driver to run the soft tyres during the initial runs, the rest of the pack bolting on the medium and hard compounds.

While Canadian Grand Prix winner Russell had set the early pace during the first quarter of the session, Verstappen did not seem happy in the Red Bull, the Dutchman experiencing a lock-up in the RB21.

Verstappen reported back about the problems on the radio – but on this occasion the World Champion was speaking to Simon Rennie rather than his usual Race Engineer Gianpiero Lambiase, with ‘GP' taking the weekend off.

Also seemingly struggling in the sister Red Bull was Yuki Tsunoda, who experienced a wide moment of his own as he continues in his mission to get to grips with the car. Elsewhere, Lewis Hamilton was informed that his SF-25 had an “issue with the gearbox”, forcing the Briton to return to the pits.

The problems did not look to have ended there for Ferrari, with Beganovic's car up on the stands in the other side of the garage as the crew removed the floor. Russell, meanwhile, was sitting atop the timesheets, having pumped in a 1m 05.776s after running the soft tyres.

A yellow flag briefly appeared following a spin for Fernando Alonso, with the two-time World Champion running onto the grass thanks to a moment at the final corner. “That was the worst out-lap we can do – good to do it in FP1!” the Aston Martin driver commented.

As the majority of the field switched to the soft tyres and the times started to tumble – with Ferrari also getting both cars back out on track – Esteban Ocon sparked another yellow flag after locking up and going straight on at Turn 1. The Haas driver was able to rejoin, albeit with a flat spot on his front left tyre.

With Russell still leading the way from Verstappen and Piastri as the session entered its final quarter, Dunne caught the eye by going fourth fastest, his time just seven-hundredths away from Piastri's.

“A few small raindrops,” Russell reported as the last 10 minutes of FP1 approached, with clouds hovering above the Red Bull Ring. But questions over the weather did not prevent the Silver Arrows driver from maintaining his place at the top of the timesheets, having set the pace on a 1m 05.542s.

Verstappen – who has won at this track a record four times – was 0.065s adrift in P2, while Piastri and Dunne held third and fourth for McLaren ahead of Alpine's Pierre Gasly in fifth. Gabriel Bortoleto slotted into an impressive sixth for Kick Sauber, while the Williams pair of Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz, Hamilton and Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar completed the top 10.

Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli claimed 11th – off the back of completing his school exams – ahead of Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg (12th), Aston Martin's Lance Stroll (13th), Alonso (14th) and Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson (15th). Franco Colapinto put his Alpine into P16, while Tsunoda, Beganovic, Ocon and Haas' Ollie Bearman classified P17 through to P20 respectively.

The drivers and teams will now regroup in the paddock to examine their data and prepare for Friday's second Free Practice session, which is due to get underway at 1700 local time.

In the last practice session for the Austrian Grand Prix, McLaren driver Lando Norris set the pace from his team mate Oscar Piastri in a frenetic session.

Lando Norris set the pace ahead of Oscar Piastri and Max Verstappen in the final practice hour of the Austrian Grand Prix, setting the scene for an unpredictable Qualifying session as many struggled to stick to the track limits.

After Friday's running, which saw McLaren establish themselves as the team to beat with their latest upgrades, the drivers returned to the track with the ambition of fine-tuning their cars ahead of Qualifying later today.

Red Bull's Verstappen, who is working with a different race engineer this weekend, was among the first to head out for a fast lap – bolting on a set of hard compound tyres, he clocked a 1m 6.131s on his initial effort, substantially slower than Norris' benchmark time of 1m 4.580s from FP2.

The Dutchman momentarily went wide at the final corner, subsequently reporting over the radio that “the car is a bit nervous getting back on throttle”, adding that the Red Bull felt “a bit snappy” as he attempted to cut down his times.

Practice 3 results

FORMULA 1 MSC CRUISES AUSTRIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

More and more cars gradually joined Verstappen on the circuit and Norris bettered his rival's lap by 0.156s, albeit on the soft tyres. Elsewhere, Turn 1 produced a series of overcorrections as the Briton, Franco Colapinto and both Ferraris were forced to take to the run-off area and abort their flying laps after driving wide.

Approaching the halfway point, everyone had made an appearance on the timesheets, but it was Norris who remained firmly at the top with a gap of around four-tenths back to his compatriots in Lewis Hamilton and George Russell.

In an attempt to close the deficit to his papaya team mate, Piastri pushed a little too hard and rattled over the gravel at Turn 9, narrowly hanging on to avoid a more damaging incident. He quickly advised his side of the garage to check the floor and remained over 0.5s behind Norris with 20 minutes to go.

Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar suffered another near-miss at the following corner as he similarly dropped a wheel into the gravel, which sent him into a spin and brought out the yellow flags momentarily. It was one of the more satisfying errors of the session – he ended up facing the right way on the track and uttered a sheepish “sorry!” to his engineer.

Norris abandoned a lap despite setting the fastest first sector of the hour as he drifted wide over a kerb, but he nevertheless finished the session on top with a time of 1m 4.324s, leading a McLaren 1-2 with Piastri just over a tenth behind.

Verstappen replicated Hadjar's spin late on but slotted into third place, beating the Ferrari duo of Leclerc and Hamilton. The two Mercedes were separated by just 0.035s with Russell marginally ahead, while an in-form Lance Stroll, Yuki Tsunoda and Gabriel Bortoleto rounded out the top 10.

The second Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso was 12th, just behind Liam Lawson, who managed to set a time identical to Bortoleto's. Nico Hulkenberg took P13 ahead of the Williams pair of Alex Albon and Sainz, with Haas' Ollie Bearman settling for P16.

At the tail end of the order, Pierre Gasly, Esteban Ocon, Hadjar and Colapinto will all be hoping to reset and better their times ahead of the Qualifying hour at 1600 local time.

It was not an entirely smooth Friday for Ferrari at the Austrian Grand Prix, with Lewis Hamilton losing track time in FP1. Charles Leclerc, meanwhile, sat out the session to hand his car over to rookie Dino Beganovic.

Lewis Hamilton has explained the issues he faced during a “not spectacular” Friday at the Austrian Grand Prix, with Ferrari team mate Charles Leclerc also suggesting that there is “a lot of work to be done” overnight.

While Leclerc sat out FP1 to hand his car over to rookie Dino Beganovic, Hamilton had a disrupted session owing to a gearbox problem, meaning that he lost time on track while the team worked on his SF-25 in the garage.

The seven-time World Champion eventually returned to action, but had the lowest lap count of the session. And while things ran more smoothly in FP2, the Briton – who ended the hour in 10th on the timesheets – admitted that it had not been a straightforward day at the Red Bull Ring.

Asked to assess his Friday, Hamilton responded: “Not spectacular. We had a problem in the morning with the gearbox, which was obviously difficult, frustrating for everyone in the garage obviously because the boys did a great job, kept topping it up.

“But you go out, you can only do one lap, and so we didn't get the long runs. But I think we recovered okay with it, they did a great job changing the gearbox and getting us ready for FP2.

“Charles was six-tenths off, I was close to a second off, so not ideal. But I think there's lots of learnings, so I think we will make some changes. Hopefully we can try and get a little bit closer. We won't be at the front.”

Pushed on whether the new floor that the team have brought to the event is part of a wider package spread over the next few races aimed at moving the squad forwards, Hamilton said: “A huge amount of work went on to bring the floor, but as you see it's not necessarily changed our competitiveness.

“The car actually doesn't feel bad, we're just a huge chunk off pace-wise, so we need to look into that and that's about it really. We just keep pushing, just trying to dial the car in more and see what we can get, but it's obviously very close in the top 10 so a tenth could make a difference, so we'll work towards trying to gain at least that over the night.”

Leclerc also appeared disappointed by how Friday had unfolded, the Monegasque finishing his sole practice session in fifth place.

When quizzed on whether he was happy with his day's work, Leclerc answered: “Not really. [Missing] FP1 didn't really compromise FP2. I felt kind of at ease on the track straightaway, but not really at ease with the car and the way the car feels, so there's quite a bit of work to be done for tomorrow.

“It doesn't feel like the performance is quite there yet, but hopefully we will put everything together tomorrow and do a step forward, but there's quite a lot of work to be done tonight.

“Long run [pace] seems to be more positive as we very often have – we are faster on the race [pace] than we are in Qualifying. In Qualifying there's a lot of work to be done.”

Despite the difficulties on Friday, Leclerc remains confident that Ferrari's race pace can at least put them nearer to their rivals in theory.

“Our race pace is very positive,” the eight-time race winner commented. “We were, I would say, [setting] very similar lap times to the fastest guys, so that's good, but the problem is that we've seen recently that everything is so close, and as soon as you start P6, P7, then in the race it's extremely difficult to come back where you should be.

“So that's really our target, is to try and maximise Qualifying – whether we'll make it or not I don't know, but there will be a lot of work tonight to try and maximise that.”

As for Beganovic, the F2 driver was delighted to experience FP1 at the wheel of the SF-25, the 21-year-old admitting that he felt “on it straightaway”.

“It felt very good, it's always very nice to drive an F1 car,” said Beganovic. “Doing an F1 weekend is obviously even more special, and on top of that doing it in a Ferrari, even more special. It means a lot to me.

“This is my sixth year now [in the Ferrari Driver Academy], so it's been a long journey and here we are doing the steps towards my goal, which is to have an F1 seat one day, and doing these programmes that we have in the Academy really helps me to show myself but also get a first taste of what it is.”

Alex Dunne hailed his Formula 1 practice debut with McLaren, for the Austrian Grand Prix, as ""something pretty special.""

Alex Dunne has hailed his Formula 1 practice debut as ""something pretty special"" after finishing only fractionally slower than the sister McLaren of Oscar Piastri during FP1 ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix.

The 19-year-old Irishman leads the Formula 2 standings after taking two Feature race wins so far this season, but got the chance to drive McLaren's MCL39 in his role as a development driver with the team.

Although Dunne previously sampled McLaren's 2023 challenger and underwent simulator running, this was his first time in an official F1 session.

Despite his relative lack of experience, Dunne posted the fourth fastest time at the Red Bull Ring in FP1, less than a tenth behind championship leader Piastri in the sister McLaren, and just over two tenths down on George Russell's session-best.

""I don't even know where to start,"" said Dunne after the session. ""Super happy, I think it's safe to say it went pretty well.

""I think we knew going through the session that the goal wasn't necessarily for performance it was more to help out with the car, help Lando [Norris] and just help the team improve as much as they can for FP2, FP3 and then onwards into the weekend.

""So to have the pace that I had and show what I'm capable of on the F1 stage is something pretty special, so massive thank you to McLaren and everyone for the opportunity. I'm extremely grateful.""

McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella was impressed by Dunne's performance, not only because of his speed but also that he was able to help the team develop the car, which featured a new suspension set-up.

This in turn helped regular driver Lando Norris once he got back behind the wheel of his car, before topping FP2 ahead of Piastri.

""I think we have to acknowledge that he [Dunne] has gone through quite an extensive plan of testing with some new parts, with some rake work, some adjustments on the steering wheel that we don't see on TV but definitely keeps the drivers very busy,"" Stella told Sky Sports F1.

""Alex has been quite diligent and impressive. Then he also had the chance to show some speed and no surprise, he's a fast driver.

""I think we need to be a bit careful looking at the lap times because his time came later on in the stint when the fuel was down but I think encouraging and impressive in terms of Alex himself and also I think a good session for McLaren.""

McLaren locked out the top two positions during Friday practice for the Austrian Grand Prix, with Lando Norris leading the way from Oscar Piastri.

McLaren enjoyed a strong start to the Austrian Grand Prix weekend after Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri set the pace during Friday's second practice session.

Norris missed the opening session to give F2 racer and McLaren junior Alex Dunne a run in the MCL39, but the Briton was immediately on the pace when he returned to action in FP2.

Norris' best time of 1m 04.580s put him 0.157s up on team mate Piastri, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen more than three-tenths of a second back at one of the shortest tracks on the calendar.

Assessing his and the team's first day at the Red Bull Ring, Norris said: “I think the car felt good from the off. Alex gave good feedback this morning after FP1 and he was on the pace straight away, so that was good to see.

“I think they moved the car in the right direction for FP2, and we just need to understand if we want more of that tomorrow, or a little bit less, or somewhere in the middle.

“Good steps in the right direction, but still a little bit more to come hopefully.”

Norris does, however, expect McLaren's rivals to turn up the heat as the weekend progresses – predicting a “tight” battle for pole position.

“I think as a team we seemed a bit more competitive,” he continued. “I think we definitely didn't look that good this morning, so I think we did move things in the right direction.

“I think as always we are very quick in FP2 at times [and] we've shown a bit more pace than some of the others. I certainly think they're going to catch up, Max is not far behind, and they [Red Bull] normally improve a lot into Saturday.

“I expect a good day tomorrow and I'm sure we'll improve on some things, but it's not as easy as maybe it looked today. I think it's still going to be tight tomorrow, it always is, there's no reason for it not to be, but we'll work hard to make it as big of a gap as possible.”

Piastri echoed Norris' comments about McLaren's early pace and what their rivals might be able to do overnight, earmarking Verstappen as a particular “threat” in Qualifying.

“It looked pretty good,” Piastri commented. “Max is still close, so I think he'll be definitely a threat this weekend. But no, the car's feeling good, I think the pace is quite good, so a positive first day.”

With Norris reporting that McLaren's recent upgrades have moved the car “in the right direction”, Piastri also gave his take on the developments – and whether he is using the new front suspension debuted by Norris in Montreal.

“There's some other bits and pieces… I'm not using the bits that came in Canada, because they're not an upgrade, they're just different,” he confirmed. “All the parts that we think will make the car faster are on both cars.”

James Vowles has admitted ""this feels like it was made to be"" having signed a long-term contract extension with the Williams Formula 1 team.

James Vowles has admitted ""this feels like it was made to be"" having signed a long-term contract extension with the Williams Formula 1 outfit to remain as Team Principal.

Vowles has held the position since the start of the 2023 season, having moved across from Mercedes where he spent four years as Motorsport Strategy Director and with now more than two decades of experience in the sport.

Under Vowles' leadership, the illustrious team has gone from struggling at the back of the field to fighting consistently for point-scoring finishes, with Williams currently fifth in the Teams' Championship.

With an upturn in form, the decision was made ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix this weekend to extend Vowles' involvement with the team as he looks to take them back to the top and add to the nine Constructors' and seven Drivers' titles already achieved.

""I feel at home here. This feels like it was made to be and we gel really well,"" Vowles told Sky Sports F1.

""I'm so incredibly fortunate with Dorilton and our board, we talk, today we've spoken twice already. It's not a normal board in that regard, we're very interactive and close.

""The first few years are really making sure each other is the right fit for this in the long-term. We've now, I think, shown the world we can do some basics right, which is where we're at now.

""Now it's to properly build this into a championship-winning team and that will take some time and this commitment to each other is a serious commitment towards that goal. I couldn't be happier.

""This Williams feels like, if this is where I spend the remainder of my career, it would have been a very good and well spent amount of time.""

Alex Albon praised Vowles' input at the team, having been with Williams since 2022 and since a gradual improvement in performance, which includes scoring points in seven of the 10 Grands Prix so far this year.

“I think it's a great vote of confidence for all of us,"" he said.

“I feel like James has clearly spearheaded the team in a good direction, the right direction, and for myself, the team, it's a great sign of things to come and shows trust and confidence from the board. It makes the future brighter for the team.”

Lando Norris led McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri at the top of the times in the second practice session for the Austrian Grand Prix

Lando Norris led McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri at the top of the times in the second practice session for the Austrian Grand Prix.

The Briton, who missed FP1 as his McLaren seat was taken by F2 championship leader Alex Dunne, was immediately up to speed on Friday afternoon despite a lack of earlier running.

His 1m 04.580s left him 0.157s clear of Piastri and was almost a second faster than George Russell's best from earlier in the day.

Max Verstappen completed the top three ahead of Lance Stroll's Aston Martin and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, who also missed FP1 as Dino Beganovic drove his car.

The drivers and teams report back on all the action from Friday Practice at the Red Bull Ring for the Austrian Grand Prix.

Mclaren had a strong opening session, despite Norris being on the sidelines. Dunne was driving in an FP1 session for the first time and impressed many by finishing fourth, less than a tenth back from Piastri's time. Norris wasted no time getting going in FP2 though, jumping to the top of the timing sheets and staying there. He wound up well over a tenth clear of his team mate, and looks well placed to fight for pole tomorrow. But Piastri often takes longer to build into the weekend, so cannot be discounted just yet.

Oscar Piastri - FP1: 1:05.697, P3; FP2: 1:04.737, P2

“It was a decent Friday. The pace looks strong, and the car is feeling good. There are a few things to try and work on overnight to make sure we can maximise Quali, but I'm in a happy place at the moment and I'm looking forward to tomorrow.”

Lando Norris - FP2: 1:04.580, P1

“A good day on track to start the weekend. I had to play a bit of catch-up in FP2, but Alex did a good job this morning to give the team important feedback on where we could improve the car for the second session. We took some more positives steps forward, so I'm feeling good but will work with the team overnight to make sure I feel completely happy on the limit tomorrow.”

Alex Dunne - FP1: 1:05.766, P4

“I'm very happy with how today went. I knew going into the session that the goal wasn't performance, it was to run through a test plan and help the team prepare for the weekend, so to be also able to show some pace at the end felt great.

“In terms of the session itself, it was nice and clean. Running the rakes to begin with meant I was able to gather valuable data for the team and support with comparisons. I was able to put it all together and make sure I applied what I needed to from the learning we did in the TPC tests and on the sim, so thank you to the team for preparing me so well.

“I want to say a massive thank you to Zak, Andrea, Alessandro, Stephanie, Warren, and everyone at McLaren for giving me the opportunity, I am very grateful and, as I said at the end of the session on the radio, a little boy's dream came true today.”

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

""It's been a productive Friday in Austria with both sessions running smoothly today. It was great to be able to give Alex the opportunity to take part in his debut FP1 session as part of his progress within our Driver Development Programme. Alex did a good job driving Lando's car in the first session, working his way through a quite extensive plan of testing with some new parts, some rake work and multiple adjustments of settings on the steering wheel before a solid performance run. We have collected important data which the team, Lando and Oscar have available overnight to take into Saturday. Thank you and well done to Alex for his contribution.

“Whilst Oscar completed his run plan in FP2, Lando returned to the MCL39 and was immediately on the pace and able to learn about the car and tyres. Overall, a positive Friday but we know that the field is very competitive, and we will have to maximise all the opportunities.”

Russell picked up where he left off in Canada, quickest on both the hard compound tyre and then the soft. He set his time early too, and despite the track gripping up, no one could beat him. Antonelli was a shade behind after a scrappy few laps on the softs where he ran wide at times. It was much the same in FP2, Russell quick, Antonelli not quite at home on this track just yet. But Russell did not wind up top this time, the McLarens proving the class of the field. He did set his time a bit earlier again though, so was not as far back as it seems.

George Russell - FP1: 1:05.542, P1; FP2: 1:05.229, P6

""We struggled a bit today, but the afternoon session was aligned with our pre-weekend expectations. We had strong single lap pace in FP2 which was a slight surprise for us. The car balance felt good but jumping into FP2, we took a little bit of a step back. We will look into that overnight and aim to return towards the sweet spot we found within the first hour of practice.

""We'll be doing our best tomorrow but seeing the McLarens pace, we might struggle to fight for pole position. Hopefully we can be in the mix for the top five, but we are also aware of how much race pace dictates your result here. The tarmac is abrasive here and managing that has not been a strength of ours recently. We will work hard to optimise the car though and see what we can do over the rest of the weekend.""

Kimi Antonelli - FP1: 1:06.130, P11; FP2: 1:05.537, P11

""It was a pretty tricky day overall but still a positive one with lots of learnings. I was feeling good at the start of both FP1 and FP2 but the track being this short, it's always a challenge to get a good single lap. I didn't feel that I optimised any of my laps on the softest compound, making a few mistakes here or there. I will focus on improving that in FP3, so I am ready heading into Qualifying.

""My long runs were more promising, though. Our pace looked decent throughout and the overall balance of the car felt good. We know that a circuit with tarmac that is as abrasive as it is here usually makes our life difficult. Hopefully the recent steps we have taken with the W16 will have helped in this area, but we will only know come the Grand Prix on Sunday. For now, we know which areas we need to work on overnight and hopefully can take another step forward with the car as we head into the weekend.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""We had a solid start to the weekend in FP1. The overall car balance was good, and we looked strong on the single lap. We had focused more on the long run through and were able to get decent data; all seemed in a reasonable place in terms of pace and degradation.

""We looked less competitive in the second session on the single lap, however. The wind direction changed somewhat and that didn't suit us. We also made some changes that may have hurt the balance, but we can look at those on the simulator overnight. The long run still looked decent thanfully and as we had got started on that programme earlier than others, we were able to complete more laps. McLaren still look like the ones to beat, which is not a surprise at a track like this, but we're reasonably content with today as a starting point for our weekend.""

Both Verstappen and Tsunoda locked up in the opening session, complaining about their brakes and the balance of the RB21. But in the Dutchman's hands at least the Red Bull looked quick on the soft tyres as he got the closest to Russell's time. He was the last to come out in FP2, and got the closest to the papaya cars – despite being on heavily used soft tyres for that run. As such, there is time out there for Verstappen tomorrow. Tsunoda improved as the day continued, winding up in the top 10 in the second session.

Max Verstappen - FP1: 1:05.607, P2; FP2: 1:04.898, P3

“Overall today was quite straightforward and we didn't have any big issues. In terms of pace we had a bit too much understeer in the car on the short run and the long run, so that is something that we have to try and get rid of ahead of tomorrow. I think so far, today has been really good with Simon, I have known him for a long time on the other side of the garage as well as working with him in the SIM. He has a lot of experience so it has been very very good today, he is straight up and it was nice.""

Yuki Tsunoda - FP1: 1:06.262, P17; FP2: 1:05.292, P7

“Everything went in the right direction from FP1 to FP2. We are still missing bits but I can find positives and we will work through it more overnight to keep the momentum going. I am feeling a good confidence in the car, I like this kind of track and attacking into the very high speeds you need confidence. With that, the feeling in FP2 with the car was much better and that is what I need, I don't need more than that. I am still learning about this car and I need to have a good build up into the sessions that matter this weekend. We have had a good approach so far and I just have to put it all together tomorrow.”

Beganovic was in the SF-25 in place of Leclerc, and spent much of his early running with aero rakes on his car. As did Hamilton, the team testing out their new floor here. They ran into issues midway through the session, Hamilton having a gearbox problem while the team needed to take Beganovic's car apart, which limited his running. Leclerc was able to run for the entirety of FP2, although he did have one big moment – running wide through the gravel and over the grass. He was the quicker of the two Ferrari drivers in the early evening session, Hamilton complaining about a lack of pace out there.

Charles Leclerc - FP2: 1 :05.190, P5

""I jumped into the car for the first time in FP2 today and I felt at ease on the track, but not quite there yet in terms of the feeling I had in the car. As usual, our race pace is good, while we have some work to do in order to improve our qualifying trim, so that we can start further ahead and fight at the front of the pack on Sunday.""

Lewis Hamilton - FP1: 1:06.099, P9; FP2: 1:05.511, P10

""We missed some running in FP1 due to a gearbox issue, which set us back a little. FP2 went smoother, but we're still not quite where we want to be in terms of pace. There's work to do overnight, and we'll keep looking for the right adjustments with the team.""

Dino Beganovic - FP1: 1:06.369, P18

""It was a productive day on my side, as I was able to complete our programme supporting the team in gathering data which will be useful at a later stage. Obviously being able to run in an F1 car again feels extremely good, even more so when you've got the Prancing Horse on your race suit. I want to thank Scuderia Ferrari HP and the Academy for this opportunity.

""Now I will switch back my focus to Formula 2, doing my best to bring home some good results this weekend.""

It took both Williams drivers a few laps to get the balance right on the soft tyre, but once they did they both landed solidly in the top 10. Add in the fact that Sainz was very quick on the mediums, and the team had a strong opening session. But FP2 did not go to plan, both cars lacking pace throughout. Neither Sainz nor Albon could extract any speed from the car on the softs, whatever changes they had made between sessions backfiring. They need to find a better set-up for tomorrow if they want to be a factor for Q3.

Alex Albon - FP1: 1:05.946, P7; FP2: 1:05.765, P16

""Yes, we're a little bit confused ourselves as well. It's not feeling terrible up there, but it's not feeling fantastic. We need to understand the wind change.

""We know that we don't like certain winds which might have hit us in a non-favourable way. Also, we're still okay on the harder compounds. It seems like when we put on the Softs we fall back. We need to figure that out. We need to experiment a bit in FP3 and we've always been able to bounce back to a certain point.

""The track should be much hotter tomorrow, which means it kind of resets anyway. For tomorrow, I'm confident if we can get the tyre working, I think we should have the car and we've got the race pace, so let's see.""

Carlos Sainz - FP1: 1:06.017, P8; FP2: 1:05.814, P17

""Overall, I think our performance has been encouraging despite the time sheet after FP2. We clearly had some issues putting a lap together on the Soft tyre, but on the Medium and Hard tyres I felt very competitive out there.

""Compared to other teams, we are struggling to maintain the grip through the lap on the Soft tyre. We will look into it closely tonight. Our race pace seems okay, so we'll try to find answers for the softer compound and improve as the weekend goes by.""

Hadjar and Lawson were both testing out new parts in FP1, Hadjar on the rear wing, Lawson on the front wing. It was the former who found a set-up to his liking, managing to sneak into the top 10. But when the team made some set-up changes between sessions, they managed to create an issue for Lawson, who immediately had problems with his steering wheel at the start of FP2. As such he also locked up and damaged his hard tyres, which was far from ideal. The team rectified the issue, but it did cost the Kiwi some running.

Isack Hadjar - FP1: 1:06.110, P10; FP2: 1:05.547, P13

“It was similar between FP1 and FP2 today. I felt a bit more comfortable in the car during FP2, but here at the Red Bull Ring, all the margins in the field are extremely tight. With just a couple of tenths more, it's possible to gain more than a few places. It won't be easy tomorrow to make it to Q3; it seems  the Astons are faster than us at the moment, but obviously it will be important to put it all together and we'll give our all to get through it.""

Liam Lawson - FP1: 1:06.189, P15; FP2: 1:05.543, P12

“It's close on track so far this weekend, it's a very short lap around here, which naturally leads to close lap times, and given how tight the grid has been all season Qualifying will be extremely competitive. Our car is in a decent place, but like everyone else, we're still chasing improvements. For now we're in an ok window and there's still time to extract more pace. Traffic in Q1 will be a challenge, so managing tyre temperatures and out lap procedures will be crucial. We will need to manage the best we can and hopefully it all pays off.”

Alan Permane, Racing Director

“Today has been a productive day for us, and the car appears to be in a good position. The drivers are reasonably happy, although there is still some work to be done to find the last tenths. Overnight we will see what areas we can improve in to test in FP3 tomorrow. One challenge is today's cooler temperatures compared to the much hotter conditions expected on Sunday, this is something we'll need to factor in when considering the tyre degradation and race strategy. We've seen all three compounds used today on long and short runs and they could all feature on Sunday.”

Alonso had the biggest moment in the opening hour of practice, setting off for a push lap with tyres that were not adequately warmed up. That led to a spin out of the final corner, which was accompanied by a rueful radio message. But the better news for the team is that Stroll looks to have bounced back from a difficult weekend in Canada. He wound up fourth fastest in FP2, and Aston Martin certainly look to have a car capable of Q3 come Qualifying.

""I'm feeling better after the last few races. With the last two in the points, the car feels like it's coming alive again. It's still not quite in the right window, but we will see how we progress as we go into the weekend.

""It's really close out there, so we need to nail the lap in Qualifying tomorrow and make sure our race pace is strong too.""

Lance Stroll - FP1: 1:06.170, P13; FP2: 1:05.022, P4

""It feels good to be back in Austria – it's a great track and I always enjoy coming back here so I'm looking forward to this weekend.

""We've seen some improvements in the car over the last few weeks and we'll try to do the best we can here. It's still early in the weekend for us to say where we're at compared to everyone else, but the car is feeling good so far and we got through our run plan for the day so we'll see tomorrow how it goes.""

Kick Sauber have brought more upgrades here, and given how well their last package went, there were high hopes from the team. Bortoleto was solidly in the top 10 in FP1 to raise hopes, even if Hulkenberg couldn't match his team mate. It was much the same in FP2, the Brazilian in the top 10, Hulkenberg a little further back. But the German's one-lap pace is always impressive, so if the car has pace, Hulkenberg will find it tomorrow for Qualifying.

Nico Hulkenberg - FP1: 1:06.140, P12; FP2: 1:05.918, P19

“It was one of those Fridays where things didn't quite come together. We switched to the updated floor for FP2 and experimented with a few setup directions, but they didn't yield the improvements we were hoping for. The car felt a bit off in terms of grip and balance, so overall, not the smoothest session. But that's what Fridays are for – gathering data, trying things, and learning. I'm confident we'll be able to analyse everything tonight and make the right adjustments ahead of qualifying. Gabriel showed strong pace today, which shows the potential of the car and gives us a solid benchmark. We'll dig into the data now and aim to unlock more performance tomorrow.”

Gabriel Bortoleto - FP1: 1:05.874, P6; FP2: 1:05.411, P8

""Today has been a really positive day. The team did a great job with the upgrades - they seem to be working in the right direction, and I am feeling more and more comfortable in the car every time I jump in. I have always loved this circuit; it has been good to me since F4, F3, F2 – throughout every step. From lap one today, it felt good out there. Of course, we are very mindful this is still Friday, and there are still things to work on here and there, like always, but it feels like we are building something, step by step. If we keep this pace, I really hope we can fight for my first Q3 of the season. We will be going through the feedback we gathered today, keep pushing and see what we can achieve tomorrow.""

Gasly impressed in the opening session, winding up fifth fastest on the soft tyre. Colapinto could not match that, finding himself a little off the pace. The Argentine continued to struggle to hook up a lap in the second session, while Gasly's struggles were of a different sort. Late on, he started to complain that there was something wrong with his car – getting more vociferous as the chequered flag fell. Whatever was going wrong, the Frenchman will hope this evening is enough time to fix it before FP3 tomorrow.

Pierre Gasly - FP1: 1:05.780, P5; FP2: 1:05.613, P14

“It was quite an up and down day for us and we definitely have some improvements to find. Every Friday we are talking about how tight the timesheets are and, on a short lap like here, it really is the case. One or two tenths of a second is the difference between six to seven positions it seems so it just shows how important it is to nail a lap and maximise every detail. I was generally quite happy with my laps in Free Practice 1 and Free Practice 2. We have a few things to find overnight and it was good to assess what works and what does not. We suffered some floor damage in Free Practice 2. I was struggling with the car at the end of the session and now we know why. We will see what we can gain ahead of tomorrow.”

Franco Colapinto - FP1: 1:06.246, P16; FP2: 1:06.176, P20

“With how the last few weekends have played out and here again in Austria, I seem to have more challenges on Fridays. The car feels okay, and it felt better in the first session compared to the second, but we need to find more pace particularly on the Qualifying runs. It does not feel as strong as we do on high fuel, and we need to work hard to find some improvements in lap time. Looking at how we, as a team, reacted and bounced back in Barcelona and Montréal, it gives me confidence we can again take a step forward overnight from Friday to Saturday. So hopefully we can do the same again here and put ourselves in a better position for Qualifying. With how short the lap is, we know it is going to be very close so every detail will count.”

Haas struggled on their hot laps in FP1, the balance of the VF-25 not looking quite settled with Ocon locking up into Turn 1 and flat-spotting his tyres for good measure. On the higher fuel runs both drivers looked more comfortable. Ocon's problems continued in FP2, as he found himself in the garage for a chunk of the session with an issue. Bearman didn't help matters by running wide through Turn 7 and needing his floor checking. Neither driver found the pace they were hoping for, but they will be hoping for better tomorrow once they have analysed the data.

Esteban Ocon – FP1: 1:06.510, P19; FP2: 1:05.698, P15

“It's only practice today – we'll see tomorrow – and usually our race pace is better than our quali pace. It's all heading in the right direction, we're improving the car step-by-step most importantly, and I feel like we've picked up a decent amount of performance from FP1 to FP2. We need to make another step tomorrow as the field is extremely tight all the way through, it's just going to be even tighter here as there's only 10 corners.”

Oliver Bearman - FP1: 1:06.738, P20; FP2: 1:05.835, P18

“It's been a bit of a tough day, struggling for pace. It's very close on a track like this with a very short lap, so we definitely have some work to do tonight. All on my side, I wasn't really driving as I should be, so a bit of work to do. Our high-speed performance was lacking slightly so that's our main target to improve tomorrow. Alarm bells aren't ringing yet as our trend recently has been to be better on Saturday than Friday, and we made a step from FP1, so let's hope that continues.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“It seems that every Friday we struggle to find the sweet spot of getting the car and driver in sync. Today's been a similar story, but FP2 was better than FP1, but we need to look at a few points overnight to improve the car. We can see enough potential there, but to deliver in qualifying we need to pay attention to some details and I'm sure we can do it, I just wish we could start Friday more competitively. The good thing is that we've been here before where we've been slower on Friday and we know how to improve the car. On long runs – similar to Montreal, we show we have a good race car, so our main focus is to fine-tune everything so we can qualify in a good position to be able to fight for points.”

Simone Berra, Pirelli Chief Engineer

“The first day has pretty much confirmed our earlier expectations. On a track that was already quite well rubbered-in, despite the rain that fell yesterday afternoon and evening, performance evolution was limited over the course of the day. Compared to the same day last year, one has to keep in mind that in 2024, this was a Sprint weekend, while this year the teams have the full three hours of free practice before parc fermé rules come into effect. Furthermore, today's temperatures were five degrees lower, even if they are due to rise for the rest of the weekend, especially on Sunday. That's why this afternoon's fastest times are in line with the 2024 pole position time and already close to our simulations (1'04”).

“Today, the delta between compounds also matched our expectations, with around two tenths between the Hard and Medium - although this is an extrapolated figure as we did not get a direct comparison – and half a second between the Medium and Soft. The same goes for tyre degradation, given the expected temperatures on race day.

“It was interesting to see all three compounds in play, even if we believe the Hard and Medium will prove the most popular choices for the race. Today, the Soft worked well, even over long runs and drivers were able to set good times on a second and even a third flying lap, but we have to bear in mind it should be much hotter on Sunday.”

Josep María Martí took his second race victory of the 2025 Formula 2 season in a dramatic Austrian Sprint Race.

Josep María Martí took his second race victory of the 2025 Formula 2 season after a Sprint Race full of drama at the Red Bull Ring.

The Campos Racing driver started from fifth after receiving a grid penalty following Qualifying on Friday, but was up to second with a superb launch and opening few corners.

After a prolonged battle with front-row starter Joshua Duerksen, Martí made an overtake stick on the AIX Racing driver to take the lead and he went on to finish P1, almost three seconds clear of the pack.

The race was red-flagged in the early laps following a multi-car collision at Turn 3. Sami Meguetounif was launched into the air after contact with Arvid Lindblad, and he collected Luke Browning in the process.

All three drivers were out of the cars and okay, and the race resumed after a delay and clean-up operation.

Duerksen led the pack at the restart and retained the lead for the majority of the race. Into the closing stages, Martí made his move at Turns 3 and 4, sealed the lead and never looked back.

Having started second, Duerksen finished on the podium in P2, holding off Invicta Racing's Roman Stanek despite clipping the gravel just a few corners from the chequered flag.

Elsewhere, Alexander Dunne's advantage in the Drivers' Championship was reduced to one point over Richard Verschoor after the MP Motorsport driver finished fourth, with Dunne finishing sixth.

Lando Norris and McLaren set the pace in final practice at the Red Bull Ring as drivers began to test the limits before Qualifying.

Lando Norris remained at the top of the timesheets during Saturday's final practice session for the Austrian Grand Prix, fronting a McLaren 1-2 over team mate Oscar Piastri.

Norris worked his way down to a best time of 1m 04.324s on soft tyres to edge out Piastri by 0.118s, followed by Red Bull's Max Verstappen and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton.

Several drivers had wide moments and brushes with the gravel traps, including championship leader Piastri, who spent a few minutes in the garage midway through the session while mechanics checked for damage to his floor.

Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar and World Champion Verstappen experienced slightly bigger scares, going for full 360 spins at the final corner but avoiding any barriers, while Yuki Tsunoda dropped his Red Bull exiting Turn 1.

George Russell has dismissed his chances at fighting for pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, despite topping FP1 on Friday.

George Russell has dismissed his chances of fighting for pole position at the Austrian Grand Prix, the Mercedes driver admitting it was ""a surprise to us"" to top the opening practice session.

The Briton heads to the Red Bull Ring this weekend having taken victory last time out in Canada, his first of the 2025 campaign having also claimed pole position.

Russell carried that form into the Austrian Grand Prix weekend, posting the fastest time in the first session on Friday, before setting the sixth best time in FP2.

""I mean first practice was definitely a surprise to us,"" said Russell.

""Second practice we definitely didn't have the pace like we did this morning. The quali runs and the race pace was a step worse so we need to analyse why that was.

""The tarmac here is pretty abrasive, it's normally a two-stop race. That doesn't really suit our strengths. As I said, this morning was a real surprise, this afternoon it's probably a bit more in line with our expectations but still fighting to get back on the podium. But the top-five range is realistically where we're at.""

Despite being near the top of the times across Friday, Russell was frank in his assessment of fighting for pole position in Qualifying on Saturday, the McLaren pairing of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri having topped FP2 by several tenths over the rest of the field.

""The McLarens were mighty strong, especially this afternoon,"" said Russell. ""I don't really see that changing and that was the anticipation coming into the weekend unfortunately. We'll do our best but I don't think we'll be fighting for pole this weekend.""

Mercedes team mate Kimi Antonelli enters the weekend off the back of his best result in F1, having claimed his maiden podium at the previous round in Montreal.

The teenage Italian finished 11th in both sessions on Friday and despite struggling for a clean flying lap, believes Mercedes' race pace remains strong.

""Definitely the long run was positive and we were pretty close, just towards the end we started to struggle a bit more compared to the McLaren but the first half of the stint was pretty strong,"" he said.

""Always very positive but we need to do a good Qualifying in order to start at the front and maybe we can put up a fight.""

The case also goes after rappers Babyface Ray and 42 Dugg, whose song ""Ron Artest"" is sampled in the 2023 track.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Flo Milli is facing a copyright lawsuit over her hit 2023 song “Never Lose Me,” which allegedly sampled a beat that had been exclusively licensed to a man in Baltimore four years earlier.


	The Friday (June 27) lawsuit targets Flo Milli (Tamia Monique Carter) over “Never Lose Me,” which peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as Detroit rappers Babyface Ray (Marcellus Rayvon Register) and 42 Dugg (Dion Marquise Hayes) for their 2023 song “Ron Artest,” which Milli sampled on “Never.”


	A man named Shamar Deal, who describes himself as a Baltimore, Md.-based songwriter and recording artist, claims that both “Never Lose Me” and “Ron Artest” infringe his exclusive license to a beat called “Youu” by the producer Gerreaux Katana.




			Trending on Billboard		







	According to the lawsuit, Deal bought “Youu” from Katana via the rap instrumental marketplace Traktrain in 2019. Deal says he was granted an exclusive license to the beat that was supposed to last 10 years.


	But Katana allegedly violated this agreement in 2023 by re-licensing “Youu” to Babyface Ray and 42 Dugg, who used it as the foundation for “Ron Artest.” Deal says Flo Milli then sampled “Ron Artest” for “Never Lose Me,” repeating the Detroit rappers' supposed infringement.


	“As plaintiff currently holds the exclusive right to the composition, the incorporation of the composition in ‘Ron Artest' and ‘Never Lose Me' constitutes copyright infringement of Deal's exclusive rights in the composition track,” writes Deal's attorney Larry Zerner. “Deal brings the current lawsuit to recover damages for the violation of his copyright.”


	Deal is seeking at least $1 million from Flo Milli, Babyface Ray, 42 Dugg and Katana. He also names EMPIRE and Sony Music Entertainment as defendants, saying the companies distributed the two songs at issue.


	“Never Lose Me” was a chart success in 2023 and 2024, also climbing to No. 2 on Billboard‘s Rhythmic Airplay, No. 5 on Hot Rap Songs, No. 6 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and No. 7 on Streaming Songs.


	The track has generated 947.5 million on-demand official streams globally, with 531.3 million of those in the United States, according to data from Luminate.


Billboard reached out to all the defendants or their reps for comment on the lawsuit Friday, but did not immediately receive any responses.

Night one of the queer Brooklyn festival saw the Drag Race star introduce the Am I the Drama? rapper.


													By
												

	Joe Lynch


Executive Digital Director


	While the wider worlds of pop and hip-hop may not have realized it when it was announced earlier this week, the name of Cardi B's long awaited sophomore album, Am I the Drama?, is suspiciously close to a viral quote from Scarlet Envy's time on RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars season six.


	But for the predominantly (if not close to exclusively) LGBTQ revelers at Brooklyn's annual LadyLand Festival, “am I the drama?” is queer meme canon. So when Scarlet Envy emerged onstage at 1:35 a.m. on Friday night (technically Saturday morning, but who's counting) to introduce Cardi's headlining set, absolutely everyone knew why she was there.

	











	“Happy Pride, New York City!” Scarlet shouted, prowling the stage in a shimmering red outfit and gigantic wig. “I'm here every single year — it's good to be on the stage this year, bitch. My name is Scarlet Envy: I'm the drama,” she said to cheers and finger snaps. “I'm blessed to introduce this performer to you. She's an icon, she a legend and she's a hometown hero.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Who's tucking today?” Cardi B yelled at the LadyLand crowd as she rolled up on stage in a black-and-white horizontal-striped jumper. “I'm an old bitch,” she joked. “I have like 100 kids, I'm ready for bed.”


	What happened next was not the handiwork of someone with one foot in slumberland: Cardi led the eager crowd through a breathless tour of her biggest hits, despite the growing rain. “Let's get sexy y'all!” Cardi shouted at the top of her set, perhaps needlessly – the LadyLand attendees, who had been gathering, gyrating, kiki-ing and flirting for hours, were way ahead of her, singing along and shaking ass the moment her tiny frame emerged on the fest's Fist Stage. (For those interested, “Fist and Resist” keychains were available at the merch table.)

	











	Flanked by two giant inflatable fists with nails even longer than hers, Cardi B delivered hits like “She Bad,” “Money” and her new single, the Offset-eviscerating “Outside,” with the effortless fervor and personality-drenched flow that catapulted her to fame.


	“Imma spill some tea, get ready for the tour,” the five-time Billboard Hot 100 topper promised the audience of what was to come. Four of those five chart toppers (“WAP,” “Bodak Yellow,” “I Like It,” “Up”) were accounted for during her show. Despite the persistent rain that gathered strength throughout Cardi's set, the audience remained undaunted and rapt; after all, it's not every day you get to see a hip-hop superstar perform under the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (LadyLand has called Greenpoint's Under the K Bridge Park home since 2023).


	Prior to Cardi B's headlining set, Ladyfag, the LadyLand founder and a driving force in NYC nightlife, told the crowd about her history with the Bronx-raised rapper. “It's a full circle moment for me and Cardi,” she explained: back in 2017, before Cardi ascended to mainstream success with “Bodak Yellow,” she performed up at Holy Mountain, LadyFag's legendary NYC monthly throwdown.


	“She got very excited about being with the gays,” Ladyfag recently told Billboard of that February 2017 party. “She was only supposed to do a few songs, but she wouldn't stop. Within a few months, she became one of the biggest stars in the world — and she always remembered it.” That connection and warmth was obvious on Friday night, with Cardi blowing past her bedtime to give the gays, the dolls and everyone else an experience beyond what any other NYC festival provides.

	











	Saturday (June 28) is the second and last night of LadyLand 2025, with FKA Twigs headlining and performances from Pabllo Vittar, Boris, Eartheater, VTSS, Isabella Lovestory and Kevin Aviance.

	The BBC has revealed how it plans to show Kneecap's Glastonbury performance later today. 


	The corporation has confirmed that the performance will not be streamed live but will be shown on-demand.


	“As the broadcast partner, the BBC is bringing audiences extensive music coverage from Glastonbury, with artists booked by the festival organisers,” a spokeswoman said. “Whilst the BBC doesn't ban artists, our plans ensure that our programming meets our editorial guidelines. We don't always live stream every act from the main stages and look to make an on-demand version of Kneecap's performance available on our digital platforms, alongside more than 90 other sets.”

	The controversial Irish hip-hop trio will take to what will likely be a packed West Holts Stage in less than two hours. We wrote earlier this week about how the BBC was facing a dilemma over its Kneecap coverage, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying the performance is not “appropriate.” Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the following day: “Personally I don't want to see [Kneecap] on TV screens.”

Out and out censorship. We should refuse to pay our licence. The sooner we in Ireland are completely separated legally from backward racist bankrupt police state Britain the BETTER!

they literally called for the murder of MPs and openly support a terrorist organization.

Neil Young's on-off relationship with the BBC and Glastonbury appears to have been resolved, for now, and the singer's set will be shown live tonight on the national broadcaster.


	Yesterday, the BBC said the iconic singer's performance on the Pyramid Stage would not be available to watch at Young's request, with the BBC planning to instead show Charli XCX's performance from the Other Stage. 


	As of the past few minutes, this has been reversed.


	“We are delighted to confirm that Neil Young's headline set from Glastonbury on Saturday will be broadcast live to audiences across the UK on the BBC,” said a spokeswoman. “It will be on iPlayer's Pyramid Stage stream from 10pm, as well as BBC Two and Radio 2. Our on-demand plans continue to be finalised.”

	Young's relationship with Glastonbury and the BBC has been rocky for months. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Earlier this year, after he had been confirmed as headliner, he and his Chrome Hearts band initially said they were pulling out of the country's biggest music fest because it was under the “corporate control” of the BBC. This was also reversed shortly afterwards. 


	Young's will he-won't he is not the biggest controversy at this year's Glastonbury, which is attended by more than 200,000 people and kicked off properly yesterday.


	In a few hours' time, controversial Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap will take to the West Holts Stage and the BBC is still not clarifying how it will go about covering the set. 


	One of the group's members, Mo Chara, is currently bailed on a terror charge after displaying a flag at a London gig in support of Hezbollah – a proscribed terrorist group in the UK. This came a few months after counter-terrorism police said they were assessing videos of a bandmember allegedly telling fans at a gig: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory.

	All eyes are trained on Kneecap and in what form they appear on the national broadcaster, which has said “our plans will ensure that our programming will meet our editorial guidelines.”

					By Stewart Clarke 




EXCLUSIVE: Christian Zübert, the writer and director of hit Netflix film Exterritorial couldn't believe it when his German action thriller scaled the streamer's film charts. “I said to my wife, I hope we don't have a moment like La La Land in 2017 because I was thinking: ‘It's quite unbelievable,'” he says.


	“I was really happy with the movie, it turned out the way I wanted, a mix of a really emotional story and a genre story. I thought, maybe we'll get number one in Germany and in some other countries, and hopefully we won't do too badly in the big markets, like the U.S. and Britain.”

Exterritorial actually sat atop the Netflix film charts in 88 countries including the U.S. and UK. It was the most-watched film in the streamer's non-English language charts for three weeks. Having scaled the heights, the Constantin Film-produced movie is now fifth most-watched non-English language film ever on Netflix with over 85M views and is closing in on fourth spot.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“You start to realize, and I don't say this to brag but more because Netflix has got such a huge reach, maybe at that moment, this was the most seen movie in the world,” Zübert says.


	The story follows former elite soldier Sara Wulf, played by Jeanne Goursaud (Barbarians), whose child mysteriously disappears in the labyrinthine U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany. Forced to go into battle mode after the authorities deny her son was ever there, her search for her missing child unravels a cover-up that dates back to her time in Afghanistan.


	Zübert recalls the idea for the show came while he was working on hit German series Bad Banks. He was in the U.S. consulate trying to get visas for his family. He didn't lose any offspring and embark upon a two-hour carnage-filled mission to get them back, per the film, but the idea was born.


	Netflix's German-language programming boss Sasha Bühler greenlit the movie. “We said maybe we can try to do this emotional take on Die Hard set in a consulate,” Zübert says.

	











	The action elements wedded to the emotional pull of a missing child is the film's secret sauce, the writer-director adds. “You have this framing of the Die Hard-type movie, but there's also this mother looking for a child, and who has to overcome her own self-doubts. Those two elements were really important for me. If you had just taken one element, it probably wouldn't have had the same impact, people would have said: ‘I've seen this a million times.'”


Casting: Dougray Scott's German American Challenge


	The director had seen numerous actors but until he saw Goursaud had not found one who could inhabit the role of Sara Wulf, a mother and ex-soldier haunted by memories of her time in Afghanistan. “That was the first time that I really could see and feel the role. She's not a trained fighter but she was able to work out [the character] and also get the moves. For me, from the beginning, I wanted her to do everything. I didn't want to use any stunt doubles.”


	Goursaud is in a cat and mouse game with Dougray Scott's head of consulate security Erik Kynch.


	“His brain must be really f***ed up, because he's Scottish and he had to play an American with an American accent but who can also speak German, but with an American accent,” Zübert says. “He worked really, really hard, and that was besides the fight training. On set [in Vienna, Austria], he was always saying: ‘Please speak German to me.'”.


	The movie's success is a fillip for the German business and other writers and directors. “We don't have the budget of Hollywood, I wouldn't have had the money to let the whole consulate explode,” Zübert says. “We cannot rely on the budget and the big spectacle; we have to use the narrative and the emotional angles to make something special.”


From Embassies To Equestrian


	Zübert is in Bratislava, Slovakia, when he talks to Deadline and prepping for a TV drama set within the world of showjumping. It has the working title Nordhof and comes from German novelist Julie Zeh. The series is for German public broadcaster ZDF.


	“It showcases the whole world of those really expensive horses which are sold to billionaires,” Zübert explains. “It was written by a famous German novelist called Juliet Zeh and this is her first series. She knows the scene really well. There have been movies about horse racing, but I haven't seen [a project] like this where you really see this world of show jumping [represented] so visually and in such an exciting and new way.”


	Showjumping aside, wasn't the temptation to return to the Exterritorial universe, after all, the industry loves a sequel?


	“I always like to do something new and challenge myself in a new way. I wouldn't say no, but I would say we would have to have a really good idea for that first. I wouldn't just do it just for the heck of it, or just because the first one was successful.”

	The possibility of a live-action take of the 1988 anime movie Akira from Warner Bros is no longer, as Deadline has confirmed that the right have lapsed, now reverted back to manga publisher Kodansha. 


	The movie directed by Katsuhiro Ôtomo follows teenage biker gang member who turns into a rampaging psychic psychopath after a secret military project endangers Neo-Tokyo. The protag learns he has telekinetic abilities which are dangerous to the word. His best friend is the only guy who can stop him. 


	The Burbank, CA lot has had the movie rights since 2002 with directors like Stephen Norrington, Albert Hughes, Jaume Collet-Serra and Taika Waititi circling. Leonardo DiCaprio's Appian way was circling and at one point, Akira, had an $18.5M California Tax credit. Boardwalk Empire star Michael Pitt was even attached to the project at one point, and then Garret Hedlund. Kristen Stewart, Helena Bonham-Carter and Ken Watanabe even kicked the tires on Akira.

	Here's the thing: turning anime into live action movies or even a TV series is hard. Two of the most prolific projects were failures: Paramount turned 1995's Ghost in the Shell into a $110M big screen take starring Scarlett Johansson. The movie tanked grossing just over $40M and under $170M worldwide, rejected by fans for whitewashing the original. The result served as a harbinger to motion picture studios to avoid anime big screen adaptation. Netflix made a 2021 series Cowboy Bebop starring John Cho, Mustafa Shakir and Daniella Pineda. In a total shock, the streamer axed a second season for the series less than a month after it dropped back in December 2021. Shinichiro Watanabe, the original creator of the Cowboy Bebop animated series, expressed to Forbes that he couldn't watch the live-action take.

THR who first reported the story about Akira‘s right today says that development went into eight figures over 20 years. Reportedly there's a bidding war for Akira, but no parties were named.

This is fantastic news. The material is not adaptable. Period. Walk away. Find yourself a 4k copy of the original and enjoy it.

Lots of money will be spent and it will still tank sadly. It's not adaptable. Making it a live action film will require changes that will alienate its core audience.

Well, at least a lot of screenwriters got paid to write Akira scripts that never got produced. 

But anime doesn't really work as big-budget Hollywood studio adaptations. Although I think that Keanu Reeves and the Wachowskis could've made an amazingly terrible American version of Akira back in the late 2000s or early 2010s.

Whoever ends up making this movie please have it make some semblance of sense unlike the original anime

It makes perfect sense if you're paying attention

Still waiting on Otomo's next feature, not a Hollywood bastardization of this

Akira is a perfect movie as an anime. We don't need live-action remakes of everything. Some things should be left alone. 

And for F's sake, do NOT put a white actor in the title role.

	As the 007 franchise has moved away from its more misogynist roots, Matthew Goode wanted to go in another direction.


	The Emmy nominee recently explained why he “didn't get” a chance to audition for the coveted role of MI6 agent James Bond after sharing his vision for the character with franchise producer Barbara Broccoli ahead of the 2006 refresh Casino Royale.


	“I didn't audition. I went in and met Barbara,” he recalled on the Happy Sad Confused podcast. “I didn't get to the audition, but it was quite a funny one because — and she's gorgeous and just a lovely, lovely person.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Goode added, “She was like, ‘So what's your idea for Bond?' And I was like, ‘My idea for Bond, we've gotta take it back to the books, you know? Really, we absolutely have to make this guy an alcoholic, a drug addict. He hates himself. He hates women. He hates a lot of people. He's in deep pain. He's brilliant at killing people.'


	“I think by the end of the interview, she was like, ‘Mhmm. Next.' Because I wanted to make it really dark… but what I should have said was, ‘But also incredibly charming,'” said Goode.


	As the actor noted, “Ultimately, you know, what they did get was Daniel Craig.”


	Craig took over the iconic role in Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012), Spectre (2015) and No Time to Die (2021). Following previous Bond stars Sean Connery, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan, Craig's successor has not yet been chosen.

	











	This week, Amazon MGM Studios officially tapped Denis Villeneuve to direct the next installment amid the studio's new 007 partnership with returning producers Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. Tanya Lapointe will executive produce.


	After announcing that Amy Pascal and David Heyman will produce the next film in the franchise, Amazon MGM's Courtenay Valenti and Sue Kroll said at CinemaCon in April that the pair of “filmmaking legends” is currently in London working on the film.


	“We are committed to honoring the legacy of this iconic character, while bringing a fresh, exhilarating new chapter to audiences around the world alongside Amy and David,” said Valenti, head of Film, Streaming and Theatrical. “They are both in London getting started and couldn't be here tonight, but we wanted to thank them for what we know will be an incredible partnership. Thank you, Amy and David!”

Read the books; he's exactly right. One of the things about Craig's Bond that works so well is including the menace of underlying thug (Connery was the last with that important aspect) to show through the carefully crafted veneer of civility. Bond is so much more interesting than the brand he's been turned into, but there's almost zero chance we'll ever see a more complex take, given the dollar-driven testosterone bonanza he represents now. Read the books; they're great.

Andrew Garfield

Two words: NICHOLAS GALITZINE

Thand God. Tired of dour Bond. Bring fun back.

As long as Ranveer Singh plays the Bond villain. He's so underrated.

	After more than 25 years, Joshua Jackson still blushes about one of his first onscreen sex scenes.


	The actor, who played Blaine Tuttle in 1999's Cruel Intentions, recently recalled an encounter with co-star Eric Mabius “years” after they shared a brief gay sex scene in the Roger Kumble-helmed teen movie, a modern deconstruction of Dangerous Liaisons.


	“I wasn't on Cruel Intentions very much, but I do believe that my first day on this movie was giving a man head,” he told Men's Health. “And that can be stressful for a 19-year old heterosexual boy, to sit in a room, and give another man a blowjob.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Jackson said his “stress test” in the role was “to commit myself to this job that I had taken on, and really make sure… that I was all-in, so to speak.”


	In the hit film, Blaine gets closeted jock Greg McConnell (Mabius) in bed as part of a scheme with pal Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Phillippe) to blackmail him.

Joshua Jackson's first day on Cruel Intentions involved… WHAT??! #fyp


	“So then years pass—and I don't see Eric after a long time after we've had this experience together—and I'm taking out my trash one day, and he and his wife walk by, because they've just moved in down the street,” he continued.


	“She sees us see each other and have this moment of like, ‘Hey, what's up?' And she's like, ‘Oh, how do you guys know each other?'” said Jackson. “And the two of us, now well into our 30s, I think both blushed scarlet red. Like, how do you explain what that connection was?”

He could have just said that they worked together a long time ago. Making it a bigger deal than it needed to be.

I swear the commenters always have to blow things out of proportion.  It's just a little anecdote meant to produce a chuckle…not some deep insightful interview that needs to be dissected.

I think it was brave of him to do it for real rather than simulated. Bravo!

Oh my! How embarrassing for two actors to know each other from working on a film together. His wife must have been mortified.

And he did five takes!

Method acting at its finest!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Friday night means bad news for Doctor Odyssey and Grosse Pointe Garden Society","https://www.avclub.com/doctor-odyssey-grosse-point-garden-society-canceled","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 03:16:00 GMT","

Of all the days of the week where your TV show could get some news, Fridays are almost always, and by a pretty fair margin, the shittiest. We've written many times in this space about the Friday Night TV Murder Pile, where shows get tossed when executives—desperate to not spend their afternoons getting yelled at—toss off a quick “Hey, we're canceling your show and letting the cast's options expire” on the way out the door, presumably on the way to something more fun. And the pile is heaped on this particular Friday night, with news that NBC's Grosse Pointe Garden Society and ABC's Doctor Odyssey have both met their likely ends.

That “likely,” by the way, is largely on behalf of Doctor Odyssey, since it's a Ryan Murphy show, and Murphy has a pretty hefty amount of latitude, with a lot of different networks and streamers, to shuffle his many shows around. The series—which starred Joshua Jackson as a cruise ship doctor, solving nautical medical mysteries—has not, technically, been canceled. But ABC has allowed its actors' contracts to expire, which is generally a death knell for a series, while also stating that the program won't be on its upcoming schedule. Co-starring Don Johnson, Philipa Soo, and Sean Teale, the series started with strong ratings, and has been bolstered with occasional crossovers from other Murphy shows like 9-1-1. But it ultimately floundered as its only season progressed. It could come back some day, somewhere, but it'll have to lock its cast back down in order to do so.

In contrast to Grosse Pointe, which is just plain dead. The series, created by Good Girls creators Jenna Bans and Bill Krebs, was the lowest-rated scripted series at NBC at the moment—but well-liked enough by the folks in charge that there was some hope it might get sent over to Peacock, where it could run and play and live a good, long life out in the streaming countryside. But, uh, nuh-uh: NBC execs ultimately decided the series, while apparently pretty cheap to make by streaming TV standards, just wasn't in the streamer's existing budget, and wasn't expected to massively grow its audience in a new home. And so, just like the corpse secreted away by the titular Garden Society in the show's pilot, the series has now been buried.

Kate Winslet has done pretty well by the modern trend of Certified Movie Stars dipping into the world of TV; her Mare Of Easttown is still held up as one of HBO's best prestige offerings in recent years, mostly on the strength of her committed and fearless performance. (And while her follow-up effort, The Regime, wasn't as critically regarded, it did seem like it was pretty fun to film.) Now, though, it sounds like the Oscar-winner won't be going for a small-screen hat trick: Deadline reports that Winslet has dropped out of The Spot, a TV series she was set to star in and executive produce for A24 and Hulu.

The series, about a successful surgeon (the part vacated by Winslet) and her spouse who believe she might have been the culprit in the hit-and-run death of a child, is the brainchild of creator and showrunner Ed Solomon. (Whose eclectic career includes writing all the Bill And Ted movies, Men In Black, and a number of recent collaborations with Steven Soderbergh.) The series was announced back in August of 2024, and was set to begin filming in early 2026. But Winslet has now dropped out of the project, reportedly over creative differences due to “how the project's evolution has impacted the required approach to the role.” Her departure has sent the production hunting for another “A-list actress” to take over the role, with all involved still hoping to hit that early 2026 filming date.

Of course, The Spot wasn't Winslet's only TV project in the works: She's also supposed to be filming a new HBO miniseries called Trust with Todd Haynes—who knows a bit about big-name actors dropping out of projects, having had his schedule last year blown apart after Joaquin Phoenix ditched out on a film very shortly before shooting was supposed to begin, ultimately causing the entire production to fall apart. So, hey, The Spot: Could be worse!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","On Virgin , Lorde has never been less certain or more alive","https://www.avclub.com/lorde-virgin-album-review-music","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 16:01:46 GMT","

When Lorde emerged on the music scene at 16 years old, seemingly fully formed like Athena springing from Zeus's head, preternatural precociousness was part of her appeal. As an old soul immersed in youth culture, the clear-eyed certainty with which she observed her world permeates her early albums. Her knack for putting the exact right words to growing up in the 21st century earned her a cult following of young people who looked to her to make sense of their lives. Even when she rejected this devotion on her last album Solar Power (“If you're looking for a savior, that's not me”) she was still a “prettier Jesus” preaching from a place of self-assuredness, the “Girl (Who's Seen It All)” and could pass on that wisdom to her followers.

Not anymore. On her messy, visceral fourth album, Virgin, Lorde finally manages to take herself off the pedestal. Her immense songwriting talent is still on display, but the lyrics purposely shed the perfect precision of previous work. (Lorde told Rolling Stone that “in the past, I'm really trying to craft these lyrics. This time I was like, ‘No, be smart enough to let it be really basic. Be plain with language and see what happens.'”) The result is urgent, immediate, and alive in a way Lorde has never been before—and few of her peers could accomplish. 

There will be inevitable comparisons to Charli XCX's Brat, which Lorde (who featured on the beloved “Girl, so confusing” remix) has said influenced her own work. Like Brat, Virgin favors straightforward language and makes dance-pop out of heavy introspection, trading in topics like generational trauma and disordered eating. But Virgin is really a return to the form Lorde herself pioneered on her debut album Pure Heroine; the dark, spare electronic beats of that record had a huge influence on subsequent pop music. Virgin marries that Pure Heroine sensibility with the more naturalistic, acoustic sounds present on Melodrama and Solar Power to surprising effect. A single song will veer into drastically different sonic directions that nevertheless feel inevitable by the time it's over. The lyrical delivery can be syncopated and strange, her typical hyperverbal writing style resistant to easy rhyme or simple resolution. And there are a handful of moments that showcase exciting new sides of her vocal abilities.   

All of this is only possible through Lorde's dogged commitment to transparency, which includes owning up to ugliness: teeth rotting from an eating disorder (“Broken Glass”); problematic viewing of a forbidden sex tape (“Current Affairs”); extreme people pleasing (“Shapeshifter” and “Favorite Daughter”). Virgin emanates self-acceptance, but not in the way Solar Power did. That record presented a tidy conclusion to coming-of-age that ended in a settled identity. On Virgin, Lorde knows that she doesn't always know, that identity is evolving and ever unfinished (“I'm ready to feel like I don't have the answers,” as she sings on “Hammer”). Even her most definitive song, “GRWM,” leaves room for doubt. Adulthood is “Jumping from stone to stone in a riverbed, I guess,” she shrugs playfully. “Maybe you finally know who you wanna be / a grown woman in a baby tee.” Previous iterations of Lorde wouldn't be content with “maybe,” but this version reserves the right to change her mind in the future.

﻿﻿

Accepting life's gray areas doesn't just exhibit personal growth, it makes the album—and the artist—more “rugged” (her word) but also more contemporary. She's able to embrace her role as a “mystic” who “[swims] in waters that would drown so many other bitches,” she sings on “If She Could See Me Now” before mischievously quoting “Suga Suga” by Baby Bash (“Got me lifted, feeling so gifted”). See, Lorde is no longer the kind of mystic who sits high on the hill looking down. She's among the people, listening to the same songs we do, going to the gym, jerking off, letting somebody spit in her mouth. The album's dedication to viscera emphasizes that she's a real, flesh-and-blood 28-year-old woman, not an ageless, unknowable idol. 

If there's a fault in Virgin, it's that the hyperspecificity can occasionally render it unrelatable (“Favorite Daughter,” for instance, is relatable in concept, but allusions to the jet-setting lifestyle of a young pop star with a poet mother are pretty unique). That's the price of entry for a project so baldly honest, and a worthwhile one to pay. More often, the specificity is a benefit, like all great songs that use individual experiences as a doorway to universality. Take the affecting “Clearblue,” which starts particular—”After the ecstasy, testing for pregnancy”—but broadens into an achingly human and beautifully expressed sentiment about how relationships feel like they can change us down to the DNA. Or the gorgeous album closer “David,” which is so particular to Lorde and her relationship that it name-drops her first album. Yet the track opens up to an ecstatic melancholy that could resonate with anyone: “So why do we run to the ones we do?” she asks. Like the fans who see her as an anointed icon, Lorde has sought her own objects of worship in imperfect places. “I made you god 'cause it was all that I knew how to do / but I don't belong to anyone,” she sings.

For those still clamoring for Lorde to tell them how to feel, the pop star does indeed tap into something quintessential about being alive in 2025. “Current Affairs,” for instance, feels like an anxious but accurate reflection of how difficult it is to disentangle our personal dramas from the dystopia of the outside world. Listeners will surely find themselves in these songs, but the conversation is less between the artist and the audience than the audience and herself. On Virgin, Lorde speaks to the person in the mirror, to the innocent teenager she once was, to the masculine and the feminine she recognizes within herself today. Throughout her career, we've watched Lorde grow up, but from a mysterious remove. Now she invites us deep inside the flawed process of personhood, both profound and mundane, mortal and divine. Virgin is an album so earnestly, painfully vulnerable you can almost see straight through to the blood and guts. It's not always polished or pretty, but it doesn't have to be. It's alive.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","A propulsive The Bear sees the whole gang on the upswing","https://www.avclub.com/the-bear-recap-season-4-episode-3","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

[Editor's note: The recap of episode four publishes June 29. This recap contains spoilers.]  

When it's firing on all burners, The Bear's greatest superpower is knowing when to frustrate viewers' hopes and when to give us the catharsis we've been craving. And like Richie pulling out his most epic “surprise” to date, this episode delivers the latter in spades with a propulsive 40 minutes that sees the whole gang on the upswing. And after the muck and mire of season three, it's a massive relief. 

We begin in the wee hours, as Sydney chips away at her latest masterpiece, a delicious-looking scallop dish encircled by buoyant foam. The dreamlike mood of this sequence, complete with colorful lighting and a cherry tree blooming in the dining room through the kitchen window, is a potent visual metaphor for the creative process. She's terrified to present it to Carmy that morning, but to her surprise, he declares it more perfect than perfect.   

And thankfully, Richie seems to have pulled himself out of the hole he fell into last episode. On a phone call with Tiff (Gillian Jacobs), he says The Bear is doing great—and actually seems to mean it. But even a good mood won't get him to agree to attend his ex-wife's wedding.

Over in the 'burbs, Jimmy is struggling to sell his house—and to sell his son on the move. (Where's he moving to and is he planning on using the money from the sale to save The Bear? TBD.) Having neglected his own kid because he's been too busy parenting the Berzatto babies, he's contrite in the Jimmy-est of ways: “You don't deserve disruptive, especially if the motherfucker who disrupted it was your own fuckin' dad.”

The real-estate agent trying to find a buyer is none other than Donna Berzatto (Jamie Lee Curtis). As much of a disaster she is as a mother, she's totally in her element here. She projects big “I will sell this house today” energy as she leads prospective buyers through the kitchen, lying through her teeth about the custom design and Gucci-inspired cabinet handles. Alas, it's not enough to score a sale. 

Back at The Bear, new-and-improved Carmy continues to be a good boss—and a good friend—to his employees. When he finds Marcus puzzling over whether he should agree to meet up with his crappy father, Carm empathizes about how lonely home can feel when your parents suck. We catch a glimmer of the younger, hopeful Bear when he tells Marcus that the truest thing about working at a restaurant is that you're never alone. It's an apt sentiment coming from a guy for whom work and family have always been intertwined.

Meanwhile, the Faks, Chuckie, and Chi-Chi are doing terrifying things with an extension cord inches from a large puddle. It's all in the service of Richie's surprise—Chicago snow in the early fall—for a family coming in that night whose daughter is celebrating six months cancer-free.

It's been hard, even punishing, to have watched The Bear fail for so long, so it's a true release to see the gang have a genuinely great night. There are finally more green Post-its on the order cards than red, Sweeps has found his stride as a somm, and Syd's scallop dish is a huge hit. Hell, Richie even trusts Carm to amp up the presentation on an Italian beef he's bringing to the VIP table.

A lone diner observing Richie make this family's day compliments the food and the vibe and smiles when Richie tells him that making his customers happy makes him happy. He's so jazzed that he fails to clock what, for us, is plain to see: This dude is a restaurant critic—maybe even the one Richie was wondering about.

I don't know about you, but I started crying as soon as the family stepped outside into Richie's winter wonderland, their eyes lighting up under a “snowy” sky. It's a scene straight out of a Hallmark Christmas movie, and that's not a dig in the least. Richie's surprise is as much a gift to viewers as it is to the characters—a slow exhale, a moment of unadulterated joy that we've more than earned. “There's better things you're gonna get into / I wanna be there, too,” Dion sings sweetly on the soundtrack as the entire staff steps outside with beaming smiles. 

Those feel-good vibes propel Carmy out of the kitchen and into the night, writing his own rom-com as he races across town to Claire's (Molly Gordon) apartment. The tension between the two had me holding my breath: Bear struggling to find the words he needs to make things right, Claire hovering on the edge of slamming the door in his face. It's a beautiful scene between a pair of actors who are fully living inside their characters' skins. Even when Claire isn't looking at him, Carm maintains unbroken eye contact—a massive deal for a person who hates to be seen. Once he finally finds his voice, he proves that beneath the gruff, nervous exterior beats the heart of a true romantic. 

He tells Claire it was hard to be around her because he was so in love with her that it felt like he was on fire—and his life has never taught him what to do with happiness. It's so loud in his brain, but it turns out Claire's loud looks a lot like his: She's also scared of intimacy, also terrified she'll ruin everything she touches. When Carmy held her at arm's length, she thought it meant he didn't love her, so she pulled away, too.

Both overcome with emotion, they shout over each other until Carm finally utters the apology we've been waiting so long to hear. Claire reminisces about what might have been if they hadn't been so afraid of opening up to each other. Though she doesn't say never, there's something final about her wish for him to “find some quiet” before she leaves him alone on the stoop. Aside from stolen moments with Claire, Carmy has never heard what quiet sounds like in his life. But when he calls Pete about amending the partnership agreement, we have a hunch it doesn't sound like the din of the kitchen.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Squid Game delivers a claustrophobic masterwork","https://www.avclub.com/squid-game-recap-season-3-episode-2-the-starry-night","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

[Editor's note: The recap of episode three publishes June 29.]   

I don't normally react viscerally to TV. I'll laugh my ass off, and I've cried when a show nails a strong emotional moment. But I have a taste for tension that means it's hard for television to really wind me up. I'm more likely to grin at the artfulness of the screws being turned than give myself over to fictional panic.

I say this not to brag about my stoicism but to showcase what it means when I say that “The Starry Night” absolutely wrecked me. When the credits finally rolled on this hour-long descent into hell, I found myself sitting in front of a dark screen for two full minutes, breathing heavily, just trying to get myself under control. Squid Game is always a tense show and never more so than when one of its lethal games is running. But this episode—which, with the exception of a brief cold open, never leaves the labyrinth our players find themselves trapped in for a deadly bout of hide and seek—displays a level of focus that I wasn't entirely sure the series was capable of in its Squid Game 2/3 incarnation. No fucking around on boats. No tension-cutting comic relief. This is, in many ways, the show's perfect episode. Just knives, loyalty, and death.

Directed, as always, by series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk, the episode pulls the bizarre trick of operating slower than real time, as the half-hour the game officially runs for stretches like molasses in the somnolent glare of a bright blue maze. Hwang uses his labyrinthine setting to fascinating and disorienting effect, deliberately tripping up the viewer by contrasting long tracking shots with rapid cuts that sometimes hide jarring changes in perspective. All of our characters are alone here, whether they're in alliances or not, and the sense of being isolated in a sea of blue only heightens the dream-like nature of the chase—especially when, at any moment, a red jersey could come around the corner, knife in hand, desperate to deal out death.

It's within this ocean of misery that Hwang chooses to bring several of Squid Game‘s running narratives to a close. (This euphemism for getting a blade shoved through your throat is, hopefully, easily understood.) Squid Game 2 was strangely shy about body count, only losing a handful of named characters across its seven episodes. Hwang makes up for lost time here, killing off a huge chunk of his cast in ways that deal nearly as much damage to the killers as to the killed. It's a testament to how well these two seasons have worked to develop these “new” characters that pretty much every resolution brings on some measure of agony, as cruelty and desperation combine with violence, all while the clock ticks down. Each of our characters gets a moment to decide who they are in the crucible of the killing game; very few of them like what they find out.

Take, for instance, Myung-gi, who probably tells himself he's the less vile member of his impromptu duo with drug-addled murderbro Nam-gyu. After all, he's not popping pills, doing his best Thanos impression, and giving cheesy monologues about seeing the light go out of people's eyes. He's killing solely to fulfill his goal. And then again, to seal the deal. And then again, after Nam-gyu appeals to his cryptoscum tendencies by pointing out that taking out additional blue players functionally increases the pot by two deaths, since it'll mean some red somewhere gets eliminated when they can't find a target. Myung-gi swore he was picking up the knife to keep Jun-hee and their rapidly incoming baby safe; he presumably tells himself the same thing, when he turns himself into a spree killer on commission, squeezing a few more won out of the corpses of the innocent.

Speaking of loathsome and unlikely team-ups: Circumstances also end up forcing together Player 100 (Im Jeong-dae) and Player 044 (Seon-nyeo) for a battle of the manipulative snakes. Finding the exit to the maze isn't enough for the blues to escape, it turns out: You also have to have three different keys that were distributed to the hiders at random, representing either collaboration, or, in more practical terms, a willingness to rob corpses. (That's certainly how Jeong-dae gets his extra one, after he wastes exactly zero time shoving an “ally” into the thresher to save his own ass.) Both of these characters have always felt more allegorical than the average Squid Game contestant, standing in for wider and dangerous forces driving people to self-destructive actions. If that's the case, then fake business geniuses end up winning out over fake religious messiahs, as Jeong-dae betrays Seon-nyeo (who's been busy using her own followers as human shields) once they've got the exit door open, for no apparent reason beyond meager profit and spite. She might have survived, even so, if not for a sudden appearance by Min-su, who's whacked out of his mind on guilt (and one of Thanos' loose pills). No talk of karma or demands to the spirits can save her from his wayward knife, as he fantasizes he's saving the murdered Se-mi from Nam-gyu. Certainly, though, that's going to be the most fucked-up murder of the episode, right?  

Cut to Hyun-ju, Geum-ja, and Jun-hee, who've stuck together to stay alive—something that gets a lot more complicated when Jun-hee's ankle snaps, followed swiftly by her water breaking. It falls on Hyun-ju to keep the two more vulnerable women alive while the young mother gives birth, fending off attackers, navigating the labyrinth, and ultimately finding the exit. Faced with the ultimate temptation—she's carrying all three of the trio's keys, for safety—Hyun-ju proves, once and for all, that she's too good for this sinful earth, turning back from certain safety to save the other two. Her reward is a knife to the back, courtesy of Myung-gi, who doesn't realize who he's killed, or who he's done it in front of, until it's far too late. 

Squid Game tends to get a lot of credit for its writing—at least in part, I think, because the language barrier sometimes makes its performances harder to appreciate. But it would have been very easy for Hyun-ju, as the show's only trans character, to have existed as a sort of edgeless cipher, a character made deliberately anodyne because the show's creators were too scared to give her a real personality or flaws. Park Sung-hoon never let that happen, though. In his hands, she was shy, funny, charismatic, and badass, a deeply necessary character to root for as the series has gotten ever darker. Losing the closest thing we've got to a hero right now is a horrifying gut punch, and the episode effectively sells the tragedy of her death. But, hey, at least that's got to be the most fucked-up murder of the episode, right?

Cut to Gi-hun, who stalks the starry hallways like some kind of hyper-focused minotaur, hunting for blood. Our “main character” isn't here to kill blue players; he's not even here to try to ensure his own survival. Our protagonist is wearing red because he intends to kill Dae-ho, and Dae-ho alone, for his “betrayal” during the failed revolution. This is, honestly, the weakest of the various plot threads that run through “The Starry Night,” if only because its resolution is so very obvious (and because it's disconnected from so much else of what happens in this episode). When Gi-hun finally tracks a desperate Dae-ho down, he's confronted with the reality that all he's really doing is externalizing his own guilt, and that the young military faker is just a scapegoat for his own desire to die over how many people he got killed. Which doesn't stop Gi-hun from fatally choking his quarry, out of a blend of rage, survival instinct, and just a smidge of narrative convenience (because the show isn't killing Lee Jung-jae off with four more episodes left to go). He squeezes the last of the life out of the boy just as the clock winds down; seconds later, he turns the knife on himself, but it's too late. The Front Man's guards shoot it out of his hands before he can kill the man he's truly come to hate. But, hey, at least that's got to be the most fucked up murder of the episode. Right? Right?

Cut to Yong-sik, Geum-ja's son and the apparent Charlie Brown of would-be killers. Throughout “The Starry Night,” we check in on his hapless efforts to score a kill, failing each time, and bringing him closer and closer to the moment when he'll be eliminated at game's end. Lucky for him, then, when he stumbles onto two extremely vulnerable targets right at the last moment. The only issue is that they're his mother. And Jun-hee. 

What follows is queasy, horrible, honest, ugly, and absolutely devastating. Yong-sik seems like a nice guy, in small doses. He's funny, goofy, and he tries to be kind. And he is, above all else, weak. It's how he ended up in debt to loan sharks; it's how both he, and his mother, ended up on the island. (Of all the characters we've met in Squid Game 2 and 3, in fact, he's the one closest to the Gi-hun we met back at the beginning of the show.) And that weakness manifests here in the most grotesque way possible, as he begs his mother to step aside and let him murder a new mother holding her baby so that he can live for one more day. He'd never hurt his own mom to keep himself alive, of course. But he'd shamefully sink a knife into someone else's.

But Geum-ja, despite her failings, is not weak and so she finds herself standing at the exact limits of how far co-dependence and love can take a mother. Kang Ae-shim has been one of the highlights of these last two seasons of Squid Game, and she's utterly heartbreaking here, as Geum-ja realizes there's only one way to stop Yong-sik from doing something truly monstrous. With her emergency knife jammed into his back, he's halfway to dying, even before the Pink Guards show up to finish the job. He has just enough time to croak out an apology to his mom before we close on her screams and the shots. 

“The Starry Night” feels, in a lot of ways, like a challenge. Squid Game weathered a lot of accusations of being simple torture porn after it was released, of existing as cruelty for its own sake and little else. And so Hwang has given us an episode that is all murder game, in which our heroes must either kill or be killed, and where we never leave the perspective of rats running in the maze. More than once, during my first watch of it, I had to check the running time of the episode—not because I wasn't riveted, but because I needed to see how much horror was still on the horizon. And yet, very little in the episode feels gratuitous. (It is, essentially, a character piece, with each of our dwindling survivors being tested and mostly found wanting.) The episode represents an extremity: for the characters, for the reality of the show, and for the audience's endurance. Hwang absorbed condemnations for making misery porn and seems to have been moved to create misery art instead, crafting something very close to Squid Game idealized: human beings trapped in a system designed to grind them down and turn them into killers. It might be the best episode the show has ever done. I pray like hell it never tries to repeat the achievement.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","John Travolta Just Surprised Fans with Huge Hair Change","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/john-travolta-surprised-huge-hair-change/","Sat, 28 Jun 2025 16:35:00 GMT","

John Travolta has starred in several iconic movies throughout his illustrious career. However, many fans agree that their favorite of his is “Grease.” Recently, John Travolta appeared at a “Grease” themed sing-along, sporting a significant hair transformation. Naturally, the crowd went wild. 

The beloved actor took to his Instagram on June 26th to show off the new do. He said, “Tonight at the Hollywood Bowl, for the first time, I surprised everyone at the GREASE Sing-A-Long and dressed up as Danny Zuko.”

John Travolta continued, “No one knew. Not even the cast. Thank you for a great evening.(Swipe left to see the video!)”

The first part of the post features the picture of John as his “Grease” character, Danny Zuko. As he says in his post, the second part shows him walking up to the stage in full character. He then greeted everyone on stage. 

A post shared by John Travolta (@johntravolta)

“Grease,” starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, was released in the US in June 1978. According to IMDb, the film had a $6 million budget and became an instant box-office success. To date, it has generated around $400 million, representing a substantial return on the initial investment. 

Due to the success, the film studio soon greenlit a sequel, “Grease 2.” However, the second film did not feature John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Reports say they held meetings to make cameos in the movie, but these plans were ultimately scrapped. 

Sadly, “Grease 2” is generally regarded as a disappointing film. It earned back its production budget at the box office, but the movie didn't make nearly as much as its predecessor. Additionally, critics thought it also fell short of the magic of the first version. Despite this, many fans consider “Grease 2” to be a cult classic film that was misunderstood. 

Regarding the first, as demonstrated by the Hollywood Bowl sing-along, it remains popular with audiences worldwide. 

Many fans would like to see a new version of “Grease” and have John Travolta appear in some capacity. While this isn't in the works, there is a series based on the movie. The show, “Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies,” premiered on Paramount+ in 2023. 

Although there was some fanfare for the “Grease” series, the streaming service canceled it after just one season. Still, “Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies” remains on the platform.

Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez are officially husband and wife! According to a report in People, Amazon founder, 61, and the Emmy-winning journalist, 55, tied the knot on Friday, June 27. 

The couple exchanged their vows in a black-tie ceremony on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, Italy.

Here's an official photo shared by TMZ, 

A post shared by TMZ (@tmz_tv)

The multi-day celebration brought together the couple's closest family and friends, and a star-studded guest list.

Who's who of Hollywood and high society attended the glamorous festivities.

Guests included Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Usher, Karlie Kloss, and Tom Brady.

Also in attendance were Queen Rania of Jordan, Bill Gates and his partner Paula Hurd, François-Henri Pinault, and fashion icons like Diane von Fürstenberg, Domenico Dolce, and Tommy Hilfiger.

According to People, the wedding began with a touching performance of Elvis Presley's “Can't Help Falling in Love,” sung by Matteo Bocelli, which was met with cheers from the guests.

Before arriving at the venue, Bezos and Sánchez were seen leaving the Aman Hotel separately. The bride wore a retro-inspired white suit with a silk headscarf, while Bezos looked sharp in a black tuxedo and aviator sunglasses. Vogue shared official pictures from the wedding.

The couple's wedding weekend began on Wednesday, June 25, when they were photographed arriving in Venice via helicopter, walking hand-in-hand and smiling.

A welcome party was hosted on Thursday night, June 26, at a cloister near the Madonna dell'Orto church. According to People, Guests enjoyed an authentic taste of Italy — pizza made on-site by a famous Neapolitan chef, arancini, fried zucchini flowers, octopus, and lemon cakes.

Initially, the ceremony was set to take place at Scuola Grande della Misericordia on Saturday, June 28. However, due to ongoing local protests, the couple had to move venues at the last minute to ensure safety and privacy.

According to the Associated Press, in a gesture of appreciation, Bezos and Sánchez highlighted Venice's artisanal culture by sourcing nearly 80% of their wedding provisions from local vendors.

That includes pastry shop Rosa Salva and glassmakers at Laguna B. Instead of wedding gifts, guests were encouraged to donate to three local charities: the UNESCO Venice Office, CORILA, and Venice International University.

On their invitation, the couple wrote: “This magical place has gifted us unforgettable memories. Our hope is that through these efforts and by you joining us, Venice will continue to inspire wonder for generations to come.” 

News of Bezos and Sánchez's relationship first emerged in January 2019, shortly after Bezos announced his divorce from MacKenzie Scott. Sánchez was also separating from her then-husband, Patrick Whitesell.

Sources previously told people the couple began working together on projects before gradually developing romantic feelings.

In January 2023, Sánchez opened up about their relationship in WSJ Magazine, saying:“We love to be together and we love to work together.” She also shared a side of Bezos the public rarely sees: “He's really funny. He makes me laugh all the time. He can be goofy.”

The couple got engaged in May 2023 during a romantic getaway to the South of France. Sánchez was spotted wearing a dazzling ring while vacationing aboard Bezos's superyacht, Koru.

Well, despite the initial hiccups, all's well that ends well for the newlyweds!

Somehow, Hallmarkies have courageously survived nearly two years without a Michael Rady sighting in a Hallmark rom-com, cozy mystery, or Christmas movie. But the wait is finally over. 

On June 27, 2025, TV Insider reported that Rady will co-star in “Catch of the Day,” premiering on August 30. Rady had appeared in at least one Hallmark movie every year since 2016, but after the October 2023 premiere of “Where Are You, Christmas?” co-starring Lyndsy Fonseca, the beloved actor's fans have waited patiently for a new project. 

Granted, Rady has been busy. In addition to being a dad of four, he landed a role on his friend Justin Hartley's hit CBS show “Tracker,” and in November, he told EntertainmentNow that he'd just filmed a new Hallmark movie. It's not confirmed if that was “Catch of the Day,” which co-stars Emilie Ullerup and guest star Katie Lee Biegel, but when it premieres, it will mark Rady's official return to the network close to two years after his last movie. 

A post shared by Katie Lee Biegel (@katieleebiegel)

“Catch of the Day” was written by two TV stars. Food Network star and cookbook author Biegel co-wrote the script with Hallmark screenwriter and “Dateline NBC” correspondent Andrea Canning, according to TV Insider. 

Ullerup plays Sophie, according to the synopsis, “a rising culinary star on the verge of becoming executive chef at a high-end Manhattan restaurant. But when her sister Abigail calls with news that their beloved family seafood spot in Montauk is floundering, Sophie returns home to help.” 

Rady will play Sophie's teenage crush Cam, a local fisherman with whom she has a surprising second chance, the logline says, noting that his “quiet strength and charm leave Sophie rethinking everything she thought she wanted.” Biegel, meanwhile, has a cameo in the movie as a blogger, TV Insider reported. 

Hallmark Media VP of Development Laura Gaines told TV Insider, “This all started with Katie Lee's vision of exploring a woman who is pulled between two culinary worlds and ultimately falls in love with her family's legacy, leaving the fine dining world behind to reconnect to her roots.” 

She continued, “And just when I felt the project wouldn't get any stronger, Emilie Ullerup and Michael Rady said yes! This was a dream to work on and has already become a treasured title here at the network. We can't wait to share it with the world this August.”

When EntertainmentNow spoke with Rady in November, he had high hopes for continuing his work on Hallmark movies. 

“I had a grand time on this last one, and I look forward to the next one,” he said, noting that he's had the chance to star with leading ladies like Erin Cahill, Erica Durance, and Nikki Deloach. “I can't believe — I'm so grateful — I can count myself in their ranks. They are some of the most wonderful people I've ever met. They truly are.”

Ullerup has also been on a bit of a hiatus from Hallmark, having also last appeared in 2023 with the movie “Retreat to You.” Before that, she spent seven years on the series “Chesapeake Shores.”

Biegel, meanwhile, is appearing in her second Hallmark movie. She also appeared in 2022's “Groundswell” with Lacey Chabert. 

“Catch of the Day” is scheduled to premiere on August 30 at 8 p.m. Eastern time, and will be available to stream the next day on Hallmark+.

Lisa Kudrow can't escape comedy.

The “Friends” star is returning to a show that may not be as popular but is definitely loved by the fans who have tuned in.

Get ready to return to the world of Valerie Cherish, a woman whose career you will cherish by the end of the show's latest and final run.

“The Comeback” is not “Friends” nor does it need to be. It's as cutting as it needs to be and as heartfelt as it can be. 

Starring Kudrow as Valerie Cherish, the show follows a sitcom actress who could never escape her past. Her return to network TV is in a bad sitcom. To make matters worse, she's starring in a reality show called “The Comeback” that is chronicling her return to TV. 

Season two follows Cherish's second attempt at a career resurgence with help from Andy Cohen. She's cast as a fictionalized version of herself on a separate show, which sparks interest in who she is. A new documentary is made that follows Cherish personally at the cost of losing her real life relationships. 

Although co-star Robert Michael Morris passed away in 2017, Kudrow is set to be joined by other cast members including Dan Bucatinsky, Laura Silverman, and Damian Young.

The first season of “The Comeback” arrived in 2005. It was mostly panned by critics at the time. However, the show found a fandom big enough to warrant a second, eight episode season in 2014.

In a press release, creator Michael Patrick King and Kudrow said of the return “Valerie Cherish has found her way back to the current television landscape. Neither of us are surprised she did.”

Executive Vice President of HBO & Max Comedy Programming, Amy Gravitt, commented on the ability of Cherish to survive in an industry that keeps punishing her. 

“No matter what the industry throws at her, Valerie Cherish is a survivor, Gravitt said. “On the 20th Anniversary of her debut, Michael Patrick King and Lisa Kudrow have brilliantly scripted her return to HBO and we can't wait to see that.”

Season three of “The Comeback” will debut on HBO and HBO Max sometime in 2026.

Scary stuff: filmmaker Danny Boyle said that there were fears from some studio brass that reviews calling “28 Years Later” a moving tear-jerker might spoil its box office potential.

“Obviously, the core audience is a horror audience, and they're concerned if too many reviews call it a weepie. … But the first film was actually very moving, too,” Boyle told The Independent. “So [hiding the film's tearjerker story] is born out of the right instincts. They're just a bit worried [about selling it on that].” Boyle dropped the admittedly banger tagline “you'll weep with terror” during that interview, as well.

 










Boyle also told Variety that “women now form an important part of the horror audience.” He had insisted that women would be interested in the first film, “28 Days Later,” when they were trying to “big up” Naomie Harris' character. “They were dismissive of women watching horror movies. That's changed and I think that's a very good thing, obviously,” he said.

Earlier this month, Boyle spoke with IndieWire about the “connected tissue” between films in the “28” series, as well as the real-life inspirations that were used to craft the sequel.

 










“The virus itself has adapted, and its hosts, the humans who carry it, are changing with it. I think the authorities quarantine the island, isolate it, lock it down, and imagine that it will burn itself out. And it doesn't. Nature won't do that. Ebola does that, apparently. That's one of the ways that we haven't all died of Ebola because when it breaks out in remote villages. It is so virulent that it hasn't got time to spread. It literally just burns itself out. But this one doesn't, and it's learned that its hosts can have behavioral changes, which influences the rest of the story. And you see elements of that in ‘The Bone Temple,' as well. It grew out of the idea that they expended so much energy, they would just burn out. There'd be none of them left,” Boyle explained.

“28 Years Later: The Bone Temple” is set for a January 16, 2026 release, but Boyle insisted that viewers are not getting just “half a film” with “28 Years Later.”

“The film is complete, and then you get this little tail that appears that's, ‘Oh, God. Anyway, we'll see what people think of it.' It is different,” he said.

Director Gerard Johnstone revealed the inspiration for the “dark mirror” AI counterpart to robot M3GAN in the original film's sequel, “M3GAN 2.0” — although he admits AMELIA didn't really turn out as planned.

“The reference was Michelle Pfeiffer in ‘Scarface,' but she ended up looking a lot more like Jessica Rabbit,” Johnstone told Variety. “This is a way for a middle-aged man like myself to play dress-up dolls, so it's a real dream come true.” Johnstone explained that AMELIA — the aforementioned counterpart — had to be more “grungy” and “tactile” than M3GAN. “She's a woman, whereas M3GAN's stuck in the permanent state of adolescence,” he explained.

Tackling an AI-centric in 2025, Johnstone admitted, is “thorny territory,” and that “M3GAN” explores whether or not it is time to take a “pause we can really figure this out and put some systems in place” for the technological advancements.

“iPads and smartphones are everywhere and no one's stopping and saying, ‘Wait, should these be in schools? Should we wait and see what the studies are telling us about how much time kids are spending?' So I'm a big fan of slowing down, but at the same time, I try not to be too preachy about it, because I'm well aware that AI can make incredible gains in medical research and things like that. More regulation. If I ran the world, there would just be more policy put in place and more thought put into it. This thing's not going away. For better or worse, we need to find a way to work with it,” Johnstone concluded.

 










In an interview with THR, series star Allison Williams said that a “second doll was the only way to go” once a follow-up was green lit. This, Williams said, made the series' much-discussed pivot into action thriller a logical step.

“That was not even something that we had explicitly set out to do, but it just felt obvious to Gerard that if there's a second doll, we are going to be in that genre now,” Williams related. “So we let ourselves enjoy that experience.”

Williams is leaving the door open, too, for another outing with the smartalec robot.

“We have big aspirations of big dreams, and I certainly don't feel like I'm done making these movies with these people and this tonal landscape and the subject matter. So, yeah, I have been dreaming of a third, for sure,” she said.

In 2020, when movie theaters across the globe were struggling to survive COVID, the box office received an unlikely hero: “Demon Slayer,” the popular anime action series. In the fall of the year, when new releases were scarce, a film spinoff of the show titled “Mugen Train” received a wide release that attracted audiences in droves. Grossing $507 million worldwide, “Mugen Train” was the highest-grossing film of the year and smashed the record for the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time, serving as a prime example of how the anime market has grown after the last decade.

 










Now — five years, three more seasons, and two compilation films later — “Mugen Train” is getting a proper cinematic followup. Crunchyroll has unveiled the trailer for “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle,” a new original film in the anime universe. And it won't just be any film — the movie will kick off a full-fledged trilogy of movies, adapting the original manga's climactic story arc.

Written by anonymous manga artist Koyoharu Gotouge, the original “Demon Slayer” manga was published in the magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from 2016 to 2020, concluding with 205 chapters published. Set in a fantasy version of early 1900s Japan, the series focuses on the adventures Tanjiro Kamado, an ordinary boy whose peaceful life in the mountains is disrupted when demons murder his family. The only survivor is his youngest sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a demon herself. Taking Nezuko along with him, Tanjiro trains in the art of demon slaying in order to find a way to reverse his sister's curse and ultimately find vengeance. 

Over the course of its run, “Demon Slayer” became one of the most popular manga series of all time and a worldwide pop culture phenomenon, grossing $150 million since 2021. Much of its success can be attributed to the anime adaptation, produced by animation studio Ufotable and directed by Haruo Sotozaki, which premiered in 2019 and became a viral word of mouth hit thanks to its high quality animated fight scenes. The series has since run for four seasons and 63 episodes, in addition to “Mugen Train,” which adapted one of the manga's most notable story arcs. 

In the manga, the “Infinity Castle” chapters see Tanjiro and the Demon Slayer Corps get abducted and sent into the titular extra-dimensional world, a stronghold for demons. As they fight to escape, Tanjiro confronts Muzan Kibutsuji, the demon who originally killed his family. The “Infinity Castle” film — which, like “Mugen Train,” is directed by Sotozaki — will adapt only part of the arc, before two sequel films follow to complete a trilogy. The manga continued for roughly 20 chapters after the “Infinity Castle” arc, but it's unclear if the trilogy will be followed by another season of the show or if the final film will incorporate that content and act as the anime's grand finale. 

 










Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures Entertainment will release “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle” in U.S. theaters on September 12, including on premium formats like IMAX. Release dates for the next two planned films have not been announced. Watch the trailer for the film below.

Some industrious fan should organize the Lorde walking tour of New York—people would pay money to see where contemporary pop's most famous mystic has deposited trails of her magic dust. Start at the Flame Diner near Columbus Circle, where she worked late into the night writing lyrics for 2017's Melodrama; cut across the park to the Met, where she once stole that fork as a souvenir for her mom. Swing down to Canal Street where, as she tells us in the opening moments of her fourth album, Virgin, she's getting her ears pierced and her aura read. Then across the Williamsburg Bridge to end the night dancing at Baby's All Right.

For her last album, 2021's Solar Power, Lorde took an extended beachside sabbatical, channeling her retreat into psychedelic, somewhat stifled acoustic pop that felt out of place and time. Afterward, four years ago now, she plugged back in and bought an apartment in Manhattan. She befriended artists and read a lot of books; she went through a breakup, came to terms with an eating disorder, and began to inhabit a more fluid understanding of her gender.

This broad set of circumstances—moving to and finding oneself in the city—has precipitated so much art that it almost feels too obvious to bother pointing out. But some make the familiar story revelatory. I think of Nan Goldin, whose Ballad of Sexual Dependency is a vital record of queer downtown New York in the 1980s. Her photos—flash-lit, unsentimental images of tangled lovers and friends—are lodged in my head as I listen to Virgin, Lorde's gritty, tender, and often transcendent ode to freedom and transformation.

Maybe Lorde agrees with the masses that Solar Power never hit quite the same as Melodrama. Maybe that's why Virgin circles back to the body-friendly, programmed drums and synthetic sparks she left in 2017, with a lead single so analogous to Melodrama's that she could have just called it “Blue Light.” Former right-hand man Jack Antonoff is absent—Lorde's primary creative partner here is Jim-E Stack, who has worked with Bon Iver and Caroline Polachek, with additional contributions from pop producer du jour Dan Nigro. The new collaborators settle into familiar rhythms. Like Melodrama, Virgin touches off from heartbreak and swims gracefully through its aftermath. Its title is unrelated to sexual purity—if anything, Lorde's references to sex here are exceptionally frank. Rather, it signals a state of innocence and exploration, of hunger for experience, that seems to have pulled Lorde back to an earlier version of herself.

Those experiences she's after are intensely physical, though not as glamorous or easily aestheticized as you'd expect from a pop artist. Twenty seconds into opener “Hammer,” Lorde utters a word I'd wager has never been heard in the Hot 100—“ovulation”—and follows it up with “Some days I'm a woman/Some days I'm a man,” a striking, if uncharacteristically blunt, subversion of biological essentialism. On Virgin, her singing is visceral and sometimes—there's no other word—orgasmic. Her relationship to her own body is complicated by her history of disordered eating, which she references freely across the album. But in her telling, living in a human body is also sublime (“The mist from the fountain is kissing my neck”) and cathartic (“I rode you until I cried”). And it's abject: It's cum on your chest and acid reflux from throwing up and peeing on a stick because you might be pregnant.

That last vignette comes from “Clearblue,” a spare swirl of vocoder melody à la Imogen Heap. It's all Lorde's voice, words running across her tongue like ribbons curling against a blade as she recounts a pregnancy scare that blurred the boundaries between intimacy and independence. The incident passes, becoming a precious reminder of her own vitality; the test a relic, lost to the trash. But the topic of motherhood remains potent. The presence of Lorde's mom, the poet Sonja Yelich, is felt across the album—particularly on “Favourite Daughter,” a bubbly number where Lorde imagines her own career as the fulfillment of her mother's ambitions. Lorde's choice of album cover, too, is meaningful: Heji Shin, the photographer who X-rayed her pelvis, is perhaps best known for her raw images of crowning newborns. Documents of the grotesque and generative potential of the human body, they can also be read as metaphors for the bloody labor of creativity.

Now 28, Lorde can't be neatly mapped on the continuum of girlhood to womanhood to motherhood. This is the consequence of being known as a perennial wunderkind, a sage since 16, and now also a sort of mother to her dozens of musical descendants. (She calls her fans her “kids,” too.) She gets at this state of multitude on “GRWM,” declaring herself “a grown woman in a baby tee”—an objectively dumb lyric that she's just confident enough to pull off. The production here, as on much of the record, is minimal—a rattling beat and some synth stabs, adding muscle but not bulk and pushing Lorde's voice and words to the foreground.

It's long been her writing that telegraphs Lorde's capital-A artistry. Where someone like Charli XCX is keen to move culture, and Addison Rae is keen to put on a good show, Lorde is happy to sweat it out in the Notes app. The music's job, it seems here, is mostly to not get in her way. “Shapeshifter” is a high mark, a lovely bit of text painting that starts with a skeletal garage beat, shaded in gradually until it hits you with a full bleed of color. This song moves; it mirrors the state of constant flux that Lorde is singing about. Virgin could stand to have more of that synergy—production touches that are as freaky and unpredictable as the person at their center. Instead, there's the glitchy vocal fragments and oddball samples that we've heard before. There's so much negative space, it feels almost like a tease, because it implies everything that could fill it.

But that ecstatic sense of possibility—of being many things at once, of following your impulses in all directions, all the time—is the animating force of Virgin. Some would be cowed by the enormity of the prospect. Not Lorde: “I swim in waters that would drown so many other bitches,” she crows on “If She Could See Me Now.” It's not hard to see why she's drawn to another stop on the Lorde tour of New York: Walter De Maria's Earth Room (1977), a Soho loft filled with nothing but 250 cubic yards of dirt. Lorde recreated it in her video for “Man of the Year,” where she binds her chest with duct tape and thrashes about in the soil, tapped into some elemental lifeforce. The original installation has been there for nearly 50 years; nothing grows. The whole thing is pregnant with possibility, blissfully abstract, ripe for interpretation. It feels like a portal to anywhere you want to go.

	It was captured on the Ring camera. In the footage, Martin Díaz, 35, runs across the front lawn of his house, indistinguishable from the officers in plainclothes who follow, pepper spraying Díaz as he attempts to make his escape through the garden gate, dragging him back toward the sidewalk, and tackling him to the ground next to a potted plant. “I got you, fucker,” one of the agents says. The struggle lasts for several seconds, but Díaz's hands are pinned. 


	From another camera angle on the back patio, Díaz's roommate tells the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who have not identified themselves or presented a warrant, that they are not allowed on the property, but they brush him off. He also attempts in vain to advocate for his friend, saying, “He's a good guy!”


	“No, he's not,” an agent says. The whole altercation is two minutes long. 


	Though Díaz was initially processed for deportation on April 29, he wouldn't stay long in ICE detention. Instead, he's now in the county jail in Spokane, Washington, because one of the ICE agents filed a criminal charge in federal court several days later, claiming Díaz elbowed him in the face. For assaulting a federal officer, Díaz is facing a possible sentence of 20 years in prison as well as a $250,000 fine. 

	











	But Martin Díaz's wife, Kendall Díaz, said in an interview that the Ring camera footage is proof he did not elbow the ICE agents. She believes the agents made up the extra charges. “Of course, I believe he didn't do that… I think it's a retaliation,” she said. Three days before the extra charges were filed, Kendall posted a photo to Facebook of one of the faces of the officers involved in the arrest. 

	











	Since President Donald Trump took office in January, violent ICE arrests have been caught on camera across the country. In the clips, many of which have gone viral, agents are seen smashing the window of a car with a pregnant woman inside, vigorously beating a man who is curled up on the asphalt, and tossing tear gas canisters near a toddler and a baby.

	The Department of Homeland Security has presented ICE agents themselves as the real victims here. DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin says assaults against ICE agents have risen 500 percent since the beginning of the year. 


	DHS refused to respond to Rolling Stone's request for the total number of assaults against ICE agents. DHS has never made this information public, so it is unknown whether the 500 percent increase is between 10 and 60 assaults or 200 and 1,200. Rolling Stone also asked for clarification as to whether the figure refers to accusations or legal charges, as well as the definition of assault used in the statistic. Assault on a federal officer can be a felony or a misdemeanor, with possible sentences varying in severity. Other publications have met similar resistance in communication with DHS about this topic. The press release DHS sent to Rolling Stone on June 20 just links to a Breitbart article that claims to have “exclusive data,” but does not reveal anything other than the 500 percent number. 


	Recent data on immigrants booked into ICE custody acquired by Rolling Stone lists 35 pending assault charges since October 2024, but it is not clear whether those potential assaults were against ICE officers. From DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's public statements, though, it appears any physical contact with an ICE officer could now be classified as assault, and the agency is prepared to file charges against anyone and everyone as they see fit. “You will not stop us or slow us down. ICE and our federal law enforcement partners will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Noem said in a recent statement.

	Even Democratic politicians have been arrested in recent weeks during altercations with ICE officers, including New York City Comptroller Brad Lander and Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.). Lander was arrested while escorting an immigrant out of a courtroom and DHS made a public statement saying he would be charged with assault, but the charges were dropped, while McIver was arrested at a protest in front of an ICE detention center and was indicted with three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding, and interfering with federal officials. 

	











	In a statement, McIver called the charges against her “a brazen attempt at political intimidation,” part of “an effort by Trump's administration to dodge accountability for the chaos ICE caused and scare me out of doing the work I was elected to do.”


	Lander and McIver's altercations with ICE officers were filmed and took place amid a forest of bystanders, but many of these assault cases will rest only on the testimony of the people involved. In May, ICE charged Francisco DeJesus Morales, an undocumented man from Nicaragua with no criminal history (crossing the border without authorization is not a crime) with assault for grabbing and twisting an ICE officer's testicles. At a workplace raid in Omaha, Nebraska on June 10, a Honduran man, Marvin Aleman Zepeda, was arrested and charged with the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon to assault, resist, or impede a federal officer — ICE agents say he brandished a box cutter while hiding in the crawl space of a warehouse after the agents had tasered his leg. Cases like these balance on the integrity of the agents involved, and any evidence they can provide of physical injuries. 


	Sometimes, the claims unravel. On June 18, ICE agents arrested a U.S. citizen, Adrian Andrew Martinez, 20, at a Walmart in Pico Rivera, California. Martinez approached the agents in an attempt to defend one of the store's janitors against deportation. A Border Patrol Assistant Chief told a local Fox station that Martinez was arrested because he punched two officers. Later, the Walmart store compiled security camera footage of the whole interaction, which includes no punches, only the officers throwing Martinez to the ground three times as he argues with them. When the footage was released, instead of assault, Martinez was charged with felony conspiracy to impede or injure an officer (a possible six-year sentence), charges that his lawyers claim were “trumped up” and “filed to justify the federal agents' violent treatment of Adrian.” 


	José Manuel Mojica, also a U.S. citizen, participated in the anti-ICE protests in Paramount, California, on June 7, and was charged with impeding a federal officer, with a possible prison sentence of 8 years, after he attempted to halt a violent altercation between another protester and an agent. Instead of pushing an officer, as the charges allege, Mojica says he was slammed to the ground, blacked out, and thought he “was going to die.” Mojica has the video evidence of the incident, and the bruises, to prove it. 

	











	In any of these cases, if the ICE agents had been local police officers, the possible sentences for these crimes would be lighter, a reality that criminal defense attorneys are now urging the public to understand as civilians interact with federal agents for the first time in their workplaces, schools, and neighborhoods. An officer can file charges any time someone doesn't comply with a verbal order and has any physical reaction that does not follow the order. 


	The situation is complicated by the fact that ICE officers often refuse to identify themselves, as well as their new costume: plainclothes, unmarked cars, and face coverings. Even if the officers are armed, nearly anyone can own a firearm in America. To many who encounter them, the ICE officers appear far more like criminals than the people they arrest. 


	Kendall Díaz said a group of Customs and Border Patrol officers showed up at her house several weeks before her husband's arrest, but he wasn't home. They bumped into her car in the driveway in a false attempt to get her attention and start a conversation, pretending to be civilians. When Díaz asked one of the agents why another one was staring inside the window of her home, the agent replied that he was “off his meds.” It was only later that the agents revealed that they were from CBP and had been watching the couple for weeks. 


	“It was super weird behavior,” Díaz said. “We asked for proof of ID and a warrant and they refused to give us any information.”


	Complicating matters further, ICE impersonators have been arrested in at least six states over the past few months, including two men who used their false identities as ICE agents to sexually assault immigrant women. If it is impossible to tell who is a real federal officer, California state Senator Scott Weiner says, the public will lose trust in law enforcement. “The recent federal operations in California have created an environment of profound terror. If we want the public to trust law enforcement, we cannot allow them to behave like secret police in an authoritarian state,” he said in a press release. 


	In El Monte, California on June 20, ICE agents tackled a U.S. citizen, and after realizing their mistake, asked, “Why were you running?” — as if there could be no explanation why one would run from masked, armed men, if not undocumented. 


	Former ICE Chief of Staff Jason Houser, who worked at the agency during the Biden administration, says the new directives from the Trump team are putting ICE agents in positions at odds with their former role in society, triggering “combustible” situations with civilians, as the agency lurches towards valuing optics over public safety. While the majority of ICE's previous work involved tracking and arresting undocumented people with criminal convictions, the Trump administration has now set a quota of 3,000 arrests per day. This has led ICE to turn to the easiest people to find, rather than the arrests deemed most necessary. Since January, ICE has picked up double the average number of people, and less than 10 percent have serious criminal convictions. 

	











	In other words, ICE agents are unaccustomed to picking up everyday people from Home Depot parking lots, city sidewalks, or courthouses, areas where there could be crowds of citizens dissenting. In Los Angeles on June 24, an ICE agent pointed a taser at the head of a U.S. citizen who was filming an arrest. He attempted to swat away her phone and shouted, “You're resisting!” — even though filming a federal officer was her legal right. 


	José Manuel Mojica, the protester charged with assaulting an ICE officer in Paramount said, on the way to the police station, one of the ICE agents told him,, “Don't act like you're not used to this,” but Mojica had never been arrested before in his life. 


	David Bier, a research fellow on immigration at the Cato Institute who has been tracking ICE detentions, said there has also been a 500 percent increase in ICE arrests on the street in public places. Bier said given the tense environment, and the threat of being sent to a prison in a foreign country like El Salvador with no hope for release, the idea that people would fight back against arrests, leading to a 500 percent increase in perceived assaults, is “not surprising.”  


	Bier also believes the vast majority of DHS' assault claims could be accusations that never translate into criminal charges. “If I spit at ICE officers and it hits five of them, that's assault on five officers,” he said. 


	And sometimes, DHS just makes things up. On June 13, DHS responded to a viral video on X of ICE agents arresting a U.S. citizen and stealing his ID. They claimed the man in the video, Brian Gavidia, assaulted an ICE officer, but he was never charged. 


	Regardless of whether civilians are assaulting ICE officers in large numbers, Houser says threats of criminal charges can be used to coerce people already in custody. Since October, 2024, over 44,000 people have been listed with “pending” charges when they were booked into detention. These pending charges may never be filed. With the goal of maximum political impact, Houser says many statistics released by ICE under the Trump administration are misleading. “They're going to the check-out at the grocery store and double-scanning their bananas,” he said. 


	When an immigrant is placed in a detention center under deportation proceedings, they are not guaranteed legal representation. Often, federal agents will attempt to convince the immigrant to sign papers authorizing their own deportation, so their removal is expedited, without any input from a judge. Otherwise, the immigrant would take up a bed in a detention center for months waiting for a court hearing. The threat of prison time could get an immigrant to give up hope on their release, Houser says. “They're using it as a tactic because they're trying to get voluntary removal.”

	











	Amanda Schuft, a lawyer with Immigrant Defenders Law Center in Los Angeles, says ICE officers and other DHS personnel have also taken action to impede immigrants' knowledge of their rights and legal representation in recent weeks. “It's very concerning that it's been so hard for us to get in touch with people who are getting arrested,” she said. “They don't have access to information that they don't have to sign a deportation order.” 


	While she waits for her husband's trial, Kendall Díaz says she is confident the camera footage will prove Martin's innocence. But he still could be deported to Mexico if acquitted, even though he is married to a U.S. citizen and has submitted an application for a green card. Díaz's lawyers have told her Martin will probably be re-arrested by ICE in the courthouse, immediately after the trial concludes.

	The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that lower federal courts should not have the power to issue nationwide injunctions blocking presidential orders — no matter how obviously unconstitutional such an order may be.


	The decision is a monumental gift to Donald Trump's administration, which is seeking to implement much of its anti-immigration and other policy priorities through executive orders. The ruling was 6-3, with the court's six conservative justices opting to restrict the power of the lower courts. 


	The ruling comes in response to the Trump administration's argument that the judiciary does not have the power to block the president's executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, a right enshrined in the Constitution. The Supreme Court's ruling effectively restricts the injunctions that blocked the birthright citizenship order, and could potentially apply to other authoritarian actions by Trump and his administration that have been blocked by federal courts.

	











	Trump was ecstatic. “GIANT WIN in the United States Supreme Court!” he wrote on Truth Social. “Even the Birthright Citizenship Hoax has been, indirectly, hit hard. It had to do with the babies of slaves (same year!), not the SCAMMING of our Immigration process. Congratulations to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Solicitor General John Sauer, and the entire DOJ.”

	“Thanks to this decision, we can now promptly file to proceed with numerous policies that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis, and some of the cases we're talking about would be ending birthright citizenship,” the president added at a news conference later on Friday.

	











	The day he was inaugurated, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled, “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” which was intended to strip the children of non-citizen immigrants — regardless of their legal status — of the right to American citizenship if they were born in the United States. 


	The effort is blatantly unconstitutional. The 15th Amendment guarantees citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” The order was challenged in multiple lawsuits, and its implementation was quickly blocked by several district court judges across multiple states.

	In response, the Trump administration disregarded the question of the order's constitutionality almost entirely, appealing to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the lower courts don't actually have the right to issue nationwide injunctions against an executive policy. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, called out the administration's tactics in her dissent of Friday's decision.


	“The gamesmanship in this request is apparent and the government makes no attempt to hide it,” she wrote. “Yet, shamefully, this court plays along.”


	“No right is safe in the new legal regime the court creates,” Sotomayor continued. “Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship. The majority holds that, absent cumbersome class-action litigation, courts cannot completely enjoin even such plainly unlawful policies unless doing so is necessary to afford the formal parties complete relief. That holding renders constitutional guarantees meaningful in name only for any individuals who are not parties to a lawsuit.”


	During oral arguments in May, lawyers for the Justice Department argued that executive orders could not be blocked by the lower courts, and should be allowed to go into effect until something like a class-action lawsuit against a given policy makes its way to the Supreme Court.

	“Your argument turns our justice system into a catch me if you can kind of regime from the standpoint of the executive where everybody has to have a lawyer and file a lawsuit in order for the government to stop violating people's rights,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said during one oral argument exchange with U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer.

	











	The Supreme Court is controlled by conservatives, though, three of which Trump appointed in his first term. In the end, they agreed with the Justice Department.

	Alan Sepinwall



This post contains spoilers for the entire fourth season of The Bear, now streaming on Hulu. 


The Bear Season Four finale is called “Goodbye.” This could be read a lot of different ways, given both its subject matter and its placement in the season. The episode — a single scene, shot on one location, largely just featuring Carmy and Sydney, with Richie and then Natalie joining later — is about Carmy's decision to quit the restaurant and leave Syd in charge. So that could be the goodbye, even though he insists he will stick around long enough to get The Bear out of the financial hole he dug for it with his ridiculous behavior throughout the third season and the first part of this one. The goodbye could simply be that this is the last episode of the season, and we'll have to wait another year to see all our cousins again. It could be that the series continues, but without Carmy as a regular presence, while Jeremy Allen White goes off to try to be a movie star. 

	











	Or it could be a goodbye from The Bear altogether. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







The Bear creator Christopher Storer, who wrote and directed the finale, rarely does press. And I'm told FX has no immediate plans to announce anything about the show's future — whether that would be a renewal for a fifth and final season, a more open-ended renewal, or the declaration that “Goodbye” is meant to be taken literally. All we can do for now is guess, stuck in the same kind of limbo in which Carmy is leaving Syd, Richie, Natalie, and the rest of the group with his plan to abandon the culinary arts and figure out who he actually is. And we can argue about how rewarding it would feel if this is a permanent goodbye from all involved. 

	











	Leaving all those questions aside for a moment, “Goodbye” is another remarkable chapter in a season that had several of those. It's a pretty textbook example of a bottle episode — shot on a single preexisting set (or, in this case, in a single location that the production uses regularly), with no guest stars (and most of the regular cast missing, at that), to save money that can be spent elsewhere in the season (in this case, getting every famous person in Storer's phone to guest star in the wedding episode). It's all about the actors, whom Storer films in very tight shots, focusing on their expressive faces, and demonstrating how physical closeness and emotional closeness are wildly different things.

	To Carmy, giving Syd the restaurant is a kindness — to her, to him, and to everyone who works there. He's miserable and erratic, in part because, as he tells Richie later in the scene, “I don't know what I'm like.” And he's making them all miserable in the process. 


	To Syd, Carmy's choice is one more betrayal by a mentor who's been the scorpion to her proverbial frog. He keeps apologizing. He keeps promising to do better. And he keeps failing her. She turned down the offer to build a new restaurant with Adam Shapiro(*) because she wanted to work at this place — and to specifically work with Carmy, who made the best meal she's ever eaten, and who inspired her to be her best chef self. She loves everyone at The Bear, but she came there for Carmy. On the occasions when he's able to get his various neuroses under control, he's an incredible partner who makes Syd feel better about herself than even her beloved father can. And when he's failing at that, at least she can console herself with the understanding that the good version of Carmy will make an appearance sooner or later. But that can't happen if all versions of Carmy quit. 


(*) It was nice of Shapiro, however, to immediately confirm for Syd that she made the right call by petulantly accusing her of making “a truly idiotic decision.” 


	Carmy tries telling her that he has to get away from here in order to “make me not like this!” Syd's reply is an entirely reasonable, “How?” He admits that he doesn't know, then pivots the conversation to the more important idea: Carmy may have worked at the greatest restaurants in the world, and for the greatest chefs, and been celebrated for his own work, but Syd is simply better at all of this than he is. She's a better manager of people, and has even turned out to be the better chef — it's her scallop dish generating buzz this season, rather than one of his creations. She has her own anxieties, but most of them are triggered by him. He tells her he believes in her more than he's ever believed in himself, and when she understandably asks him why, he says the only thing that makes sense to him: “Because you're the Bear.” People call him that because of his last name, and even people who aren't technically members of the family, like Claire, often get a nickname with “Bear” in it. Sydney has never felt like a part of that extended Berzatto clan, but she is. She's an artist like Carmy. She's an admirable leader like Mikey was. She's empathetic and warm like Sugar. Carmy started this version of the restaurant, but it works because of her.

	Still, this is a lot to spring on a person in one conversation, and before Syd can even fully absorb it, Richie steps out into the alley, and greets the news of Carmy's planned departure with complete exasperation. These two have always been uneasy allies, each jealous of the other's relationship with Mikey, each convinced the other is somehow more comfortable among all the biological and adopted Berzattos, each incapable of giving a proper apology to the other one. Richie hears that Carmy is leaving, and immediately his mind goes back to the period when Carmy was in New York while Richie was the one trying and failing to pull Mikey out of the spiral that ultimately killed him. Bringing Richie back to the present first requires Carmy to admit a shameful secret from the past, confessing that he went to Mikey's funeral but left immediately because he couldn't handle it. Hearing this, and hearing Carmy finally acknowledge that Richie lost a brother, too, is enough to snap Richie out of his anger. And witnessing this moment makes Syd realize the condition she'll require in order to allow Carmy to leave: Richie has to be a partner, too, along with Syd, Sugar, and Uncle Jimmy. When Syd first showed up at The Original Beef of Chicagoland and started working with Carmy to turn a sandwich shop into a fine dining restaurant, Richie was at the front of the pack (alongside Tina) opposing what was being done to his beloved workplace. But they've long since moved past that — in part by bonding over their shared frustration with Carmy — and it feels like a fitting and poignant sign of how far they've come that Syd insists on giving Richie a financial stake in The Bear to go along with his emotional one. 


	Finally, a fourth member of the team joins them, as Sugar wonders what they're all doing out here. Syd explains that Carmy is leaving. And where Syd and Richie both responded to this news by feeling shocked and betrayed, Natalie — who knows her brother in a way even his best friends never quite will — immediately understands why. She hugs him in support, but also weeps, not only because she'll be losing a chance to work with him every day, but because she knows how much Carmy has suffered. And she knows that Mikey never gave himself the same kind of break.  


	Technically, the episode isn't just that scene. After the hug, we get a glimpse of Chicago at night, and then go into the restaurant's empty kitchen. It's after 1 a.m. Everyone has gone home to sleep and prepare for the next day's service. And the digital countdown clock, which Uncle Jimmy had his friend Computer install, finally reaches zero. 

	











	By then, we understand that zero hour doesn't mean the restaurant immediately shuts down; just that Jimmy will stop devoting any money to it, and will begin at least exploring what he could get from selling the building. It's an underwhelming, poorly-explained pivot, since the beginning of the season implied the more dire scenario(*). Still, it's the end of the money, if not the end of The Bear. But is it the end of The Bear? 


(*) It's also something where the show cheated at least a little. Carmy and the others have to keep cutting back expenses just to keep the restaurant functional while Jimmy slowly shuts off the money tap. Yet Richie is able to hire Jessica, Garrett, and Rene from Ever — a.k.a. the best restaurant in the world, at least until its owner decided, like Carmy, to move on to something else — who surely don't come that cheap, even for a friend. And when Marcus is in desperate need of help with the desserts, his former teacher Luca just so happens to be in town and willing to work for free for weeks on end. It's great to have all these characters back — particularly in the chemistry between Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Sarah Ramos as Richie and Jessica got to know each other better — but it doesn't feel right that a place running on a shoestring budget would be able to field such an all-star team.  


	On the one hand, Season Four addresses a lot of outstanding emotional issues. Carmy and Richie finally have it out about Mikey. Donna apologizes to Carmy for all the ways that she hurt him(*). Carmy and Claire make peace, whether or not they're officially back together. Marcus is praised in a Food & Wine article about great young chefs, completing his arc that started with him as the guy who baked bread but dreamed of something bigger. Richie makes peace with his odd place in the center of their little world. Carmy recognizes that the restaurant isn't healthy for him, and resolves to leave and find himself. In terms of character arcs, there's not a lot that would be necessary to address in a fifth season, much less a sixth or seventh. 


(*) It's a scene with jaw-dropping performances from both Jamie Lee Curtis and Jeremy Allen White. At times during the conversation, Carmy looks like a cornered animal who would rather be anywhere else on the planet than listening to his mother talk about all the ways she hurt and failed him. At others, he looks like these are the words he's been waiting his whole life to hear. 












	On the other hand, various plot threads are left dangling. We don't know how or if Carmy will get the restaurant out of debt. We don't know for sure if they earned the Michelin star, even if the patron who witnessed the fake snowfall stunt was sure presented as if he was the Michelin man. We don't know if Ebraheim's new mentor Albert will team up with Computer and Jimmy to turn the sandwich window into its own business — and, if so, whether this will be The Bear's financial salvation, or if the money men intend to carve it off entirely. And because the finale is focused entirely on the Carmy/Syd/Richie triumvirate, various members of the supporting cast get forgotten. We don't know if Sweeps has yet mastered all the wines, or if Richie and Jessica might become more than friends. We don't even know if Carmy will actually be able to quit, or if by the time he untangles the financial knot, he will come to realize that maybe he could just try seeing a therapist, rather than having to find a new career in his mid-thirties when he only knows how to do the one thing.

	Some of these questions are obviously more interesting than others, with all due respect to Sweeps' sommelier learning curve. There are versions of a fifth season that could be great (if nothing else, they might give Tina something more interesting to do than try to cook her pasta course more quickly), and versions that could drag the series back into some of the self-indulgent traps that befell it in Season Three. (And even that season gave us the Mikey and Tina conversation.)  


	Mainly, though, “Goodbye” feels more satisfying as an episode of television than it does as a series finale. It only features four characters (and one of those only briefly), when The Bear is about the larger community that those four have built in and around the restaurant. It offers a lot of catharsis but not much closure. I have no idea if there are enough narrative ingredients left to justify continuing the show, but if this is our last meal at this restaurant, it leaves a slightly unsatisfying taste.

	Walter Scott Jr., who led R&B group the Whispers as a vocalist with his twin “Scotty,” died Thursday. He was 81.


	“We all are incredibly heartbroken,” wrote Desirae Benson, who worked as a publicist for the Whispers, on Facebook. “His voice, presence, and contributions helped shape a musical legacy that touched millions. Walter's impact on the industry and in the hearts of fans will never be forgotten… We lost a legend!“


	According to reports from Billboard and Los Angeles Sentinel, Scott died after a six-month battle with cancer.


	The Whispers got their start back in 1963 in San Francisco, originally made up of twin brothers Walter and Wallace “Scotty” Scott, along with Marcus Hutson, Gordy Harmon, and Nicholas Caldwell. A decade in, Harmon (who died in 2023) left the group and Leaveil Degree stepped in to complete the lineup. Hutson died in 2000 and Caldwell died in 2016.

	The Whispers released more than two dozen albums, many of which landed on the Billboard 200. Two of the albums, 1980's The Whispers (their first to go platinum) and 1982's Love Is Where You Find It, hit Number One on the R&B albums chart.

	










A post shared by Questlove (@questlove)


	The band's breakthrough came in 1969 with “The Time Has Come,” followed by their first R&B Top 10 hit, “Seems Like I Gotta Do Wrong,” in 1970. They stayed on the charts through the Eighties with hits such as “And the Beat Goes On,” which Will Smith sampled on “Miami,” and their massive 1987 hit “Rock Steady,” produced by Babyface. (50 Cent, Mobb Deep,  and J. Cole are among the artists to sample the Whispers' classic sound on their music.)

	Walter and Wallace Scott were both born in Forth Worth, Texas, and moved to Los Angeles in 1959. There's where the twins helped form the Whispers in 1963. Walter served in the Vietnam War and later returned to the group in 1969.


	“Love For Walter Scott of The Whispers…one of the most trusted voices in 70s soul music,” wrote Questlove on Instagram. “He along [with] his twin Wallace ‘Scotty' Scott rode the thin line of the common velvet smooth voice you were familiar with.”

 June 28, 2025, 00:56 am ET, BY Thomas Y.- Contributor| Editor: Thomas H. Kee Jr. (Follow on LinkedIn) Longer Term Trading Plans for UFO

Buy UFO near  28.11 target n/a stop loss @  28.03.  Details
The technical summary data tells us to buy UFO near 28.11, but there is no current upside target from the summary table.  In this case we should wait until either an update to the summary table has been made (which usually happens at the beginning of every trading day), or until the position has been stopped.  The data does tell us to set a stop loss 28.03 to protect against excessive loss in case the stock begins to move against the trade.  28.11 is the first level of support below 28.74, and by rule, any test of support is a buy signal.  In this case, if support 28.11 is being tested, a buy signal would exist.
NONE .  Details
NONE . There are no current resistance levels from the summary table, and therefore there are no Short resistance Plans which tell us to short upon tests of resistance.  Resistance levels have broken higher and unless the stock reverses lower and below support levels again short positions look risky.

Swing Trading Plans for UFO

Buy UFO slightly over n/a, target n/a, Stop Loss @ 0  Details
If n/a begins to break higher, the technical summary data tells us to buy UFO just slightly over n/a, with an upside target of n/a.

In this case, n/a, initial resistance, would be breaking higher, so a buy signal would exist.  Because this plan is based on a break of resistance, it is referred to as a Long Resistance Plan.
Short UFO slightly  near n/a, target 28.34, Stop Loss @ 0.  Details
The technical summary data is suggesting a short of UFO if it tests n/a with a downside target of 28.34. We should have a stop loss in place at 0 though in case the stock begins to move against the trade.  By rule, any test of resistance is a short signal.  In this case, if resistance, n/a, is being tested a short signal would exist.  Because this plan is a short plan based on a test of resistance it is referred to as a Short Resistance Plan.

Even after seeing footage from Steven Spielberg's highly secretive upcoming sci-fi film, it remains difficult to get a clear sense of the project's full story and direction.

It seems that was intentional, as the footage was reportedly carefully curated so that no plot details could be deduced.

Earlier this week, Spielberg attended a special event at Universal Pictures' sprawling 84,000-square-foot facility known as The Commons. There, he officially unveiled a new screening room bearing his name, the Steven Spielberg Theater, a 250-seat cinema dedicated to his legacy.

To mark the occasion, Spielberg shared exclusive footage from the mysterious sci-fi movie, which reportedly involves UFOs. Fans and insiders have speculated wildly about the film's nature, with theories ranging from an entirely original story to possible sequels of classics like E.T. or Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

The clip featured Emily Blunt as a relatable, down-to-earth woman living in a quiet rural area who is being chased by shadowy figures in unmarked black vehicles.

One particularly gripping moment showed her damaged sedan, with Josh O'Connor's character inside, crashing headlong into an oncoming train. The pair desperately escape through the shattered windshield just before the car is crushed beneath the train's wheels.

Colin Firth appeared to take on an antagonistic role, seen in a tense moment inside a futuristic underground laboratory or sci-fi bunker.

Meanwhile, brief glimpses of Eve Hewson and Colman Domingo suggested their involvement in the story, though their exact characters remain a mystery given the limited footage shown.

Among the stars attending the theater dedication were John Travolta, Vin Diesel, Seth Rogen, Colman Domingo, Dakota Fanning, Jeff Goldblum, and Ke Huy Quan, highlighting the significance of the event within the film community.

While christening the theater room, Spielberg told attendees that he never plans to retire.

Previously, screenwriter David Koepp, who collaborated once again with Spielberg on the project, teased, ""What he does so brilliantly is that he combines a vast spectacle with really honest, human emotion. Unlike, I think, any other director- it's a very emotional experience, this movie.""

""He was the most involved as he's been on any movie I've written for him to direct,"" Koepp added.

Audiences can likely expect a signature Spielberg experience, as the director is once again teaming up with  Koepp.

The duo has a long history of successful collaborations, having previously worked together on Jurassic Park in 1993, The Lost World: Jurassic Park in 1997, War of the Worlds in 2005, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 2008.

The upcoming film stars Emily Blunt (Edge of Tomorrow, A Quiet Place), Josh O'Connor (The Crown, Challengers), Colin Firth (Kingsman, Barbie), Eve Hewson (The Luminaries), Colman Domingo (Fear The Walking Dead, The Color Purple ) and Wyatt Russell (Thunderbolts). 

The Untitled Steven Spielberg film from Universal Pictures is currently set to hit theaters on June 12, 2026.

Amid the grand setting at Waterfront Cebu City Hotel and Casino on June 20, 2025, the United Architects of the Philippines (UAP) District C1 gathered to mark a significant milestone: its 50th founding anniversary. This golden jubilee celebration was highlighted by a special recognition event, aptly titled “50 Distinguished Architects of District C1,” honoring individuals who have profoundly shaped both the architectural landscape and the UAP organization.

The evening, conceptualized and organized by district director, architect Leartes Tabotabo Jr., along with assistance from the offices of architects James Jao and Rolan Paolo Alberto, served as a testament to the enduring legacy of architects in Central Visayas. The atmosphere was convivial, hosted by the “Voice of Dubai and Filipino Community Leader,” architect Jason Roi Bucton, alongside Katrina Sia. Attendees were serenaded by “Tawag ng Tanghalan” winner Barette Oliver Richards, adding a melodic backdrop to the dignified affair.

The core of the celebration was the acknowledgment of 50 architects who have exemplified excellence and commitment. These individuals were selected through a rigorous process, initiated in April 2025 by the District C1 management committee in consultation with UAP national officers. The initiative aimed to recognize architects for their contributions to society through their practice and their active participation within the UAP.

Chapter presidents across District C1 nominated members who embodied service, leadership and professional integrity. The recognition spanned five major categories: Design, Construction, Academe, Management and Government Service. From each of the five decades — 1975 to 2025 — 10 exemplary architects were chosen, representing the best of each era and category.

Criteria for selection extended beyond professional accomplishments to include sustained involvement in UAP initiatives, community engagement and efforts to raise public awareness of the architectural profession. Over 70 nominations were submitted by chapter leaders, district officers and members of the District C1 College of Fellows. A panel of past and present UAP national officers, including architect James Jao, immediate past chancellor, UAP College of Fellows; architect Benjamin Panganiban Jr., past national president, UAP; architect Catherine Carunungan, chancellor, UAP College of Fellows; architect Joel Jao, Area C vice president; and architect Rex Chua Tak, district director A5 and incoming UAP secretary general, rigorously evaluated and voted on the final list.

The search for extraterrestrial life may be operating within overly narrow parameters, as powerful tools like the James Webb Space Telescope offer new opportunities to detect more exotic biosignature gases from lifeforms thriving in conditions vastly different from those on Earth, according to new research.

MIT Professor of Physics Sara Seager led the study, which reviews the variety of gases and extreme environments that could theoretically host life in forms unlike anything found on Earth. Rather than focusing solely on Earth analogs, the study urges astrobiologists to expand the scope of their search. With over two decades of exoplanet discoveries, scientists now have a broad range of targets in the search for life — if they widen their approach.

Where earlier efforts to find extraterrestrial life, such as SETI, largely waited for signals from other advanced civilizations, modern scientists are using the James Webb Space Telescope to actively search for biosignatures produced by even the simplest life forms on distant exoplanets.

While this method is innovative in some respects, astronomers have primarily focused on Earth-like planets, which, as real-world exoplanet research shows, are less common than once speculated. By broadening their definitions of life, researchers hope to avoid overlooking potentially habitable worlds among the thousands of exoplanets identified so far.

As with much exobiology research, the team began by examining the only known life-hosting planet: Earth. Some organisms here are remarkably resilient, thriving in conditions that would be lethal to others. Among the most notable are bacteria and extremophiles; tiny organisms capable of enduring Earth's harshest environments.

Bacteria, in particular, offer hope for expanding the range of gases that might indicate life. Studies on Earth have shown that these small life forms can survive and even thrive in gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and helium. Such findings suggest that life could exist under conditions far different from those on our planet.

Extremophiles likewise challenge traditional concepts of habitability. A notable example is the tardigrade, or “water bear.” These tiny half-millimeter creatures have been observed withstanding radiation, extreme temperatures and pressures, starvation, and even direct exposure to outer space.

The team proposes two major avenues for reconsidering where to search for alien life, first by investigating gas planets for life forms that could exist in thick atmospheres high above their searing hot rock cores. This concept, known as a “cloud biosphere,” suggests that sub-Neptunes with permanent water clouds could theoretically support life.

Researchers point to work dating back to the 1970s, which hypothesized that chemical reactions in such environments might give rise to life. One challenge is that life requires metal ions for catalytic reactions, meaning that without contact with a planetary surface, organisms would have to rely on meteors delivering these essential ingredients.

The second avenue moves beyond just water, considering other solvents that could form life-supporting oceans for creatures very different from Earth's. Some terrestrial organisms live in highly acidic environments, and laboratory studies have shown that even concentrated sulfuric acid can sustain organic chemistry. This opens up the possibility that conditions more acidic than any on Earth, such as the sulfuric acid clouds of Venus, could support life.

Implementing these ideas means scientists must rethink their current strategies. Present telescope observations focus on detecting Earth-like conditions, such as oxygen and ozone. Moving forward, researchers are developing more comprehensive lists of metabolic byproducts produced by Earth microbes to widen the range of gases sought in the cosmos.

At its core, the evolving search for life is shifting from an Earth-centric view of astrobiology—focused on what is known—toward exploring what is possible. With exoplanet research revealing a wide array of worlds that differ dramatically from Earth, scientists are expanding their search to consider how life might survive in these alien conditions, rather than looking only for another Earth-like planet in the so-called “habitable zone.”

The skepticism and debate around the question of ""are we alone in the universe"" makes the field of astrobiology more cautious


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The search for extraterrestrial life has long gone back and forth between scientific curiosity, public fascination and outright skepticism. Recently, scientists claimed the “strongest evidence” of life on a distant exoplanet – a world outside our solar system.

Grandiose headlines often promise proof that we are not alone, but scientists remain cautious. Is this caution unique to the field of astrobiology? In truth, major scientific breakthroughs are rarely accepted quickly.

Newton's laws of motion and gravity, Wegener's theory of plate tectonics, and human-made climate change all faced prolonged scrutiny before achieving consensus.

But does the nature of the search for extraterrestrial life mean that extraordinary claims require even more extraordinary evidence? We've seen groundbreaking evidence in this search beforehand, from claims of biosignatures (potential signs of life) in Venus's atmosphere to NASA rovers finding “leopard spots” – a potential sign of past microbial activity – in a Martian rock.

Both stories generated a public buzz around the idea that we might be one step closer to finding alien life. But on further inspection, abiotic (non-biological) processes or false detection became more likely explanations.

In the case of the exoplanet, K2-18 b, scientists working with data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) announced the detection of gases in the planet's atmosphere – methane, carbon dioxide, and more importantly, two compounds called dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). As far as we know, on Earth, DMS/DMDS are produced exclusively by living organisms.



Their presence, if accurately confirmed in abundance, would suggest microbial life. The researchers even suggest there's a 99.4% probability that the detection of these compounds wasn't a fluke – a figure that, with repeat observations, could reach the gold standard for statistical certainty in the sciences. This is a figure known as five sigma, which equates to about a one in a million chance that the findings are a fluke.

Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

So why hasn't the scientific community declared this the discovery of alien life? The answer lies in the difference between detection and attribution, and in the nature of evidence itself.

JWST doesn't directly “see” molecules. Instead, it measures the way that light passes through or bounces off a planet's atmosphere. Different molecules absorb light in different ways, and by analysing these absorption patterns – called spectra – scientists infer what chemicals are likely to be present. This is an impressive and sophisticated method – but also an imperfect one.

It relies on complex models that assume we understand the biological reactions and atmospheric conditions of a planet 120 light years away. The spectra suggesting the existence of DMS/DMDS may be detected because you cannot explain the spectrum without the molecule you've predicted, but it could also result from an undiscovered or misunderstood molecule instead.



Given how momentous the conclusive discovery of extraterrestrial life would be, these assumptions mean that many scientists err on the side of caution. But is this the same for other kinds of science? Let's compare with another scientific breakthrough: the detection and attribution of human-made climate change.

The relationship between temperature and increases in CO₂ was first observed by the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius in 1927. It was only taken seriously once we began to routinely measure temperature increases. But our atmosphere has many processes that feed CO₂ in and out, many of which are natural.



So the relationship between atmospheric CO₂ and temperature may have been validated, but the attribution still needed to follow.

Carbon has three so-called flavors, known as isotopes. One of these isotopes, carbon-14, is radioactive and decays slowly. When scientists observed an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide but a low volume of carbon-14, they could deduce that the carbon was very old – too old to have any carbon-14. Fossil fuels – coal, oil and natural gas – are composed of ancient carbon and thus are devoid of carbon-14.

So the attribution of anthropogenic climate change was proven beyond reasonable doubt, with 97% acceptance among scientists. In the search for extraterrestrial life, much like climate change, there is a detection and attribution phase, which requires the robust testing of hypotheses and also rigorous scrutiny.

In the case of climate change, we had in situ observations from many sources. This means roughly that we could observe these sources close up. The search for extraterrestrial life relies on repeated observations from the same sensors that are far away. In such situations, systematic errors are more costly.

Further to this, both the chemistry of atmospheric climate change and fossil fuel emissions were validated with atmospheric tests under lab conditions from 1927 onwards. Much of the data we see touted as evidence for extraterrestrial life comes from light years away, via one instrument, and without any in situ samples.

The search for extraterrestrial life is not held to a higher standard of scientific rigor but it is constrained by an inability to independently detect and attribute multiple lines of evidence.

For now, the claims about K2-18 b remain compelling but inconclusive.

That doesn't mean we aren't making progress. Each new observation adds to a growing body of knowledge about the universe and our place in it. The search continues – not because we're too cautious, but because we are rightly so.

Not all strange weather is folklore. From snow that's red to storms that rain fish, here are 8 real weather events and what science says about them.

They look magical but happen when sunlight hits ice crystals in cirrus clouds at just the right angle, creating rainbow-colored clouds.

Dust or sand from places like the Sahara gets swept into clouds and turns raindrops red. Documented across India, Europe, and the Middle East.

Snow that looks like it's bleeding! It's caused by red-pigmented algae that bloom in melting snow.

Tornadoes or waterspouts suck small animals from lakes and drop them miles away when the winds calm.

Floating glowing orbs that appear during storms. Still a mystery—but possible causes include vaporized minerals or trapped plasma.

Round, floating ice disks that spin in cold rivers. Formed when slush swirls in slow-moving eddies.

Late-night hot wind gusts that suddenly raise temperatures by up to 10°C. Caused by collapsing thunderstorm clouds.

These odd weather events may seem magical, but they all have scientific roots. Climate science helps us understand and adapt to a changing world.

In the CW's Supernatural, Sam and Dean Winchester travel throughout the country ridding small towns of the monsters that plague them. Vampires, shapeshifters, werewolves, demons, witches and more appear several times throughout the show's 15-year run. Supernatural successfully adapted mythical monsters and urban legends to seamlessly integrate into the hunting adventures of Sam and Dean. However, some of the Winchesters' most interesting foes only appeared once.

These one-off antagonists delivered some of the best scares and could have potentially contributed more to the overall story arc. Viewers love the classic monsters that are visited quite often, but these seldom-seen fiends felt more distinct, making them stand out among the typical terrors. Despite having limited screen time and story focus within the broader realm of creatures in the Supernatural realm, these monsters made an impact and deserved further exploration.

Supernatural draws inspiration from Roman myth to bring the Crocotta to the television screen. In mythology, the Crocotta is a wolf-hyena hybrid said to mimic human voices and cries to lure unsuspecting prey into a trap. In Supernatural, the Crocotta uses the voices of dead loved ones over the telephone, weaponizing the grief and vulnerability of its victims before striking a fatal blow. During the episode, Dean receives a call from John Winchester, their deceased father.

Supernatural brilliantly mixed numerous genres, sometimes resulting in some of the weirdest episodes of the long-running CW series.

The voice of John tells Dean he has a way to break Dean's deal, which will damn him to Hell. Sam and Dean receive similar reports of residents in Ohio receiving calls from dead loved ones, imploring them to take their own lives. They discover the culprit of the crimes is Clark Adams, the manager of a local phone company. He is a Crocotta, using his position in the company to tap into the landlines. The Crocotta appears very early in Supernatural, when the digital age of smartphones and social media was not so prominent. Considering how this evolved over the years, the Crocotta returning in later seasons to take advantage of the more modern digital age could've made it even more dangerous.

The Buruburu is a spirit from Japanese folklore that inflicts fear on those who encounter it. At the start of the episode, Dean frantically runs, convinced that hellhounds are chasing him. In reality, it is just a regular dog. The episode then rewinds time, showing how he ended up in this situation. While Sam and Dean are investigating cases of seemingly healthy individuals, including a marathon runner who has recently died of natural causes. After questioning those close to the victims, the Winchesters discover they were exhibiting signs of extreme fear leading up to their deaths.

In this episode of Supernatural, Dean faces the haunting Buruburu, leaving him terrified of everything around him. This leads to the iconic scene of Dean screaming as a stray cat crosses his path. Considering how often the Winchesters face fear, especially with Sam becoming unraveled because of his memories of Lucifer's cage and the trials of the angel table, a secondary appearance from the Buruburu could have been devastating.

 Sam and Dean find themselves in a rural farming community that is hiding a horrible secret. The people of Burkittsville, Indiana are sacrificing drifters to the Vanir, a pagan god of Norse mythology origin that grants wealth, fertility and overall prosperity. The spirit of the Vanir is tied to the image of a Scarecrow and placed in the middle of an orchard in the town. The Vanir itself isn't the only monster in this episode, as it highlights that sometimes people are the real problem.

In later seasons of Supernatural, Sam and Dean encounter other Norse deities such as Baldur, Odin, Loki, Fenrir, and others, but the Vanir do not reappear. The role of pagan gods in a predominantly Christian world, represented by figures like angels and Chuck as God, remains largely unexplored. Bringing the Vanir back for later appearances could have addressed this issue.

The legend of the Rawhead, or Bloody Bones, stems from English and North American folk tales. The Rawhead is a variation of the classic boogeyman story, used to frighten children into going to bed and encourage good behavior. The episode starts with Sam and Dean chasing clues that lead them to the den of a Rawhead that has been capturing children. When they encounter the monster in a basement, Dean tells Sam to get the kids out while he deals with the Rawhead. When Dean uses a taser to shock the boogeyman, he is standing in water and permanently damages his heart.

Supernatural leaves the deeper lore of the Rawhead largely unexplored, as it only appears in the opening. The encounter is used to set up Dean's heart trouble and the Winchesters' quest to heal him. The creature is merely a plot device in the grand scheme of the episode. Considering Sam and Dean are often saving children, a return of the Rawhead could have uncovered much of the history behind the monster.

Similar to the Rawhead, the Lamia is used as a small plot device of a larger story arc in an episode of Supernatural. The Lamia shares more commonalities with the Rawhead, as, according to Greek mythology, it prefers to pursue children. As Bobby is attempting to regain his soul from Crowley after the apocalypse, Sam and Dean are working on a case. After researching, Bobby determines the boys are hunting a Lamia and tells them the best way to dispatch the creature is by using a silver knife blessed by a priest.

In many stories, the Lamia was once a beautiful queen who became involved with Zeus. Hera was enraged by this and took the Lamia's children from her, and she became a serpent-like demon, forced to eat children. The Lamia's lore is similar to the Rawheads and represents another missed opportunity in Supernatural to emphasize the rich history of another intriguing monster.

The Okami appears in the same episode as the Lamia, but thankfully gets a bit more screen time as Rufus and Bobby deal with the monster while Sam and Dean dispatch the Lamia. As Bobby interrogates demons trying to discover Crowley's name to leverage against him, Rufus appears with the corpse of the Okami. Bobby finds this strange as it also coincides with the appearance of the Lamia, making this a case of two monsters rarely seen outside their native countries appearing in North America simultaneously.

From Sam and Dean Winchester's hilarious quips to Castiel's iconic lines, Supernatural is full of great dialogue.

The Okami appear as humans, but have a close resemblance to werewolves and vampires when they transform. What makes these monsters stand out is that they do not target a specific victim, with each Okami having a specialized preference. The episode shows the Okami are extremely difficult to kill, even for seasoned hunters like Rufus and Bobby. Like the Lamia, the Okami could have returned to shine a light on international creatures.

After Sam and Dean decide to hunt together again, they receive reports that victims are dying at the hands of famous dead people, such as Abraham Lincoln. Two eyewitnesses come forward and tell the Winchesters that their friend was taken hostage by Paris Hilton, making things even more strange. When Sam and Dean arrive at the local police station, they are shown footage of a man's death, focuses on James Dean's car, which has a history of being a harbinger of doom for its owners.

In Slavic mythology, the Leshi is a forest deity that lures its victims into the deep forest and can change its appearance. In Supernatural, the Leshi opts to transform into the image of well-known pop culture icons as its real worshipers have waned over the centuries. Shapeshifters appear throughout the history of Supernatural, and the Leshi is essentially a more powerful version of the series staple. The Leshi offers interesting story opportunities for impersonating fellow hunters or friends, while presenting a more formidable foe.

Sam and Dean receive a call from everyone's favorite hunter goof, Garth Fitzgerald. Garth is investigating a series of strange deaths focuses on a sake brewery in Kansas. When the Winchesters and Garth dig deeper into the murders, they discover the culprit is an invisible spirit that can only be seen if one is under the influence of alcohol. The Shojo is a creepy entry to Supernatural's roster of monsters, but the episode also provides a bit of comedic relief as Dean and Garth drink to pursue the spirit.

Supernatural takes more liberties in its interpretation of the Japanese mythology surrounding the Shojo. In myth, the Shojo is more playful and associated with being joyful while drunk, but in the show, it is a vengeful spirit that kills the people it is summoned to target. Considering the comedic nature of the episode, it would have been interesting to see a more lore-accurate version of the Shojo return and interact with the inebriated Winchesters as a potential guide or informant.

In classical mythology, the goddess Athena, Minerva in Roman mythology, becomes jealous of a woman named Arachne, who is said to be the most skilled weaver in the land, so she is turned into a spider. In Supernatural, the Arachne kidnaps victims and preserves them in webs to eat. It also infects some for breeding. While the soulless Sam was hunting with Samuel, he thought they had solved the case and defeated the spider monsters. However, he discovers that's not the case when he and Dean receive coordinates to the town and return to investigate.

Supernatural misses an opportunity with the Arache by ignoring the mythological tale of the weaver Arachne.

The episode states there are more Arachne at large, having been infected, but they never appear in future episodes.

Sam and Dean receive reports of victims dying after losing massive amounts of weight at a rapid pace, leading them to investigate a local wellness spa. In folklore, the Pishtaco is a boogeyman-esque figure that appears in some South American regions, which feeds on the fat of its victims.

With over 200 episodes, Supernatural is a powerhouse series with more than a few episodes fans could easily call perfect.

The Pishtaco in Supernatural uses a tentacle-like tongue to suck the fat out of unsuspecting victims. Many of the spa workers are Pishtaco's, but the show lightens a bit of their sinister nature by including a particular creature that only eats enough fat to survive. The monster's name is Martiza, and Sam and Dean allow her to live. Normally, in the rare instance that a creature is allowed to walk away, they return in later episodes to show the fault in letting them live. Martiza could have returned, having succumbed to her hunger, or to inform the Winchesters that others of her kind were back to their murderous way.

There's about $7.5 trillion of high-grade US corporate bonds outstanding, according to Bloomberg index data, more than double the size of its euro-denominated counterpart.

President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs in April stirred fears that the era of US exceptionalism was over, and European and Asian money managers would cut back on buying US corporate debt. So far, it's not happening, and foreign investors are buying more American debt than they have in months.

Overseas investors bought Bloomberg Terminalabout $45 billion of US corporate notes in April, the most in six months, according to the latest Treasury Department data analyzed this week by Citigroup Inc. strategists including Daniel Sorid and Mathew Jacob.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Antoine Massey was one of 10 inmates who broke out of jail six weeks ago; only one still remains at large

Louisiana authorities on Friday captured one of the 10 men who escaped from a New Orleans jail six weeks earlier – and who police say released videos on social media while still on the run.

Antoine Massey, 33, was taken into custody at a residence in New Orleans about 2 miles (3km) from the jail, said the New Orleans police department superintendent, Anne Kirkpatrick. That left one of the 10 escapees still at large.

“He actually walked out of a home peacefully,” Kirkpatrick said of Massey. “He peacefully gave up to law enforcement who had surrounded the house.”

The Orleans parish sheriff, Susan Hutson, said she had received a tip on Friday morning and immediately notified other law enforcement authorities, who arrested Massey by midafternoon.

The Louisiana state police superintendent, Robert Hodges, said authorities were still investigating how Massey was able to stay at the residence where he was recaptured.

“It's pretty obvious over the last six weeks to remain a fugitive that long, he had assistance – he had help,” Hodges said.

Authorities had recently investigated social media posts by a man who identified himself as Massey and earlier in June raided a New Orleans home where they believed the videos were produced. But they did not find him.

“Great work by all our law enforcement partners who have been working so hard for this outcome,” Louisiana's attorney general, Liz Murrill, said after Massey's capture on Friday. “One more to go!”

Authorities are still searching for convicted murderer Derrick Groves. Police previously captured the other eight escapees following the 16 May jailbreak, one of the largest in recent US history. Authorities said the men yanked open a faulty cell door inside the New Orleans jail, squeezed through a hole behind a toilet, scaled a barbed-wire fence and fled into the dark.

The men's absence wasn't discovered until a morning headcount, hours after they bolted for freedom. Authorities found a message drawn around the hole the men used to escape: an arrow pointing at the gap and the words “To Easy LoL”.

Officials have pointed to multiple security lapses in the jail, but authorities remain adamant that the men also likely had help. A maintenance worker at the jail was arrested for allegedly helping the men escape by turning off the water to the toilet where the hole was cut behind. His lawyer says he has denied knowingly aiding them.

Massey faced charges of rape, kidnapping, domestic violence involving strangulation and violation of a protective order, authorities in nearby St Tammany parish said. In Orleans parish, he faced charges of motor vehicle theft and domestic battery.

Murrill said Massey will face additional charges for his role in the escape.

A woman police identified as being in an on-again, off-again relationship with Massey was arrested and charged with obstruction of justice and as a principal to aggravated escape, court records show. Authorities said the woman knew of Massey's escape plans beforehand, communicated with him afterward and misled authorities.

On his social media videos, Massey pleaded with Donald Trump, Kim Kardashian and rappers to help him.

A $50,000 reward remains for tips leading to Groves' recapture, authorities said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

New York is bracing for an “exodus of billionaires” after the Democrats nominated a staunch socialist as their candidate for mayor.

Zorham Mamdani, a 33-year-old “anti-Zionist”, sent shock waves through American politics on Tuesday when he beat Andrew Cuomo, the former governor, in the Democratic primary, earning him the party's nomination for November's mayoral election.

A rank outsider, Mr Mamdani was carried to victory by a wave of young voters who were won over by his radical campaign pledges to freeze rents and introduce free public transport and city-run grocery stores, all of which he pledged would be paid for by hiking taxes on the wealthy.

The primary result has sparked panic among New York's ultra-rich, with luxury real estate agents inundated with calls from clients looking to relocate or freeze plans to move their businesses to Manhattan.

One high-end broker described Mr Mamdani's victory as the “worst thing for the housing market since 9/11”, while another called it the “nail in the coffin” for New York.

“There's an old saying in real estate: Money goes where it's welcome,” said John Boyd Jr, founder of Florida-based corporate site selection specialist The Boyd Co, who works with a range of multi-millionaire New York-based clients.

“There's alarms going off among many key executives as well as the billionaire class about New York becoming a socialist run city,” he said.

Eric Benaim, a leading real estate broker known as “The King of Queens”, said that his phone has been “blowing up” with clients panicking about the impact of Mr Mamdani's policies.

“One person just liquidated everything. He was just about to make another investment in New York city but he's now going to look elsewhere,” said Mr Benaim, the founder of Modern Spaces.

“It's the most devastating thing (to our industry) since 9/11,” he added. “We are going to have the biggest exodus of New Yorkers since Covid - except this time, they're not going to come back. That's going to change New York.”

Mr Mamdani plans to hike the corporate tax rate from 7.25 per cent to 11 per cent and to charge those earning over $1 million a year an additional two per cent in city income tax, which is expected to cost wealthy households an additional $118,000 a year.

Business executives say the proposals have triggered widespread dismay, with Kathryn Wylde, the CEO of the partnership for New York City, which represents top business leaders, warning that “terror” is being felt by many New Yorkers.

Briggs Elwell, the CEO and co-founder of RLTYco, a real estate consultant in New York, told The Telegraph it was “a time of unique uncertainty”.

While James Whelan, president of the real estate board of New York, described Mr Mamdani's proposals on how to cut crime, build houses and create jobs as “fanciful and extreme”.

Many of the city's ultra-wealthy have thrown their weight behind the more business-friendly incumbent Eric Adams, who launched his re-election campaign as an independent on Thursday with a rousing speech in which he declared: “This is not a city of handouts.”

Mr Adams won as a Democrat in his first mayoral bid in 2021, but announced he would run an independent after he saw his popularity plummet following his indictment on corruption charges, which he denied.

The case was later dropped by the Trump administration.

Late on Wednesday, Mr Adams courted Wall Street sharks and politicos in a Manhattan conference room where they plotted how to block the rise of Mr Mamdani, according to The New York Times.

As New York's top one per cent look to leave the city, low-tax states such as Florida, which does not levy income tax, are set to become “big winners”, with Mr Benaim claiming property agents are “rubbing their hands” at the prospect of wealthy buyers flooding into the state.

Mr Boyd said that he has been inundated with enquiries in recent weeks from business executives looking to move full-time to South Florida, which he called “the sixth borough of Manhattan”.

Republicans have been quick to cash in on the so-called “Mamdani effect”, with Jack Ciattarelli, a New Jersey gubernatorial candidate, inviting business owners to move to the state.

“To all the residents and business owners of New York City who don't want a socialist, defund the police, anti-Semitic mayor representing them, I encourage you to move to New Jersey,” Mr Ciattarelli wrote on X.

Even members of Mr Mamdani's own party have sought to distance themselves from him, with John Fetterman, the centrist Democratic senator, describing the state assembly member's nomination as “Christmas in July for the GOP”.

Kathy Hochul, the New York Governor, also refused to endorse Mr Mamdani's tax rises in the lead up to the primary, telling reporters: “I don't want to lose any more people to Palm Beach.”

It is not only Mr Mamdani's fiscal policy that has generated consternation among New York's business leaders. A self-described “anti-Zionist”, the mayoral candidate is a staunch Palestinian supporter and incensed members of the Jewish community by refusing to condemn the phrase “globalise the intifada”.

In a city with the biggest Jewish population outside of Israel, this is a major problem, according to Greg Kraut, the CEO of KPG funds, the largest office developer in New York.

“I've probably had about 30 phone calls from clients who are very nervous,” he said. “Any time there is a headline that says ‘anti-Semite socialist wins Democratic party election', that's not good for business, is it?”

Experts also fear that Mr Mamdani's plans to pay for free public transport and universal free childcare with tax rises on the wealthy are unrealistic.

“If you are making a million or more in New York City, going from four per cent to six per cent in income tax is a 50 per cent tax increase - it's substantial,” said Nicole Gelnas, a senior fellow focused on Urban Economics at the Manhattan Institute.

According to the city's independent budget office, one per cent of households pay 40 per cent of city income taxes, with non-resident tax payers making up the fastest growing group of New York taxpayers.

“It doesn't take many of them to say, ‘I can spend eight months a year in Florida and come back here whenever and save myself a lot of money,' to change the tax base,” Ms Gelnas added.

Luxury real estate dealers fear Mr Mamdani's support for de-funding the police and abolishing prisons will drive down property prices. He has also endorsed decriminalising prostitution and pledged to block US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents' efforts to deport undocumented migrants.

The last democratic socialist elected mayor of New York was David Dinkins, whose three-year term in office from 1990 was marked by racial discord, a drug epidemic, high levels of homelessness and a soaring murder rate.

“Crime was through the roof, businesses were fleeing and public services weren't being met,” recalled Mr Kraut, warning that the election of Mr Mamdani could herald a return to those dark days.

“People have called me up from Chicago saying: ‘You guys are up next,'” he cautioned.

Mr Mamdani romped to victory thanks in part to a tidal wave of support from young voters, enamoured with his progressive agenda and slick social media campaign.

However, real estate agents warned that wealthy liberal voters' preoccupation with radical left-wing politics is naive.

“Everyone's a liberal until they lose their limo,” said Mr Kraut. “If those companies and ultra net worth individuals choose to leave the city, your tax base goes bye bye.”

Reflecting on the long-term effects on America's wealthiest city, he added: “New York always survives, but it's just another nail in the coffin.”

Mr Boyd warned that the primary result could spook investors in the long-term, potentially sending the city into a downward spiral.

He said: “There's a very significant concern among job creators, investors and the real estate industry that New York is now always one election cycle from being a socialist-run city.”
