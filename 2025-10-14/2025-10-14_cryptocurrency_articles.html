                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From generative AI tools to digital payments, small businesses are adopting cutting‑edge technology faster than ever before. These emerging tools are helping entrepreneurs scale smarter and faster to close the gap with large enterprises. During the CO— 100 Small Business Forum, Senior Features Editor Barbara Thau sat down with Byron Wirtz, Technical Sales Director at Intel, and Sid Coelho‑Prabhu, Senior Director of Product Management at Coinbase, to explore how AI and crypto are unlocking new opportunities for small business owners. Their discussion focused on practical, real‑world solutions, from automating marketing and streamlining tech management to reducing payment fees and reaching global customers. It's no surprise that Wirtz named AI as the biggest technological disruptor in recent years, since it helps businesses of any size innovate and compete. He noted that companies like Intel and Dell are now embedding AI directly into laptops and devices, which makes tech easier to manage for teams with limited IT support. On the front end, small businesses are using generative AI to create marketing content. Wirtz pointed out that many small business owners are using these tools to create emails, design ad campaigns, or even brainstorm new offerings in a fraction of the time it used to take, freeing staff to focus on core operations. “Anytime you can help move the focus from dealing with technology to dealing with your own business … that's a win,” he said. [Read more: AI for Small Businesses: How to Stay Competitive] Another tech innovation that has come to the forefront recently is cryptocurrency, which is currently used by one in five small businesses. Coelho‑Prabhu noted that many of these businesses use stablecoins like USDC, which operate on the blockchain and are tied 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. Aside from its greater global reach, crypto's lower transaction fees can have a dramatic impact on profit margins. “Instead of paying the 3% acceptance fee [for traditional card payments] … you could take that money and … reinvest it in your growth [and] … hire global talent,” Coelho‑Prabhu told CO—. [Read more: The Pros and Cons of Accepting Cryptocurrency as Payment] While AI and crypto may seem complex, small businesses can easily access and apply these technologies in practical ways with the right strategies. To help small businesses adopt AI responsibly, Intel and Dell offer free startup programs that include workshops, expert mentoring, and commercial-grade hardware discounts. These programs are designed to help business owners focus on where AI can actually solve problems in their day-to-day operations, rather than using AI for the sake of it. “If you have questions about how [you] can … apply technology to make [your] business run better [and] … help with your business goals in a better way, these programs are available for you for exactly this reason,” Wirtz explained. On the crypto side, Coinbase's recent Shopify partnership allows any new and existing merchant on the platform to accept cryptocurrency payments. Coelho-Prabhu said this opens small businesses up to a larger global audience, especially younger consumers who prefer crypto payments. “[It] makes it easier for them to scale when they can set up a Shopify store and start accepting payments from … anyone in the world.” Coelho-Prabhu also discussed the launch of Coinbase Business, a new platform that helps companies expand their reach and lower operating costs through digital payments. “People are seeing a very real pain point being solved around fees,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New on-chain data suggests that the US government hacked wallets for its $14 billion Bitcoin seizure. Although it indicted major criminals, the BTC in question had been taken from them five years ago. If this is true, then law enforcement may begin aggressive seizures to fill a Bitcoin Reserve. First of all, although the Cambodian crime ring was a pig butchering operation, it also ran other criminal and legitimate enterprises. Over the last five years, these assets sat idle in wallets, and a report claimed that they had vulnerable private keys: In other words, crypto sleuth ZachXBT made some revolutionary connections between these incidents. If this is true, it might have huge implications for the US Strategic Crypto Reserve. The government holds billions in BTC, but it must reimburse most of them to their initial owners. If, however, these funds were hacked from other indicted criminals, the US government might just keep them. Until today, US law enforcement has taken a methodical approach to all Bitcoin seizures. However, if the US has a new directive to acquire Bitcoin through methods like hacking, it could upend all that precedent. Moving forward, law enforcement might take a proactive role in filling Uncle Sam's bags.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Monad Opens Airdrop to Solana Users, Ethereum NFT Holders as MON Launch Nears Monad, an upcoming layer-1 blockchain network designed to rival Solana and Ethereum, shared further details of its upcoming MON token airdrop on Tuesday, including outlining the community recipients and opening an eligibility checker. Eligible users may be able to see their allocation as early as October 28, though the claim will remain open until November 3—at which point it is expected that the token will be claimable. In building its airdrop recipient base, the Monad Foundation used strict anti-sybil measures, or criteria designed to weed out bots and those performing low-value activities apparently just to farm a potential token airdrop. Beyond anti-sybil efforts, the Foundation focused on identifying the Monad community, on-chain users that participated in major DeFi protocols on-chain, high value DEX traders, and long-term holders of notable NFT collections to receive MON tokens. Specifically, holders of popular Ethereum NFT collections like CryptoPunks, Azuki, Moonbirds, Pudgy Penguins, Meebits, and others based on a September 30 snapshot were eligible for MON. Additionally, significant traders using protocols like Solana token launchpad Pump.fun, Virtuals, Hyperliquid, and recent participants in on-chain governance of major Ethereum DAOs will have an allocation of MON tokens set aside. A select group of contributors to crypto education and builders in the Monad ecosystem will also receive tokens. the airdrop claim is open for 3 weeks, you DO NOT need to rush, be careful and beware of scams Exact tokenomic details remain outstanding, though eligible participants were able to reveal an “airdrop strength level” based on their on-chain activity and social media presence.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. authorities dropped a legal hammer on global firm Prince Group as an operator of forced-labor global scam operations — including infamous pig butchering schemes — based in Cambodia, indicting the company's leader and imposing sanctions. In that case, the DOJ took what it said was its largest-ever crypto seizure of 127,271 bitcoin BTC$112,782.19, worth about $14.4 billion at current value. "Today's action represents one of the most significant strikes ever against the global scourge of human trafficking and cyber-enabled financial fraud,” said U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi, in a statement. And in a coordinated effort, the U.S. Department of the Treasury said it sanctioned Prince Group on Tuesday, designating it a transnational criminal organization and blocking its financial activity and the ability for people to do business with it without U.S. repercussions. According to a DOJ statement, the defendant and his executives secretly "grew Prince Group into one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organizations." "Prince Group carried out these schemes by trafficking hundreds of workers and forcing them to work in compounds in Cambodia and execute the scams, often under the threat of violence," the statement said, describing barbed-wired compounds, political influence and sophisticated crypto laundering efforts. The CEO, who is at large, and those accused as co-conspirators are said to have used proceeds on lavish lifestyles, including in one case the purchase of a Picasso painting. It said Phnom Penh-based Huione had been laundering proceeds of crypto scams. Those crypto-funded operations have long been a focus of digital assets analytics firms, investigators and even congressional inquiry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As context, previously banking associations have raised concerns about the digital euro driving an outflow of deposits from banks with a consequent impact on financial stability. Hence, in order to protect banks, holding limits are planned. While the ECB is expected to make a decision on the limit, several EU countries are not keen on conceding that control. A recent ECB survey indicated that the central bank was considering limits of up to €10,000. One German banking survey claimed that with a €3,000 holding limit, only 56 of 714 institutions would meet legally required liquidity buffers. By contrast, the ECB's latest research found far more benign results. However, as highlighted below, there's a data dimension that is omitted from both the latest report and the digital euro survey results published earlier this year. This could partially (or entirely) offset any drain on deposits from the introduction of a digital euro. But the existence of dollar stablecoins without caps could present a far larger financial stability risk, although we'd argue probably not yet, given crypto is not yet entirely mainstream.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk says Bitcoin's value is rooted in real-world energy, making it impossible to fake unlike fiat currencies. Elon Musk said on Tuesday that Bitcoin's value stems from its reliance on real energy, contrasting it with traditional fiat currencies that governments can create at will. The world's richest man, who has a history of criticizing government spending, once again publicly placed digital gold above traditional finance. Receive up to $100,000 worth of exclusive gifts for newcomers upon registration. Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit Responding to a post by financial blog ZeroHedge on X about AI driving up global energy demand, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO wrote: ZeroHedge linked the rise in prices of gold, silver, and Bitcoin to what it called the “debasement” of money, the gradual loss of purchasing power that occurs when more currency is created to fund major national projects. Historically, debasement referred to reducing the precious metal content in coins. In modern economies, it often describes the effects of monetary expansion, such as central banks “printing money.” Crypto advocates have long argued that Bitcoin is designed to resist debasement, due to its fixed supply of 21 million coins and energy-intensive mining process. They claim this helps prevent manipulation by governments or central banks, unlike fiat currencies, which can be issued in unlimited quantities. One of the world's leading Bitcoin advocates, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, responded to Musk's post: Bitcoin's actual energy consumption has reached levels comparable to those of entire nations, drawing growing criticism over its environmental footprint. In an article  by Steven Ferrey, a professor of law at Suffolk University Law School, he claimed the cost of crypto has had an “astronomical” impact on the energy industry. To illustrate the magnitude, Bitcoin's daily electricity use equals nearly 228 days of energy consumption in Somalia. In U.S. terms, the same amount of energy could power around 8.4 million homes for an entire day.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence, or AI, is transforming the way we live and work, from tools like ChatGPT to advances in healthcare, business and education. But as AI grows more powerful, so do the threats against it. One of the biggest risks is “data poisoning,” when hackers use malicious information into the AI data systems that they rely on to learn. AI is built on massive amounts of data, and it's able to process it at lightning speeds to impressive results and even help machines “think.” But it's that dependence on data that is also its greatest weakness. He explains that poisoned data can be secretly inserted in an AI system to trick everything from drones to self-driving cars into making dangerous mistakes. Amini showed NBC6 how a green laser pointer or other subtle signal can trick an AI-powered camera into misreading a red traffic light as green. “A small green spot was able to deceive this specific computer vision system.” To help protect against these types of attacks, Amini and his team of 10 FIU Ph.D. students are developing a new AI security framework called blockchain-based federated learning, or BCFL. By working together, devices can identify and reject poisoned data before it ever reaches the decision-making process. “If you imagine like referees in a sports game, if one referee finds a foul, all the referees congregate and look over the information,” he said. Autonomous vehicle companies already have strong security protocols in place to prevent these types of data poisoning attacks, but the FIU team hopes its BCFL algorithm can add an extra line of defense. The FIU team is now working with partners to test their blockchain-based federated learning algorithm in real-world scenarios.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shiba Inu (SHIB) price prediction is turning bearish once again as sentiment in the market becomes uncertain after a turbulent crypto weekend. Shiba Inu, once a popular meme coin, is gradually losing market share to newer, more thrilling projects like Remittix (RTX) — a DeFi token that is revolutionizing cross-border payments. Remittix ICO has already raised over $27.4 million, pulling massive attention from traders considering real-world utility and long-term prospects. This rebound shows some relief buying after last Friday's sell-off, which saw panic erupt after Donald Trump issued a bold warning of 100% tariffs for China and the export ban of rare earth. Though SHIB Price has experienced a small rebound, the experts remain cautious in expecting sustainable growth under low token utility and ongoing market uncertainty. The majority of recent Shiba Inu News points towards profit trading in the short term but no long-term faith, especially with investors looking for crypto with usable use cases and lower gas charges. Amid this market reset, Remittix is currently one of the best crypto presale 2025 contenders, having exceeded $27.4 million funded and selling more than 678 million tokens at $0.1166 per token. Unlike meme-based tokens, the Remittix DeFi project is focused on developing a cross-chain cryptocurrency-to-fiat bridge, enabling users to send cryptocurrencies to bank accounts in more than 30 countries. The Remittix project is now officially verified by prominent blockchain auditor CertiK. More astonishingly, Remittix is ranked #1 on CertiK for pre-launch tokens, which reflects its technical competence, transparency, and trustworthiness. With speculative investments such as Shiba Inu Coin being volatile, platforms like Remittix are gaining recognition for offering financial solutions in the real world. In unifying secure verification, live product testing, and worldwide payment functionality under one roof, RTX stands as one of the top performing cryptocurrency under $1 with long-term value.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have uncovered a new Android vulnerability that allows malicious apps to reconstruct on-screen content, such as recovery phrases and two-factor authentication codes. A newly discovered Android vulnerability enables malicious applications to access content displayed by other apps, potentially compromising crypto wallet recovery phrases, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and more. According to a recent research paper, the “Pixnapping” attack “bypasses all browser mitigations and can even steal secrets from non-browser apps.” This is possible by leveraging Android application programming interfaces (API) to calculate the content of a specific pixel displayed by a different application. Instead, it layers a stack of attacker-controlled, semi-transparent activities to mask all but a chosen pixel, then manipulates that pixel so its color dominates the frame. By repeating this process and timing frame renders, the malware infers those pixels to reconstruct on-screen secrets. This, fortunately, takes time and limits the attack's usefulness against content that is not displayed for more than a few seconds. One kind of particularly sensitive information that tends to stay on screen for much longer than a few seconds is crypto wallet recovery phrases. Those phrases, which allow full, unchecked access to the connected crypto wallets, require users to write them down for safekeeping. Related: UK renews Apple iCloud backdoor push, threatening crypto wallet security Google initially attempted to patch the flaw by limiting how many activities an app can blur at once. However, the researchers said they found a workaround that still enables Pixnapping to function. The most obvious solution to the issue is to avoid displaying recovery phrases or any other particularly sensitive content on Android devices. Even better would be to avoid displaying recovery information on any internet-capable device.

Home » News » Blockchain associations partner to bridge state, federal stablecoin policies

The North American Blockchain Association (NABA) and the Blockchain Association (BA) are launching a strategic alliance to bridge state and federal stablecoin policy coordination. 

The partnership will focus on ensuring that state policymakers understand the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, or GENIUS, Act, and can effectively develop supporting state-level regulations.

This is the first formal collaboration between NABA, the leading coordinator of state-level blockchain policy efforts, and the BA, the leading federal blockchain advocacy organization. 

“This partnership fills a vital gap in our policy ecosystem by connecting state-level implementation with federal innovation frameworks,” Jessi Goostree, executive director of the North American Blockchain Association, said. “NABA represents the collective voice of states, territories, and provinces working to advance coherent blockchain policies. Partnering with the Blockchain Association ensures our state-level constituents have direct access to federal policy expertise as they navigate this new regulatory landscape.”

With the GENIUS Act establishing federal stablecoin regulations, both organizations recognize the importance of equipping state officials and regulators with a thorough understanding of federal requirements as they develop state policies. The partnership will focus on preventing conflicting regulatory approaches that could fragment the national stablecoin framework.

“The GENIUS Act represents a landmark opportunity to modernize U.S. payment infrastructure through innovation, with both federal and state regulators playing important roles in the Act's implementation,” Michael Postupak, policy engagement manager at the Blockchain Association, said. “Through this partnership, we're ensuring that state policymakers have the tools, knowledge, and federal context they need to unlock the full promise of stablecoin technology for their state economy, in addition to consumers and businesses alike.”

The two organizations will work to develop targeted educational initiatives for state officials, coordinate policy messaging between state and federal levels, and facilitate knowledge sharing to promote consistent regulatory approaches nationwide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When the latest crypto market instability resurfaced, wiping hundreds of billions off the total crypto market cap, Bitcoin wobbled, plunged – and then rebounded, weathering the storm just like it always has. Yet, for all its dominance, Bitcoin, as a blockchain, still struggles with growing pains: slow transfers, high fees during congestion, and a lack of a native environment for DeFi or complex smart contracts. Could Hyper be the upgrade Bitcoin's ecosystem needs? At its core, Bitcoin is a rigid, ultra-secure ledger designed for trustless settlement. These limitations constrain BTC's trajectory, restricting it to a passive store of value rather than an active application platform or even its original vision as a digital payment. Hyper adapts Solana's runtime environment to run smart contracts, parallel execution, and composable dApps – giving Bitcoin access to a high-throughput application layer. When they want to exit, the wrapped token is burned, and $BTC is released on L1, validated via proofs. Bitcoin Hyper batches L2 transactions, compresses them into succinct proofs (zero-knowledge or ZK proofs), and commits to Bitcoin's base chain. That ensures correctness without congesting the base layer. The native $HYPER token is central to the economy, serving as fuel for gas, staking incentives, governance, and developer rewards. Its fixed supply (21B) and deflationary burner options give it a built-in scarcity model. Bitcoin Hyper's presale powers on, with tokens currently priced at $0.013115. Token allocation is designed to fuel growth but also reward stakeholders: As network usage grows, demand for $HYPER to pay gas, stake, and vote increases. Combined with Bitcoin's own recovery, $HYPER could be a turbocharged, leveraged play on $BTC's resurgence. Execution is hard: building secure bridges, ZK proof systems, fallback dispute layers, and seamless UX won't be easy. There's growing interest in a protocol that unlocks Bitcoin's full utility for the ever-expanding crypto economy. In that sense, Bitcoin Hyper isn't merely a speculative token – it presents itself as an essential upgrade for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Hyper could thrust $BTC into the future as not only digital gold, but also programmable money, capable of supporting real-time applications, DeFi flows, and a new generation of use cases. Bitcoin Hyper's own utility is clear: investors can ride $BTC's recovery while also betting on the migration of capital and utility into Bitcoin's upgraded layer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New paper by Bindseil/Senner suggests sovereignty at risk, also from the home team The ‘digital euro does not appear to be the solution to any of these problems' is a familiar refrain in central bank digital currency discussions with incumbent commercial bank and payments players, but is perhaps unexpected from the man charged with piloting digital euro legislation through the European Parliament. The Eurosystem presses on, less controversially, with wholesale CBDC in response to accelerating distributed ledger technology-based finance in the US. However, a more contentious battle still rages over the future of European retail payments. Here, complicated technical and political considerations find themselves alongside sophisticated lobbying on behalf of vested interests. It appears to rebut claims such as that by Markus Ferber, economic spokesperson for the European People's Party in the European Parliament, that ‘vague notions of monetary sovereignty do not cut it' as a compelling case for the digital euro. Bindseil and Senner open their paper with an argument between the US and Brazil about Pix, Banco Central do Brasil's instant payments platform. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has complained unfairly benefits the Brazilian government system at the expense of US commercial interests. which exemplifies the increasingly brutal potential impact of resurgent mercantilism on the freedom of sovereign nations to act in their own monetary interests. This new reality, coupled with the essentially boundless nature of technology, is changing the calculations that policy-makers should make about versions of money and payments. India, Brazil and China have concluded that the state needs to continue to treat payments as a public good in the digital realm, even if the private sector is to play an important role in it. These major jurisdictions also found a way to work with initially reluctant banks on these projects – the economic impact in India has been particularly pronounced. While uncontroversial, the logic quickly flows into practically contentious areas: ‘no dependency and vulnerability to hostile foreign actors, fraud prevention, consumer protection, restricting the abuse of market power', along with the ability to collect seigniorage, and prevent the collection of information by foreign actors. At meetings with OMFIF's Digital Monetary Institute, a wide range of conservative-leaning European market participants have referenced so-called ‘kill switches in Washington'. Not infrequently, populists object to public versions of digital money. So far, central bank money in the form of cash has been a viable alternative to private solutions, but with the current trend towards electronic payments, this may soon be over, implying that banks could benefit from liquidity inflows (when banknote holdings decline) and higher fees collected through private payment solutions to which they participate (such as interchange fees). This lobbying has already resulted in a partial neutering of the digital euro project through the adding of holding limits – anticipated to be €3000 or lower – and a guarantee that it will not be remunerated. The private sector has so far not covered itself in glory with the creation of a pan-European payments champion. One observer suggested that recent attempts to achieve an interoperability solution between EPI and EuroPA, was merely a vehicle for banks to argue that CBDC is unnecessary, and stall for time. European public money finds itself therefore in a peculiar limbo. With widespread but rapidly declining cash use, no credible private-sector player yet to join Mastercard and Visa in payments facilitation, potential disruption from new private versions of money in the form of stablecoins, new risks from military or commercial adversaries, including former allies, and lobbyist pressure to prevent state vehicles stepping in to remedy what might be described in the short term as a market failure, Bindseil/Senner would contend that this case is far from ‘vague'. John Orchard is Chairman of the Digital Monetary Institute at OMFIF. Join OMFIF on 17 October to examine CBDC as a unified and integrated currency system: wholesale, retail and financial sector interoperability.</p>

Anna Fifelski is a reporter covering startups and technology companies in Southeast Michigan as well as banking and finance. Silicon Valley crypto billionaire Tim Draper and his associates are expanding their blockchain venture studio outside of Los Angeles for the first time — to Troy. Draper Goren Blockchain, located at 3221 W. Big Beaver Road, will serve as the firm's second office location, as a strategic hub for incubating and accelerating portfolio companies, which include real estate technology startups, according to a news release. It will also house DGB's expanding team of operators, which includes six employees, and serve as a meeting space and coworking environment for Michigan-based portfolio companies and teams flying in from out of town, David Bleznak, founding partner of DGB, told Crain's in an email. Draper Goren Blockchain was founded in 2023 in Los Angeles by Tim Draper, Alon Goren, and Bleznak. The firm has several Michigan-based portfolio companies, “and with our current and planned growth, it made sense to establish a centrally located space for these teams,” Bleznak said. The office will not only serve local portfolio companies, but will also serve the firm's out-of-town companies “to give them a home base, meeting spot and connections within the mortgage epicenter of America,” Bleznak said. "I'm incredibly excited to see our companies thriving at this level," Alon Goren, founding partner at DGB, said in the release. "Opening a second home base in Michigan is a testament to our success, and I couldn't be prouder to have it led by my incredible partner, David Bleznak." The firm makes regular investments averaging about one new portfolio company a month, Bleznak said, but also doubles up on its growing teams and continually invests in them. These additional investments can be through the firm's partners within the Draper Venture Network, like Draper Associates, or through funds that Goren and Bleznak manage directly as the Draper Goren managers. Though the firm invests exclusively in real estate-related technologies, Draper — a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who made early investments in Tesla, SpaceX and Hotmail — invests in startups across the board in his "Shark Tank"-style show, “Meet the Drapers,” for which he filmed an episode of its 10th season Sept. 26 at Newlab in Detroit. Four startups from across Michigan were selected from 250 applications to participate in the pitch competition: Marquette-headquartered aerospace logistics company Kall Morris Inc.; East Lansing-based public transit technology company; Detroit-based cybersecurity company Block Harbor, which is headquartered in Newlab; and BRCĒ, an East Lansing-headquartered company developing patented shoelaces.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to SoSoValue data, spot bitcoin ETFs recorded $326.5 million in negative flows yesterday. While funds from Fidelity, Ark & 21Shares and VanEck also recorded outflows, BlackRock's IBIT reported a positive flow of $60.36 million. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a heavier $428.5 million net outflow, with funds moving out from seven ether ETFs with no inflows on the day. BlackRock's ETHA saw $310 million net outflows, which marks its second worst performance since debut. "Monday's outflows reflect post-liquidation caution," said Vincent Liu, CIO at Kronos Research. "Investors are pausing, clearly waiting for clearer macro signals before putting more capital to work. Sentiment is driving activity more than fundamentals now." Crypto saw one of its largest liquidation events in history last weekend, wiping out over $500 billion from the market that pushed down entire crypto prices by 10%. This was triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's confirmation that he would impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports. The Kronos Research analyst predicted that ETF flows will see a "measured return" as traders seek clearer macro signals. "The outflows appear to reflect short-term institutional risk management rather than a structural shift in sentiment," Min Jung, Research Associate at Presto Research, also told The Block. "Looking ahead, ETF flows should begin to stabilize as markets absorb the weekend's volatility and broader macro uncertainty." Jung added that the market will remain sensitive to U.S.-China trade headlines, which may continue to drive short-term volatility across crypto and other risk assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Data Point Decoding the headlines with facts, figures, and numbers Crypto analysts said this was the largest wipeout in a 24-hour period in the market's history [File] | Photo Credit: REUTERS Following the largest crypto liquidation in history last Friday, options market investors are bracing for more volatility and further declines in bitcoin and ether, aggressively positioning in trades that offer protection against another potential freefall. Market participants said the crypto sector on Friday saw more than $19 billion in liquidations across leveraged positions as panic selling and low liquidity triggered sharp swings. The world's largest cryptocurrency hit a record high above $126,000 on October 6. Ether, the second biggest digital currency, dropped 12.2% to a low of $3,436.29 on Friday. It last changed hands at $4,254, up 2.4% on the day. Altcoins took an even bigger hit as HYPE (-54%), DOGE (-62%), and AVAX (-70%) all experienced steep drawdowns before recovering to post more modest losses. Trump over the weekend softened his rhetoric on China, however, noting that "it will all be fine" and the U.S. did not want to "hurt" China. "Last Friday, you saw volatility just jump across the board, not only for short-dated, but also for long-dated maturities. The sentiment around short-dated volatility is that more people are worried about downward turns," said Sean Dawson, head of research at Derive.xyz in Canberra. Data from Derive.xyz, a crypto options trading platform, showed heavy "put" buying from traders in bitcoin and ether, which suggested hedging against potential downside risks. In bitcoin, there were hefty purchases of puts conferring the right to sell bitcoin at strike prices of $115,000 and $95,000 for the October 31 expiry, according to Dawson. There was also a sharp reversal from call buying to call selling at the $125,000 strike for the October 17 expiry, suggesting a bearish short-term view. He also noted substantial buying of $2,600 puts for the December 26 expiry. Those strikes, he said, are indicative of growing bearish sentiment through year-end. Despite the meltdown, Willy Woo, a leading onchain crypto analyst with more than a million on X, noted that bitcoin investor flows have been holding up well and may be the reason it fared better than expected against a sharp decline in stocks. He believes that capital in altcoins is likely rotating into bitcoin rather than leaving the system. Altcoins, also known as alternative coins, refer to cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin, which are often treated as high-risk, high-reward investments. Some altcoins deliver massive returns, but many fail or lose liquidity. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is widely viewed as a "blue-chip" crypto asset, widely-held by institutions. "However, bitcoin now faces another uphill battle to break past key resistance levels that will allow it to reach a meaningful new all-time high this year."
