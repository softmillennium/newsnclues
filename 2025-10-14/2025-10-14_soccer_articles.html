                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>COMMERCE CITY, Colorado — The U.S. Soccer Federation is finalizing plans to stage two high-profile U.S. World Cup tuneups within days of each other at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium in the spring, multiple sources told Yahoo Sports. In a highly unusual arrangement, the national team would face Portugal and Belgium at the same location in late March — the final international window before Mauricio Pochettino selects his 26-man World Cup squad. However, the USSF now seems intent on playing both games at the retractable-roof facility, which is home to the NFL's Atlanta Falcons and MLS' Atlanta United, three sources said. Typically, the U.S. team reports to camp in a metro area on Monday, plays there on Friday or Saturday, then moves to another city for a friendly the following Tuesday. For instance, in the current window, Pochettino's team trained in Austin, Texas, before playing Ecuador last Friday, then traveled to the Denver area for Tuesday's friendly against Australia. Next month the Americans will report to greater Philadelphia before a match against Paraguay, then face Uruguay in Tampa. The March window, however, allows for higher-profile matches involving European teams that have qualified for the World Cup. Atlanta was a natural choice for one match because, in preparation for hosting eight World Cup matches, Mercedes-Benz Stadium will install a grass field in early 2026. In addition, Atlanta United is MLS' best-supported team. Appearing on a Friday night or Saturday, Ronaldo and Portugal would help sell tickets and perhaps fill the stadium, which holds more than 71,000. (Portugal is on pace to qualify for its seventh consecutive World Cup.) A Belgium game on a Tuesday would not have the same drawing power, but for aesthetic purposes, the stadium would drape off the upper deck – a common practice for Atlanta United matches – and accommodate as many as 42,500. The U.S. men's team has played 2015 Gold Cup and 2024 Copa América matches in Atlanta but hasn't held a friendly there since 1977. The organization is building a headquarters and training center about 20 miles south of the capital in Fayetteville, Georgia. His company, AMB Sports and Entertainment, operates Mercedes-Benz Stadium.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — The owner of Spanish soccer club Mallorca says FIFA risks damage to the sport's image with its ticket prices for next year's World Cup. Andy Kohlberg, a former professional tennis player who took control of the club two years ago, spoke following a promotional event on Tuesday and said “the message (that) has gotten out so far has been primarily negative and that's not a good thing.” FIFA's website has offered hospitality tickets at prices up to $73,200 per person for the eight matches at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, including the final on July 19. It's gotten a lot of bad press,” Kohlberg said. But you can't mix them too much with ticket prices at such a high average and alienate the core fan base, which in terms of numbers is a lot higher but in terms of dollar revenues at a stadium event may not be so high.” FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kohlberg expressed caution about La Liga's decision to move Barcelona's Dec. 20 match against Villarreal from Spain to Miami Gardens, Florida, the first major European league game to be played in the United States. “We have to be pretty discerning and careful 'cause it angers some of our fans,” Kohlberg said. ”It's a lot more controversial in Spain, that people get upset when a game is played out of their country and out of their stadium, whereas in the U.S., they welcome the NFL playing in London. Former NBA star Steve Kerr and Steve Nash and former U.S. soccer star Stu Holden are among the club's investors, and Kohlberg said another well-known person will be announced soon. The Spanish league, dominated by Real Madrid and Barcelona, has a more difficult task at increasing U.S. interest than England's Premier League. “Premier League and NBC have done an incredible job and spent an enormous amount of money and so I don't think La Liga or ESPN can match that. Mallorca, which has played in Spain's top division since 1997-98, had a top 10 finish in 2022-23 and 2024-25, won the Copa del Rey in 2003 and reached the 1999 European Cup Winners' Cup final but lost to Italian club Lazio. Its Estadi Mallorca Son Moix was remodeled in a project completed last year, and it has seven premium areas in an effort to attract supporters to a team based in the Balearic Islands. “We have an element of the population that can and will afford it. But it would be very hard to do what we're doing in Levante or Elche or Alaves,” he said. But because we have 18 million tourists coming, there's a small segment that'll come to the game.” This material may not be published, broadcast, written or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>England face Latvia in Riga knowing a win today guarantees their place at the 2026 World Cup. Thomas Tuchel's side need three more points to book their spot in next summer's tournament in the USA, Canada and Mexico. England play the world's 137th-ranked side after a 3-0 friendly win against Wales on Thursday. England XI: Pickford; Spence, Konsa, Stones, Lewis-Skelly; Anderson, Rice; Saka, Rogers, Gordon; Kane. Marcus Rashford can be ‘one of the world's best' with consistency, says Thomas Tuchel Thomas Tuchel's team has been announced for tonight's game and it contains some interesting choices. Anthony Gordon is preferred to Marcus Rashford on the left. Latvia (5-3-2): Zviedris; Veips, Jurkovskis, Cernomordijs, Balodis, Ciganiks; Varslavans, Vapne, Zelenkovs; Gutkovskis, Ikaunieks. With a World Cup qualification spot confirmed with victory tonight, England boss Thomas Tuchel has gone pretty much as strong as he could have. Only two changes: Marc Guehi is rested in a defensive reshuffle, while captain Harry Kane is fit to come in up front to replace his deputy Ollie Watkins, who picked up a knock on Thursday against Wales. Guehi dropping to the bench will see Djed Spence and Ezri Konsa return to their more natural positions at right-back and centre-half respectively, with Myles Lewis-Skelly coming in at left-back. Kane for Watkins is a direct switch at striker. Thomas Tuchel's men line up as follows this evening. England (4-2-3-1): Pickford; Spence, Konsa, Stones, Lewis-Skelly; Anderson, Rice; Saka, Rogers, Gordon; Kane. This is why, and how it's cutting through. English football, right-wing politics, and a new front in the culture wars Currently, separate windows in September and October sees nations play a maximum of two matches in each, but from next year onwards, this will be condensed into one period with a maximum of four matches. The change means the Premier League and other top European divisions will miss around a three-week break (say, from September 21 to October 10, 2026) providing extra time for club fixtures. England head coach Thomas Tuchel has told Marcus Rashford he can still be “one of the best in the world”, but that he needs to improve his output. Tuchel has tried to resurrect Rashford's England career this year, but warned the 27-year-old could still fail to fulfil his huge potential. Rashford has one goal in five England appearances under Tuchel, and three goals so far in his loan spell at Barcelona from Manchester United. With Tuchel opting against calling up Real Madrid playmaker Jude Bellingham and in-form Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton, it adds further credence to the belief that the Anderson and Rice partnership is here to stay. It was a position that had a plethora of options, from Kobbie Mainoo to Curtis Jones and Angel Gomes, but their lack of consistency has enabled Anderson to leapfrog them in the pecking order. If he starts next to Rice again tonight, it will be another indication of his importance. The friendly win over Wales was Jordan Pickford's eighth clean sheet in a row for England, breaking the national team's record for a goalkeeper. The previous mark of seven had been set firstly by Gordon Banks, with the last of those games being the 1966 World Cup quarter-final against Argentina at Wembley, which England won 1-0. Pickford then equalled Banks' record in 2021, with his final clean sheet of that run coming in the quarter-finals of Euro 2020 against Ukraine. But now, following the shutout against Wales, Pickford holds the record outright and will be eager to extend it further against Latvia tonight. Three first-half goals, from Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins and Bukayo Saka, secured a pretty routine victory at Wembley. Rey Manaj's goal condemned the home side to back-to-back defeats, with head coach Dragan Stojkovic resigning from his post after the final whistle. That means England are on the verge of securing qualification for next summer's tournament and will do so with a win against Latvia, who are second bottom of the group, tonight. They sit top of the pile with 15 from a possible 15 after five wins from five, having scored 13 and conceded none. Latvia and definitely Andorra are basically out of contention. In England's most recent World Cup qualifying match, a stunning 5-0 win against Serbia on September 9, everything finally clicked. Harry Kane and then Noni Madueke scored inside three minutes, the latter a brilliant run and finish, before Ezri Konsa and Marc Guehi, plus Marcus Rashford from the penalty spot, made it a near-perfect outing for the visitors. Their toughest rivals in World Cup qualifying were dispatched away from home with minimum fuss. Goalkeepers: Rihards Matrevics, Krisjanis Zviedris, Frenks Davids Orols. Defenders: Roberts Savalnieks, Andrejs Ciganiks, Raivis Andris Jurkovskis, Antonijs Cernomordijs, Vitalijs Jagodinskis, Daniels Balodis, Deniss Melniks, Maksim Tonisevs, Roberts Veips. Midfielders: Alexejs Saveljevs, Eduards Daskevics, Renars Varslavans, Dmitrijs Zelenkovs, Lukass Vapne, Kristers Penkevics, Kristaps Grabovskis, Danila Patijchuks. Forwards: Janis Ikaunieks, Vladislavs Gutkovskis, Marco Regza, Ingars Pulis. After all, the dominant themes of this England squad selection, when it was announced at Wembley at the start of this international break, were loyalty and continuity. 💬 “Are there players out who deserve to be with us? Is there a way back into the team through performance? “What are we doing if a player like Jude (Bellingham) is injured before the World Cup? “This is more about the last camp and what we started to build, than about the dependence on individual players.” Jack Grealish, who joined Everton on loan after being frozen out at Manchester City, has started very well, with our very own Patrick Boyland saying he has ‘allowed Everton to dream again'. Trevoh Chalobah has come in and out, the midfield exclusions of Curtis Jones and especially Adam Wharton appear mystifying, and Phil Foden is out despite returning to form for Manchester City. While Morgans Rogers and Gibbs-White have been poor for Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest respectively but retain their places. And don't get Tim Spiers started on Jude Bellingham being left out... ✍️ Jude Bellingham, one of England's most gifted young footballers, has been left out of the squad and it's a completely normal situation. It might be an idea to practice with your best players? Actually, no wait, Brazil used to leave out Pele all the time. Elliot Anderson did impress on his debut outing in Belgrade but Wharton's exclusion was still startling, as was that of Jack Grealish, who has started the season well with Everton, alongside Man City's Phil Foden. Jude Bellingham being absent is perhaps more understandable given his recovery from a shoulder injury.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>England will wrap up its place at the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday, provided it beats Latvia in Riga. With five wins from five in UEFA Group K thus far, England travels to Riga on Tuesday knowing one more win will secure its spot at the 2026 World Cup. Thomas Tuchel's men enjoyed the same result when they faced off against Wales last Thursday and hope to cap off the international break with a World Cup berth in tow. Latvia, meanwhile, can only clinch a second-place play-off spot at best but needs to pull off a mighty upset against the English to keep that dream alive. England was already without the injured trio of Reece James, Noni Madueke, and Trent Alexander-Arnold heading into this break. However, Bayer Leverkusen's Jarell Quansah has since joined them on the sidelines after suffering a knee injury last week. All-time scorer Harry Kane was rested for the meeting with Wales, but should return to the XI as England looks to get its nose over the World Cup line. Latvia's squad isn't exactly flush with star talent, though 21-year-old striker Dario Sits is one name who could be worth keeping tabs on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The World Cup qualifiers are entering their final stretch, and not every powerhouse is cruising toward safety. With just one point from four matches, Jon Dahl Tomasson's side needs a miracle to qualify for the 2026 World Cup. Despite having attacking talent, Sweden hasn't qualified for a major tournament since Euro 2020, and that drought looks set to continue. After missing the 2018 and 2022 editions, Gennaro Gattuso's men have won three of their first four qualifiers — yet they still trail an unbeaten Norway side. To top the group, Italy must win their remaining three games — including a decisive clash with Norway — and hope their rivals drop points against Estonia. If not, they'll face another dreaded playoff, where painful memories of defeats to Sweden and North Macedonia still linger. Despite a recent win over Lesotho, they sit third in Group C, behind South Africa and Benin, with one match left to play. Failure to qualify would mark a second consecutive absence for the Super Eagles, who had previously reached six of the last seven tournaments. Costa Rica and Cameroon: No Room for Error In CONCACAF, Costa Rica has made life difficult despite an easier path following the automatic qualification of the North American hosts. With only one win in four matches, they trail Honduras by two points and must win both remaining fixtures to avoid the playoffs. Having qualified for six of the last eight World Cups, Saudi Arabia faces a decisive moment. Hervé Renard's squad must beat Iraq to progress, after finishing third in their group. A defeat would send them into another playoff, and potentially the inter-confederation stage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA is reportedly preparing to lift its current cap on the number of clubs from a single nation allowed to compete in the Club World Cup. Currently set at two, the proposed increase to three could dramatically impact Premier League contenders, including Liverpool and Arsenal. Despite their historical pedigree and recent domestic success, both clubs missed out on the 2025 edition. If the adjustment is approved, England could send three clubs to future tournaments, offering greater representation for one of Europe's most dominant leagues. For readers who want to turn these structural shifts into personal opportunities, there's a surprise at the end of this article: a special bonus from Melbet that can be activated during registration. The expanded Club World Cup format, set to debut in 2025, features 32 clubs and operates on a four-year cycle. While this limit promotes regional diversity, it has also sidelined high-performing teams from top leagues. One of FIFA's core objectives is to enhance the credibility of the Club World Cup as a legitimate contest between elite clubs. The proposed rule change to allow three clubs per country seeks to correct that by ensuring that high-caliber teams can participate based on merit. Limiting England to only two slots no longer reflects the league's current strength. Introducing a third berth would align the Club World Cup more closely with performance metrics and enhance its competitive credibility. This rare harmony between football's global and continental governing bodies opens the door for immediate reform. If implemented, it would mark a pivotal shift in how European dominance is acknowledged on the world stage. Both have posted strong performances in domestic and European competitions but fell just short of qualification under the existing rules. For clubs that often operate just outside the shadow of Manchester City's dominance, this rule change could be transformative. As the structure of world football evolves, strategic fans are turning their attention to informed predictions. On Melbet Ghana, users can place targeted bets on major club tournaments, including future Club World Cup winners, player goal totals, and match outcomes. By entering the promo code MELBONUS when creating an account, new users unlock an enhanced welcome bonus – a smart move for those looking to leverage football knowledge into tangible wins. The potential expansion of Club World Cup slots represents more than just a rule change – it's a recalibration of global football hierarchy. Allowing three clubs per nation could make the competition more inclusive of true performance, not just legacy. For English football, it signals an era where depth is finally rewarded. And for fans, the rise of Liverpool and Arsenal as global contenders is no longer a dream deferred, but a possibility waiting to unfold. Ultimately, it is a competition where dreams are made and legends are born, and despite a large proportion of fans reserving their attention for the latter stages when Premier League giants enter the fray, the real... The league was founded in 1979 to create a non-league football pyramid, and was originally known as the Alliance Premier League. From Premier League veterans to Championship battlers, the National League South is full of players with serious pedigree who've dropped down the divisions for one last challenge — or...</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Landon Donovan says that players who missed out on the USMNT's October camp are in danger of "falling behind" with Mauricio Pochettino regardless of their stature within the team. In their most recent friendly, the United States Men's National Team managed to draw with Ecuador, 1-1. While the scoreline may not turn heads or send jaws plummeting towards the floor, the American's performance was largely impressive especially when considering that Ecuador sit 2nd in CONMEBOL's (South America's football federation) World Cup qualification standings having conceded just 5 goals across 18 matches this cycle and that the USMNT were missing a number of their key players. Antonee Robinson, Sergiño  Dest and Alejandro Zendejas missed out due to injury while Tyler Adams was absent due to the upcoming birth of his 2nd child. Additionally, Christian Pulisic was limited to 17 minutes off the bench as he recovers from an ankle injury. While some of these players have long been viewed as vital first-teamers, on the most recent episode of Unfiltered Soccer, Landon Donovan warned that their places as starters aren't necessarily promised. The guys who weren't there now, they're going to fall behind a little bit, right? Like Tyler [Adams], Sergiño [Dest], Jedi [Antonee Robinson] now a little. We think of them as like... they're a step above. Of those notable absences, Antonee Robinson's has raised the most concern. He has been dealing with tendinopathy in his knee since last November, a condition which caused him to miss out on the CONCACAF Nations League  semifinals in March, the Gold Cup this past summer, the September friendlies against South Korea and Japan and now this most recent friendly against Ecuador. “From talking to people behind the scenes, it's a real issue.” So what course of action should Robinson take in managing the injury and boosting his chances for full fitness at next summer's World Cup? The USMNT, with or without Robinson, are next in action Tuesday night against Australia, a nation that will be heading to its 6th consecutive World Cup next summer here in North America.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team manager Mauricio Pochettino struck an optimistic tone when the topic of Christian Pulisic's fitness was raised this week. The royally in-form forward was named as a substitute for the USMNT's 1–1 draw with Ecuador on Friday night after struggling with an ankle issue. Speaking the day before his side take on Australia in a marquee friendly on Tuesday night, Pochettino was positive about Pulisic's condition. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. “His ankle I think reacted very well and just hope that tomorrow he can be available. We need to wait today for the reaction too, but I think it's much better than when we he arrived.” “We are managing him in the best way, but he still cannot be involved in training and for sure tomorrow cannot be involved in the game. I hope that it's not an important thing, but [can] come back to his club and can be in a normal way there training.” Pulisic is enjoying the form of his career for AC Milan. Milan's rampant two-way threat boasts four goals and two assists across his opening six Serie A appearances this season—no player in Italy's top flight has directly contributed to more goals—thriving under Massimiliano Allegri's more pared-back approach. For all of the enthusiasm about Folarin Balogun's strong showing against Ecuador, the USMNT will need Pulisic to begin replicating his club form on the international stage if they are to harbor ambitions of making a deep run in this summer's World Cup. 10 hasn't scored a goal for his country since Nov. 19, 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GIBRALTAR -- Germain Haewegene has a mischievous, excitable grin. The New Caledonia forward has just scored the second goal in his country's 2-0 friendly win against Gibraltar, though he knows he has a long night ahead of him. A bus will collect him and his domestic teammates at 2.30 a.m. to begin a 30-hour, 12,000-mile journey home -- just 72 hours after making it in the opposite direction to play their Oct. 8 friendly. Haewegene is standing outside the visitors locker room in Gibraltar's Europa Point Stadium, holding an apple in his hand -- no protein shakes or rehydration gels for this group of players -- but he wants to talk about his goal, the pride of playing for the South Pacific nation and why even a grueling trip back to the French-controlled archipelago is absolutely nothing to complain about. "I feel pride for my country and also for my teammates, who did a big job to win this game. New Caledonia's biggest journey has only just started and the final destination, as incredulous as it seems, could be the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada. "It is always special to beat Tahiti," midfielder Jekob Jeno said. - Why this is (kinda) the last October international break ever - How Estêvão, 'Little Messi,' burst onto scene at Chelsea - Premier League issues: What to watch after break Tahiti and New Caledonia are separated by 2,900 miles of ocean, making it perhaps the longest-distance "local" rivalry in sport. But while New Zealand booked Oceania's solitary direct World Cup spot, New Caledonia will travel to Mexico for the interconfederation playoffs in Guadalajara and Monterrey knowing they're just two victories from the World Cup. They are a team consisting of part-timers playing in New Caledonia's 10-team Super Ligue and several who play no higher than the fifth-tier of French football. Only Jeno, who joined Romania's Unirea Slobozia this summer, represents a top-level team beyond Oceania. Bolivia have also qualified for the Play-Offs and will be joined by two Concacaf nations and one each from Asia and Africa; New Caledonia, ranked 150 by FIFA, know they have a mountain to climb to become the smallest nation ever, eclipsing Iceland, to qualify for the World Cup by clinching one of the two final qualification spots. "The step is big," coach Johann Sidaner told ESPN. "Maybe we have a 1% chance of qualifying for the World Cup. Their dream may be years in the making, but New Caledonia is a relative newcomer to international football, only becoming a member of FIFA in 2004 after being given permission by the French Football Federation four years earlier to apply for membership. As one of France's Overseas Territories, its citizens have French nationality and are eligible to vote in French presidential elections. Despite being over 10,000 miles apart, the close ties to France explain why almost half of Sidaner's squad play in the country and why the 48-year-old left a position at his hometown club Nantes to become New Caledonia coach in 2022. "It was an easy decision for me," Sidaner said. It is easy to manage this football team." When Gibraltar confirmed the friendly against New Caledonia last month, the announcement was done with flags from Gibraltar and New Caledonia alongside each other on the Gibraltar FA website, causing little short of a diplomatic incident. "We were asked by UEFA within 20 minutes of the story going up to change the flag [and add France] because of a complaint by New Caledonia," a Gibraltar source told ESPN. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. The flag sensitivity also led to Gibraltar having to buy a new flagpole for the game due to both French and New Caledonian flags needing to be flown, with strict instructions that the French flag took prominence over the island nation's. It was only in 2008 that France granted the football team permission to have its own anthem rather than La Marseillaise, which remains New Caledonia's official national anthem, so it is against this backdrop of French control that New Caledonia's footballers are literally putting their country on the map. "Maybe we can show ourselves as New Caledonia through our football," midfielder Jeno said. "We know how important the team is to people in New Caledonia. We are their passion and our progress is good for everybody. "They have had to take time away from their families, their jobs -- normal jobs, like working in a supermarket -- to come to Gibraltar, but we all do it for New Caledonia." Haewegene, the charismatic goal scorer, laughs when asked whether he could be a full-time professional in New Caledonia with AS Magenta, before revealing his incredible "real" job. "I play for the biggest team in New Caledonia, but we are not professional. Gibraltar's stadium is half-football ground and half-cricket pitch, tightly framed by the imposing Rock of Gibraltar, a substantial red-and-white lighthouse and the Straits of Gibraltar, the 9-mile-wide stretch of water that separates Europe from Africa. But having not played a game since the defeat against New Zealand in Auckland in March, New Caledonia simply needed to play. "My job is to arrange games for national teams and the New Caledonia coach asked me to find an opponent in Europe in October," Gaël Mahé, a FIFA match agent told ESPN. There aren't many possibilities, especially because there are World Cup qualifiers right now and the big national teams can find opponents much easier. "For the New Caledonia players, half of whom play in their own country, they are travelling halfway around the world for 30 hours, but Gibraltar were happy to play the game, so it was a good solution." It's 4 a.m. in Noumea, the capital of New Caledonia, when Sidaner's team kick off against Gibraltar at 7 p.m. local time. Having only arrived on Sunday evening, the jet lag is likely to be at its most punishing for the home-based players. A team room with table tennis and video games has been set up at the squad's hotel; some players spend their time shopping, while coach Sidaner relaxes on the terrace outside the hotel with a beer. There is a relaxed atmosphere around the team, but once the game starts, there is also a tenacity and energy that takes Gibraltar by surprise. "It was an important victory for us because we have beaten a European team for the first time," coach Sidaner said. "We are raising the level of demand with these World Cup 2026 qualifying play-offs and we are only 150 days away from a historic date for New Caledonian football. A training camp in France is planned for January, with hopes of at least one competitive game before the trip to Mexico in March, but after beating Gibraltar, the players just want to celebrate the moment. Sidaner's squad sit on the steps outside the stadium post-game; some are on their phones, a couple of them sneak a vape and others pose for selfies and photographs. Then they get on the bus, pack their bags and prepare for that arduous journey home. The itinerary takes them from Malaga, Spain, to Paris, a connecting flight to Singapore and then finally to Noumea -- all in coach class -- but there is only joy among the players as they danced on the bus.</p>

Gennaro Gattuso's Italy can at least secure a spot for the playoffs to qualify for the FIFA World Cup if they win on Tuesday against Israel. The Azzurri started off the group qualifiers with a disappointing defeat against Norway, which led to the sacking of former manager Luciano Spalletti. Under Gattuso, Italy have won all three of their matches so far including a thrilling 5–4 away victory over Israel last month and are now likely to finish second behind Norway. That would mean facing the playoffs for the third consecutive time, after missing out in 2018 against Sweden and again in 2022 against North Macedonia, marking the first time in history the Azzurri have failed to qualify for two straight World Cups. Here's what you need to know about Tuesday's match. Italy XI: Gianluigi Donnarumma; Giovanni Di Lorenzo, Gianluca Mancini, Riccardo Calafiori; Andrea Cambiaso, Nicolo Barella, Manuel Locatelli, Sandro Tonali, Federico Dimarco; Mateo Retegui, Giacomo Raspadori.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States trailed by a goal against a stingy Ecuador side that entered Friday night's friendly at Q2 Stadium on an unprecedented unbeaten streak. Ecuador led early thanks to a well-executed strike from their star finisher Enner Valencia in the 24th minute on a transition play. In fact, an equalizer felt almost inevitable. The U.S. created chance after chance – first from Chris Richards, then from Aidan Morris – looking fluid in their formation and unflinchingly resolved to level the match. “I think they don't realize how much we as players rely on their support. It's always nice when we can play at an amazing stadium like today with the home crowd supporting us and cheering us on.” “In the second half, the stadium started really going crazy, and we started to step it up a bit,” winger Tim Weah said. “That was nice, and we ended up getting the goal thanks to them. It's always great having that turn up.” “We felt it on the field,” Ream said. “I made the comment on the bench that for a friendly, it was a really impressive atmosphere… to feel that togetherness from a sellout crowd and hearing the ‘U-S-A!' Balogun finished a Malik Tillman cross to tie the match 1-1. The United States closed out the match with a draw, tying a team that finished second behind only Argentina in World Cup Qualifying in CONMEBOL. The response, the support, added up to a strong performance — one that seems to define this group that is growing under head coach Mauricio Pochettino.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>COMMERCE CITY, Colo.— By some estimates, last week's 1-1 tie with Ecuador was the best performance, if not result, that the U.S. men's national team has had since Mauricio Pochettino took over as coach just over a year ago. Whether that's true or not doesn't matter. Because when it comes to these two-match tuneups for next year's FIFA World Cup on home soil — there are only five friendly matches remaining for the USMNT before Pochettino names his 26-player roster, and just seven before the Americans open the tournament June 12 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles against an opponent to be determined at December's draw — the second match is the one that counts. A dispiriting 2-0 defeat to South Korea that wasn't as close as that score would suggest. That means quickly forgetting all about Friday's draw in Austin, Texas, and focusing completely on Australia, the nails-tough World Cup-bound foe they'll meet here on Tuesday outside of Denver. "Tomorrow is going to be a different game," Pochettino said on Monday during his pregame press conference at Dick's Sporting Goods Park. "Australia is a team [that's] very aggressive." No, their players don't play at Paris Saint-Germain or AC Milan like the Ecuadorians' top stars, but they play hard and together. "We need to respect them," Pochettino said. "They're going to be another good test, like Ecuador, for us." DSG Park sits a mile above sea level. The temperature is significantly colder than it was last week in Austin. And Pochettino also has to keep the big picture in mind; star left back Antonee "Jedi" Robinson, U.S. Soccer's Male Athlete of 2024 Award winner who hasn't represented his country at all this calendar year because of injury, will sit out a second straight October game. Other USMNT players might simply be rested as Pochettino doles out opportunities to other World Cup roster hopefuls. Christian Pulisic, who was limited to a late cameo off the bench versus Ecuador because of a swollen ankle, could also feature from the start.

"The most important thing in the national team is to have competition," said Cristian Roldan, a 2022 World Cup veteran who Pochettino summoned for the first time last month. "That's what we all want to strive for, because now you have a bigger player pool to choose from." "He's he's created an environment so quickly that doesn't create certainty for anyone," striker Folarin Balogun, who's been the best U.S. player for three games running, said of Pochettino. "Nobody's place is guaranteed — he's created that feeling throughout the team," Balogun added. The U.S. has emerged victorious in just one of its last four games dating to July's Gold Cup final. Another win could do wonders for the USMNT's collective belief. Balogun, given his from, seems sure to start again in greater Denver. "When you come into the national team, you've got to do what you can for the nation," reserve winger Brenden Aaronson said, "It's about rolling up the sleeves and doing the best you can in any situation. How the Americans will line up is another open question. Pochettino has started a three-man back line in each of the USMNT's last two outings. Yet he suggested that things could change again, especially with the Aussies playing style more entrenched. "We need to build something, but they are more solid in their ideas," Pochettino said of Australia. "I don't believe that they are going to change the way that they are going to play. "We want to have this flexibility, with different players and sometimes different shape or dynamics on the field, to provide the team better quality [opposition]. "I'm happy to face a team like that." Doug McIntyre is a soccer reporter for FOX Sports who has covered United States men's and women's national teams at FIFA World Cups on five continents.</p>
