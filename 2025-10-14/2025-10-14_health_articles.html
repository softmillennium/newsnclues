                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Damage to the cornea affects millions of people worldwide. Empa researchers are working on a transparent, biocompatible implant from the 3D printer. This allows defects to be repaired seamlessly and permanently. Millions of people worldwide are affected by corneal damage, but only around 100,000 of them each year can be treated with a corneal transplant. The reason: Demand for donated tissue is significantly higher than its availability. A team of researchers from Empa, the University of Zurich, the Zurich Veterinary Hospital and Radboud University in the Netherlands is therefore developing a self-adhesive implant that is not dependent on tissue donations and does not cause a rejection reaction. "The basis for the implant is a biocompatible hydrogel made of collagen and hyaluronic acid," says Markus Rottmar from Empa's Biointerfaces lab in St. Gallen. The transparent implant also contains additives to ensure optimum biomechanical stability. And because the self-adhesive transplant does not require surgical sutures, longer operating times and post-operative complications such as infection, scarring or inflammation can also be avoided. Empa's Zukunftsfonds raises private third-party funds for such pioneering research projects that are not yet supported otherwise. Would you also like to give our research an additional boost?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An AI system that can predict what a patient's knee X-ray will look like a year in the future could transform how millions of people with osteoarthritis understand and manage their condition, according to research by the University of Surrey. A new study, published at the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2025), details how the Surrey-developed technology uses advanced machine learning to generate a realistic "future" X-ray alongside a risk score for disease progression in the knee. These two outputs combined can give doctors and patients a clear, visual forecast of how the condition may develop over time. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that affects more than 500 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of disability in older adults. Trained on nearly 50,000 knee X-rays from almost 5,000 patients - one of the largest osteoarthritis datasets in the world - the system outperforms comparable AI tools for predicting osteoarthritis progression, doing so around nine times faster and in a much more compact form. Researchers say this blend of speed, scale and accuracy could accelerate adoption in real clinical settings. Our system not only predicts the likelihood of your knee getting worse - it actually shows you a realistic image of what that future knee could look like. It helps doctors act sooner and gives patients a clearer picture of why sticking to their treatment plan or making lifestyle changes really matters. We think this can be a turning point in how we communicate risk and improve osteoarthritic knee care and other related conditions." David Butler, study lead from the University of Surrey's Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP), and Institute for People-Centred AI These points add transparency by showing which areas the AI is monitoring for changes, making the system easier for clinicians to understand and trust. In the future, this research could pave the way for similar tools in other chronic conditions for example, predicting lung damage in smokers or tracking heart disease progression, giving doctors and patients the same kind of visual insight and opportunity to act early. "Earlier AI systems could estimate the risk of osteoarthritis progression, but they were often slow, opaque and limited to numbers rather than clear images. Our approach takes a big step forward by generating realistic future X-rays quickly and by pinpointing the areas of the joint most likely to change.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A peer-reviewed viewpoint article published today in Psychedelics by Prof. Xiaohui Wang and colleagues examines the therapeutic potential of psychedelic substances for treating stress-related psychiatric disorders through novel neurobiological mechanisms. The analysis synthesizes current evidence on how compounds like psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and MDMA could fundamentally alter treatment paradigms for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The authors emphasize that chronic stress represents a major contributor to psychiatric illness worldwide, with persistent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis leading to structural brain changes. Traditional treatments including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive behavioral therapy, while helpful for some patients, leave many with residual symptoms or significant side effects. This receptor activation promotes neuroplasticity and functional connectivity that could counteract structural damage from chronic stress exposure. The authors note that preclinical studies demonstrate psilocybin can upregulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor and enhance dendritic arborization in the prefrontal cortex, processes critical for mood regulation. The viewpoint highlights mounting clinical evidence across multiple conditions. For depression, the authors cite studies where single psilocybin doses produced significant symptom reductions lasting weeks to months in treatment-resistant patients. One pivotal study showed approximately 67% of PTSD patients no longer met diagnostic criteria after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, though recent FDA advisory committee concerns about methodological limitations underscore the need for refined trial designs. "Psychedelics offer a potential in counteracting the damaging effects from prolonged exposure to stress," the authors write, noting these substances foster neuroplasticity that may allow recovery of brain regions impacted by cortisol. Unlike conventional treatments targeting symptoms, psychedelic therapy addresses underlying causes, potentially enabling sustained relief through confronting and integrating unresolved stressors. The analysis extends beyond serotonergic effects to examine anti-inflammatory properties that may provide additional therapeutic benefit. Preliminary evidence suggests psilocybin decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines, offering potential protection against stress-related brain changes. The authors propose that concurrent monitoring of immune markers and cortisol could clarify whether these mechanisms work synergistically. MDMA presents a distinct profile as an entactogenic agent, functioning as a monoamine-releasing compound that promotes emotional openness and reduces fear responses. The authors emphasize its therapeutic signal derives from acute prosociality and enhanced memory reconsolidation during psychotherapy sessions, rather than classical psychedelic phenomenology. This pharmacological state enables patients to access traumatic memories without overwhelming fear responses. The viewpoint acknowledges substantial hurdles before mainstream integration becomes feasible. Current Schedule I classification severely restricts research and therapeutic implementation, though evolving policy experiments in Oregon and Colorado suggest regulatory frameworks may emerge. The authors advocate for standardized protocols, enhanced safety reporting, and strategies to manage expectancy effects that complicate efficacy interpretations. Longitudinal studies comparing psychedelic-assisted therapy with conventional treatments across psychiatric diagnoses remain essential. Prof. Wang and colleagues identify critical research needs including biomarker development for personalizing treatment, optimization of dosing regimens, and investigation of genetic factors influencing response. This viewpoint article represents a critical synthesis of the current state of knowledge in psychedelic therapeutics, providing researchers, clinicians, and policymakers with a comprehensive framework for understanding these substances' therapeutic potential.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this interview, News-Medical Life Sciences speaks with Bill Kotowski, Sales Manager for North America State & Local Chemical Identification at Thermo Fisher Scientific, and Dr. Suja Sukumaran, Product Manager at Thermo Fisher Scientific, about the latest advances in controlled substance testing. They discuss how handheld Raman spectrometers, benchtop Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) instruments, and updated spectral libraries are transforming workflows from the field to the lab, enhancing both safety and accuracy in the fight against narcotics and emerging drug threats. Bill Kotowski: I manage the state and local sales teams for North America, focusing on handheld chemical identification solutions. I've been with Thermo Fisher for about 15 years, and I've overseen the launch of several handhelds, including our newest TruNarc Delta narcotics analyzer. Suja Sukumaran: I'm a product manager at Thermo Fisher, specializing in molecular spectroscopy solutions. Bill Kotowski: We provide solutions that cover the entire workflow, from presumptive testing in the field with our handheld Raman devices to confirmatory analysis in the lab using FTIR and benchtop Raman. Our teams merged Research and Development (R&D) efforts so that the same spectral libraries support both handheld and lab instruments, ensuring consistency from street to lab. Bill Kotowski: TruNarc Delta is our flagship handheld Raman analyzer for presumptive testing. TruNarc Delta delivers results in seconds and can scan right through bags or containers, keeping officers safer in the field. Many agencies report that when TruNarc indicates cocaine, for example, defense attorneys often advise clients to enter plea agreements rather than push to trial. We also had a recent Kelly hearing in California, where TruNarc results were deemed admissible, creating legal precedent for presumptive evidence in the United States (US). Fentanyl and its analogs are extremely potent—sometimes even lethal at microgram levels. That's why both field and lab testing methods must prioritize safety. Suja Sukumaran: Our handheld Raman allows non-contact scanning, while in the lab, glove boxes, chemical hoods, and fiber optic ATR probes help analysts avoid direct exposure during confirmatory FTIR or Raman testing. By combining them, analysts get a more complete structural picture. Using both, compared to a library, provides robust confirmation of controlled substances, whether powders, pills, or mixed samples. By combining FTIR and Raman, analysts get the most complete structural picture, ensuring accurate confirmation of controlled substances. Bill Kotowski: Counterfeit oxycodone pills are a serious concern. With TruNarc, if a tablet doesn't register as oxycodone, it's highly likely to be counterfeit—and often laced with fentanyl. For cases where the concentration is very low, we use our Type H2 kit with surface-enhanced Raman (SERS) technology, which can detect fentanyl and other drugs at levels below 5 %. Bill Kotowski: One of the big challenges we see is drugs sprayed onto paper or even greeting cards. TruNarc can often pick up concentrated hot spots directly, and when levels are lower, the Type H kit helps us detect them. States like California and Arkansas have now standardized on TruNarc across their correctional systems, which really shows how important this tool has become for protecting both inmates and officers. Importantly, the libraries can differentiate between different fentanyl isomers. For example, cis vs. trans, which have very different potencies. Bill Kotowski: Yes, many agencies use grants to fund purchases. We partner with policegrantshelp.com to provide guidance, and agencies can qualify for programs like COPS Anti-Heroin or Byrne JAG grants. We also assist directly in the grant-writing process if needed. As new synthetic drugs emerge, maintaining updated libraries and leveraging techniques like Raman microscopy and SERS will be essential. Handheld Raman will continue to be critical for first responders, correctional officers, and border agents who need to make quick decisions while minimizing risk. Bill Kotowski is the Sales Manager for the North America State & Local Chemical Identification team with Thermo Fisher Scientific. He has been with Thermo Fisher for 15 years and has overseen the launch of key safety & security handhelds including the latest Thermo Scientific TruNarc Delta Handheld Narcotics Analyzer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The World Health Organization (WHO) today warns that less than one in three countries around the world has a national policy to address the growing burden of neurological disorders, responsible for over 11 million deaths globally each year. The WHO's new Global status report on neurology released today shows that neurological conditions now affect more than 40% of the global population – over 3 billion people. The top 10 neurological conditions contributing to death and disability as of 2021 were stroke, neonatal encephalopathy, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, diabetic neuropathy, meningitis, idiopathic epilepsy, neurological complications linked to preterm birth, autism spectrum disorders, and cancers of the nervous systems. Low-income countries have more than 80 times fewer neurologists compared to high-income nations despite the high burden of these diseases. With more than 1 in 3 people in the world living with conditions affecting their brain we must do all we can to improve the health care they need. Many of these neurological conditions can be prevented or effectively treated, yet services remain out of reach for most – especially in rural and underserved areas – where people too often face stigma, social exclusion and financial hardship. Dr. Jeremy Farrar, WHO Assistant Director-General, Division of Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Control Just 32% of Member States (63 countries) have a national policy addressing neurological disorders, and only 18% (34 countries) report having dedicated funding to address them. Essential services are out of reach for most people. Only 25% of Member States (49 countries) include neurological disorders in their universal health coverage benefit packages. Critical services such as stroke units, pediatric neurology, rehabilitation, and palliative care are frequently lacking or concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural and underserved populations without access to lifesaving and life-sustaining care. The report reveals a severe lack of qualified health professionals, with low-income countries facing up to 82 times fewer neurologists per 100 000 people compared to high-income nations. This shortage means that for many patients, timely diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing care are simply out of reach. As a result, informal carers – most often women – are left without recognition or support, reinforcing social inequities and placing a significant financial strain on families. In response to these growing public health challenges, Member States adopted the Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders in 2022 to reduce the burden and impact of neurological conditions. Without action, the burden of neurological disorders will continue to rise, deepening global health inequalities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a landmark public health achievement, the World Health Organization (WHO) has validated the Maldives for eliminating mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of hepatitis B, while maintaining its earlier validation (in 2019) for EMTCT of HIV and syphilis. This historic milestone provides hope and inspiration for countries everywhere working towards the same goal." Mother-to-child transmission leads to infections that affect millions worldwide. In the WHO South-East Asia Region alone, provisional estimates indicate that in 2024, more than 23 000 pregnant women had syphilis and over 8000 infants were born with congenital syphilis. said Dr Catharina Boehme, Officer-in-Charge, WHO South-East Asia Regional Office. "This landmark feat is an important step towards 'Healthy Beginnings, Hopeful Futures,' for improving maternal and newborn health by ending preventable deaths and prioritizing long-term well-being. I congratulate Maldives and look forward to the country pioneering progress in many other areas, while sustaining these gains." More than 95% of pregnant women receive antenatal care, with nearly universal testing for HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B. The country also has a strong immunization system, with over 95% of newborns consistently receiving a timely dose of hepatitis B birth dose and full vaccine coverage, protecting infants from lifelong infection. As a result, no babies were born with HIV or syphilis in 2022 and 2023, while a 2023 national survey confirmed zero hepatitis B among young children (first grade of school), surpassing elimination targets. These achievements are backed by universal health coverage, which guarantees free antenatal care, vaccines and diagnostic services for all residents, including migrants, supported by strong policies and investment of over 10% of GDP in health. "This historic validation is a moment of immense pride for the Maldives and a reflection of our nation's steadfast commitment to protecting mothers, children and future generations," said H.E Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim, Minister of Health, Maldives. "Achieving triple elimination is not only a milestone for our health sector, but also a pledge by the Government to our people that we will continue to invest in resilient, equitable and high-quality health services that leave no one behind." This milestone reflects strong partnerships between government, private health providers, civil society, and international partners, working together on screening, services, outreach, and technical support. "The Maldives' triple elimination stands as a powerful example of how sustained investment in health systems, innovation, and community-based care can change the trajectory of public health, said Ms Payden, WHO Representative to Maldives. "WHO is proud to have partnered with the Government of Maldives and will continue to provide technical support to sustain this achievement and ensure that every child across all the islands have a healthy future."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>California this week plans to notify Affordable Care Act marketplace enrollees that their costs could rise sharply next year unless Congress extends subsidies to help people buy health insurance. Health care analysts say the nation's uninsured population will rise significantly if federal lawmakers do not agree to renew covid-era tax credits, which Congress authorized in 2021 to supplement ACA subsidies. According to a KFF poll, more than three-quarters of adults, including 59% of Republicans, say they want Congress to extend the enhanced tax credits for people with low and moderate incomes. Last week, President Donald Trump suggested a health care deal might be in the works. And Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, long aligned with the "Make America Great Again" movement, appeared to endorse an extension of the tax credits, saying in a social media post that she was "absolutely disgusted that health insurance premiums will DOUBLE if the tax credits expire this year." However, Republican leaders want to reopen the government first, while Democrats want a deal in a bill that ends the shutdown. If the supplemental subsidies are not extended beyond this year, the amount subsidized consumers pay for their ACA health plans is expected to more than double on average. That would be a painful cost-of-living increase for most of the country's more than 24 million marketplace enrollees, including almost 90% of the nearly 2 million people in Covered California, the largest state-run health insurance marketplace. Analysts say the loss of enhanced credits would lead millions to drop their coverage nationally, including hundreds of thousands in California. One estimate puts the price tag at $350 billion over 10 years. Open enrollment season for 2026 ACA health plans starts Nov. 1 in most states, including California, and enrollees still have no clue whether their premiums will rise exorbitantly next year. In July, Covered California sent notices to enrollees breaking out the enhanced portion of their federal subsidy that is set to expire. The idea was to give them a warning of how much their costs might rise if they chose to keep the same health plan next year. Another enrollee stood to lose one-third of a total $600 per month in aid, according to sample notices provided by Covered California. Senate Majority Leader John Thune in late September left the door open to extending the otherwise-expiring tax credits but said "it would have to come with some reforms." If the enhanced subsidies end, Covered California projects its enrollees receiving enhanced subsidies will see their premium costs rise an average of 97%. Depending on age, income, and location, some people will see smaller jumps while others could see their out-of-pocket costs triple, Altman says. Rural residents, especially in the northern and eastern counties, and along the Monterey Coast, will see disproportionately large cost increases, according to projections from Covered California. Enrollees with incomes over $62,600 will lose financial aid altogether, leaving some who are ages 55-64 with premium bills as high as 30% of their income. Without the enhanced subsidies, "we're going to see more people experiencing medical debt, more people being either uninsured or underinsured," says Cary Sanders, senior policy director at the nonprofit California Pan-Ethnic Health Network. "And that is the quickest way for families to lose their economic security." Covered California estimates about 400,000 people would leave the exchange and likely go without insurance. But the proportional impact in California will be smaller than in some Republican-led states such as Florida, Texas, and Georgia. Since those states did not embrace the ACA's Medicaid expansion, millions of residents thronged to Obamacare marketplace plans, particularly after the enhanced tax credits made coverage eminently more affordable. In Texas, it more than tripled to just under 4 million. But that money is currently used to help offset enrollee deductibles, coinsurance payments, and other out-of-pocket expenses. "A lot of people are going to be shocked at what they're facing," says Rachel Linn Gish, a spokesperson for the nonprofit advocacy group Health Access California. "They're going to have to make super hard choices of, 'Do I cut back on my groceries, or my rent, or do I go uninsured?'" Very soon, Covered California and other ACA marketplaces will have to send out formal open enrollment letters, notifying enrollees precisely what to expect for 2026 coverage. Covered California typically sends those letters out Oct. 1 but has delayed them to around Oct. 15 in the hope that Washington will provide clarity. Altman says she is hoping for congressional action before sending the one with whopping premium increases. She fears that if Covered California informs enrollees that their rates will likely rise sharply, it will scare many away, even if Congress later agrees to extend the credits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Around 70% of women who suffer a sexual assault develop PTSD; now scientists have shown that many of these women show a marked reduction in the usual communication between two important brain areas involved in processing and control of emotions, the amygdala and the pre-frontal cortex. In some women, synchronisation between these areas can drop to near zero. This work is presented at the ECNP conference in Amsterdam. Worldwide, between 17% and 25% of women undergo a sexual assault, with around 70% subsequently developing PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). Previous PTSD studies, after natural disasters, accidents or war, have revealed changes in how the brain communicates. Now a group of Spanish scientists have shown that sexual assault can lead to similar brain changes. All underwent brain scans (via resting-state functional MRI) to look at brain connectivity, and how they relate to depressive and PTSD symptoms. Resting-state fMRI measures how different brain areas communicate with each other. Lead researcher, Dr. Lydia Fortea (of the Hospital Clinic, Barcelona) said "PTSD following sexual assault tends to be especially severe and is often accompanied by higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. This is one of the first, and certainly the largest, connectivity study to look at PTSD in sexual assault in teenagers and adult women. We looked at how key brain regions involved in fear and emotion regulation synchronise with the rest of the brain in women with PTSD following sexual assault. We focussed on the fronto-limbic system, which plays a crucial role in regulating emotions and responding to threats When this connection weakens, the brain might struggle to manage fear responses or regulate emotions, which could explain why people with PTSD often experience intense fear and mood changes. However, we didn't find that this brain change was directly linked to how severe their PTSD and depressive symptoms were. If so, we would be able to identify early which patients are at risk of worse outcomes and intensify clinical efforts to help them recover. The finding that amygdala–prefrontal communication can drop to near zero underscores the severity of circuit-level disruptions in emotional regulation networks after trauma. This raises the possibility that such disruptions could become predictive biomarkers for treatment response, guiding personalized interventions. However, larger longitudinal studies are needed to determine how these neural patterns evolve and whether targeted therapies can ameliorate connectivity".

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These delays can sharply raise the risk of complications, such as blood clots, infections and death. Additionally, because hip fracture patients are usually older, frail and have multiple health conditions, the traumatic nature of the injury and immobilization can cause a rapid deterioration in physical and mental well-being. Anesthesiologists are uniquely trained to quickly identify any conditions that must be addressed before surgery, as well as recognize those that can wait until after the procedure. After a hip fracture, every hour counts, and by avoiding unnecessary delays and focusing on what truly matters for safe surgery, we can help patients get to surgery and back on their feet faster." Sabatino Leffe, D.O., senior author of the study and vice chairman of Northwell Southshore University Hospital, Bay Shore, New York At most hospitals, hip fracture patients are seen by an emergency room or orthopedic physician who works with the internal medicine physician or hospitalist to admit the patient and schedule the surgery. This can delay surgery for hours and sometimes days. They determined if the patient's heart and lungs were stable, standard tests were normal and less urgent issues could be handled after surgery. Those in the traditional process group were brought to the OR an average of 30.8 hours after admission, while those in the anesthesiologist-led group were brought to the OR an average of 25.7 hours after admission, about five hours faster. For example, those in the anesthesiologist-led group had 59% fewer heart or lung complications and 75% fewer thromboembolic complications (such as blood clots) than those in the traditional group. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding length of stay, infection or death. An aging population is driving a dramatic rise in the incidence of hip fractures, which are typically caused by a combination of having fragile bones (osteoporosis) and falling or other trauma, said Dr. Leffe. About 350,000 Americans fracture a hip annually, according to research. Many never regain their prior level of mobility and independence and/or suffer from long-term complications, including cognitive decline, chronic pain, pneumonia or bedsores. "Our study demonstrates that a preoperative process primarily led by the anesthesiologist results in markedly improved time to surgery, with fewer complications and no increase in deaths or length of stay," said Surya Indukuri, B.S., lead author of the study and a medical student at Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra University, Uniondale, New York. "We are confident this expedited care will reduce unnecessary testing and shorten hospital stays, which should result in significant cost savings."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Infertility affects about one in six couples, and male factors account for roughly half of all cases-often because sperm don't swim well. Researchers from the University of Osaka uncovered a key component of the "switch" that keeps the movement signal strong, offering a promising new avenue for both diagnosis and treatment. When this switch is absent, sperm slow down, and fertilization fails. For sperm to successfully fertilize an egg, they must be able to swim, a process driven by their tail. This movement is activated by an essential signaling molecule called cyclic AMP (cAMP). While it was known that an enzyme named soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) produces cAMP inside sperm, the precise mechanism controlling this enzyme's stability and function remained largely a mystery. The research team focused on a protein with a previously unknown function, TMEM217, which is produced specifically in the testes. Further investigation revealed that TMEM217 partners with another protein, SLC9C1, to form a stable complex. Without TMEM217, SLC9C1 is lost and sAC is markedly reduced, causing cAMP levels to plummet and sperm motility to fail. In a significant breakthrough, the team took the immotile sperm from these mice and treated them with a cAMP analog-a molecule that mimics cAMP. This treatment successfully restored the sperm's movement and enabled them to fertilize eggs in vitro, leading to the birth of healthy pups. It's an encouraging step toward practical options for some forms of male infertility."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A major international study has uncovered a new vulnerability in prostate cancer cells that could help improve treatment for one of the most common cancers affecting men. It reveals that two enzymes - PDIA1 and PDIA5 - play a crucial role in helping prostate cancer cells grow, survive, and resist treatment. These enzymes act as molecular bodyguards for the androgen receptor (AR), a protein that fuels prostate cancer. The team also found that combining drugs that block PDIA1 and PDIA5 with enzalutamide, a widely used prostate cancer medication, significantly boosted the treatment's effectiveness. We've discovered a previously unknown mechanism that prostate cancer cells use to protect the androgen receptor, which is a key driver of the disease. By targeting these enzymes, we can destabilize the AR and make tumours more vulnerable to existing therapies like enzalutamide." Luke Selth, Senior Author, Professor, Head of Prostate Cancer Research and Co-Director of Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute's Cancer Impact program Lead author, Professor Jianling Xie, who started the research whilst at Flinders University, says that this combination therapy worked well in patient-derived tumour samples and in mice, suggesting strong potential for future clinical trials. "This is an exciting step forward," says Dr. Xie, now at South China University of Technology. "Our findings show that PDIA1 and PDIA5 are not just helpers of cancer growth but they're also promising targets for new treatments that could work alongside existing drugs." "This dual impact of hitting both the AR and the cancer's energy supply makes these enzymes especially attractive targets," adds Dr Xie. Professor Selth adds that while current drugs that block PDIA1 and PDIA5 show promise, more work is needed to make them safe and effective for use in patients. Some of the existing compounds may affect healthy cells, so future studies will focus on developing safer inhibitors. Although treatments like hormone therapy and AR-targeting drugs have helped many patients, resistance to these therapies is a major challenge. This new discovery could help overcome that hurdle and improve outcomes for men with advanced prostate cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How do people keep the beat to music? When people listen to songs, slow waves of activity in the brain correspond to the perceived beat so that they can tap their feet, nod their heads, or dance along. In a new JNeurosci paper, researchers led by Cédric Lenoir, from Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), explored whether this ability is unique to hearing or whether it also happens when rhythm is delivered by touch. The researchers recorded brain activity as study volunteers finger tapped to the beat of music delivered via sound or rhythmic vibration. The ability to move in time with a beat is essential for human social interactions through music. Future research will help clarify whether long-term music practice can strengthen the brain's ability to process rhythm through other senses, or whether sensory loss, such as hearing impairment, might allow the sense of touch to take over part of this function."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A major UK cohort study uncovers widespread eating disorder symptoms among diverse adolescents, exposing urgent gaps in recognition, cultural care, and long-held assumptions about who is truly at risk. Study: The Prevalence and Sociodemographic Correlates of Eating Disorder Symptoms in a Diverse School-Based Population Study. *Important notice:  Preprints with The Lancet / SSRN publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information. In a recent study posted to the SSRN Preprints with The Lancet server*, researchers investigated associations between sociodemographic characteristics and eating disorder (ED) symptoms in adolescents. ED incidence in primary care in the UK has increased over the past two decades, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, and in young adolescents aged 11–16, a period of peak ED incidence. A UK survey found that 13% of people aged 11–16 met the probable ED threshold in 2022. However, these estimates were from the Development and Well-being Assessment's ED module, which is susceptible to false positives and shows moderate agreement with clinical diagnoses. Other UK estimates have focused on clinical samples, limiting generalizability. In the present cross-sectional study, researchers examined the prevalence of ED symptoms and their associations with sociodemographic characteristics in UK adolescents. Data were collected from September 2023 to July 2024 using two sequential questionnaires, with all ED measures drawn from the first survey. The EDE-QS collected data on ED symptoms. Probable ED was defined as an EDE-QS score ≥ 15, a screening cut-off validated in adult community samples, and sensitivity analyses were performed using a slightly lower cut-off to define probable ED (≥ 13). The authors noted that the psychometric performance of EDE-QS in ethnically diverse early adolescents has not been fully validated. Probable ED was defined using an EDE-QS score ≥ 15. ED symptom distribution was described by sociodemographic characteristics: sex, school year group, ethnicity, area-level deprivation, and gender identity. Participants self-reported sex as male or female as assigned at birth and gender identity as female, male, or non-binary; there was also a free-text option to further describe gender identity. The researchers created a gender identity variable based on these free-text descriptions and responses: gender diverse (gender identity differed from sex assigned at birth) or cisgender (gender identity aligned with sex assigned at birth). Sex-stratified probable ED prevalence was reported by area deprivation and ethnicity. Linear regression was performed to explore associations between sociodemographic characteristics and EDE-QS scores. Overall, 9,498 individuals completed at least one survey. Among these, 7,434 had complete data and were included in analyses. Moreover, gender diverse individuals and females had higher EDE-QS scores than cisgender participants and males, respectively. Asian participants had lower EDE-QS scores than White individuals. Probable ED prevalence was lower in the least deprived areas. Participants from the most deprived areas had higher EDE-QS scores than those in the least deprived areas. Probable ED prevalence was higher among females and males in the most deprived areas than in the least deprived areas. Moreover, males and females from the most deprived areas had higher EDE-QS scores compared to those from the least deprived areas. The most frequently reported symptoms were dissatisfaction with shape or weight and a strong desire to lose weight. Compulsive exercise was the most frequently reported ED symptom among males, whereas dissatisfaction with shape or weight was the most common in females. Laxative use or self-induced vomiting were the least common symptoms in males and females. Gender diverse participants had higher endorsement of all symptoms than their cisgender peers. Asian, Black, or other ethnic males had a higher prevalence of fasting and dietary restriction than White males. Females from the most deprived areas showed a higher prevalence of binge eating, fasting, purging, and dietary restriction than those from the least deprived areas. Males from the most deprived areas had a higher prevalence of nearly all symptoms. Together, there was a high prevalence of ED symptoms in UK adolescents. Shape and weight dissatisfaction were common across sociodemographic groups. Ethnic minority males had more ED symptoms than White males, whereas White females had more symptoms than their Black and Asian peers. The findings challenge the misconception that EDs predominantly affect affluent White populations, highlighting a need to address inequalities in recognition and care. The authors also note that EDE-QS psychometrics are not fully established in ethnically diverse young adolescents and that the cohort's composition may affect generalizability. *Important notice:  Preprints with The Lancet / SSRN publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sepsis, or infection causing life-threatening organ dysfunction, is a leading cause of death in children worldwide. In efforts to prevent this rare but critical condition, researchers developed and validated AI models that accurately identify children at high risk for sepsis within 48 hours, so that early preemptive care can be provided. The multi-center study, led by Elizabeth Alpern, MD, MSCE, from Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, is the first to use AI models to predict sepsis in children based on the new Phoenix Sepsis Criteria. The predictive models we developed are a huge step toward precision medicine for sepsis in children. These models showed robust balance in identifying children in the ED who will later develop sepsis, without overidentifying those who are not at risk. This is very important because we want to avoid aggressive treatment for children who don't need it." The study included five health systems contributing to the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), which provided Dr. Alpern and colleagues access to a large dataset and diverse population. Children with sepsis already at arrival or within the first hours of ED care were excluded, focusing the goal of the study on predicting sepsis, to allow for early initiation of therapies that have been proven as lifesaving. "We evaluated our models to ensure that there were no biases," said Dr. Alpern.
