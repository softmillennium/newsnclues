Global demonstrations — not Trump or Netanyahu — are the real reason why we have a ceasefire now, says Ofer Cassif.

As President Trump addressed the Israeli Knesset on Monday, he was briefly interrupted by two lawmakers who waved signs reading “Recognize Palestine.” The two Knesset members, Ayman Odeh and Ofer Cassif with the Hadash-Ta'al alliance, were expelled from the chamber. “Yesterday, there was a disgusting display of flattery and personality cult by two megalomaniacs who are hungry for power and blood,” says Cassif. “This was a minimum protest against the policy of the genocidal government of Israel.”

AMY GOODMAN: We begin today's show in Israel, where the family members of the 20 remaining released hostages are welcoming their loved ones home.

On Monday, as President Trump addressed the Israeli Knesset, a group of leftist Israeli lawmakers briefly interrupted his speech, shouting at President Trump and waving signs that said “Recognize Palestine.”

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Everybody loves Steve, and they respect him, and they somehow can relate to him. I've known him for many years, and I've seen it over — over and over again.

KNESSET CHAIR: [speaking in Hebrew]

KNESSET MEMBERS: Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That was very efficient.

AMY GOODMAN: The two lawmakers were Ayman Odeh and Ofer Cassif. They're members of the Hadash-Ta'al alliance. Footage shows professor Rashid Khalidi's book, The Hundred Years' War on Palestine, resting on MK — that's member of Knesset — Cassif's desk as he's sitting before being ousted. He'll join us in a minute. After the two lawmakers were expelled from the Knesset, the Hadash-Ta'al head, Ayman Odeh, shared this message.

AYMAN ODEH: I was kicked out of the Knesset for raising the simplest demand, one of the whole international community agrees on: Recognize the state of Palestine. Recognize the simple truth: There are two peoples here, and no one is going anywhere.

AMY GOODMAN: That's the Palestinian member of the parliament, Ayman Odeh.

We're joined now by Ofer Cassif, a Jewish Israeli member of the Knesset and the leftist Hadash-Ta'al coalition.

Welcome back to Democracy Now!, sir. If you can start off by describing exactly what happened? You have for the first time President Trump addressing the Israeli Knesset, before taking off for Egypt, where he signed the ceasefire deal. Talk about what you did.

OFER CASSIF: Well, first of all, thank you for having me.

Yesterday, there was a disgusting display of flattery and personality cult by two megalomaniacs who are hungry for power and blood. That's the main bond between Netanyahu and Trump. And we used this opportunity, which I dare say, or I would like to say, that, luckily, doesn't happen too often, that someone like Trump attends the Knesset, and we used it to display our signs calling for the recognition of the state of Palestine.

This was a minimum — and, I would say, even polite — protest against the policy of mainly the government of Israel, the genocidal government of Israel, the government that sacrificed the Israeli hostages and the even Israeli soldiers on the altar of a messianic, crazy ideas. And all of that was taking place under the auspices of the governments of the United States, in plural — Biden and, later on, Trump. And this was our protest against the policy that both share. That's the reason we did it.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Ofer Cassif, I wanted to ask you the — there's been much made here in the United States of Trump's initiative to create this peace plan. But to what degree do you feel what happened in the weeks before, especially at the U.N. General Assembly, as one U.S. ally after another — Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, Portugal — recognized the state of Palestine — what impact do you think that had on pushing forward this ceasefire?

OFER CASSIF: First of all, I totally agree, if that's what you wanted to imply, that the main reason for the change in President Trump's policy towards the genocide in Gaza is the change — are the changes that have been occurring throughout the globe. First of all, it's the huge demonstrations of different peoples across the globe, in Europe, in America, in Australia, in East Asia, etc., etc., millions of people, of good people, of peace activists. People were terrified by the pictures from what was going on in Gaza. Those demonstrations, for sure, influenced, had their impact on Trump. And same about those leaders, like Sánchez in Spain or Petro in Colombia and others. There's no doubt that if we should thank someone for the end, for ending the genocide and releasing the Israeli hostages, it's not Trump, let alone Netanyahu. It is the demonstrations, that I mentioned, and some of the leaders in the — of different countries in the world.

And the proof is that a couple of days ago, President Trump told Prime Minister Netanyahu — and I quote, almost word by word — “Israel cannot stand against the whole world.” Why did he say that? He said so specifically because he was witnessing those demonstrations and change of mood, including the recognition by 150 states, recognition of the state of Palestine, and the two-state solution. So, no doubt that that was the main impact on Trump. Alas, he still hasn't gone enough — far enough to say explicitly that the two-state solution and the liberation of the Palestinian people are a must. And I hope that he will.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what is your sense now of the impact on Israeli society and on your democracy of this peace plan, and the fate of Netanyahu in the future?

OFER CASSIF: First of all, if I may refer to what you said about Israel as a democracy, it pops out to my mind, you know, something that Mahatma Gandhi said. He was asked once what he thought about British civilization, and he said, “I think it's a wonderful idea.” So, if you ask me what I think about the Israeli democracy, I would answer the same: I think it's a wonderful idea. Unfortunately, we are not there yet. That's not a democracy. But perhaps that's for another chat.

But the influence of the change in the international atmosphere does influence the public discourse within Israel, still too little and too late, but it's better than nothing and never. You could see that throughout the demonstrations in the last two years against the so-called war, which I prefer to call a genocide, to the demonstrations that called to release the hostages by sealing a deal that will end the genocide. You could see throughout those two years, and we participated in those demonstrations all the time, since the beginning.

Within those demonstrations, there were two main voices. One voice focused on the fate of the Israeli hostages and soldiers and totally ignored the fate of the Palestinians. The other voice, which we led and was in the beginning in a tiny minority, said that we do, of course, care a lot and want to release the hostages and stop the bloodshed of Israeli soldiers, too, but, obviously, we also emphasized the terrible death toll and destruction, etc., in Gaza and of Palestinians. We were, in the beginning, quite isolated and marginalized, sometimes even physically attacked. But you could see that throughout, as time went by, we began to gain more and more support. So, towards the end, we, I guess, constituted perhaps 20-30% of the demonstrators. So, that, of course, shows that the public discourse and the public opinion within Israel did shift.

You could also see that in different organizations from below, so to speak, by workers, you know, social workers, physicians, professors, teachers, artists and the writers, who began to raise a voice in the last few months against the genocide in Gaza, using the term “genocide” clearly and explicitly, like the very famous writer David Grossman did in an interview to La Repubblica, an Italian newspaper. And no less importantly is that no less than 600 ex-generals in the so-called Israeli security services also signed a petition in which they referred to the ongoing situation in Gaza as ethnic cleansing and war crimes and called to stop that. So, you could see a change there in the public discourse and in the public opinion in Israel.

And, of course, as the demonstrations in the world shift — also grew, it also influenced some of the Israeli discourse. So, in the end, you could see this kind of influence of the international community on the Israeli public.

AMY GOODMAN: During his address to the Knesset Monday, President Trump suggested Netanyahu should be pardoned on corruption charges. This is what he said.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Hey, I have an idea. Mr. President, why don't you give him a pardon? Give him a pardon. You know, whether we like it or not, this has been one of the greatest wartime presidents. This is one — been one of the greatest wartime presidents. And cigars and champagne, who the hell cares about that?

AMY GOODMAN: So, that's President Trump calling for Netanyahu to be pardoned. Can you talk about the significance of this, Ofer Cassif? And for people to understand, many believe that he extended the assault on Gaza to extend his own trial, to put off the end of that trial. And we're not even talking here about the charges in the international court of crimes against humanity.

OFER CASSIF: Absolutely, there's no doubt about it. But we should add to that that Netanyahu is not alone. If you put the all blame on Netanyahu, we miss a great deal of others who are totally blamed for the carnage that took place in Gaza and the sacrifice of the Israeli hostages, as well. Those are combined through — you know, totally, and there's no way to distinguish between them.

So, Netanyahu, on the one hand, is interested only in his own good, just like Trump. I mean, those two psychopaths are good friends. It's not a coincidence. One criminal endorses the other criminal, and whether we are talking about crimes of corruption or other crimes, including crimes against humanity or war crimes, etc., etc. So, as far as Netanyahu himself is concerned, from the very beginning, he was interested in doing whatever possible to stay in power, and, by that, to refrain from being behind bars. That's his only interest. He doesn't care about the well-being of the Israelis, including the hostages, and obviously let alone the well-being of Palestinians.

And because of that, he formed a coalition and a government that in the past he himself refused to form, because he knows exactly who we are dealing with. We are dealing with messianic bigots. We are dealing with little fascists. But Netanyahu decided to join forces with them, to add them, and to base his government and coalition on them, not only, by the way, in the sense of collaborating with bigots like Ben-Gvir and Smotrich — that is to say, to another parties — but to change the Likud party from within. Let's not forget that in the last few years, Netanyahu transformed totally the Likud party. The Likud party, which was never my cup of tea, but the Likud party had, you know, serious politicians, people with values, which I do not share, which I object, but still with values and some respect and commitment to democratic rules of the game. What Netanyahu did, once he understood that he may find himself in prison, is to get rid of those people and to substitute them and add others who are messianic and bigots and racists, no less than Smotrich, Ben-Gvir and their allies.

So, all together, we can see a combination, a constellation, of a prime minister who is accused in serious corruption charges, who's afraid, as a coward, who is afraid of prison, together with messianic, fascist bigots who think that the blood of human beings, Israelis and Palestinians alike, is the red carpet of the Messiah. So, that's — that combination, actually, created the genocide in Gaza that took place and that continued for two years at the expense also of the Israeli hostages and soldiers. That's the key to understand what was going on.

And when President Trump dares say that Netanyahu should get a pardon, first of all, of course, he intervenes in domestic issues which are not his business. But on top of that — and in my view, worse than that — is that he actually speaks the language of a mob, of the mob. He's not Tony Soprano, but he behaves as if he was.

AMY GOODMAN: Ofer Cassif, I want to thank you so much for being with us, member of the Israeli Knesset and the Hadash-Ta'al coalition. On Monday, he and the Palestinian parliamentarian Ayman Odeh were ousted from the Knesset during President Trump's speech, after the two shouted “terrorist” at Trump and held up signs that read “Recognize Palestine.”

OFER CASSIF: I want to correct you, please. We didn't shout anything. We were totally silent. We didn't shout at all. We just held the sign, “Recognize Palestine.” That's it. We didn't shout. We didn't curse. We didn't interrupt. We kept silent.

AMY GOODMAN: And are you going to be allowed back into the Knesset, or were you expelled?

OFER CASSIF: Who knows? At the moment, I am suspended anyway, until the end of December, because I dare say that there was genocide going on. It was forbidden to say that there was a genocide. But I appeal to the Supreme Court. Let's see what's going to happen.

AMY GOODMAN: Well, when we come back, we're going to Physicians for Human Rights Israel in Ramallah to talk about the Gaza doctors who are still being held, imprisoned by Israel, including the pediatrician Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital. And we hope to go to Gaza, which has lost internet connection, but we hope to speak with Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud. This is Democracy Now! Back in 30 seconds.

Governor says bill would cause sudden product shift, sparking debate among chefs, lawmakers and environmentalists

Gavin Newsom vetoed a California bill that was set to ban the sale of cookware and other consumer goods manufactured with Pfas, also known as “forever chemicals”, human-made compounds linked to a range of health issues.

The governor's decision on Monday followed months of debate and advocacy, including from high-profile celebrity chefs such as Thomas Keller and Rachael Ray, who argued that nonstick cookware made with Pfas, when manufactured responsibly, can be safe and effective and urged lawmakers to vote against the proposal.

Newsom said in a statement that the legislation was “well-intentioned” but would affect too broad a swath of products and would result in a “sizable and rapid shift” of cooking products available in the state.

“I am deeply concerned about the impact this bill would have on the availability of affordable options in cooking products,” Newsom wrote, adding that the state “must carefully consider” the consequences of a dramatic shift in available products.

Concerns over the use of Pfas, chemicals used to make cookware and other items non-stick and water-resistant, have grown significantly in recent years. Called “forever chemicals”, because they do not break down naturally, Pfas are used in non-stick cookware, waterproof mascara and dental floss, among other items.

Pfas have been linked to a number of health issues, with some linked to high cholesterol, reproductive issues and cancer. A United States Geological Survey study in 2023 detected the chemicals in almost half the country's tap water.

Under the bill approved by California's legislature, the state by 2030 would have banned the sale or distribution of goods, including cleaning products, cookware, floss, food packaging and ski wax, with “intentionally added” Pfas.

The bill had the support of major environmental groups, as well as opposition from influential figures, such as Ray and Keller, and high-profile chefs who argued it would place an unfair burden on restaurants. Ray argued the focus should be on educating consumers rather than eliminating the products.

“Removing access to these products without providing fact-based context could hurt the very people we're trying to protect,” Ray said.

Ben Allen, the state senator who introduced the legislation, told the Los Angeles Times he planned to keep working on the issue.

“We are obviously disappointed,” he told the newspaper. “We know there are safer alternatives – [but] I understand there were strong voices on both sides on this topic.”

Over the weekend, Newsom also vetoed legislation focused on racial justice, including a bill that would allowed universities to give the descendants of enslaved people preference in admissions preference, while approving funding for a reparations study. He also signed a bill allowing a wide range of family members to care for children if the federal government deports their parents.

Attorneys for Debbie Brockman, released with no charges, deny agent's claim she ‘threw objects' at border patrol car

Attorneys representing a producer for Chicago's WGN television station who was temporarily detained by federal agents last week in Chicago, say the incident “should be alarming and horrifying to every person in this country”.

Debbie Brockman, a US citizen and a WGN employee, was arrested on Friday by federal agents during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) operation in Chicago's Lincoln Square neighborhood. Videos from the scene show Brockman being forced to the ground by two agents before she is handcuffed and put in a van.

At the time, a homeland security official claimed that Brockman “threw objects at border patrol's car” and was “placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer”.

Later on Friday, WGN confirmed that Brockman had been released from federal custody and that no charges had been filed against her.

In a news release issued by attorneys representing Brockman on Tuesday, which was sent to the Guardian as well as several Chicago news outlets, her lawyers disputed the government's account. They said they “adamantly deny any allegation that she assaulted anyone” and that “Brockman was the one who was violently assaulted by federal agents on her way to work” on 10 October.

Her lawyers say that at the time of the arrest, Brockman was “not acting in any professional capacity as an employee for WGN” but that she was just “walking to the bus stop as part of her morning commute when she was attacked by Border Patrol agents.

“Brockman, who is a US Citizen born in this country, was violently detained on Foster Avenue,” the statement continues. “As this occurred, individuals on the street began recording the incident and asked Ms Brockman her name.”

The statement says that she told the bystanders her name and that she worked at WGN, in the hopes that “someone would notify her employer so coworkers would know that she would not be arriving at work that day”, her attorneys said.

According to her lawyers, Brockman was held in federal custody for about seven hours before being released.

“She has not been charged with any crimes and she intends to pursue all legal avenues available to her to vindicate her rights and hold the federal authorities accountable for their actions,” the statement adds.

Brad Thomson, one of her attorneys, added in the statement: “If armed, masked, federal agents are snatching US citizens off the street as they walk to work and throwing them in unmarked vehicles, you can only imagine what these agents must be willing to do to our immigrant neighbors and people who dare to speak out against them.

“Ms Brockman was taken to the ground, battered, handcuffed, and her pants were pulled down exposing her bare buttocks,” Thomson said. “No one should be treated like that in this city, in this country or anywhere else in the world.”

Ice, the Department of Homeland Security, and the US Customs and Border Protection agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Guardian.

Brandon Dawson's gourd that weighs as much as a small sedan was crowned winner after he lost by 6lb last year

A California engineer and gardening enthusiast won the top prize at an annual pumpkin-weighing contest in northern California after growing a giant jack-o'-lantern gourd weighing 2,346lbs (1,064kg).

Brandon Dawson, of Santa Rosa, California, clinched the victory Monday at the 52nd World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off in Half Moon Bay, south of San Francisco.

Dawson pumped his arms in the air and sat his two children on top of the giant pumpkin – roughly the same weight as a small sedan or a large bison – after being crowned this year's winner.

“My mind is kind of racing because I was in this position last year when I lost by 6lbs (3kg),” he said in an interview.

Dawson, a manufacturing engineer at electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive, said he has been growing massive pumpkins for five years. Precision skills acquired at his job helped him with the right watering and sunlight to help his gourd grow, he said.

He said he enjoys getting his children involved in the process.

“We like to spend time out in the patch and watch the thing grow,” Dawson said about his two-year-old son and four-year-old daughter.

“My four-year-old now can really pay attention to the growing process,” especially since the giant pumpkins can grow by 50 to 70lbs (23 to 32 kg) a day, he added.

The pumpkin champ won a $20,000 prize for growing the biggest pumpkin.

Dawson's pumpkin was the runner-up in last year's contest at Half Moon Bay when the winning gourd grown by Minnesota horticulture teacher Travis Gienger came in at 2,471lbs (1,121kg).

Gienger, of Anoka, Minnesota, set a world record at the California contest in 2023 for the heaviest pumpkin when his giant jack-o'-lantern gourd weighed 2,749lbs (1,247kg). Gienger's pumpkin was damaged earlier this season and he couldn't enter this year's contest in California.

Two brothers in England earlier this month broke Gienger's record with a gourd that weighed 2,819lbs (1,278kg).

“Weaponizing the executive branch” to punish free speech “is illegal and wrong,” an open letter from the groups said.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Thousands of nonprofit organizations have penned an open letter condemning President Donald Trump for signing a memorandum indicating his intention to target the free speech of social justice groups under the guise of combating political violence.

The organizations — more than 3,700 in total — noted that the murder of right-wing political commentator Charlie Kirk in September played a key role in the Trump administration's directives. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that the gunman was motivated by left-wing ideology, and has seized upon the killing as an opportunity to conduct a sweeping crackdown on leftists and his political opponents.

The letter from nonprofits suggests that Trump's stated motivations are a ruse, and that his real objective is to suppress dissent.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“We of course unequivocally reject political violence,” the organizations wrote in their open letter. “But we won't mince words. No president – Democrat or Republican – should have the power to punish nonprofit organizations simply because he disagrees with them.”

Such actions are “not about protecting Americans or defending the public interest,” but rather “about using unchecked power to silence opposition and voices he disagrees with,” they continued.

The groups added: 

This attack on nonprofits is not happening in a vacuum, but as a part of a wholesale offensive against organizations and individuals that advocate for ideas or serve communities that the president finds objectionable, and that seek to enforce the rule of law against the federal government. Whether the target is a church, an environmental or good government group, a refugee assistance organization, university, a law firm, or a former or current government official, weaponizing the executive branch to punish their speech or their views is illegal and wrong. It is also an attack on the very notion that government power must serve the people, not those in office.

The letter was published earlier this month, just a couple of weeks after Trump issued an executive order declaring that “antifa” is a domestic terrorist group. Following that declaration, the president released a memo detailing what his administration might do to address the supposed domestic threat.

“Antifa” — short for “anti-fascist” — isn't a real nationwide organization, but rather a political belief. As part of his campaign against “antifa,” Trump said that the administration would be monitoring groups with “anti-American,” “anti-capitalist,” and “anti-Christian” views, as well as those who are “extreme” on issues of “migration, race and gender,” without providing legal specifics.

The memo could pose a direct threat to any nonprofit group that the administration deems to fall into those categories. For example, the directive orders the IRS to “take action to ensure that no tax-exempt entities are directly or indirectly financing political violence or domestic terrorism,” and to refer “such organizations, and the employees and officers of such organizations, to the Department of Justice for investigation and possible prosecution.”

Beyond the open letter condemning Trump's plan to target left-leaning groups, several organizations' leaders have expressed dismay with the transparent attempt to interfere with their free speech rights. 

“President Trump's order mobilizing federal law enforcement to investigate perceived opponents of his administration turns reality on its head,” and “fabricates a nonexistent plot as a pretext to suppress speech and ideas across the U.S. political spectrum,” Human Rights Watch executive director Federico Borello said late last month. 

“A missive from the most powerful man in the world carries so much force that it is, inevitably, a blunt instrument. When the president uses his pen to take aim at anything, it will cause a chilling effect,” wrote Adam Goldstein, Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression vice president of Strategic Initiatives. 

Goldstein added:

What will the overreactions to this new memo look like? Donors ending their support because they don't want to risk an investigation? Groups being denied bank loans or leases because they're on a government list with no way to appeal that determination? Activists going underground because they want to challenge an orthodoxy, hiding their opinions from the places where they would otherwise be challenged in the marketplace of ideas? If this is the plan to save American values, what's the plan to destroy them look like?

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Carrie Romney either fell or jumped, and foul play did not appear to be a factor, officials said

The sister-in-law of Mitt Romney, the former US senator, was found dead on Friday next to a suburban Los Angeles parking garage, according to authorities.

Carrie Romney, 64, evidently either fell or jumped, and foul play did not appear to be a factor in the early stages of the investigation into her death, officials told multiple media outlets on Monday, when her identity became public.

The Los Angeles county medical examiner's office indicated that Carrie Romney's exact cause of death had initially been listed as “deferred” while the results of toxicology tests that could take months remain pending.

Attention generated by Carrie Romney's death prompted her brother-in-law – once a presidential candidate and Massachusetts governor – to issue a statement lamenting her.

“Our family is heartbroken by the loss of Carrie, who brought warmth and love to all our lives,” said a statement from Mitt Romney reported by People. “We ask for privacy during this difficult time.”

Carrie Romney's body was discovered near a shopping center parking garage in Valencia, California, at about 8.30 Friday morning, officials said. Authorities said her car had also been spotted at the garage.

She had married Mitt Romney's older brother, George “Scott” Romney, in November of 2016. Scott Romney, 81, a prominent attorney in Michigan who is also the father of the former Republican National Committee chair Ronna Romney McDaniel, had filed to divorce Carrie – his third wife – in June after eight years of marriage, as the Daily Mail reported.

Mitt Romney, 78, ran for the US presidency twice after serving as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. He lost the Republican nomination to the late John McCain in 2008 and then clinched it four years later.

Both of those elections were won by Barack Obama, the last Democratic candidate to win consecutive presidential terms.

Mitt Romney then won a six-year term as one of Utah's US senators beginning in 2019.

He opted against seeking re-election to that post after becoming the only Republican who voted to convict Donald Trump at both of his impeachment trials during his first presidency.

At the time, Mitt Romney said he was leaving the US Senate to give younger generations the chance to “step up” and “shape the world they're going to live in”.

Mitt Romney did not support Trump as the latter man won a second presidency during the November 2024 election. But he also did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, whom Trump defeated after losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden.

Former president urges support for the ballot measure Democrats say could add up to five US House seats

In a new ad released on Tuesday, Barack Obama urged California voters to support Proposition 50, a November ballot measure that could reshape the state's congressional map and deliver up to five new Democratic seats in the US House.

“California, the whole nation is counting on you,” the former two-term Democratic president says in the video. “Democracy is on the ballot.”

On 4 November, California voters head to the polls to decide whether to approve Proposition 50. The measure, if approved, would authorize state lawmakers to redraw the state's congressional districts.

Proposition 50, spearheaded by California's governor, Gavin Newsom, and other Democratic leaders in the state, is designed to add up to five Democratic seats in the US House and was crafted in response to a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas earlier this year where state lawmakers redrew their congressional map to add five new districts that would favor Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, at the behest of Donald Trump.

Newsom signed California's redistricting proposal in August, sending it to the voters. At the time, Newsom said that California was “neutralizing” Texas's map.

Obama first voiced his support for the effort over the summer.

“Over the long term, we shouldn't have political gerrymandering in America, just a fair fight between Republicans and Democrats based on who's got better ideas,” he said in August. “But since Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House and gerrymandering in the middle of a decade to try and maintain the House despite their unpopular policies, I have tremendous respect for how Governor Newsom has approached this. He's put forward a smart, measured approach in California, designed to address a very particular problem at a very particular moment in time.”

In the new ad, Obama warned that “Republicans want to steal enough seats in Congress to rig the next election and wield unchecked power for two more years.” But with Proposition 50, he added: “You can stop Republicans in their tracks.

“Prop 50 puts our elections back on a level playing field, preserves independent redistricting over the long term, and lets the people decide,” Obama said. “Return your ballot today.”

Newsom shared the video of Obama on his social media on Tuesday morning, captioning it: “Listen to @barackobama.”

A recent Emerson College Polling survey of California voters found that 51% of registered voters planned to vote in favor of Proposition 50, whereas 34% said they planned to vote no. The survey found that 15% said that they were undecided.

In September, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former Republican governor of California, urged voters to reject Proposition 50.

            What makes a passport “powerful”? Well, a clear measure is travel openness, the ability to slip into destinations around the world with a breezy wave of your passport, no visa required.
    


            The Henley Passport Index is one of several rankings measuring passport potency in this regard and, for the first time in its 20-year history, the US passport has fallen out of its top 10 list altogether.
    


            Three Asian passports now command the top of the leaderboard: Singapore, with visa-free access to 193 destinations worldwide; South Korea, with access to 190; and Japan, with 189.
    


            The United States, meanwhile, is down in 12th place in the latest quarterly ranking, tied with Malaysia.
    


            Citizens of both nations enjoy visa-free access to 180 of the 227 countries and territories tracked by the index, which was created by the London-based global citizenship and residence advisory firm Henley & Partners, and uses exclusive data from the International Air Transport Association. And because Henley counts multiple countries with the same score as a single spot in its standings, there are actually 36 countries that outrank the US on the list.
    


These are the North American airports that travelers find the most satisfying



            Back in 2014, the US held the No.1 spot, and in July this year it was still clinging onto the top 10. So what's behind this further descent?
    


            It's down to a series of access changes. In April, Brazil withdrew visa-free access for citizens from the US, Canada and Australia due to a lack of reciprocity. China has been introducing more welcoming policies, offering visa exemptions for dozens of mostly European countries, including Germany and France, but the US hasn't made the cut.
    


            Papua New Guinea and Myanmar have also tweaked their entry policies, which boosted other passports' rankings while further eroding that of the US. The final blow, the latest report from the index says, was Somalia's launch of a new eVisa system and Vietnam's exclusion of the US from its latest visa-free additions.
    


            “The declining strength of the US passport over the past decade is more than just a reshuffle in rankings — it signals a fundamental shift in global mobility and soft power dynamics,” said Christian H. Kaelin, chair of Henley & Partners, in a statement. “Nations that embrace openness and cooperation are surging ahead, while those resting on past privilege are being left behind.”
    


            The UK passport, which once held the top spot on the index in 2015, has also fallen to its lowest-ever position, dropping two places since July, from 6th to 8th.
    


            During this past decade of decline for the UK and the US, China has been making a sharp ascent on the rankings, climbing from 94th place in 2015 to 64th in 2025, gaining visa-free access to 37 more destinations in that time.
    


            The Henley Passport Index report points to China's recent moves — granting visa-free access to Russia, new agreements with the Gulf states, South America and several European countries — as examples of Beijing's ongoing strategy of increased openness.
    


            The UAE is another one of the biggest success stories on the index, having risen 34 places in the past decade, from No. 42 to 8th place.
    


            At the opposite end of the list, at No. 106, Afghanistan remains locked in bottom place, with visa-free access to just 24 destinations, two fewer than at the start of this year. Syria is at No. 105 (with 26 destinations) and Iraq is at No. 104 (with 29 destinations).
    


            That's a yawning mobility gap of 169 destinations between the top- and bottom-ranked passports.
    


            Commenting in July 2025 on the ailing performance of the US passport in the index, Richard Quest, CNN Business editor-at-large, noted how travel openness was being affected by the introduction of new restrictions such as ESTAs in the European Union and in the UK.
    


            “Can we make a linkage, if you will, to immigration policies of the Trump administration?” said Quest. “Yes, you probably can, at some level, say there is a direct relation between one and the other.”
    


            However, he added, the passports at the top of the leaderboard are still highly desirable with very few restrictions overall. “There are certainly citizenships that give greater access and availability to travel,” said Quest, and there are wealthy individuals who seek to obtain them through investment schemes, such as the $5 million “gold card” proposed by Trump in February.  Henley & Partners advises its clients upon just these kind of residence and citizenship opportunities.
    


            “But for the average person, it's not a jot of difference,” said Quest. “You've got your passport, you've got where you are. Learn and live with it.”
    


Traveling to the European Union is about to get more complicated. Here's what you need to know



            The Henley list is one of several indexes created by financial firms to rank global passports according to the access they provide to their citizens.
    


            Arton Capital's Passport Index takes into consideration the passports of 193 United Nations member countries and six territories — Taiwan, Macao, Hong Kong, Kosovo, the Palestinian territories and the Vatican. Territories annexed to other countries are excluded.
    


            It's also updated in real-time throughout the year and its data is gathered by close monitoring of individual governments' portals.
    


            Arton's Global Passport Power Rank 2025 puts the United Arab Emirates in the top spot, with a visa-free/visa-on-arrival score of 179. Second place is held by Singapore and Spain, each with a score of 175.

Editor's note: The story has been updated to include comments from the Odesa mayor.

President Volodymyr Zelensky stripped Odesa Mayor Hennadiy Trukhanov of his Ukrainian citizenship after years of allegations that he possessed a Russian passport. 

"The presence of Russian citizenship has been confirmed for certain individuals. The decree has been signed," the president said on Oct. 14, not naming the Odesa mayor by name.

The decision would effectively oust Trukhanov from his post. The mayor said he plans to contest the decision in court.

Ukraine's Security Service have confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Zelensky revoked Ukrainian citizenship of Trukhanov, ballet dancer Serhii Polunin, and former Ukrainian politician Oleg Tsaryov.

Polunin and Tsaryov, both living in Russia, have been publicly supporting Russia's war against Ukraine. Trukhanov, who lives in Ukraine, hasn't.

"I will appeal the decision to deprive me of Ukrainian citizenship in the Supreme Court. And, if that is not enough, then in the European Court of Human Rights," Trukhanov wrote following the decision.

According to the Security Service, Trukhanov has an active Russian passport, issued in 2015, a year after Russia launched its war against Ukraine and occupied the Crimean Peninsula.

The news came amid days of speculation that the president might take such a step against the mayor, while Trukhanov warned of "provocations" and denied holding a Russian passport.

Reports that Trukhanov held Russian citizenship have circulated since 2014. Ukrainian journalists said, citing obtained documents, that the Odesa mayor possessed such a passport in the past.

After repeatedly denying the fact, Trukhanov had his passport annulled through a Russian court in 2017, due to alleged procedural violations. He claimed to have learned about the passport online.

In 2018, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) published a copy of Trukhanov's Russian passport and offshore documents, showing he was registered as living in the city of Sergiev Posad in Moscow Oblast.

Last year, activist Serhii Sternenko published documents allegedly indicating that Trukhanov still holds Russian citizenship. The data also suggested that a person with the same name as Odesa's mayor applied for a Russian bank account just weeks before Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) previously said it had found no evidence of Trukhanov's Russian citizenship.

On Oct. 13, a petition was launched urging the president to strip Trukhanov of his Ukrainian citizenship. It reached the required 25,000 signatures within hours. 

According to the petition, the Odesa mayor's alleged dual citizenship "raises national security concerns and damages public confidence in local leadership."

"I'm supported by the majority of Odesa's population, and someone really doesn't want to see me as the mayor of the city," Trukhanov told the Kyiv Independent, hinting at the president.

Trukhanov, 60, has served as mayor of the southern port city of Odesa since 2014. He has been reelected twice. Despite a political career marked by multiple scandals, including graft allegations, he has so far managed to avoid losing office.

For years, Trukhanov has been widely seen as a Russian sympathizer. However, after the start of the full-scale invasion, he rebranded himself as a Ukrainian patriot, yet continued to resist the removal of Soviet-era monuments and renaming streets in Odesa as part of the decommunization efforts aimed at breaking ties with Russia's imperial legacy.

In 2018 Trukhanov was charged with embezzling Hr 92 million ($2.2 million) by purchasing Odesa's Krayan factory building for the city government at an inflated price.

An Odesa court acquitted him amid allegations of political pressure on the judges in 2019. An appellate court canceled the verdict and re-opened the case in 2021. Trukhanov was twice arrested in the case before being released on bail.

According to political analyst Ihor Reiterovych, confirmation by the president of Trukhanov's Russian citizenship would prompt political issues, since it "obviously dates back much earlier."

“(Trukhanov) is, of course, tainted. But when you have a mayor like that, you can always keep him on a short leash, and he won't make any moves against the central government,” Reiterovych told the Kyiv Independent. 

Unlike some other outspoken mayors, Trukhanov hardly ever voiced criticism towards the central government in light of the trend of mounting pressure on local authorities. 

In the past week, Zelensky has openly criticized local officials, suggesting upcoming staff reshuffles.

The move to terminate Trukhanov's citizenship also comes just weeks after a devastating flood hit Odesa in late September, killing at least 10 people. Local authorities faced criticism over their handling of the disaster's aftermath.

When asked about the emergency, Zelensky replied emotionally on Oct.11, saying: "Everything must be done consistently and fairly. And we will deal with the situation in Odesa as well."

"I wouldn't rule out that, in this context, the authorities simply decided to seize the moment — using a formal pretext to apply additional pressure on local government representatives," Reiterovych said.

"There have long been rumors that the central government wants to gain, or at least tighten, control over key cities — including Odesa."

Stripping Ukrainian officials of their citizenship is not a new practice, and it has been mired in controversy.

Ukraine's Constitution bans dual citizenship but guarantees that no Ukrainian citizen can be deprived of their citizenship. At the same time, it gives the president the power to grant or terminate it.

Loss or termination of Ukrainian citizenship can serve as grounds for removing a person from office, including an elected one such as mayor, according to the law. In such a case, the mayor's duties are transferred to the city council secretary — a position currently held by Ihor Koval, a representative of Zelensky's Servant of the People party.

Under martial law, the president also has the authority to establish a city-level military administration.

Later in the evening, Zelensky confirmed he would appoint a head of the military administration, saying that Odesa "deserves greater protection and stronger support."Too many security issues in Odesa have gone unanswered for far too long," the president said in his address.

ANKARA, October 14. /TASS/. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stressed the importance of ensuring a lasting ceasefire in Gaza, warning that Israel would face serious consequences if it "returns to genocidal actions" in the enclave.

"First of all, it is essential that this ceasefire remains stable and that no violations occur. As you know, Israel does not have a very good record when it comes to respecting ceasefire agreements. This situation compels us to be more vigilant and meticulous. Turkey, the United States and other nations are determined to help preserve the truce. Israel knows the cost of returning to genocide will be high. We make this clear at every opportunity," Erdogan told reporters from his press pool after returning from Egypt.

He also remarked that "many [Gaza] agreements reached in the past were never implemented." "Unfortunately, Israel's inconsistency and the lack of [international] determination have contributed to this. Now, however, the resolve has strengthened, and unity has deepened. We saw this shared stance again at the summit in Egypt. I believe that [US President Donald] Trump will continue to lead the process he began," Erdogan added.

New York Attorney General Letitia James spoke at a rally for New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani on Oct. 13, marking her first public appearance after being indicted on federal fraud charges.

The event, in the city's Washington Heights neighborhood, also included remarks from New York Liberty guard Natasha Cloud and the television personality and podcaster known as The Kid Mero, kicked off the final stretch of Mamdani's campaign ahead of the Nov. 4 election.

MOSCOW, October 14. /TASS/. Russia continues its special military operation in Ukraine due to a lack of options but remains ready to resolve the conflict peacefully, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a briefing.

"Russia is ready for a peaceful settlement. Russia continues the special military operation at the moment due to a lack of alternatives," he pointed out, commenting on French President Emmanuel Macron's remarks who had made an allegation about Moscow's "military stubbornness" and threatened that Russia would have to pay "a price" unless it "returned to the negotiating table."

"One way or another, Russia will safeguard its interests and achieve its goals," Peskov emphasized.

Russia has repeatedly stressed that it would prefer to resolve the Ukraine conflict through peaceful political and diplomatic means, ensuring equal and indivisible security for all countries in Europe. However, the Kiev regime, actively backed by the West, keeps finding excuses to reject a fair settlement.

Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said on Oct. 14 that he is willing to strengthen ties with the U.S. as long as the move aligns with Belarus's interests.

The comments come amid intensifying dialogue between the Trump administration and Minsk, a key ally of Russia during its all-out war against Ukraine.

"We will wait for their big proposals, for a big deal, as they like to say. They love these big deals," Lukashenko said at a government meeting on the U.S.-Belarus relations, according to the Belta state news agency.

"We are ready to make a big deal with them."

Lukashenko did not specify the focus of the potential agreement but voiced readiness to participate in the U.S.-led diplomatic efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.

The Belarusian dictator also noted that both Minsk and Washington have their own questions and requests regarding mutual ties, adding that he views U.S. President Donald Trump's proposals as "absolutely normal."

"But our interests must also be taken into account."

The U.S. in September helped to negotiate the release of 52 political prisoners of different nationalities held in Belarus, while Washington agreed to lift sanctions on the Belarusian state airline, Belavia.

Trump's envoy, Keith Kellogg, later revealed that the goal of the renewed dialogue with Belarus is to "ensure lines of communication" with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of a broader push to end the war in Ukraine.

Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994, allowed Russian forces to launch attacks on Ukraine from Belarusian territory at the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. As a result, Belarus has faced massive Western sanctions and diplomatic isolation.

The military monitoring group Belarusian Hajun was an open-source intelligence project that tracked Russian and Belarusian troop movements and other military activity in Belarus.

Polunin previously worked with the the Royal Ballet in London and later as the director of the Sevastopol Opera and Ballet Theater in Russian-occupied Crimea from December 2019 until the summer of 2024.



"Poisonous smoke floats over the city, which can be seen even from Stary Krym (25 kilometers away)," local media reported. 

The comments come ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels on Oct. 15, chaired by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

The IMF forecasted 2% growth in 2025 and 4.5% in 2026, unaltered from its April 2025 projections. 





Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha urged U.N. member states to condemn Russia's Oct. 14 attack on a U.N. aid convoy in Kherson Oblast, which left one truck destroyed and another badly damaged.



Speaking about past negotiations with Moscow, Trump said U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff "had no idea about Russia, had no idea about Putin too much" at the time.



The proposal, initiated by the Russian National Automobile Union, comes amid a deepening supply crisis exacerbated by Ukraine's escalating drone strikes on Russian oil infrastructure.



"Dozens of (strike drones) were launched somewhere. Can you imagine?! I look and it's flying. Where will it fly, and what will it do, what is it targeting? It's simply hopeless," the woman said.

Weaving through a pack of masked protesters with her phone held aloft, a slight woman in her sixties pushes herself to the front of a colourful crowd assembled in Portland, Oregon.

Pam Hemphill, formerly known as “Maga Granny”, has come to the city to document immigration protests and to prove Donald Trump is wrong about Antifa, the Left-wing group he designated a terrorist organisation.

“This is my second time here. Don't you have a right to stand up and protest? I don't care what side, you want to make sure that both sides are able to do it,” she told The Telegraph.

“I don't want to see that you're violent, but I'm going to find out for myself, because they lie [Trump administration] about everything,” Hemphill said of her desire to travel to Oregon to observe Antifa protesters in person.

Convicted for taking part in the January 6 insurrection, the 72-year-old retired substance abuse counsellor from Idaho was among the more than 1,500 people whom Mr Trump pardoned earlier this year for storming the Capitol.

Some 140 law enforcement officers were injured in the furore while one died the day after the riot.

The president's sweeping clemency shuttered the largest investigation in US justice department history, including more than 300 pending cases.

After pleading guilty, Hemphill served her full 60-day sentence in prison before walking free in September 2022.

In a remarkable about-turn, Hemphill refused the presidential pardon, insisting she was guilty and had been brainwashed into taking part in the insurrection.

She proudly hangs a framed letter sent to her by Mike Pence, the former vice-president, in which he applauds her for turning down the pardon. Mr Pence fell out with the president after he refused to overturn the 2020 election result.

“I was guilty. How are you going to take a pardon when you're guilty?” she said.

“How do you live with that when you get away with a sentence when you know you did wrong?

“Plus, I didn't want to be a part of his narrative that the DoJ [department of justice] was weaponised against us. The DoJ was not weaponised against me, and I did the research. All of them were getting due process. We all got due process.”

Today, she compares her time in Maga to that of a cult. Before her Left-wing conversion, she posed with a toy gun for a photograph captioned: “On my way to Washington DC January 6th!”

She travelled to Portland for a second time, eager to disprove the president's characterisation of it as a “lawless hellhole”.

Protesters in the city are holding nightly protests outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) centre in response to the president's crackdown on illegal migrants.

To combat the disorder, Mr Trump said he was sending National Guard troops “to protect war-ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists”. The deployment of troops has so far been blocked by the courts.

Hemphill insists protests have remained civilised.

“They're [Antifa] not throwing eggs on cars or threatening to kill anyone. It's so funny because when you see it, it does not match anything they're [the Trump administration] saying.”

Hemphill suggested all Biden-voting Democrats were being labelled Antifa because they are enemies of Mr Trump.

“Maga gave me the name Pam-Tifa. I am Antifa [under their definition] because we know there's 81 million people that voted for Biden.”

Of the situation in Oregon, she said: “You have your little bad apples but it's not warranting the National Guard.”

Hemphill accused the Trump administration of using extreme language to paint a picture that was not real.

She said: “It's a theatre here. This is all this is. It is a theatre because they're going to show you the smoke bombs, because ‘everybody's violent', and they got to get them away, right?”

Hemphill accused the administration of being blinded by the accounts of Right-wing influencers who have descended on Portland.

“Do you know why we have a divorce court? Because there's two sides to every story,” she said.

Last week, conservative influencers were invited to the White House to tell Mr Trump how they had been harassed in Portland. Nick Sortor, a Maga influencer with 1.2 million followers, was recently arrested by the Portland police department and charged with disorderly conduct. The charge was later dropped.

“With knowing both sides, you could then make a choice and be informed. They're not going to bring me [to the White House]. They know who I am by now. I've got the videos and I'll share. They don't want to. They love this picture right now.”

Hemphill slipped into the crowd of misfits that had gathered outside the city's detention centre on Thursday evening, her partner acting as a de-facto bodyguard.

Small in stature, she was easy to lose. But to the eagle-eyed, a gold bracelet adorned with a string of rubber bullets was her defining marker, a symbol of her newfound defiance.

“One of the protesters made it for me. Yeah, that's worth more than diamonds,” she said.

“I'm going around. I'm meeting everybody, asking questions. They welcome me. They brought me food and hugs. I'm letting people know that I'm going to report the facts, I'm not going to lie for you, and if you become violent, I'm leaving.”

Investigative journalist Andy Ngo fled a group of violent Antifa protesters in Portland, Oregon; crying out for assistance, his heart pounding, and in fear for his life, he told Jan Jekielek, host of EpochTV's “American Thought Leaders” for a show that will air Oct. 14 at 9 p.m. ET.

“I didn't know I could run that fast,” Ngo said, “I'm running through downtown, sprinting, screaming for help, and nobody helps.”

Global markets fell as investors grew uneasy over mounting tensions between the U.S. and China ahead of talks between the two countries aimed at striking a durable trade deal.

Wall Street futures pointed lower after U.S. markets ended sharply higher yesterday.

Dow futures were down 0.6 per cent, S&P 500 futures dropped 1.02 per cent and Nasdaq futures were 1.34 per cent lower as of 7:40 a.m. ET. 

TSX futures were in positive territory after Canada's main stock market was closed for holiday yesterday. 

On Wall Street, markets are watching earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., Johnson & Johnson, BlackRock Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co.

“If one looks at the recent history of export controls and charges for ships docking in ports, then it's been largely interpreted as a path towards negotiation rather than a fresh outbreak of hostilities on the trade front between the U.S. and China,” Investec chief economist Philip Shaw said.

“So yes, there is uncertainty, but you've had a huge rally, not just in U.S. stocks, but a lot of global indices as well. And while there are still some question marks over U.S.-China trade friction, I'd interpret the latest sell-off as a bit of a correction rather than a huge stepping-up of investor uncertainty,” he said.

Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.85 per cent in morning trading. Britain's FTSE 100 slipped 0.43 per cent, Germany's DAX declined 1.28 per cent and France's CAC 40 gave back 1.03 per cent.	

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei closed 2.58 per cent lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.73 per cent.

Oil prices reversed early gains and fell amid uncertainty about trade tensions between the U.S. and China and as the International Energy Agency flagged weaker fundamentals.

            As a former president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy has been behind many doors closed to the average French citizen.
    


            On October 21, as the cold steel of his jail cell door clangs behind him, he'll be in one room to which few would covet entry.
    


            The former French leader was convicted in September of criminal conspiracy in what the court heard was a scheme to finance his 2007 presidential campaign with funds from Libya in exchange for diplomatic favors. He was sentenced to five years in prison but is likely to be released on parole partway through.
    


            The former president intends to appeal, but in the meantime is expected to occupy a cell either in solitary confinement or in the so-called “VIP wing” of La Santé prison complex in Paris, the only prison in the French capital.
    


            That wing is reserved for prisoners considered unsuited to be among the prison's general population, usually out of fears for their own safety. They could be politicians, former police officers, members of far-right organizations or those tied to Islamist terror groups, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.
    


            Sitting opposite an old people's home in a residential corner of Paris' 14th arrondissement, La Santé's unassuming presence is only given away by the occasional wailing siren as prisoners are transported to and from the site.
    


            In winter months, the faces of inmates can sometimes be seen peering out from behind the barred windows of the prison through the bare branches of the tree-lined avenue. Occasionally their stares are returned by a package lobbed over the walls by a passerby, as CNN witnessed.
    


            Over the past century and a half, the walls of La Santé have deprived many famous French men of their freedom.
    


            One of the world's most wanted terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, aka “Carlos the Jackal,” spent time in La Santé, as did Jacques Mesrine, a notorious murderer and bank robber of the 1970s whose criminal career was portrayed in a 2008 film starring Vincent Cassel. Mesrine famously also broke out from La Santé's walls.
    


            Other well-known inmates include Alfred Dreyfus, the Jewish army captain at the center of the late 19th-century Dreyfus Affair, in which antisemitism saw him wrongly convicted of treason, and more recently Alexandre Benalla, an aide and former bodyguard of Emmanuel Macron sentenced to jail time after he was filmed beating Yellow Vest protesters.
    


            Sarkozy won't even be the prison's first world leader. Manuel Noriega, the former dictator of Panama, spent time there following his extradition from the United States after the American invasion that deposed him.
    


            Unsurprisingly, Sarkozy isn't happy about heading to prison.
    


            “If they absolutely want me to sleep in prison, I will sleep in prison. But with my head held high. I am innocent,” he said after his sentencing hearing, his voice boiling with anger.
    


            “This injustice is a scandal,” he continued, with his wife, the singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, at his side.
    


            She's likely to be one of the first former supermodels to enter the prison if she pays him a visit.
    


            But  behind its high brick walls, La Santé is no dungeon.
    


            “It's alright, La Santé, it's like an Ibis Hotel,” Marco Mouly, a former prisoner in the prison's VIP wing told BFMTV in a 2022 documentary, referring to a popular European budget hotel chain.
    


            Built in 1867, with a distinctive radial layout designed to give prisoners the feeling of being under constant surveillance, the prison recently underwent a four-year renovation and modernization program, reopening in 2019.
    


            If Sarkozy is housed in the VIP wing, one of 18 identical cells will be allotted to him, each of which boasts a cooking hob, fridge, television, shower and toilet, as well as a fixed telephone line allowing prisoners to call certain authorized numbers.
    


            The cells measure nine square meters (nearly 97 square foot), no bigger than normal cells, although residents in this special wing aren't required to share a cell, typically out of concern for their safety.
    


            Still, a stay is far from comfortable, those who've experienced it say.
    


            “The problem is the noise,” Didier Schuller, a former civil servant and politician held for several weeks in La Santé told BFMTV in 2022. “At night, you're woken up by people shouting.”
    


Former FBI Director James Comey to be arraigned Wednesday



            A former policeman interviewed by the broadcaster described the insults shouted non-stop by prisoners on other wings when they learned he had arrived as an inmate.
    


            There's little chance that Sarkozy won't attract similar attention behind bars. And despite his vow to appeal his conviction, his liberty may seem a long way off on that first night locked up.
    


            “You know when you're going in,” Patrick Balkany, former mayor of Levallois-Peret, northwest of Paris, told BFMTV of La Santé, where he served several months for tax evasion before being released on health grounds.  “You don't know when you're coming out.”

Greig Mordue is an associate professor and the ArcelorMittal Dofasco Chair in Advanced Manufacturing Policy in the faculty of engineering at McMaster University.

Canada's auto industry is struggling. The challenges presented by the current U.S. administration have only brought visibility and urgency to its decades-long drift.

Even so, it has not yet collapsed. The reason does not reside in the $50-billion-plus in tax credits and grants that Canada's policy makers have poured into it over the past few years. Rather, Canada's auto industry endures because of industrial policy measures it took decades prior. Now we must draw upon that playbook once more.

In the early 1960s, Canada's auto industry was also under pressure. The economy was sputtering, car sales dropped and automotive employment cratered. Tariffs of 17.5 per cent on imported vehicles meant that almost every car sold in Canada was made here. Canadians had few options and paid more for the ones they had.

The government responded with a royal commission. Ultimately, the work of its chair, Vincent Bladen, led to the 1965 Canada-U.S. Auto Pact. It removed tariffs on vehicles and parts if automakers built one car in Canada for every one they sold here and performed value-added work equal to 60 per cent of sales. Failure to meet both conditions triggered an import tariff of 9.1 per cent.

Opinion: Carney must remember: Trump's sound and fury signify nothing

Politics Insider: Trump's Lutnick dismisses possibility of tariff-free auto deal for Canada

The Auto Pact neatly balanced incentives and penalties, leading to a three-fold increase in vehicle production within a decade. More importantly, it successfully tethered Canada's automotive industry to the U.S., which in the 1960s was home to the world's most successful automakers.

By the early 1980s, though, the landscape shifted. North America faced recession and the OPEC oil crises caused gasoline prices to soar. Vehicle sales plummeted and employment in the sector collapsed. Meanwhile, Japanese automakers flooded the market.

Canada initially chose punitive measures against the Japanese upstarts, including imposing port blockages and negotiating limits on Japanese auto exports. Eventually, these “sticks” were complemented by a collection of “carrots”: duty remission schemes and (by today's standards) modest grants to encourage Japanese production in Canada.

By the mid 1980s, this approach ushered in Japanese assembly plants in Canada, including Honda and Toyota. Once again, Canada had linked its auto industry to the world's most successful players.

Today, Toyota and Honda produce about 900,000 vehicles in Canada each year - around three-quarters of total national production. The Detroit Three account for about a quarter.

Canada established a practice of skillfully balancing incentives and restrictions to connect its automotive sector to the most successful, ascendent players.

Which brings us to 2025.

Today, Canada's policy makers encounter new dynamics. The U.S. market is still proximate and large. However, the U.S. administration's aggressively insular turn results in Canada's assembly plants struggling to gain mandates for production.

On top of that, our policy makers are obliged to confront the reality that the world's most dynamic automakers are no longer from the U.S. or Japan. They are in China. It is the global leader in electric vehicles (EVs) and new technologies. For example, my own research shows that over the past decade, China has generated automotive patents at five times the U.S. rate and 150 times Canada's.

So far, Canada's response to the decline of the U.S. and the ascendence of China has been limited to sticks: tariffs of 100 per cent on Chinese EVs and batteries, dutifully mirroring the U.S. approach. The effect: Canadian consumers have limited access to affordable EVs. It also means Canada's 60-year practice of drafting its automotive manufacturing sector to the industry's most successful, innovative actors is in jeopardy.

Canada still has choices; options that may be revealed through its current 60-day review of the Electric Vehicle Availability Standard (EVAS), which until last month mandated 100-per-cent zero-emission vehicle sales in Canada by 2035, and its commitment to review its 100-per-cent tariff on Chinese vehicles on the one-year anniversary of its enactment (this month).

With this, pressing questions emerge: Is a policy of supporting U.S. automakers that have almost abandoned Canadian production still defensible? Can Canada afford to ignore China, the world's ascendent automaking power? Can Canada revive tactics from the 1960s and 1980s to sustain its industry? Should Canada simply wait for a possible U.S. policy shift in 2029 - and if it does, will there be an industry left to save?

Canada's automotive industry is at a crossroads. If it delays doing anything until 2029, the window for a potential Chinese investment may close. Should the U.S. and China reach a trade agreement, Chinese automotive investment interests will shift to the U.S. and Canada will be bypassed.

            Three days after being excluded from a press conference fronted by Taliban's foreign minister in India, women journalists took their seats in a powerful show of force to question him about the social exclusion of Afghan women.
    


            An image from Reuters news agency shows Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi facing a row of women journalists inside the Afghan Embassy in Delhi on Sunday.
    


            It was a rare audience for the Taliban minister representing an all-male government that over four years has slowly suffocated the freedoms and dreams of Afghan women and girls.
    


            “Why are you doing this in Afghanistan? When will they be allowed to go back and get the right to education?” asked prominent independent journalist Smita Sharma.
    


            Muttaqi's week-long visit to India is the first foreign diplomatic trip by a top Taliban leader since the hardline Islamist group seized power in 2021.
    


            The trip was seen as a reset of relations between Delhi and Kabul, part of the Taliban's attempts to be accepted as a legitimate government.
    


            Only men were invited to Muttaqi's first news conference on Friday, which was described by many Indian reporters, press groups and opposition politicians as an affront to India's democratic principles and press freedom.
    


            The Press Club of India “strongly condemned” the exclusion of women journalists, and called on the Indian government to “ensure that no foreign power is permitted to dictate the terms of engagement with the Indian press.”
    


            The Editors Guild of India called the decision “blatant gender discrimination on Indian soil.”
    


            India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said it “had no involvement in the press interaction” held by the Afghan foreign minister, local media reported.
    


            The government's response only deepened the criticism that the world's largest democracy was apparently capitulating to the Taliban, which has been diplomatically isolated over its treatment of women and girls.
    


            “Our first response was obviously outrage. But the real thing we had hoped for was that the Indian government would at least criticize it and say something about it,” said Suhasini Haider, Diplomatic Editor for The Hindu newspaper, who attended the second press conference.
    


            “It was also about a precedent, the idea that the Taliban's representative — and it's a government that's not recognized by India — could come to Delhi and host a press conference without women, wouldn't become a precedent for future interactions.”
    


            Afghanistan remains the only country in the world that prohibits girls and women from getting general education at secondary and higher levels. The government dictates how women must dress, where they can and cannot go, and with whom they must go – for example, they must have a male guardian with them to travel.
    


            The ban is part of a wide-ranging crackdown on women's rights by the Taliban, who UN groups and activists have accused of presiding over “gender apartheid.”
    


            In July this year, the International Criminal Court sought arrest warrants for two of the top Taliban leaders, citing the persecution of women and girls as evidence of crimes against humanity.
    


            In the Sunday press conference, foreign minister Muttaqi cited a “technical issue” to justify why women journalists were absent from the initial press event.
    


            “It was organised on a short notice. (There was) a short list of journalists that were invited… It was more of a technical issue but there was no other problems,” Muttaqi told reporters. “Our colleagues had decided to send the invitation to a specific list of journalists. There were no other intentions other than that.”
    


            Haider believes that public pressure following the first conference “really ignited something, and so it was really the Taliban that decided the bad press wasn't worth it.”
    


            Women journalists were invited inside the embassy alongside their male colleagues to ask questions and were not required to wear head coverings. Haider said they acknowledged there was no reason to have kept women out of the initial briefing.
    


A two-day internet blackout shows even the Taliban can't turn back time



            In a “moment of media solidarity,” Haider said male reporters cleared the first few rows of the press conference for their female colleagues, so it was mostly women front and center.
    


            Muttaqi faced hard questions as to why Afghan girls and women were barred from schools and the workforce.
    


            “We have 10 million students attending schools and other educational institutes, of which, 2.8 million are women and girls. In religious seminaries, this educational opportunity is available all the way to the graduation levels – the highest levels,” Muttaqi responded.
    


            The Taliban leader said, “there are certain limitations in specific parts, but that does not mean that we oppose education.”
    


            Haider said the minister's answers were “obviously very well-rehearsed lies.”
    


            “We knew it for a fact, and yet he continued to repeat that statement,” she said.
    


            Russia remains the only foreign government that has formally recognized the Taliban and diplomats have said steps toward recognition require a change of course on women's rights.
    


Dozens killed in Pakistan-Afghanistan clashes in worst fighting since Taliban returned to power



            Though India has upgraded diplomatic ties with Afghanistan, it is yet to recognize the Taliban government.
    


            Analysts have said the Taliban's high-level visit to India signals a change in ties, in part, as a counterbalance to souring relations with neighbor Pakistan.
    


            After Muttaqi met Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar Friday, India announced it would upgrade its diplomatic mission in Kabul to an embassy, which was closed when the Taliban recaptured Kabul in 2021.
    


            The trip by the United Nations-sanctioned Muttaqi was only made possible after the UN Security Council granted him a travel waiver.
    


            Haider said the visit was meant to normalize relations between the Taliban government and India.
    


            “There are many very good reasons to engage the Taliban,” she said.
    


            “The question is, how far are you willing to go down the path of normalization and the path of diplomatic upgradation, and then finally, recognition, before you feel your principles have been compromised?”

 What Kind of Change Is Coming to Iran?

 Karim Sadjadpour



For the first time in nearly four decades, Iran is on the cusp of a change of leadership—and maybe even of regime. As Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's reign nears its end, a 12-day war in June laid bare the fragility of the system he built. Israel battered Iranian cities and military installations, paving the way for the United States to drop 14 bunker-busting bombs on Iranian nuclear sites. The war exposed the enormous gulf between Tehran's ideological bluster and the limited capabilities of a regime that has lost much of its regional power, no longer controls its skies, and exercises diminished control over its streets. At the war's conclusion, the 86-year-old Khamenei emerged from hiding to declare victory in a raspy voice—a spectacle meant to project strength that instead underscored the regime's frailty.

In the autumn of the ayatollah, the central question is whether the theocratic regime he has been ruling since 1989 will endure, transform, or implode—and what kind of political order might emerge in its wake. The 1979 revolution transformed Iran from a Western-aligned monarchy into an Islamist theocracy, flipping it virtually overnight from an American ally to a sworn enemy. Because Iran today remains a pivotal state—an energy superpower whose internal politics shape the Middle East's security and political order and ripple across the global system—the matter of who (or what) succeeds Khamenei is of enormous consequence.

Over the past two years—since Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which Khamenei alone among major world leaders openly endorsed—his life's work has been reduced to ashes by Israel and the United States. His closest military and political proteges have been killed or assassinated. His regional proxies have been hobbled. His vast nuclear enterprise, built at staggering cost to Iran's economy, has been buried under rubble.

The Islamic Republic has sought to turn its military humbling into an opportunity to rally the country around the flag, but the indignities of daily life are inescapable. Iran's 92 million people make up the largest population in the world to have been isolated from the global financial and political system for decades. Iran's economy is among the world's most sanctioned. Its currency is among the world's most devalued. Its passport is among the world's most denied. Its Internet is among the world's most censored. Its air is among the world's most polluted.

The regime's enduring slogans—“Death to America” and “Death to Israel” but never “Long Live Iran”—make clear that its priority is defiance, not development. Power outages and water rationing have become fixtures of daily life. One of the revolution's central symbols, the mandatory hijab, which Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic's first supreme leader, once called the “flag of the revolution,” is now in tatters, as growing numbers of women openly defy the requirement to cover their hair. Iran's putative patriarchs can control the country's women no better than they can control its airspace.

To understand how Iran arrived at this juncture, it is necessary to examine the guiding principles of Khamenei's 36-year rule. His tenure has rested on two pillars: unwavering commitment to revolutionary principles at home and abroad and outright rejection of political reform. Khamenei has long believed that diluting the Islamic Republic's ideals and strictures would do to the Islamic Republic what Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost did to his country, hastening its death rather than prolonging its life. Nor has Khamenei wavered in opposing the normalization of ties with the United States.

Khamenei's age, inflexibility, and looming departure have left Iran suspended between prolonged decay and sudden upheaval. Once Khamenei is gone, several possible futures are foreseeable. The Islamic Republic's totalizing ideology could collapse into the strongman cynicism that has been the hallmark of post-Soviet Russia. Like China after the death of Mao Zedong, Iran might recalibrate by replacing rigid ideology with pragmatic national interest. It could double down on repression and isolation, as North Korea has done for decades. Clerical rule might yield to military dominance, as it has in Pakistan. And although increasingly unlikely, Iran could still tilt toward representative government—a struggle that dates back to the Constitutional Revolution of 1906. Iran's path will be unique, and its course will shape not only the lives of Iranians but also the stability of the Middle East and the wider world order.

Iranians often see themselves as heirs to a great empire, yet their modern history has been punctuated by repeated invasions, humiliations, and betrayals. In the nineteenth century, Iran lost nearly half its territory to predatory neighbors, surrendering the Caucasus (encompassing present-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Dagestan) to Russia and relinquishing Herat to Afghanistan under British pressure. By the early twentieth century, Russia and the United Kingdom had carved the country into spheres of influence. In 1946, Soviet troops occupied and attempted to annex Iranian Azerbaijan, and in 1953, the United Kingdom and the United States orchestrated a coup that helped depose Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq.

This legacy has bred generations of Iranian rulers who see plots everywhere, suspecting even their closest aides of being foreign agents. Reza Shah, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty and a leader that many Iranians still revere today, was forced to abdicate by the Allied powers during World War II, given his suspected affinity for Nazi Germany. He was suspicious of “everybody and everything,” in the words of his adviser Abdolhossein Teymourtash. “There was really nobody in the whole country whom His Majesty trusted.” His son Mohammed Reza Shah felt similarly. False American promises “cost me my throne,” he concluded, after being deposed by the 1979 revolution. Once in power, Khomeini executed thousands of opponents on charges of serving as foreign agents; his successor, Khamenei, laces nearly every speech with references to American and Zionist plots.

This deep mistrust is not confined to elites; it runs in the lifeblood of the body politic. Iraj Pezeshkzad's My Uncle Napoleon—a beloved Iranian novel, later adapted into an iconic 1976 TV series—satirizes a paranoid family patriarch who sees foreign plots everywhere, especially British ones. The novel remains a cultural touchstone, evoking the conspiratorial mindset that still shapes Iran's politics and society. A 2020 World Values Survey found that fewer than 15 percent of Iranians believe “most people can be trusted”—among the lowest rates in the world.



In Iran's paranoid style, outsiders are cast as predators, insiders as traitors, and institutions bend to personal rule. Over the past century, just four men have ruled the country, with cults of personality substituting for durable institutions and politics cycling between brief bursts of euphoria and long years of disillusionment. The Islamic Republic has sharpened this pattern by formally dividing its citizens into “insiders” and “outsiders.” In such an atmosphere of mistrust, negative selection prevails: mediocrity is rewarded, obscurity promoted, and loyalty prized over competence. Khamenei's rise in 1989 was a textbook case of this dynamic, and the same criteria are likely to inform his preferred succession plan. This entrenched culture of mistrust—shaped by history, reinforced by rulers, and internalized by society—not only perpetuates authoritarian rule but also inhibits the collective organization required for representative government. It will continue to cast a long shadow over Iran's future.

Authoritarian transitions rarely follow a script, and Iran's will be no exception. The death or incapacitation of Khamenei would be the most obvious trigger for change. External shocks—a collapse in oil prices, intensified sanctions, renewed military strikes by Israel or the United States—could further destabilize the regime. But history shows that unexpected internal sparks—a natural disaster, a fruit vendor's self-immolation, a young woman killed for showing too much hair—can prove just as consequential.

For nearly five decades, Iran has been governed by ideology; its future, however, will hinge on logistics—above all, who can most effectively manage a country nearly five times as large as Germany, endowed with vast resources yet beset by daunting challenges. Out of this volatility, Iran's post-Khamenei order could take several forms: nationalist strongman rule, clerical continuity, military dominance, populist revival, or a unique hybrid of these. Such possibilities reflect the country's factionalism. The clerics are intent on preserving the Islamic Republic's ideology. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) seeks to entrench its power. Disenfranchised citizens, including ethnic minorities, demand dignity and opportunity. The opposition is too fractured to unite but too persistent to simply vanish. None of these factions are monolithic, but it is their aspirations and actions that will define the struggle over the kind of country that Iran will become.

The Islamic Republic today resembles the Soviet Union in its late stages: it sustains its exhausted ideology through coercion, its sclerotic leadership fears reform, and its society has largely turned away from the state. Both Iran and Russia are resource-rich countries with proud histories, famous literary cultures, and centuries of accumulated grievances. Each was transformed by an ideological revolution—Russia in 1917, Iran in 1979—that sought to rupture history and construct a radically new order. Both tried to avenge the past and impose a new vision at home and abroad, inflicting devastation not only on their own people but also on neighboring states. Despite their dueling ideologies—one militantly atheistic, the other theocratic—the parallels are striking. As with the Soviet Union, the Islamic Republic cannot reach an ideological accommodation with the United States, its paranoia is self-fulfilling, and the regime carries within it the seeds of its own decay.

The Soviet collapse was accelerated by Gorbachev's reforms, which loosened central control and unleashed forces the system could not contain. In the 1990s, lawlessness, oligarchic looting, and staggering inequality fueled resentment and disillusionment. Out of that turmoil rose Vladimir Putin, a former officer with the KGB, the Soviet security agency, who promised stability and pride, replacing communist ideology with resentment-driven nationalism. As president, he has cast himself as the restorer of Russia's dignity and rightful place in the world.

A similar trajectory is possible in Iran. The regime is ideologically and financially bankrupt, impervious to genuine reform, and vulnerable to collapse under the weight of external pressure and internal discontent. That collapse could create a vacuum that security elites and oligarchs will rush to fill. An Iranian strongman—an alumnus of the IRGC or the intelligence services—could emerge, discarding Shiite ideology in favor of grievance-driven Iranian nationalism as the organizing creed of a new authoritarian order. Some prominent officials may harbor such ambitions, including Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the current speaker of the Iranian parliament and a former senior official in the IRGC. Yet their long association with the current system makes such familiar figures unlikely standard-bearers of a new dispensation. The future more likely belongs to someone less visible today, someone junior enough to escape public blame for the present catastrophe yet seasoned enough to rise from the wreckage.



To be sure, the parallels are imperfect. By the time the Soviet Union collapsed, it had already entered its third generation of leaders, while Iran is only now entering its second. And Iran has had no Gorbachev: Khamenei has blocked reform precisely because he believes it would precipitate the republic's demise.

Yet the larger truth remains: when a totalizing ideology collapses, it often leaves behind not civic renewal but cynicism and nihilism. Post-Soviet Russia was marked less by democratic flourishing than by the pursuit of wealth at any cost. A post-theocratic Iran could display similar patterns: consumerism and conspicuous consumption as substitutes for lost faith and collective purpose.

An Iranian Putin could borrow some of the tactics of the Islamic Republic, seeking stability by sowing instability among Iran's neighbors, threatening global energy flows, cloaking aggression in a new ideology, and growing rich with other elites while promising to restore Iran's dignity. For the United States and Iran's neighbors, the lesson of Russia looms large: the death of ideology does not guarantee democracy. It can just as easily deliver a new strongman equally unbound by scruples, armed with renewed grievances, and driven by fresh ambitions.

Whereas the Soviet Union failed to adapt until it was too late, China survived by pragmatically shifting in the decades after the death of Mao, in 1976, prioritizing economic growth over revolutionary purity. The “China model” has long appealed to Islamic Republic insiders who want to preserve the system but recognize that a failing economy and widespread public discontent demand some attempt at reform. In this scenario, the regime would remain repressive and autocratic, but it would soften its revolutionary principles and social conservatism in favor of rapprochement with the United States, broader integration with the world, and a gradual transition from theocracy to technocracy. The Revolutionary Guards would retain their power and profits but, like China's People's Liberation Army, turn from revolutionary militancy to nationalist corporatism.

Iran faces two obstacles to pursuing this model: establishing it and sustaining it. In China, normalization with the United States was initiated in the 1970s by Mao, the founder of the communist revolution and the new regime's first leader. But it was his eventual successor, Deng Xiaoping, who used that opening to reorient the country from ideological orthodoxy to pragmatism and launch transformational reforms. Iran has produced would-be Dengs—including former President Hassan Rouhani and Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of the revolution's founder—but none could overcome Khamenei and like-minded hard-liners, who long believed that any compromise on revolutionary ideology, especially rapprochement with the United States, would destabilize the system rather than strengthen it.

In China, rapprochement with Washington was made easier by a shared adversary in the Soviet Union. By contrast, although Iran and the United States have occasionally confronted common foes—including the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and militant groups such as al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Islamic State—for Khamenei, hostility toward the United States and Israel has always been paramount. Attempting the China model would require either a dying Khamenei to abandon his lifelong opposition to Washington, which is highly unlikely, or a succession engineered to favor a less strident leader.

Even then, Iran might struggle to follow the Chinese path. China's enormous labor force allowed it to lift hundreds of millions out of poverty, earning the state renewed legitimacy and the confidence of the public. Iran, by contrast, has a rentier economy more akin to that of Russia. If the regime abandons ideology without delivering material improvements, it risks losing its existing base without winning over new supporters.

A less ideological Iran that normalizes relations with the United States and drops its opposition to Israel's existence would mark a significant improvement over the status quo. Yet as China's experience shows, economic growth and international integration can also fuel greater regional and global ambitions—replacing today's challenges with new ones. And it is far from clear that Iran could maintain internal stability through such a turbulent transition.

If the Islamic Republic continues to put ideology before national interests, its future could resemble North Korea's present: a regime that endures not through popular legitimacy but through brutality and isolation. Khamenei's preference has long been to perpetuate rule by a supreme leader, an austere cleric committed to the revolutionary principles of resistance against the United States and Israel and upholding Islamist orthodoxy at home. Yet nearly five decades after 1979, few Iranians want to live under a system that deprives them of economic dignity and political and social freedoms. Sustaining such a regime would require totalitarian control—and likely a nuclear weapon to deter foreign pressure.

Power in this scenario would remain in the hands of a narrow clique or even a single family. Although Khamenei may try to engineer succession in favor of someone who will remain loyal to revolutionary principles, the pool of viable candidates is small, as few if any hard-line clerics have a base of popular support or legitimacy. Ebrahim Raisi, once considered the leading contender, died in a helicopter crash in May 2024 while serving as Iran's president. That leaves Khamenei's 56-year-old son, Mojtaba, as the most prominent contender. Yet hereditary succession would directly betray one of the founding principles of the revolution: Khomeini's insistence that monarchy was “un-Islamic.”

Mojtaba has never held elected office, has virtually no public profile, and is known chiefly for his behind-the-scenes ties to the Revolutionary Guards. His image evokes continuity with his father's generation, not the dynamism of a new era. Risible attempts by his supporters to liken him to the dynamic Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—including campaigns on social media with the hashtag #MojtabaBinSalman in Persian—are an indication that even Khamenei's revolutionary base recognizes that a forward-­looking vision is more appealing than a backward-looking one.



Other hard-line contenders inspire little more confidence. The country's dour, 69-year-old chief justice, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni Ejei, is little more than a hanging judge, involved in dozens of executions; perhaps his most memorable public act was biting a journalist who had criticized censorship. Any succession that involved a figure of this sort would rest not on popular consent but on the loyalty of the IRGC. But it is unclear whether the guards will continue to defer to the aging clerics of the Assembly of Experts, the body tasked with appointing the next supreme leader, or whether, when the moment arrives, they will simply choose the republic's next commander in chief themselves.

The North Korea model would also collide with a society that aspires to the openness and prosperity of South Korea. Few Iranians will tolerate a system that prizes ideology over economic well-being and personal security even more stridently than the current one. Totalitarian rule would require mass imprisonment at home, the mass exodus of professionals abroad, and perhaps a nuclear shield to deter foreign pressure. Yet unlike North Korea, Iran cannot hermetically seal itself off: Israel dominates its skies and has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to strike nuclear sites, missile bases, and senior commanders.

If the next supreme leader is another hard-liner, he will likely be a transitional figure—sustaining the system for a time but not forging a stable new order. Ahmad Kasravi, a secular Iranian intellectual assassinated by Islamists in 1946, once wrote that Iran “owed” the clergy one chance to rule so their failings could be exposed. After nearly five decades of theocratic mismanagement, that debt has been settled. If Iran's next age belongs to another strongman, he is unlikely to wear a turban.

If Iran's future lies with the IRGC, Pakistan may offer the closest precedent. Since the revolution, the Islamic Republic has gradually transformed from a clerical state into a security state dominated by the guards. Born in 1979 as “guardians of the revolution”—to protect against foreign coups, internal dissent, and potential disloyalty in the shah's army—the IRGC expanded dramatically during the Iran-Iraq War. Afterward, it moved into business, ports, construction, smuggling, and media, evolving into a chimera: part military force, part business conglomerate, and part political machine. Today, the IRGC oversees Iran's nuclear program, commands proxy militias across the region, and dominates large segments of the economy. Its vast reach has yielded an Iran for which the adage about Pakistan increasingly applies: “Not a country with an army, but an army with a country.”

Khamenei's insecurities bind his rule to the guards. The U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq gave the IRGC license to expand its budget and fund and equip proxies abroad, while sanctions enriched the organization by turning Iran's ports into conduits for illicit smuggling. But the IRGC is not a cohesive bloc: it is a constellation of competing cartels whose rivalries—generational, institutional, and commercial—have been contained under Khamenei's authority. His departure will likely bring those feuds into the open.

One scenario in which the IRGC might move from dominance to outright rule would involve the guards allowing unrest to fester before stepping in as “saviors of the nation.” This would mirror Pakistan's military, which has long justified its dominance by presenting itself as the guardian of national unity against both India and internal disintegration. For the IRGC, such a strategy would require not just sidelining the clergy but shifting the organizing principle of the state itself from Shiite revolutionary ideology to Iranian nationalism. Clerics invoke God; the guards would invoke the country.



But the IRGC's current dominance should not be mistaken for popularity. Its top leadership is handpicked by Khamenei, rotated frequently to prevent the accrual of too much power to individual officials, and widely associated with repression, corruption, and incompetence. As Siamak Namazi, an American who was held hostage by the organization for eight years, told me, “Iran is today a collection of competing mafias—dominated by the IRGC and its alumni—whose highest loyalty is not to nation, religion, or ideology but to personal enrichment.”

Israel's assassinations of nearly two dozen senior IRGC commanders in their bunkers and bedrooms underscored both the group's vulnerability to penetration and the weaknesses of an institution that prioritizes ideological loyalty over competence. For an IRGC regime to endure, it would almost certainly require a new generation of leaders, less dogmatic than those cultivated by Khamenei and capable of appealing to the public through nationalism rather than clerical ideology.

If the guards do emerge as Iran's rulers, much will depend on the type of leader who comes forward. A grievance-driven commander could cast himself as an Iranian Putin, substituting nationalism for Islamism while continuing confrontation with the West. A more pragmatic officer might resemble an Iranian Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, preserving authoritarian rule while seeking an alliance with the West, much as Egypt's president has done. The nuclear question would be central. In their writings, IRGC strategists often contrast the fates of Saddam and the Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi—both of whom lacked nuclear weapons and fell—with North Korea's regime, which has nuclear weapons and has survived. An IRGC-led Iran would face the same dilemma: pursue a bomb for survival or forsake it for the benefits of recognition.

Like Pakistan, such an Iran would be defined less by clerics than by generals—nationalists, keen to stoke the ardor of their people, and perpetually vacillating between confrontation and accommodation with the West.

In terms of territory, population, culture, and history, Iran has few cousins closer than Turkey, another fiercely proud, non-Arab, Muslim country burdened by a long legacy of mistrust toward great powers. The Turkish experience under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offers one possible parallel: elections that bring a popular leader to power, initial reforms that resonate with ordinary citizens, and then a gradual slide into majoritarian authoritarianism cloaked in the language of democracy.

For Iran to follow such a path, however, wholesale institutional change would be required. The Islamic Republic's byzantine layers of power—including the office of the supreme leader, the Guardian Council, and the Assembly of Experts—would need to be dismantled, the IRGC folded into the professional military, and the country's largely hollowed-out elected institutions empowered. Without these prerequisites, genuinely competitive and accountable politics cannot take root.

Iran, however, would not be starting from zero. As the social scientist Kian Tajbakhsh has noted, the regime's creation of thousands of local councils and municipal bodies produced “dual-use institutions: created to serve an authoritarian order, but structurally available to support democratic transition—if given the chance.” In effect, Iranians have long practiced the forms of representative government without enjoying their substance.

A populist leader could well emerge from any remotely fair election. In a country home to both significant resources and deep inequality, populism has been a recurring force in modern Iranian politics. In 1979, Khomeini railed against the shah and his foreign backers while promising free utilities, housing for all, and oil wealth that would flow to the people rather than a corrupt elite. A generation later, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a little-known mayor of Tehran, rose to the presidency in 2005 by vowing to put “the oil money on people's dinner tables.” Whether through open or competitive elections, a post-Khamenei Iran could again see the rise of a populist outsider with nationalist credentials and the ability to mobilize anger against both elites and foreign enemies.

Such a trajectory would not bring Iran to liberal democracy, but neither would it continue clerical rule. It would blend popular legitimacy with centralized authority, redistribution with corruption, and nationalism with religious symbolism. For many Iranians, this would be preferable to continued theocracy or military rule. Yet as Turkey's experience illustrates, populism can open the door not to pluralism but to a new form of authoritarianism—one with mass backing and a ballot-box mandate.

History counsels humility in prediction. In December 1978, just one month before the shah's departure, a leading American scholar of Iran, James Bill, wrote in Foreign Affairs that “the most probable alternative” to the shah would be “a left-wing, progressive group of middle-ranking army officers.” Other scenarios, he suggested, included “a right-wing military junta, a liberal democratic system based on Western models, and a communist government.” The “United States need not fear,” wrote Bill, “that a future government in Iran will necessarily be antithetical to American interests.” Most strikingly, just weeks before Iran's clerics seized power, Bill predicted they “would never participate directly in the formal governmental structure.” Iranian intellectuals also misjudged events. Weeks before Khomeini consolidated his theocracy and commenced mass executions, one of Iran's leading intellectuals, the philosopher Dariush Shayegan, declared, “Khomeini is an Islamic Gandhi. He is at the axis of our movement.”

Just as 1979 confounded both insiders and outsiders, outlier scenarios are again conceivable. Given the lack of alternatives, some Iranians look to Reza Pahlavi, the shah's exiled son, whose widespread name recognition is sustained by an online cottage industry of nostalgia for the pre-revolutionary era. Yet having spent nearly half a century abroad, he will need to overcome the absence of organization and on-the-ground muscle to prevail in the ruthless contests that define authoritarian transitions. Another possibility—perhaps the greatest dread of many Iranian patriots, including even staunch opponents of the regime—is a Yugoslavia-style breakup along ethnic lines. Iran's minorities could see a weakening of the center as an opening for revolt or as an opportunity to begin anew. Unlike Yugoslavia, however, Iran is anchored by a far older and more coherent identity: more than 80 percent of Iranians are either Persian or Azeri, nearly all speak Persian as a lingua franca, and even non-Persian groups identify with a state that has a continuous history for more than 2,500 years.

In essence, Iran once again appears to be a country up for grabs, with futures that could diverge dramatically. The United States and the rest of the world would benefit from a post–Islamic Republic guided by national interest rather than revolutionary dogma. As the diplomat Henry Kissinger once observed, “There are few nations in the world with which the United States has less reason to quarrel or more compatible interests than Iran.” Yet the United States' experience in Afghanistan and Iraq underscored the limits of foreign influence: even vast investments of blood and treasure cannot dictate political outcomes. Russia faces similar constraints. Moscow may prefer the continuation of an Islamic Republic that can serve as a perennial thorn in Washington's side and a source of instability that drives up global energy risks. But despite its best efforts, Moscow could not prevent the collapse of the Assad regime, its client in Syria. China, by contrast, has far more to gain from an Iran that fulfills its potential as an energy powerhouse than an Iran that exports instability.



Yet to whatever degree outside powers may tilt the balance, Iran today is large and resilient enough to chart its own destiny. It has all the makings of a G-20 country: an educated, globally connected population, tremendous natural resources, and a proud civilizational identity. For Iranian democrats, however, the international climate could hardly be less favorable. Western governments that once championed democracy have withdrawn resources and are preoccupied with their own democratic backsliding. The United States has pared back institutions—such as the National Endowment for Democracy and Voice of America—that were central to its Cold War success. In this vacuum, Iran is more likely to follow the broader global trend in which strongmen rise by stressing the virtues of order rather than the promise of freedom.

Majority opinion may not determine Iran's transition, but to the extent that political hopefuls seek to appeal to it, one reality appears clear: Iranians are not yearning for empty slogans, personality cults, or even lofty notions of democracy. What they desire most is a well-managed, accountable government that can restore economic dignity and allow them to live a zendegi-e normal—a “normal life” free from the suffocating grip of a state that polices what they wear, what they watch, how they love, whom they worship, and even what they eat and drink.

The Islamic Republic's tenure has amounted to a lost half century for Iran. While its Persian Gulf neighbors became global hubs of finance, transport, and technology, Iran squandered its wealth on failed regional adventures and a nuclear program that brought only isolation, all while repressing and wasting its greatest source of wealth: its people. The country still has the natural resources and human capital to rank among the world's leading economies. But unless Tehran learns from its mistakes and reorders its politics, its trajectory will remain one of decline rather than renewal. The question is not whether change will come, but whether it will finally deliver a long-awaited spring—or merely another winter.

The United States and China on Tuesday will begin charging additional port fees on ocean shipping firms that move everything from holiday toys to crude oil, making the high seas a key front in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.

China said it had started to collect the special charges on U.S.-owned, operated, built, or flagged vessels but clarified that Chinese-built ships would be exempted from the levies.

In details published on Tuesday by state broadcaster CCTV, China spelled out specific provisions on exemptions, which also include empty ships entering Chinese shipyards for repair.

The China-imposed extra port fees would be collected at the first port of entry on a single voyage or for the first five voyages within a year, following an annual billing cycle beginning on April 17.

Early this year, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration announced plans to levy the fees on China-linked ships to loosen that country's grip on the global maritime industry and bolster U.S. shipbuilding. An investigation during former President Joe Biden's administration concluded China uses unfair policies and practices to dominate the global maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors, clearing the way for those penalties.

The U.S. is scheduled to also begin collecting fees on October 14. Analysts expect China-owned container carrier COSCO to be most affected, shouldering nearly half of that segment's expected US$3.2-billion cost from those fees in 2026.

U.S.-China trade tensions loom large at IMF, World Bank meetings

China hit back last week, saying it would impose its own port fees on U.S.-linked vessels from the same day. Jefferies analyst Omar Nokta noted that 13 per cent of crude tankers and 11 per cent of container ships in the global fleet would be affected.

“This tit-for-tat symmetry locks both economies into a spiral of maritime taxation that risks distorting global freight flows,” Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers Inc said in a research note.

In a reprisal against China curbing exports of critical minerals, Trump on Friday threatened to slap additional 100 per cent tariffs on goods from China and put new export controls on “any and all critical software” by November 1.

Administration officials hours later warned that countries voting in favor of a plan by the United Nations' International Maritime Organization to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from ocean shipping this week could face sanctions, port bans, or punitive vessel charges. China has publicly supported the IMO plan.

“The weaponisation of both trade and environmental policy signals that shipping has moved from being a neutral conduit of global commerce to a direct instrument of statecraft,” Xclusiv said.

Shares in Shanghai-listed COSCO rose more than 2 per cent in early trading on Tuesday. The company said its board had approved a plan to buy back up to US$210.3-million) worth of its shares within the next three months to maintain corporate value and safeguard shareholder interest.

The shipping firm did not immediately respond to Reuters' queries about the potential impact of the port fees.

In a voicemail obtained by Fox News Digital, a caller told ICE agents he hopes they are doxxed and publicly shamed. (Credit: DHS)

EXCLUSIVE: Amid soaring assaults on federal law enforcement and following a recent shooting at a Dallas facility, a caller left a disturbing voicemail taunting immigration agents, saying he hopes "every one of those lawless c----" gets "doxxed one by one."

"You know, it's always the bad guys who need masks, not the good ones," a male-sounding voice said in a voicemail recording obtained by Fox News Digital.

"I hope every one of those lawless c---- you call ICE agents get doxxed one by one, and they get the public shaming they deserve," he said.

This comes as assaults on ICE agents have risen by 1,000%, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

DHS RIPS HOUSTON HALLOWEEN DISPLAY DEPICTING HANGING OF ICE AGENTS, DEMANDS 'SANCTUARY POLITICIANS' STAND DOWN

On Sept. 24, a gunman named Joshua Jahn, carrying rounds with the words "anti-ICE" written on them, allegedly opened fire on a facility in Dallas, killing two and injuring another.

The Dallas Observer reported that authorities found notes in Jahn's home in which he referred to ICE agents as "people showing up to collect a dirty paycheck," and that he intended to "maximize lethality" against ICE personnel.

In a statement to Fox News Digital in response to the voicemail, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin blamed the rise in animosity against agents on rampant rhetoric "comparing ICE day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols," saying such rhetoric "has consequences."

"The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop," said McLaughlin.

"These type of threats against our brave ICE law enforcement officers and their families are disgusting. These officers risk their lives every day to arrest murderers, pedophiles, rapists, terrorists, and gang members from our communities," she said.

"The men and women of ICE and CBP are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. They get up every morning to try and make our communities safer. Like everyone else, they just want to go home to their families at night."

DHS recently called on sanctuary politicians and the media to "tone down their rhetoric" in the face of surging assaults, doxxings and threats against agents and their families.

According to DHS, a Texas ICE officer's spouse received a call saying, "I don't know how you let your husband work for ICE, and you sleep at night. F--- you, f--- your family. I hope your kids get deported by accident. How do you sleep? F--- you."

The caller also said, "Did you hear what happened to the Nazis after World War II? Because it's what's going to happen to your family."

(Carlos Barria/Reuters)

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, three women, Cynthia Raygoza, 37, Ashleigh Brown, 38, and Sandra Carmona Samane, 25, were indicted in September for livestreaming their pursuit of an ICE agent to his home and then posting the victim's address on Instagram. Upon arriving at the law enforcement officer's home, they began shouting "neighbor is ICE," "la migra lives here," and "ICE lives on your street and you should know."

Commenting on the indictment, Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said, "The conduct of these defendants are deeply offensive to law enforcement officers and their families. If you threaten, dox, or harm in any manner one of our agents or employees, you will face prosecution and prison time."

Trump-style diplomacy made the deal work, and could undo it.

After the euphoria and relief of Monday's prisoner exchange and ceasefire, Tuesday has brought some ominous portents for the future of the Gaza peace deal.

For one thing, the shooting hasn't stopped entirely. Five Palestinians were killed in an Israeli drone strike on Tuesday morning in Gaza's Shejaiya neighborhood. According to the Israel Defense Forces, they had crossed the “yellow line” to which Israeli forces had withdrawn under the peace agreement. Hamas is also giving little indication that it plans on eliminating itself as either a political or military force: On Monday, video circulated of the group publicly executing seven men accused of collaboration with Israel. Israel has also decided not to reopen the Rafah border crossing, between Gaza and Egypt, and to continue to limit aid into the Gaza Strip, over Hamas's failure to return the dead bodies of hostages still in Gaza. Four bodies were handed over on Monday, with 24 still remaining. The Red Cross has said it will take time to locate some of the bodies beneath the rubble.

President Donald Trump said on Monday that the “hardest part” of ending the war had been accomplished and that rebuilding Gaza would likely be the “easiest.” Right now, it's hard to find justification for that optimism.

What's becoming increasingly clear as the deal goes into effect is that its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness: It put off the “hardest” questions — when, if ever, will Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza entirely? When will Hamas disarm? Who will govern Gaza after they do? — until later, in order to prioritize a ceasefire and hostage release.

In hindsight, this was probably the right approach, and likely the only reason the deal went through. When Trump first announced the parameters of the deal in September, the concern was that the two sides would agree in principle but insist on haggling over every little detail while the fighting continued. Indeed, that's what they tried to do. When Hamas replied to the proposal with a qualified “yes, but” in early October, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assumed the deal was off. Instead, Trump publicly celebrated Hamas for agreeing to his proposal, told Netanyahu to stop being “so fucking negative,” and continued to push the process forward. At the same time, Qatar and Egypt reportedly strong-armed Hamas into accepting a deal they had initially viewed as a nonstarter.

All of this worked because many of the 20-point plan's provisions are vague and have no deadlines attached to them. It's fair to assume many of them are not actually plans for things that will really take place, but language inserted to make the agreement minimally acceptable to all the stakeholders. Will Hamas members who lay down their weapons really be amnestied and given asylum abroad? Will the Palestinian Authority really complete a “reform program” making it acceptable to Israel as Gaza's new ruler? Will there really be an “International Stabilization Force” to provide security? Or an “interfaith dialogue process” to change the mindsets of Israelis and Palestinians? Will there really be a “Trump economic development plan” to bring prosperity to the shattered region? Will former Prime Minister Tony Blair, a man reviled in much of the Middle East for his role in the Iraq war, really play a role in governing Gaza? Even Trump has some doubts about the last one.

The deal is designed as something of a diplomatic Rorschach test that allows everyone involved to see what they want in it. This was in evidence on Monday night when Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi seemed to disagree about whether the plan calls for a two-state solution. (It does, but only briefly and in general terms.)

In the short term, none of this is a bad thing. If the negotiators had insisted on hashing out a detailed and binding road map for Gaza's political future before the deal went into effect, the IDF would likely be fighting street-by-street through Gaza City right now and the hostages would still be in captivity, as would the nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees who were also released on Monday.

The agreement stopped the carnage, and it could also be an opening for a political process that leads to a better future for Gaza and the region — or at least a less grim present. But as the events of this week are already showing, it's an opening that could close quickly.

It's worth remembering that we've been here before — and quite recently. A ceasefire deal, negotiated in the waning days of the Biden administration, was still in effect when Trump took office. (Trump and his envoy Steve Witkoff were involved in the talks that led to that ceasefire.) That deal was split into three phases. The first, binding phase, involved a pause in the fighting and the release of some of the Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Phase two, in which the two sides were supposed to begin negotiations for a full end to the war, the release of the remaining hostages, and the future governance of Gaza, never happened. Frustrated with the lack of progress on hostage releases, Israel resumed airstrikes in Gaza in March, and halted food aid into the territory, with Trump's full support. (At the time, Trump has still in thrall to the idea of “cleaning out” Gaza and turning it into a holiday resort, which probably didn't help matters.)

This time is different, mainly because the last of the hostages have been released. (Hamas leaders had reportedly begun to see them more as a liability — giving Israel a pretext to keep fighting — than as a useful bargaining chip.) But if Hamas fighters are still armed and in control of much of Gaza, and if IDF troops are still present within the territory, it's not difficult to imagine a range of scenarios that could lead to the war resuming.

Give Trump his due: Over the past few weeks, he has shown that his willingness to put real pressure on Netanyahu and to leverage his close relationships in the Gulf can produce results in the Middle East much more quickly than many experts and peace process veterans thought possible. (Whether he could have achieved it much sooner is another question.) But keeping the deal from falling apart, much less delivering the “new dawn for the Middle East,” may require him to remain as involved and willing to apply that pressure as he has been for the past few weeks.

The provision in the deal that names Trump as the chair of the “board of peace” supervising Gaza's governance may be intended as a way to keep him engaged. Others hope his pining for the still elusive Nobel Peace Prize may focus his attention.

Trump is never shy about declaring victory regardless of the facts. He now claims to have ended eight wars — several of which involved countries that were not actually at war.

In Gaza, that tendency of his was an asset. A more fact-based and pragmatic approach would probably not have gotten this deal done. But keeping the peace, and preventing more bloodshed in Gaza, may now depend on Trump being able to continue working on a problem even after he's already gotten credit for fixing it.

It's worth celebrating. But there's reason to fear what it portends.﻿

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy discusses the surge in attacks on ICE agents on 'Fox & Friends.'

FIRST ON FOX: A community college professor in Kansas has advocated doxxing ICE agents as well as community interference with their operations, an audit of a social media account belonging to him shows. 

Steve Werkmeister is an English professor at Johnson County Community College in Overland Park, Kansas. He goes by Steve W and uses the handle swerkmeister.bsky.social on Bluesky, a predominantly left-wing spinoff of X, where he describes himself as a "slacker" and "left of the dial." 

On Monday, Werkmeister reposted a flyer distributed by a left-wing advocacy group teaching anti-ICE advocates to use whistles in order to disrupt ICE operations. The flyer explains that blowing whistles when ICE agents are in the area allows people to "follow ICE caravans," "alert neighbors to join in" and "catch up with the crowd."

FEDS CHARGE ‘KEYBOARD WARRIORS' WHO THREATENED ICE DEPORTATION OFFICER AND WIFE ON INSTAGRAM

He also shared a post by John Pavlovitz, a known far-left internet activist, encouraging family members to "out" relatives who work for ICE.

"Good people need to start outing their ICE family members, neighbors, and community members," the post says. "They need to be made into pariahs in the places decent Americans gather."

On multiple occasions, Werkmeister refers to federal immigration enforcement as "kidnapping," and appears paranoid that he and his family will be "kidnapped" by ICE because of their "brown" skin. He said he communicated to the Johnson County Community College staff his desire to teach online from overseas.

"I've talked to our chair and the college president to see if I can just move online and teach from a safe location overseas (my family and I can be kidnapped by the government at any time since our skin is brown), and so far they're compassionately noncommittal (lots of empty phrases)," he said in an Oct. 10 post. 

A Rutgers University professor, Mark Bray, nicknamed "Dr. Antifa," fled to Spain last week after President Donald Trump labeled Antifa a domestic terrorist organization. 

After an apparent trip overseas, Werkmeister explained his protocol for re-entering the United States.

SPECIAL AGENT SLAMS ‘DANGEROUS' TREND OF DEMOCRATS USING ICE AS CAMPAIGN PROPS

"Even though our citizenship is beyond question in any normal, legal sense, we're brown, so I texted my family as soon as we landed and told them I'd text again once we got past customs. If they didn't get the second text, they'd know we were detained and needed lawyers right away," he posted in March.

"Then once we were safely at the gate, I realized my anxiety over the culture of violence and predatory aggression in this country had returned," he said in a follow-up post. "I never once felt threatened abroad. It's a national shame that the most dangerous part of our trip was coming home to our own country."

Some of Werkmeister's ire specifically targets White people. 

"It's tough to live with the knowledge that whenever I go to the store, or to my office, or out for a walk, or anywhere really, packs of white ‘Americans' are out hunting and kidnapping people who look like me," he said in a June 26 post. "It's psychological terrorism for the crime of being born brown in America."

In an earlier post, he claimed that White people want "brown folks back to the fields."

"Mediocre white males realized they can't compete on a more level playing field, so they need to force women back into the kitchen and black and brown folks back to the fields. They've had others carry them for 500 years, and they can't ‘win' without white privilege."

"JCCC is an open dialog institution, and the values of Johnson County Community College is something we hold true for all," a school spokesman told Fox News Digital in a brief statement. 

Werkmeister did not return a request for comment.

Fox News national correspondent Madison Scarpino reports the latest on a deadly blast at a Tennessee explosives factory on 'Fox News Live.'

The fiancée of a pastor who was identified as one of the victims in the Tennessee munitions plant explosion said his church became a "packed house" this week after a call for prayer. 

Trent Stewart was the pastor at The Log Church in Waverly, where Sunday school and worship were canceled this weekend and replaced with a time of prayer in the sanctuary, the church's associate pastor, Charlie Musick, posted on social media.  

On Monday, the sheriffs of Humphreys and Hickman counties identified Stewart as one of the 16 victims killed in Friday's explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems plant near Bucksnort, about 50 miles west of Nashville. 

"We had a packed out house this morning at The Log Church. I know this would have absolutely thrilled Trent. We appreciate everyone who came, and we hope everyone will join us again next Sunday," Katy Stover wrote on Facebook. "It brought a smile to my face and tears to my eyes to see how many people showed up to honor Trent and all the other families."

In another post, Stover said, "Trent was the most amazing man I have ever met." 

"He loved the Lord with all he had, and it showed in him every day. Regardless of anything legal, this man was my husband. I don't need a piece of paper to tell me anything," she added. "We treated each other as if we were already married. I know he would've been an amazing father. I find peace and strength in the fact that I know he loved me, and I know he is dancing with Jesus." 

Rachel Woodall was identified as one of the victims in the Tennessee manufacturing plant explosion. On a Facebook page purportedly belonging to her, she wrote, "I live in a small town, love art (drawing and painting) and scenery." (Facebook/Rachel Woodall)

Reyna Gillahan, another victim, had dreamed of paying off her home and keeping it in the family, so her daughter, Rosalina Gillahan, began fundraising after the explosion, according to The Associated Press. It was one of several fundraisers for families who lost loved ones. 

"She was a beautiful soul — loving, strong, and always thinking of others before herself," Rosalina Gillahan posted on social media about her mother. 

The other victims were identified as Jason Adams, Billy Baker, Christopher Clark, James Cook, LaTeisha Mays, Melinda Rainey, Steven Wright, Erick Anderson, Adam Boatman, Mindy Clifton, Jeremy Moore, Melissa Stafford, Rachel Woodall and Donald Yowell.

The WellSpring Christian Church in Spring Hill said Yowell, his wife and son were members long "before moving to Waverly a few years ago." 

"Don, a chemist, took a job at the facility that was the site of [Friday's] devastating explosion in Hickman County," the church added, asking for prayers for Yowell's family. 

Matt Reinhart wrote on Facebook that victim Mindy Clifton used to work in corrections in Florida before moving to Tennessee.

"During my 30-year career in Corrections, I had the privilege of working with many outstanding individuals. One of the very best was Mindy Clifton," he wrote. "After dedicating over 20 years of service to our community, Mindy retired and moved to the beautiful state of Tennessee. In her post-retirement life, she took a position at a munitions plant." 

"Many of you have already heard the tragic news about the devastating accident at that facility — an incident that claimed the lives of 16 people. Sadly, one of those lost was our Mindy," Reinhart added.

Authorities said they are working to clear the area of hazards, including explosives, in the wake of the explosion.

Once the area is clear, authorities can start investigating what caused the blast, said Matthew Belew, acting special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Some of the relevant evidence is spread out over miles, according to Belew.

"It's almost like putting a puzzle back together," Belew said. "We have worked closely with AES to know to look at pictures, look at blueprints, any of the identifying things that were in the building. And then we slowly methodically start to put some of that stuff together."

Panelists Brent Sadler and Derek Maltz weigh in on the Pentagon taking aim at narcoterrorists near Venezuela on ‘America Reports.'

President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that the U.S. military carried out another strike on a suspected drug vessel off the coast of Venezuela, killing six suspected smugglers.

"Under my Standing Authorities as Commander-in-Chief, this morning, the Secretary of War, ordered a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) conducting narcotrafficking in the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility — just off the Coast of Venezuela. Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known DTO route," Trump wrote Tuesday on Truth Social.

"The strike was conducted in International Waters, and six male narcoterrorists aboard the vessel were killed in the strike," Trump said. "No U.S. Forces were harmed." 

The strikes come after the White House sent lawmakers a memo Sept. 30 informing them that the U.S. is now participating in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug smugglers. 

Additionally, it comes on the heels of four other fatal strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean since September.

On Friday, the Department of War unveiled a new counter-narcotics Joint Task Force in the Southern Command area of responsibility, according to Secretary of War Pete Hegseth. 

TRUMP UNLEASHES US MILITARY POWER ON CARTELS. IS A WIDER WAR LOOMING?

The task force seeks to "crush the cartels, stop the poison, and keep America safe," Hegseth wrote on X Friday. "The message is clear: if you traffic drugs toward our shores, we will stop you cold."

Even so, members of Congress have called into question whether the strikes have been legal. For example, Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., filed a war powers resolution in September to bar U.S. forces from engaging in "hostilities" against certain non-state organizations. 

"There has been no authorization to use force by Congress in this way," Schiff told reporters Wednesday. "I feel it is plainly unconstitutional. The fact that the administration claims to have a list and has put organizations on a list does not somehow empower the administration to usurp Congress's power of declaring war or refusing to declare war or refusing to authorize the use of force." 

But the measure didn't pick up steam, and failed in the Senate by a 51-48 margin Wednesday. However, Republicans Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted alongside their Democratic counterparts for the resolution. 

TRUMP TOUTS US STRIKE AS MADURO SLAMS MILITARY ‘THREAT' OFF VENEZUELA

Trump has suggested that the strikes will continue and told military leaders in September the "military is now the knife's edge in combating this sinister enemy." 

"We have to put the traffickers and cartels on notice. … If you try to poison our people, we will blow you out of existence, because that's the only language they really understand," Trump told military leaders in Quantico, Virginia, Sept. 30. "That's why you don't see any more boats in the ocean. You don't see any boats around Venezuela. There's nothing."

Meanwhile, Venezuela requested an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council due to the strikes. Venezuela asked for the emergency session in a letter sent Thursday to Russia's ambassador to the U.N. and council president, Vassily Nebenzia. 

"The ulterior motive remains the same as that which has characterized the United States of America's actions toward Venezuela for more than 26 years: to advance its ‘regime change' policies in order to seize control of the vast natural resources found in Venezuelan territory," Samuel Moncada, Venezuela's ambassador to the U.N., wrote in the letter.

After the U.S. military's second strike, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said the episode is part of a larger effort "to intimidate and seek regime change" in Venezuela. The Trump administration has routinely claimed it does not recognize Maduro as a legitimate head of state, and rather, considers him a leader of a drug cartel.

The White House and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

            In February 2023, Pete Hegseth and Pam Bondi joined one another to bemoan the state of the First Amendment under the Biden administration.
    


            Hegseth called it “scary” that the “First Amendment has become what appears to be a partisan issue.” Bondi responded: “It's First Amendment when they say it is, and that's the problem, Pete.”
    


            Fast forward two and half years, and it's Hegseth and Bondi – both now high-ranking Cabinet secretaries under President Donald Trump – who are leading the charge to rein in the First Amendment on the new administration's terms.
    


            But Tuesday brought a major and highly symbolic rebuke. Fox News, the very same network on which Hegseth and Bondi spoke back in 2023 and which employed Hegseth at the time, rejected his attempts to control media coverage of the Defense Department he now leads.
    


            Fox signed a joint statement along with ABC News, CBS News, CNN, and NBC News that said Hegseth's rules would “restrict journalists' ability to keep the nation and the world informed of important national security issues.”
    


            “The policy is without precedent and threatens core journalistic protections,” the outlets said.
    


            To underscore: This is Hegseth's own former employer saying he's undermining freedom of the press.
    


            But this is also increasingly par for the course. Despite the Trump administration's growing efforts to target disfavored speech and media coverage, the First Amendment is showing growing signs of resilience.
    


            The administration picked up some real traction by using its leverage in lawsuits against media outlets that decided to settle rather than risk its wrath. But that dynamic could be shifting as Trump employs even blunter methods.
    


            The situation at the Pentagon is a case in point.
    


            Hegseth has sought to downplay the restrictions he's tried to impose on coverage. But outlets have rightly noted that those restrictions would severely limit what they're allowed to publish.
    


            The rules state that credentialed reporters cannot obtain or solicit information that is not explicitly authorized by the Defense Department – even unclassified information. If they do, they lose their credentials. Practically speaking, it would give the Pentagon the power to punish virtually any coverage it doesn't like.
    


            Even a Trump-appointed former Pentagon spokesman who resigned earlier this year has labeled these “Soviet-style restrictions.”
    


            And now the media has stood up en masse against it. As of Tuesday afternoon, dozens of outlets have rejected Hegseth's terms. They also include Newsmax, an even more MAGA outlet than Fox, and other conservative-leaning outlets. The only outlet so far to agree ahead of Hegseth's 5 p.m. deadline is ultra-MAGA One America News.
    


            Hegseth must now decide whether to move forward with a policy that's been declared too draconian and anti-free-press even by his former employer and Newsmax. If he does, he will be excluding virtually every media outlet from the halls of an institution that accounts for about 13% of all federal government spending.
    


            On Tuesday, Trump and Hegseth stood by the new policy in comments to reporters at the White House, with the Pentagon chief saying the restrictions were “commonsense stuff” and Trump suggesting he could also move reporters out of the White House if he wanted to.
    


            The backlash follows a number of setbacks for the administration's attempts to limit the First Amendment.
    


            Perhaps most significantly, the administration seems to have dropped the issue after its push to punish ABC's Jimmy Kimmel for his remarks about the reaction to Charlie Kirk's assassination.
    


            Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr was briefly successful with his threats of regulatory action against ABC, with Kimmel serving a short suspension. But soon even Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas publicly objected to the heavy-handedness of it all. Cruz likened it to mafia tactics and called it “dangerous as hell.”
    


            And Americans strongly rejected it, too. A Yahoo News-YouGov poll late last month showed Americans disapproved of the administration's threats by a 3-to-1 margin. They also disapproved of Trump's threats of regulatory actions against outlets that were critical of him, 67%-16%. Even Trump voters opposed the latter by double digits.
    


            The story was similar with Bondi's brief but apparently aborted pushed to target so-called “hate speech” after Kirk's assassination. Hate speech is protected speech under longstanding Supreme Court precedent, and many conservatives cried foul about the attorney general's comments. She quickly walked them back.
    


            There's also a growing judicial reckoning over the Trump administration's moves on free speech.
    


            A Republican-nominated judge two weeks ago issued a remarkable rebuke of the administration's targeting of pro-Palestinian activists.
    


            US District Judge William G. Young called the administration's actions a “full-throated assault on the First Amendment.” Young said the administration's moves were intended “to strike fear” into people by “intentionally denying such individuals … the freedom of speech that is their right.”
    


            Trump also suffered a strong rebuke – at least initially – in his move to bar the Associated Press from key areas of the White House over its refusal to call the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America.” A Trump-nominated judge called it “brazen” and said that “all indicators point to retaliation.”
    


            Two Trump-nominated appellate judges later provided the administration an at-least-temporary reprieve, with the full appeals court set to hear oral arguments next month.
    


            It indeed remains to be seen how most of these issues will play out. The court cases will proceed with appeals, and the administration's attempts to crack down on disfavored speech will certainly evolve.
    


            Trump has made very clear he would like to use all the tools at his disposal to expand his power, and few tools are as effective as being able to control what the media and your opposition say.  



            Trump and his allies have increasingly sought to baselessly paint the left as full of violent and organized radicals who, logic would follow, must be contained. Most strikingly of late, they've talked about the overwhelmingly peaceful “No Kings” protests, which are due to be reprised this weekend, as if they were mass gatherings of antifa and terrorist supporters.
    


            So we shouldn't expect this effort to go away.
    


            But it's also true that the administration is monkeying with something the American people generally don't want to be monkeyed with.
    


            An NPR-PBS News-Marist College poll last month showed nearly 8 in 10 Americans said the US government has generally gone “too far” in restricting free speech.
    


Quinnipiac University polling has also showed a significant rise in pessimism about free speech since Trump was inaugurated. While voters back in January said they were more optimistic than pessimistic about freedom of speech by 19 points, they now say they're more pessimistic by 10 points.
    


            That suggests the administration has overreached. The situation at the Pentagon will say a lot about whether it feels compelled to pull back.

Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (AP) — Some airports around the country are refusing to play a video with a message from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in which she blames Democrats for the federal government shutdown and its impacts on TSA operations because of its political content.

Airports in Las Vegas, Charlotte, Atlanta, Phoenix, Seattle and more say the video goes against their airport policy or regulations which prohibit political messaging in their facilities.

Various government agencies, in emails to workers and on websites, have adopted language that blames Democrats for the shutdown, with some experts arguing it could be in violation of the 1939 Hatch Act, which restricts certain political activities by federal employees. 

The shutdown has halted routine operations and left airports scrambling with flight disruptions. Democrats say any deal to reopen the government has to address their health care demands, and Republicans say they won't negotiate until they agree to fund the government. Insurance premiums would double if Congress fails to renew the subsidy payments that expire Dec. 31.

In the video, Noem says that TSA's “top priority” is to help make travel pleasant and efficient while keeping passengers safe.

“However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay,” she continues.

Government shutdownThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them?

The Transportation Security Administration falls under the Department of Homeland Security. Roughly 61,000 of the agency's 64,130 employees are required to continue working during the shutdown. The Department said Friday that the video is being rolled out to airports across the country.




A DHS spokeswoman responded to a request for comment restating some of the message from Noem's video.

“It's unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship. Our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government,” spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said.

The Harry Reid International Airport, in Las Vegas, said it had to “remain mindful of the Hatch Act's restrictions.”

“Per airport regulations, the terminals and surrounding areas are not designated public forums, and the airport's intent is to avoid the use of the facility for political or religious advocacy,” the statement said.

Westchester County Executive Ken Jenkins said the county north of New York City won't play the video at its local airport. In a statement, he called the video “inappropriate, unacceptable, and inconsistent with the values we expect from our nation's top public officials,” and said its tone is “unnecessarily alarmist” as it relates to operations at Westchester County Airport.

“At a time when we should be focused on ensuring stability, collaboration and preparedness, this type of messaging only distracts from the real issues, and undermines public trust,” he said.

Even in red states, airports weren't showing the video for various reasons. Salt Lake City International Airport wasn't playing the video because state law prohibits using city-owned property for political purposes, said airport spokesperson Nancy Volmer.

The airport in Billings, Montana, “politely declined” even though it has screens that could show the video with audio, assistant aviation director Paul Khera said Tuesday.

“We don't want to get in the middle of partisan politics,” Khera said. “We like to stay middle of the road, we didn't want to play that video.” ___

Squatters have moved into Yosemite National Park's campgrounds and rule-breakers are pushing boundaries as ranger patrols are stretched thin during the prolonged federal shutdown, according to a park employee who described growing disorder inside the park.

"There are lots of squatters in the campgrounds," the employee told SFGATE. "There are lots of people that truly believe they can do whatever they want because of the lack of rangers. They've told us."

The employee said only one wilderness ranger is currently working the entire park — and that person is technically a volunteer, not a National Park Service (NPS) employee. 

The Department of the Interior, which oversees the NPS, confirmed to Fox News Digital that it is "aware of reports" of escalating violations and is investigating.

"We are aware of reports of BASE jumping in Yosemite and investigate all reports," a department spokesperson said. "BASE jumping is illegal in all national parks, including Yosemite, due to the significant safety risks it poses to participants, the public and first responders." 

Despite the shutdown, the department said the National Park Service "will continue to keep parks as accessible as possible during the lapse in appropriations."

"Critical functions that protect life, property and public health will remain in place," the statement continued. "Law enforcement officers remain on duty and will respond to violations, trespassing or resource damage."

The enforcement gap has coincided with a visible rise in risk-taking behavior.

ICE VOWS 'NO CHANGE' TO IMMIGRATION, BORDER POLICY AMID GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

Videos and images circulating on social media show BASE jumpers leaping from El Capitan, unauthorized campers occupying closed campgrounds, and climbers scaling Half Dome's cables without permits — all in violation of park regulations.

Though Yosemite was once a hub for the sport in the 1970s, BASE jumping has been banned in national parks since the 1980s. 

BASE, an acronym for Building, Antenna, Span and Earth, is described by the department as "the recreational sport of jumping from fixed objects, including artificial structures and natural features, using a parachute to descend to the ground."

Officials note that violators face fines up to $5,000 or jail time under federal regulations. Enthusiasts have continued to participate in secret over the years, typically jumping at dawn or dusk to avoid detection.

An eyewitness has documented the illegal activity since the shutdown began.

"You hear them before you see them," Charles Winstead, who witnessed a dozen illegal BASE jumps in the park last week, told the San Francisco Chronicle. "Then the parachute pops and there's no more noise." 

Winstead shared a video on Instagram capturing one of the BASE jumpers, noting it was the second group he had witnessed that day.

"More base jumpers! Definitely feeling some freedom to flout the rules due to the shut down. Second group today," the caption read. 

Conservation advocates say these incidents are part of a larger pattern of disorder when national parks operate without proper staffing. During the 2018–19 shutdown, Yosemite and other parks suffered vandalism, illegal off-roading, and waste accumulation that took months to repair, according to park advocates.

"This is exactly what we warned about. And this is why national parks need to be closed until the government re-opens," Emily Thompson, executive director of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks, said in a statement on Friday. "This shutdown is making an already bad situation at national parks and public lands far worse. And the longer this goes, the worse it is going to get. The situation is dangerous and reckless for our parks, public lands and the visitors who love them."

The coalition, which consists of more than 40 former NPS leaders, had previously urged Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to close all 433 national park sites if government funding lapsed, citing ongoing staffing shortages.

"Leaving national parks open without National Park staff to help protect visitors and resources is not only irresponsible—it's dangerous. We don't leave museums open without curators, or airports without air traffic controllers and we should not leave our National Parks open without NPS employees," Thompson wrote. 

According to the National Parks Conservation Association, nearly 25% of the Park Service's permanent staff has been lost since January, leaving many parks, including Yosemite, without enough personnel to ensure visitor safety or respond quickly to emergencies.

At the same time, the Department of the Interior has emphasized maintaining access where possible.

The department's September 2025 contingency plan states that during a funding lapse, essential functions such as law enforcement and emergency response continue, and that most park areas "will generally remain accessible" with limited services.

Earlier this year, Burgum echoed that approach, directing that national parks "remain open and accessible," underscoring a commitment to ensure "all Americans have the opportunity to visit and enjoy our Nation's most treasured places," even with staffing constraints.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and left in place the $1.4 billion judgment against him over his description of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting as a hoax staged by crisis actors.

The Infowars host had argued that a judge was wrong to find him liable for defamation and infliction of emotional distress without holding a trial on the merits of allegations lodged by relatives of victims of the shooting, which killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut.

The justices did not comment on their order, which they issued without even asking the families of the Sandy Hook victims to respond to Jones' appeal. An FBI agent who responded to the shooting also sued.

A lawyer who represents Sandy Hook families said the Supreme Court had properly rejected Jones' “latest desperate attempt to avoid accountability for the harm he has caused.”

“We look forward to enforcing the jury's historic verdict and making Jones and Infowars pay for what they have done,” lawyer Christopher Mattei said in a statement.

A lawyer representing Jones in the case didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. During his daily show on Tuesday, Jones said his lawyers believed his case was “cut and dry,” while he had predicted the high court wouldn't take up his appeal.

“I said no, they will not do it because of politics,” Jones said.




Jones mocked the idea that he has enough money to pay the judgement, saying his studio equipment, including five-year-old cameras, was only worth about $304,000.

“It's all about torturing me. It's all about harassing me. It's about harassing my family. It's about getting me off the air,” said Jones, who urged his listeners to buy merchandise to keep show running.

Jones filed for bankruptcy in late 2022, and his lawyers told the justices that the “plaintiffs have no possible hope of collecting” the entire judgment.

He is separately appealing a $49 million judgment in a similar defamation lawsuit in Texas after he failed to turn over documents sought by the parents of another Sandy Hook victim.

In the Connecticut case, the judge issued a rare default ruling against Jones and his company in late 2021 because of what she called Jones' repeated failure to abide by court rulings and to turn over certain evidence to the Sandy Hook families. The judge convened a jury to determine how much Jones would owe.

The following year, the jury agreed on a $964 million verdict and the judge later tacked on another $473 million in punitive damages against Jones and Free Speech Systems, Infowars' parent company, which is based in Austin, Texas.

In November, the satirical news outlet The Onion was named the winning bidder in an auction to liquidate Infowars' assets to help pay the defamation judgments. But the bankruptcy judge threw out the auction results, citing problems with the process and The Onion's bid. 

The attempt to sell off Infowars' assets has moved to a Texas state court in Austin. Jones is now appealing a recent order from the court that appointed a receiver to liquidate the assets. Some of Jones' personal property is also being sold off as part of the bankruptcy case.

D'Angelo, the Grammy-winning R&B singer recognized by his raspy yet smooth voice and for garnering mainstream attention with the  shirtless “Untitled (How Does It Feel)” music video, has died. He was 51.

The singer, whose real name was Michael Eugene Archer, died Tuesday after a long bout with cancer, his family said in a statement.

It called him “a shining star of our family and has dimmed his light for us in this life,” adding that they are “eternally grateful for the legacy of extraordinarily moving music he leaves behind.”

In his music, D'Angelo blended hip-hop grit, emphatic soul and gospel-rooted emotion into a sound that helped spearhead the neo-soul movement of the 1990s. Earlier this year, the Virginia native celebrated the 30th anniversary of his debut studio album “Brown Sugar,” a platinum-selling offering that produced signature hits like “Lady” and the title track. The 1995 album earned him multiple Grammy nominations and cemented him as one of R&B's most original new voices.

D'Angelo's sultry vocal style — a mix of raspy texture and church-bred fluidity — set him apart from his peers. That voice became inseparable from the striking visuals of his 2000 single “Untitled (How Does It Feel).” The minimalist, shirtless music video became a cultural touchstone, igniting conversations around artistry, sexuality and vulnerability in Black male representation. The song earned him a Grammy for best male R&B vocal performance and propelled his sophomore album “Voodoo.” topping the Billboard 200 chart and winning the Grammy for best R&B album.

With an idiosyncratic spirit not unlike Prince, D'Angelo's devotion was always to the craft — not the machinery around it. In a 2000 interview with The Associated Press, he spoke candidly about the cost of chasing commercial success.




“(Musicians) have gotten trapped into that mode of thinking marketable and commercial. That destroys art, that destroys the essence of what it is about,” he said. “You cannot, you cannot work like that. You cannot make music like that. That's not what this is about.”

That same year, D'Angelo reflected on his need for solitude amid fame: “I used to hang out a lot, but now I've become more of a recluse,” he told AP. “I long for just peace and silence.”

Beyond his own catalog, D'Angelo's artistry shined in collaborations. He memorably duetted with Lauryn Hill on the soulful ballad “Nothing Even Matters,” a highlight of her landmark 1998 album “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” He also contributed to The Roots' 1996 album “Illadelph Halflife” and was part of the supergroup Black Men United, which yielded one song: “U Will Know,” which D'Angelo wrote and co-produced, for the film “Jason's Lyric” in 1994.

“I remember hearing your music for the first time… I said to myself damn whoever this is they are anointed,” Jamie Foxx said on social media. “Then when I finally got a chance to see you… Like everyone when they saw the most incredible music video of our time… I was blown away… I thought to myself I have to see this person in concert… I had my chance to see you at the house of blues… You came out and got right down to business… Your voice was silky and flawless… I was graciously envious of your style and your swag…” 

Years before stepping back from public view, D'Angelo's life and music were closely intertwined with Grammy-nominated R&B singer Angie Stone in the '90s. The pair met while he was finishing “Brown Sugar” and bonded over their shared Southern roots and deep church upbringing. Stone contributed to the album and later collaborated with him on “Everyday,” a song from her 1999 debut album, “Black Diamond.”

Stone once described D'Angelo as her “musical soul mate,” to the AP in 1999, adding that their working relationship was “'like milk and cereal …. Musically, it was magic. It's something that I have not been able to do with any other producer or musician.” They had a son together, the artist Swayvo Twain, born Michael Archer Jr.

Stone died earlier this year in a car crash. She was 63.

D'Angelo also has a daughter, Imani Archer, who is also a music artist.

In the years that followed, D'Angelo's life became as defined by absence as by acclaim. After “Voodoo,” he withdrew from the spotlight for more than a decade, fueling speculation about personal struggles and creative battles. His long-awaited return came in 2014 with “Black Messiah,” credited to D'Angelo and The Vanguard. The urgent and politically charged album that arrived amid nationwide protests and helped usher in a wave of activist music responding to police killings of Black Americans and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.

The album debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 chart and won him a Grammy for best R&B album, reaffirming his stature as a generational voice. Its standout single, “Really Love,” earned him another Grammy for best R&B song and earned a nomination for record of the year.

In May, D'Angelo withdrew from being a headliner for the 2025 Roots Picnic in Philadelphia due to “an unforeseen medical delay regarding surgery (he) had earlier this year,” the artists shared in a statement. D'Angelo said he was advised the performance “could further complicate matters.”

Beyond his biggest singles, D'Angelo's catalog includes fan favorites like “Me and Those Dreamin' Eyes of Mine,” “Cruisin'” and “Devil's Pie.” His influence stretched far beyond the charts: he inspired a wave of artists including Maxwell, Alicia Keys and Frank Ocean.

The play, in real time to the naked eye, might have looked very close to a violation. LeBron James leaped, got his right hand on the ball with a few tenths of the game's final second remaining and tapped it through the basket to give the Los Angeles Lakers a buzzer-beating win last season.

Referees on the floor called it correctly. Video replay backed up their call, and the Lakers got a victory over the Indiana Pacers.

Turns out, it wasn't close at all.

The NBA has a relatively new tool called “automated officiating,” and the robotic eyes that are now tracking just about everything on basketball courts showed that James was nowhere near committing offensive basket interference on that play. It wasn't needed to decide matters in that case — again, the humans got it right — but the NBA is tapping into technology more and more to ensure that plays like those get adjudicated correctly.

“Turns out, computers are really good at this,” said Evan Wasch, an NBA executive vice president overseeing basketball strategy and analytics. “So, if we can invest in this technology to get more calls right on the objective ones, we do two things.

“One, the accuracy on those calls, by definition, goes up. But we also free up the human referees to not have to focus on those calls and in turn allow them to focus more closely on the really difficult judgment plays that they're so adept at and actually increase accuracy there, too. We think there's what we call double bottom-line benefit to doing this from an accuracy perspective.”




Basketball, of course, is not alone in veering toward higher-tech officiating.

Robot umpires are getting called up to Major League Baseball next season; humans will still make the calls, but teams can challenge ball or strike calls and an automated system will determine if those challenges were successful. Many major tennis tournaments, even Wimbledon, have replaced line judges with electronic line-calling. Soccer has technology to tell referees if a ball fully crossed a goal line or if someone was offsides, calls that in real time might just be guesswork.

It's important to note that NBA referees are not being replaced. Technology is just helping; instead of six human eyes on a court, it's now six human eyes and a whole lot of camera lenses that are there to collect as much data as the league can think of.

“Let's get it right,” Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers said. “And let's get right quicker.”

Those are the goals, the NBA insists. Using technology helps with game flow thanks to shorter review times, helps with the accuracy and also provides transparency in the ability to show fans and players computer-generated images to explain how calls were made.

Cameras in arenas are helping to precisely make calls such as the ones along sidelines and baselines — who was a ball off, was it out of bounds, that sort of thing — as well as determining if blocked shots were good or was goaltending committed on those plays.

“What we're doing is tracking a bunch of objects in space with incredible precision,” Wasch said. “We are tracking a basketball, fingers, feet, heads, hands, all the parts of the body. We're tracking them in space with cameras and sensors. And there's an element of machine learning and artificial intelligence to build those algorithms on top of that to then know what in fact happened from a basketball perspective based on the movement of all those things.”

The technology isn't limited to calls or non-calls.

Some referees have been wearing earpieces during this preseason as the league tinkers with ways for better communication methods. There's been talk at the league of sending alerts to smartwatches about decisions on calls. And at summer league this year, there was even a sensor placed inside the ball to help collect data. The sensor weighs about the same as a raisin does. Hundreds of players used the ball, which typically weighs somewhere around 600 grams; nobody noticed that it was about a gram heavier than usual.

In the end, it's all about making the product better.

“There's actually been a ton of openness from the referees and the referee union on implementing this technology,” Wasch said. “It lets them focus on the things that they train for this job to do.”

PARIS (AP) — French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu on Tuesday announced he would suspend a much-debated plan to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64, in a move aimed at preventing his fragile minority government from being toppled.

After a week of political turmoil, the newly reappointed Lecornu said in a policy speech at the National Assembly that the law, a flagship initiative of President Emmanuel Macron, would be put on hold until after the next presidential election in 2027.

On Thursday, Lecornu will face two no-confidence motions, one from the hard-left France Unbowed and the other from the far-right National Rally. The two parties do not hold enough seats to topple Lecornu's government on their own, but the prime minister could be ousted if the Socialists and others on the left join forces with them.

The Socialist Party, which is not part of the governing coalition, had demanded the law be repealed.

Boris Vallaud, president of the Socialist group in the National Assembly, said his colleagues were ready to take a “gamble,” making clear they would not vote the no-confidence motions. Vallaud called the suspension a “first step” toward scrapping the law.

Lecornu said the suspension would cost 400 million euros ($463 million) in 2026, and 1.8 billion euros in 2027. He said it will benefit 3.5 million French citizens. 

“It will therefore have to be financially compensated, including through cost-saving measures. It cannot be carried out at the expense of an increased deficit,” he said.

France's deficit hit 5.8% of gross domestic product last year, way above the official EU target of 3%. France is also facing a massive debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros, or 114% of GDP. 

Earlier on Tuesday, Lecornu met with his cabinet to discuss the 2026 budget, which must be approved by year's end. He said the main objective would be to bring the deficit below 5% of GDP to safeguard France's sovereignty, stressing the need for fiscal discipline and structural savings.

Among the measures under consideration are cutting red tape, fighting social and tax fraud, targeted tax cuts for small and medium-sized businesses, and exceptional contributions from large corporations.

Lecornu also confirmed that he would not use a special constitutional power to force the budget through parliament without a vote, and would instead seek a compromise with lawmakers.

The so-called “49.3” article allows the government to pass a bill without a vote at the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament. Lecornu's predecessor, François Bayrou, used it to pass this year's budget.

“The government will make proposals, we will debate, and you will vote,” Lecornu told lawmakers.

With his government hanging by a thread, France's newly reappointed prime minister must make concessions to his political opponents. 

The opposite sides of the political spectrum have slammed Macron's decision to reappoint Lecornu, France's former defense minister and fourth prime minister in barely a year.

With less than two years before the next presidential election, National Rally is urging Macron to call another early parliamentary vote, while France Unbowed wants Macron to step down.

Rammed through parliament without a vote in 2023 despite mass protests, the pension change gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Opposition parties want it scrapped.

Those calling for the law to be suspended have gained a high-profile ally. Nobel Prize-winning economist Philippe Aghion told broadcaster France 2 that it should be suspended until 2027.

“I think we need to stop the clock now until the presidential election,” Aghion said, arguing that doing so would be “the way to calm things down” and “it doesn't cost very much to pause it.”

Communist party leader Fabien Roussel called the suspension of the pension reform “a first victory,” while the Greens were unconvinced and announced they would vote to topple Lecornu's government.

Lecornu's reappointment is widely seen as Macron's last chance to reinvigorate his second term. His centrist camp lacks a majority in the National Assembly and he is facing increasing criticism even within its ranks.

Macron's surprise decision last year to dissolve the National Assembly resulted in a hung parliament and political paralysis. 

Over the past year, Macron's minority governments have collapsed in quick succession, leaving France mired in deadlock while confronting a rising poverty rate and a mounting debt crisis that has alarmed markets and EU partners.

            An Iranian lower court handed heavy prison sentences to two French citizens charged with spying for France and Israel, the semi-official Fars news agency reported on Tuesday, a week after Paris and Tehran indicated progress in talks to release them.
    


Cecile Kohler and her partner Jacques Paris are the only two French citizens being held in Iran and have been detained since 2022. An 18-year-old French-German cyclist arrested this year, Lennart Monterlos, was released last week after a court acquitted him of espionage charges.
    


            Without specifically naming the defendants, the court sentenced one French citizen to six years in prison for spying on behalf of France, five years in prison on charges of conspiracy to commit a crime against national security, and 20 years of imprisonment for assisting Israeli intelligence services.
    


            The other defendant was handed 10 years in prison for spying on behalf of France, five years in prison on charges of conspiracy to commit a crime against national security, and 17 years of imprisonment for assisting Israeli intelligence services.
    


            The two defendants can appeal their sentences to a higher court.
    


            France has repeatedly accused Iran of holding Kohler and Paris arbitrarily, keeping them in conditions akin to torture in Tehran's Evin prison and not allowing proper consular protection. The Islamic Republic denies the accusations.
    


            Iran has accused France of arbitrarily detaining Mahdieh Esfandiari, an Iranian student living in the French city of Lyon, who was arrested this year over anti-Israel social media posts.
    


            Iran's judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir said on Tuesday that accusations against Esfandyari were baseless and that France had refused to release her temporarily on bail.
    


            “Follow-ups have taken a while but they have not stopped… We are striving for her release without conditions,” he added.
    


            Iran's Revolutionary Guards have detained dozens of foreign and dual nationals in recent years, often on espionage-related charges. Rights groups and Western countries accuse Tehran of using foreign detainees as bargaining chips, which Iran denies.

Experts created a coding scheme for kids' media quality. Here's what's at the top and bottom.

When it comes to content to watch, kids have a lot of options these days. There are still the classics, like Sesame Street, but also a new kids media titan: YouTube.

So how can a parent make sense of all this different content? And what's the best way for young kids to engage with it?

These are the questions we posed to Dr. Jenny Radesky in this week's episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast.

Radesky is a developmental and behavioral pediatrician at University of Michigan Medical School. She's also a media researcher and a director of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Center of Excellence on Social Media and Youth Mental Health.

She says children's media is very different from how it used to be. “I grew up in the 1980s when we would go watch Saturday morning cartoons all huddled together while my parents slept,” she told Vox. “There was a time and a place when technology could be watched, and that's what's really different about today. Now we have endless content on-demand and we have marketplaces and platforms where these pieces of content are competing for kids' attention.”

Radesky has tools for parents when it comes to best practices for kids and their media consumption. Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Radesky, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

Can you rank the best children's media out there? What is good content and why is it good content?

Our research team at the University of Michigan and I collaborate with folks at Georgetown, University of Wisconsin, and Brigham Young University. We've gotten together to try to create a coding scheme for kids' media quality.

[“Quality”] could be quality education. It could be quality for lovely storytelling that's meaningful to a child. The really best stuff, the stuff that is clearly made with some care and some thoughtfulness is still [like] Sesame Street, the PBS kids stuff like Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, and then there's some newcomers like Bluey and Ms. Rachel.

They might be slower-paced, they might have a good sense of humor. They tell stories that are meaningful to a child's experience, and that is one way that we define good content: It is reflecting back the world that children are in to children and helping them make meaning of it.

We also code for things like designs that just try to capture attention. We call this “bedazzling,” just this extra stuff that's on a YouTube video but often is kind of shallow and gimmicky attention-grabbing content. [For this reason] I'd say AI-generated slop is definitely at the bottom. If you ever see a video that just looks like a computer-generated bunch of cars being driven by Spider-Man and Elsa and the Hulk crashing into a whole bunch of soccer balls, that's the worst and not worth your kids' time and attention. It's all the gimmicky things that kids want to click on so that's why it trends in the algorithm and those videos have billions of views.

So we've mentioned some of the greatest hits, but I have to ask about Cocomelon. Where does Cocomelon fall in the spectrum of children's entertainment?

To speak like my 16-year-old son: Cocomelon's pretty mid. It gets middling scores from our team of coders because it is surface-level educational content. It has lots of extra giggles and pacing that really grabs and holds onto your attention. Everybody's happy. There's no friction, and life is full of friction for little kids.

Even kids need conflict in their media!

That's both how kids grow skills, but it's also how they grow their sense of self. Like, “Huh, I handled that. I figured out how to put a spoon into this slop of baby food and try to get it to my mouth.” We don't need to spoon-feed kids.

We've talked about what kids watch, but what about how kids watch? We got a question from a listener who wants to know if the type of screen matters — say, TV versus a tablet.

That's a great question. We've done a little bit of research comparing when kids read off a print book versus a tablet or when they play physical games versus digital games. Kids create much more of what we called “solitary space” around a tablet. “It's just me and this tablet. It's me and this little sensory cocoon hanging out playing this game.” They don't see it as a shared object the same way that a TV or a deck of cards or a print book is seen as a shared object by young kids.

There's so much informal learning that children do in early childhood, and we can really teach kids that media is for sharing. It's not for when each of us is stressed out and doesn't want to talk to each other. We can set those norms! Make it predictable, make it shared if you can, or at least in a shared space so you can monitor. Also, make it not just whenever your child is fussing. If your child is used to being calmed down or managed behaviorally by media, that could create a dependence. Early childhood is such a great opportunity for kids to learn other emotional awareness and coping skills.

Democratic New York mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani expressed confidence that he is leading a “movement that won the battle for the soul of the Democratic Party” in a progressive-packed rally Monday.

Mamdani spoke alongside embattled New York Attorney General Letitia James, former Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Lina Khan, and a host of other progressive Democrats in Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood.

The state assemblyman is battling with former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa to become the city's next mayor.

The Democratic Socialists of America member got his hits in on President Donald Trump while rallying his movement, which showed up over 3,000 strong at the event.

“Over the last nine months, we have watched the man with the most power in the world expend enormous energy targeting those with the least,” Mamdani said. “Our movement is a movement where we know exactly who and what we are fighting for. We are not afraid of our own ideas. For too long, we have tried not to lose. Now it is time that we win.”

Mamdani shocked New York political observers when he beat Cuomo in the June Democratic primary, signaling that the city wanted a definitive change instead of a return to the establishment. As the Democratic nominee, Mamdani is considered the favorite to win the November election.

James has been a prominent Mamdani ally, even before his primary victory. She is battling with the Trump administration over fraud charges she was recently indicted on. In speaking to a raucous crowd, she said that she expects them all to have one another's backs.

“You come for me, you've got to come through all of us,” she said. “Every single one of us. We're all in this together.”

Khan spoke of an economy under the control of a “handful of modern-day robber barons.” She added that nothing about that reality is “inevitable.”

City Councilman Chi Osse said he believes Mamdani's socialist movement will prevail.

“Understand that this election is to be part of a political revolution that continues inside and outside the halls of government,” he said.

DSA member and New York state Sen. Kristen Gonzalez said Mamdani's movement wants “a mandate” to implement its agenda.

“It's taken a movement to get us to this point,” she said. “It's going to take that same movement to get us over the finish line. Take nothing for granted. We want a mandate.”

Mamdani is expected to win the November election, but Cuomo is also expected to place more pressure on Sliwa to drop out so that he can gather the opposition support against the socialist.

The first mayoral debate is on Thursday.

Mamdani positioned the choice between him and Cuomo as a “choice between democracy and oligarchy.”

“Between a city you can afford or more of the same,” he concluded. “Between the hope of a brighter future or a broken past. We will choose the future.”

            An unusual double-ring structure spotted in space with the help of citizen scientists has turned out to be a cosmic rarity.
    


            The celestial anomaly, captured by a radio telescope, is an odd radio circle, one of the scarcest and most mysterious objects in the universe, said Dr. Ananda Hota, lead author of a study published on October 2 in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.
    


            Odd radio circles, also known as ORCs, likely consist of magnetized plasma — charged gas that is strongly influenced by magnetic fields — and are so massive that entire galaxies reside at their centers. Spanning hundreds of thousands of light-years, they often reach 10 to 20 times the size of our Milky Way galaxy. But they are also incredibly faint, and usually detectable only through radio light.
    


            The newly discovered odd radio circle, dubbed RAD J131346.9+500320, is the most distant one known to date, located 7.5 billion light-years from Earth — and the first discovered by citizen scientists. It's also only the second odd radio circle that has two rings.
    


            “ORCs are among the most bizarre and beautiful cosmic structures we've ever seen — and they may hold vital clues about how galaxies and black holes co-evolve, hand-in-hand,” wrote Hota,  an assistant professor at the University of Mumbai's department of atomic energy's Centre for Excellence in Basic Sciences, in an email.
    


            Odd radio circles were first discovered about six years ago, but the structures remain largely elusive.
    


            Hota is the director and principal investigator of the RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory, an online community open to anyone with a background in science. Astronomers train users to recognize patterns in faint, fuzzy patches of radio waves and analyze astronomical images, Hota explained.
    


            The newly discovered odd radio circle appeared in data from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Telescope, which is comprised of thousands of antennas in the Netherlands and across Europe to create one large radio telescope. It is the largest and most sensitive radio telescope operating at low frequencies.
    


            While RAD@home participants weren't specifically trained to look for odd radio circles, the unusual double-ring structure stood out, marking the first odd radio circle identified using LOFAR. The rings appear to intersect which researchers believe is because of our vantage point from Earth, but they are likely separated in space. The pair span 978,469 light-years across. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, or 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers).
    


Astronomers offer an explosive origin theory for giant odd radio circles in space



            “This work shows how professional astronomers and citizen scientists together can push the boundaries of scientific discovery,” Hota said.
    


            Astronomers once thought the odd radio circles might be the throats of wormholes, shockwaves from black hole collisions or merging galaxies, or powerful jets pumping out energetic particles.
    


            “We suggest that a major explosive event took place in the central galaxy,” Hota said. “The resulting shock or blast wave could have re-energised ancient clouds of magnetised plasma, making them glow again as radio rings.”
    


            The plasma clouds were likely first created by jets of material released by the galaxy's supermassive black hole, Hota explained. A new shockwave essentially illuminated “smoke” left behind by the galaxy's past activity, he added.
    


            Black holes don't directly gobble up stars, gas and dust. Instead, that material falls into a rotating disk around the black hole. As the debris spirals more rapidly, it becomes superheated. The powerful magnetic fields around black holes help channel these energetic, superheated particles away from black holes in jets that nearly reach the speed of light.
    


            The citizen science team also spotted two additional odd radio circles in two different galaxies, including one located at the end of a powerful jet that has a sharp curve, resulting in a radio ring about 100,000 light-years wide.
    


            Both odd radio circles are in galaxies that sit within larger clusters of galaxies, meaning the jets launching from their supermassive black holes interact with surrounding hot plasma that could help shape the radio rings, Hota said.
    


            “These discoveries show that ORCs and radio rings are not isolated curiosities — they are part of a broader family of exotic plasma structures shaped by black hole jets, winds, and their environments,” said study coauthor Dr. Pratik Dabhade, assistant professor in the astrophysics division of the National Centre For Nuclear Research in Warsaw, Poland, in a statement.
    


            Ray Norris, an astrophysicist at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation who led the discovery of odd radio circles, was pleased to see a discovery of the phenomenon using the LOFAR telescope — and with citizen science.

            It's difficult to train AI to spot odd radio circles because there are so few known examples, he said.
    


            “ORCs are really hard to find, but we know there must be hundreds in the data,” Norris said. “At the moment, citizen science look like the best approach and these guys seem to be making a great job of it.”
    


            The discovery of the most distant odd radio circle to date lets researchers effectively look back in time. The team believes that the phenomenon may serve as a way of recording and preserving ancient, violent events that shaped galaxies billions of years ago.
    


            The light from the radio circle has traveled for 7.5 billion years to reach Earth and could provide insights into the roles that odd radio circles play in the evolution of galaxies over different timescales, which is not well known.
    


            “By studying them across different cosmic times, we can begin to reveal how such energetic outbursts influence the surrounding gas and trigger or suppress star formation,” Hota noted. “Our discovery pushes the known boundary of ORCs to nearly half the age of the Universe, providing vital clues about their origins and link to the broader life cycle of galaxies.”
    


            Many questions linger about odd radio circles, including why astronomers only see them at such large sizes. Hota and Dabhade want to know whether the circles expand from smaller bubbles that are undetectable. And if odd radio circles do spring from the mergers of galaxies or supermassive black holes, why aren't they spotted more frequently?
    


            The help of citizen scientists, and next-generation telescopes like the transcontinental Square Kilometre Array in South Africa and Australia, will be needed to answer such questions.

            Now under construction and expected to be completed in 2028, the array will include thousands of dishes and up to a million low-frequency antennas to create the world's largest radio telescope.
    


            Even though these dishes and antennas will be in two different parts of the world, they will form one telescope with more than 1 million square meters (386,102 square miles) of collecting area, allowing astronomers to survey the entire sky much more quickly than ever before.
    


            The SKA, and other telescopes in development, will be able to observe the odd radio circles in much greater detail, helping astronomers learn more about the evolution of black holes and galaxies.

The Supreme Court denied a last-ditch effort on Tuesday by controversial InfoWars founder Alex Jones to overturn a $1.4 billion judgment against him for false claims he made about the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

The high court did not elaborate on its decision to reject Jones's petition for review, which was widely believed to be a long shot. The Supreme Court's order comes days after Jones had asked the justices to pause the judgment against him pending their decision on his petition, a request that is now moot.

Jones was ordered by a Connecticut jury in 2022 to pay the more than $1 billion judgment after falsely claiming the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 26 people were killed, was a hoax.

The families of victims successfully sued Jones for the harm his false statements about the massacre caused them, with multiple appeals courts rejecting Jones's attempts to toss the ruling. Jones's bid at the Supreme Court was his last chance to stop the judgment from being handed down.

Jones's lawyer had argued the high court was “obligated to make its own independent evaluation of the entire record here, which can only be done” by reviewing the case, claiming the lower courts in Connecticut had not properly ensured the families had proven Jones committed actual malice with his comments. The Supreme Court decided the case was not worthy of its review.

EIGHT CASES TO WATCH IN THE NEW SUPREME COURT TERM

Facing the prospect of paying the significant judgment, Jones filed for bankruptcy in 2022, and the courts then sought to take control and sell off his assets to pay the families. Last year, a bankruptcy judge rejected a bid from satirical news outlet the Onion to buy Jones's InfoWars, citing the lack of transparency and uneven playing field in the bid process.

Jones's lawyers said in filings to the Supreme Court that the families “have no possible hope of collecting all” of the $1.4 billion judgment.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro speaks to reporters after the man accused of attempting to set fire to his home pleaded guilty.

A suspected arsonist pleaded guilty in a Pennsylvania court on Tuesday after being accused of setting fire to Gov. Josh Shapiro's mansion in April as Shapiro and his family were asleep.

Cody Balmer, 36, appeared for the plea hearing at the Dauphin County Courthouse in Harrisburg wearing a dark red jumpsuit, handcuffs and ankle chains.

Balmer pleaded guilty to all charges, including attempted murder, aggravated arson, burglary, terrorism and other related offenses.

Shapiro spoke at a press conference following Balmer's guilty plea, calling for "real accountability for acts of political violence" while also asking the public to not "grow numb" to such actions.

"Sadly, as you know, our family is not the only ones to experience political violence, violence that is used to try and silence people or intimidate people," the governor said. "I think it's important that in this time of rising political violence, that none of us grow numb to it or accept this as the normal course of doing business for elected officials."

Balmer allegedly set the fire at around 2 a.m. on April 13 after Shapiro and his family celebrated the first night of the Jewish holiday of Passover. Shapiro and his family were asleep at the time of the incident.

In a 911 Balmer allegedly made after setting the fire, he admits that he set fire to the residence because of what Shapiro "wants to do to the Palestinian people," according to audio obtained by FOX29 Philadelphia.

Authorities said at the time of his arrest that "Balmer admitted to harboring hatred towards Governor Shapiro."  Balmer also allegedly said he planned to attack Shapiro with his hammer if he were to find the governor in the mansion.

Shapiro said that his family, especially his children, has had a hard time dealing with the event.

"We will forever be changed by this," he said. "We know that time will heal, but the scars will remain."

Shapiro said that in the aftermath of the attack, he and his family leaned on their faith and thanked all the others who shared their faith and prayers with his family, along with the firefighters who charged into the burning mansion and state troopers who rushed his family to safety.

"I want you to know we've leaned a lot on our faith these past six months to try and work through this," he said. "We've also leaned on the faith of so many others in the process."

Shapiro's remarks against political violence echo those he delivered in the immediate wake of the attack in April.

"This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society," Shapiro said during a press briefing at the time. "And I don't give a damn if it's coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another. It is not okay and it has to stop. We have to be better than this."

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Max Muncy was inches away from hitting a grand slam for the Los Angeles Dodgers to open the scoring in the National League Championship Series.

Little did he know his 404-foot drive instead would end the top of the fourth inning Monday night in one of the most incredible plays of this or any postseason.

“It's definitely the worst fielder's choice/double play I've ever hit in my life,” Muncy said after the Dodgers' 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1.

Here's how Muncy's potential grand slam turned into an unusual 8-6-2 double play:

With the bases loaded and one out, Muncy hit a long drive to center field, where Sal Frelick jumped and reached over the wall in an attempt to make the catch.

The ball popped out of Frelick's glove and hit the top of the fence before Frelick caught it in the air. Muncy wasn't ruled out because the ball hit the wall — but the Dodgers' runners scrambled back to their bases thinking the ball was caught on a fly.

“I didn't see it hit the wall,” said Will Smith, who was on second base. “I just thought he kind of brought it back in and caught it.”

Frelick fired to shortstop Joey Ortiz, who quickly relayed a strike to catcher William Contreras. Aware a force was still in effect, Contreras alertly stretched for the throw with his right foot on home plate, rather than position himself for a tag that would have been necessary if the ball hadn't hit the wall. 




Contreras caught the ball before Teoscar Hernández slid across the plate, forcing out Hernández after he had hesitated at third base. 

“Teo knows the rule. I think right there he had just a little bit of a brain fart, appreciating that when it does hit the glove, you can tag (up) there,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “But then he tagged, did it correctly, then saw he didn't catch it, (and) he went back. That was the mistake. But he owned it. And after that, there's nothing else you can do about it.”

After the forceout at home plate, Contreras smartly got up and jogged to third to force out Smith, too.

Smith had gone back to second when he thought Frelick made a clean catch.

“From home plate, I had a pretty good view of it,” Contreras said through an interpreter. “I could tell pretty much right away it hit off the wall. Right away once it hits off the wall, you know that ball is played live. Tremendous job by the guys there just doing what we needed to do to finish that play off.”

As all of it was developing, Frelick had his arms out with a quizzical look on his face, wondering what exactly had just happened — not unlike many fans.

The Dodgers challenged the call, but a replay review confirmed the forceouts at home and third for a most unusual inning-ending 8-6-2 double play.

Umpires called it correctly in real time all the way through the play.

“Honestly, I didn't know they ruled it a no-catch,” Roberts said. “I just wanted clarity on the whole situation. And then kind of making sure that they got a couple of forceouts, which they did. And ultimately, those guys and replay, the guys on the field got it right. They nailed it.”

At 404 feet, it was the second-longest projected distance on a batted ball resulting in a double play since Statcast tracking began in 2015 — regular-season games included. For Muncy, it goes down as a grounded-into-double play, even though the ball didn't touch the ground.

There had not been an 8-6-2 double play in the postseason over the last 35 years, the Elias Sports Bureau said. Those type of official scoring details are not always clear in records going back any further.

The most recent 8-6-2 double play in the regular season involved a ball hit by Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa to Cincinnati center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. in April 2004 — though that one ended with a tag at the plate.

The Nigerian man described being roused with other detainees in September in the middle of the night. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers clasped shackles on their hands and feet, he said, and told them they were being sent to Ghana, even though none of them was from there.

When they asked to speak to their attorney, he said, the officers refused and straitjacketed the already-shackled men in full-body restraint suits called the WRAP, then loaded them onto a plane for the 16-hour-flight to West Africa.

Referred to as “the burrito” or “the bag,” the WRAP has become a harrowing part of deportations for some immigrants.

“It was just like a kidnapping,” the Nigerian man, who's part of a federal lawsuit, told The Associated Press in an interview from the detainment camp in which he and other deportees were being held in Ghana. Like others placed in the restraints interviewed by the AP, he spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

The AP identified multiple examples of ICE using the black-and-yellow full-body restraint device, the WRAP, in deportations. Its use was described to the AP by five people who said they were restrained in the device, sometimes for hours, on ICE deportation flights dating to 2020. And witnesses and family members in four countries told the AP about its use on at least seven other people this year.

The AP found ICE has used the device despite internal concerns voiced in a 2023 report by the civil rights division of its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in part due to reports of deaths involving use of the WRAP by local law enforcement. And the AP has identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the U.S. used the WRAP and autopsies determined “restraint” played a role in the death.

The WRAP is the subject of a growing number of federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture, whether used in a jail or by immigration authorities during international flights. Among advocates' concerns is that ICE is not tracking the WRAP's use as required by federal law when officers use force.




DHS has paid Safe Restraints Inc., the WRAP's California-based maker, $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015 during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending. ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the WRAP despite multiple requests, and it's not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

The WRAP's manufacturer says it intended the device to be a lifesaver for law enforcement confronting erratic people who were physically attacking officers or harming themselves.

But ICE officials have a much lower threshold for deploying the WRAP than the manufacturer advises, the AP found. Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled. They said this was done to intimidate or punish them for asking to speak to their attorneys or expressing fear at being deported, often to places they fled due to violence and torture.

The West African deportee described a terrifying, hourslong experience that left his legs swollen to the point where he walked with a limp.

“They bundled me and my colleagues,” he said, “tied us up in a straitjacket.”

ICE and DHS would not answer detailed questions from the AP and refused a request for the government's policy for when and how to use the WRAP.

“The use of restraints on detainees during deportation flights has been long standing, standard ICE protocol and an essential measure to ensure the safety and well-being of both detainees and the officers/agents accompanying them,” Tricia McLaughlin, DHS' spokesperson, said in an email to AP. “Our practices align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.”

The agency would not specify those authorities or describe its practices.

“The use of these devices is inhumane and incompatible with our nation's fundamental values,” said Noah Baron, an attorney for the West African deportees. 

Charles Hammond, CEO of Safe Restraints Inc., said his company has made a modified version of the device for ICE, with changes meant to allow people to be kept in it during flights and long bus trips.

ICE's version includes a ring on the front of the suit that allows a subject's cuffed hands to be attached while still allowing for limited use to eat and drink, he said. In addition, the ICE version has “soft elbow cuffs,” Hammond said, which connect in the back so a person can move for proper circulation but can't flip an elbow out to hit someone.

An AP reporter recounted for Hammond some of the allegations made by people who had been placed in the WRAP for long flights. All of those interviewed by AP said their hands and feet were already restrained by chains. All denied fighting with officers, saying they were either crying or pleading against their deportation to countries they deemed dangerous.

Hammond said that, if true that some people were not being violent and simply protesting verbally, putting them in the WRAP could be improper use. 

“That's not the purpose of the WRAP. If (the deportee) is a current or potential risk to themselves, to officers, to staff, to the plane, restraints are justified. If it's not, then restraints aren't.”

Juan Antonio Pineda said he was put into “a bag” in late September and driven by immigration officers to the Mexico border. It was black with yellow stripes and had straps that immobilized his body and connected over his shoulders — the WRAP.

Pineda, who is from El Salvador, was in the U.S. legally, he said in a video from an ICE detention center in Arizona. On Sept. 3, he went to an appointment in Maryland to get permission for another year, his wife, Xiomara Ochoa, said in an interview from El Salvador. Instead, he was detained by ICE and told he'd be deported to Mexico, but the documents he was shown had someone else's name, he said. Even so, he was sent to the Florence Service Processing Center detention facility in Arizona.

Early morning on Wednesday, Sept. 24, he said officers tied his hands and legs, placed him into the “bag” and drove him four hours to the border. When he refused to sign the deportation papers, Pineda alleges officers broke his right arm and gave him a black eye before driving him back another four hours in the “bag.” The AP was unable to independently confirm how he was injured. Pineda's video shows him with a cast on his arm and bruising on his face.

The next day, Thursday, Sept. 25, they tied him up again, put him in the bag and drove him to the border, where Mexican immigration officials turned him away, he said.

“Eight hours there and back and they don't give me food or water or anything,” he said in the video, which his wife shared with the AP. “Please help me.”

He was ultimately deported to Mexico, Ochoa said.

ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the AP regarding Pineda's case.

In addition to the Nigerian man flown to Ghana, four others interviewed by AP said they were placed in the WRAP and carried onto deportation flights since the first Trump administration.

As U.S. immigration officials move aggressively to meet the president's deportation goals, advocates and attorneys for immigrants are echoing the concerns of the government's own civil rights inquiry that ICE officers aren't trained on how to use the restraints. 

“This should be a last resort type of restraint after they've already tried other things,” said Fatma Marouf, a Texas A&M law professor who has sued ICE over its use of the device. “Just being bound up like that can inflict a lot of psychological harm.”

Some deportees said they were left in the WRAP for an entire fight. A lawsuit filed on behalf of the Nigerian man and four others currently detained in Dema Camp, Ghana, included the allegation from one that ICE left the restraint suit on him for 16 hours, only once undoing the lower part so he could use the bathroom.

“No one should be put into a WRAP. I don't even think they strap animals like that,” recalled a man who said he suffered a concussion and dislocated jaw being placed into the device in 2023 before a deportation flight to Cape Verde, an African island nation. AP's review of his medical records confirmed he suffered those injuries in 2023.

“It was the most painful thing I've been through,” said the man, adding he was restrained most of the 10-hour flight. “Forget the assault, forget the broken jaw. Just the WRAP itself was hurtful.” 

Also, the man said, the metal ring his cuffed hands were attached to — one of the ICE modifications to the WRAP designed to increase comfort — injured him. “When they slammed me face forward on the floor, that metal ring dug into my chest causing me bruising and pain which was part of my injuries that I complained about.”

ICE's current use of the WRAP comes amid an unprecedented wave of masked federal immigration officers grabbing suspected immigrants off the street, and mounting accusations that the Trump administration has dehumanized them, including by subjecting them to cruel and unusual detention conditions.

ICE's use of the WRAP has continued despite a 2023 report by DHS's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, or CRCL, that raised serious concerns over the lack of policies governing its use.

ICE agreed with the internal findings on some points, a then-DHS official involved in the review said, but challenged the notion that the WRAP should be classified as a “four-point restraint,” a designation that would place more limitations on its use. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the inquiry.

DHS largely dismantled the office that produced the 2023 report earlier this year amid widespread government firings, calling it a roadblock to enforcement operations. 

“Without changes to the current training, and the lack of policy, CRCL has serious concerns about ICE's continued use of the WRAP,” wrote the report's authors, who cited a news article mentioning lawsuits claiming the device had led to deaths.

Last year police officers in Virginia Beach, Virginia, placed Rolin Hill in the WRAP, saying he was being combative during an arrest at a convenience store. The officers left Hill in the device when they dropped him at the jail. Video from the jail shows deputies punching the WRAP-immobilized Hill in the head and back. Hill died in a hospital, and while the WRAP's exact role is unknown, Hill's death was ruled a homicide by “positional and mechanical asphyxia due to restraint with neck and torso compression.” Three of the deputies are now charged with his murder, and five were removed from their jobs.

Also last year, in Missouri, prosecutors charged five jailers in the death of Othel Moore Jr., who according to an autopsy asphyxiated in the WRAP. Jailhouse footage showed Moore, who'd also been sprayed with tear gas and placed in a “spit mask” covering his face, repeatedly told officers he couldn't breathe.

AP identified many of the other non-ICE cases involving the WRAP during an investigation into deaths after police subdued people with common tactics that, unlike guns, are meant to stop someone without killing them.

While Hammond insists the WRAP has never been determined as the cause of death when used properly, the AP identified 43 times in which the WRAP was used by police or correctional officers in a case in which someone died. In 12 of those cases the official autopsy determined that “restraint” played some role in the death.

It was often impossible to determine the exact role the WRAP may have played, as deaths often involved the use of other potentially dangerous force on people who in several cases were high on methamphetamine.

The WRAP first appeared in law enforcement in the late 1990s, presented as an alternative to tying a subject's hands and feet together in a practice known as “hog-tying.” It first found widespread use in California jails and today is used by more than 1,800 departments and facilities around the country, according to the manufacturer, which says it has sold more than 10,000 devices. 

Many of these cases have drawn little media attention, such as the 2020 case of Alberto Pena, who was jailed on a misdemeanor criminal mischief charge after getting drunk and damaging the walls and doors at his parents' home outside Rio Grande City, Texas. The 30-year-old became erratic on the way to the Starr County Jail, beating his own head against the inside of the patrol unit and, later, the wall of his cell.

Deputies placed Pena in the WRAP for more than two hours, where he repeatedly cried out for help and complained he could not breathe. But he was left unattended in the device for significant periods of time, court records show, and no medical attention was provided for his self-inflicted head injuries. 

An autopsy ruled Pena's death “accidental,” but a forensic pathologist hired by the family attributed Pena's death in part to the WRAP's “prolonged restraint” and said it “could have been averted” with proper medical care.

“The WRAP should have never been used in this situation. It was a medical emergency and he should have been taken to the hospital,” said Natasha Powers-Marakis, a former police officer and use of force expert who reviewed the case on behalf of Pena's family as part of their wrongful death lawsuit against the county and officers who placed him in the device. The arresting officers had been told Pena suffered from bipolar disorder.

The Starr County Sheriff's Office has denied wrongdoing and maintained Pena did not require medical care. Robert Drinkard, an attorney for the county, told AP the use of the WRAP “was neither improper nor caused Mr. Pena's tragic death.” He added that each deputy involved in placing Pena in the WRAP had been trained in its application.

A federal judge recently dismissed the Pena family's lawsuit, ruling the deputies were shielded from liability. 

In the context of an ICE deportation flight, the use of restraints like the WRAP can be justified, Hammond, the manufacturer's CEO, argues.

ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said. Given the high stakes of a violent confrontation on an airplane, Hammond believes cases like those described to the AP can warrant the WRAP's use, even if the person is already in chains.

However, properly trained agents are supposed to loosen the straps and allow enough movement so the subject can eat and drink, as well as use the bathroom.

“With the WRAP, when it is used properly, it's a shorter fight, which is good for everybody. It prioritizes breathing, which is good for everybody. And you have no more fight and can provide medical care or mental health care or de-escalation efforts,” Hammond said.

Those placed in one of Hammond's restraint suits, however, recount the experience as traumatic.

One of these people was first put into five-point shackles when he became dizzy and tripped while ascending the stairs to board the ICE flight to Cameroon in November 2020. The officer mistook his stumbling as resistance, he said. Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.

Soon, he felt the straps cinching around his legs and upper body.

“They bundled me like a log of wood from all the sides and they were just carrying me like a corpse,” he said.

Another man interviewed by the AP said ICE officers put him in the WRAP after he initially resisted efforts to move him onto a deportation flight in Alexandria, Louisiana, in 2020. He'd fled political violence and persecution in his native Cameroon, and was afraid to go back. He said officers took him out of his cell in front of the other detainees and put him in the WRAP, leaving him for hours in view of the others as a warning to them not to speak up.

“I told him ‘I can't breathe,'” the man said. “He responded, 'I don't care, I'm doing my job.'”

Several U.S. airports will not show Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem‘s video about the government shutdown‘s effects on travel out of concern that it violates the Hatch Act.

Noem blames Democratic lawmakers for the shutdown in the video, which was set to play at every public airport in the United States to warn travelers about the shutdown's effects on travel processes and the Transportation Security Administration.

The refusing airports include those in Portland, Oregon; Buffalo, New York; Seattle, Washington; Los Angeles, California; Charlotte, North Carolina; Cleveland, Ohio; Phoenix, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada, according to a Newsweek report. The airports have cited concerns over the political nature of the video, pointing to the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal government employees from engaging with certain political activities and messaging while on the job, according to the Washington Post.

“It is TSA's top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience possible while we keep you safe. However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay,” Noem says in the video.

Kara Hansen, a spokeswoman for the Port of Portland, which oversees Portland International Airport, told the Washington Examiner that the airport's refusal to show the video was out of concern that the video violated the Hatch Act and state laws. Hansen confirmed that the request to play the video came from TSA.

“We did not consent to playing the video in its current form, as we believe the Hatch Act clearly prohibits use of public assets for political purposes and messaging,” Hansen said. “Additionally, Oregon law states no public employee can promote or oppose any political committee, party, or affiliation. We believe consenting to playing this video on Port assets would violate Oregon law.”

The Hatch Act was passed in 1939 “to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, and to ensure that federal employees are advanced based on merit and not based on political affiliation,” according to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel.

When the Washington Examiner asked the Department of Homeland Security for comment, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin echoed Noem's video, saying Democrats “refuse to fund the federal government.”

“While this creates challenges for our people, our security operations remain largely unimpacted at this time. It's unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship. Our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government,” McLaughlin said.

TRUMP OFFICIALS FACE COMPLAINT OVER WEBSITE BANNERS BLAMING SHUTDOWN ON DEMOCRATS

Portland officials haven't shied away from criticizing the White House lately. The Trump administration sent National Guard troops to Portland to fight crime, against the wishes of its local Democratic lawmakers. There have also been several protests outside Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

The message of GOP congressional leadership and the Trump administration has been to blame the Democrats for the shutdown that began on Oct. 1. Several federal agencies have included website banners that blame Democrats, and several federal agencies' out-of-office email messages also blamed Democrats for the shutdown.

Purdue is No. 1 in the preseason Associated Press Top 25 college basketball poll for the first time.

The Boilermakers earned 35 of 61 first-place votes to top Monday's poll to begin the 2025-26 season. That put Matt Painter's squad ahead of the two teams that played in last year's NCAA title game, with runner-up Houston at No. 2 and reigning champion Florida at No. 3.

“We are obviously excited to get the season going and being ranked No. 1 in the preseason is a great indicator of what we feel this team can accomplish,” Painter said. “But the goal is to be No. 1 at the end of the year. We're thrilled that people think this highly of our team, but there is a long ways to go and a lot of work to do to reach that goal in April.”

Purdue started a year ranked as high as No. 2 once before, in 1987-88 under Gene Keady.

It's another milestone for Painter, the former Keady player who has built his own successful program that is still looking for its NCAA title breakthrough as he enters his 21st season. Purdue had never been ranked No. 1 in any AP poll before the 2021-22 season, which marked the first of three straight seasons in which the Boilermakers have reached the top. The last was during the 2023-24 season behind two-time AP national player of the year Zach Edey in a run all the way to the national title game.

The Boilermakers reached last year's Sweet 16 before falling to Houston on a last-second basket, but return a first-team AP All-American in point guard Braden Smith, scoring leader Trey Kaufman-Renn (20.1) and veteran guard Fletcher Loyer.

Kelvin Sampson's Cougars earned 16 first-place votes to match the program's best-ever preseason AP ranking after last year's finals run. The other No. 2 appearance was by the 1967-68 team led by Elvin Hayes.

Todd Golden's Gators earned eight first-place votes to start this year with their highest preseason ranking since the last time they entered a year as reigning champions in 2006-07, the start of a run to a second straight title.

UConn was next at No. 4 and earned the remaining two first-place votes. St. John's was fifth, with Rick Pitino's Red Storm surpassing the program's previous best ranking in a preseason AP poll (No. 7 in 1984-85).

Duke was next at No. 6, followed by Michigan, BYU — which landed the nation's No. 1 recruit in A.J. Dybantsa — Kentucky and Texas Tech to round out the top 10.

It hasn't taken long for Pat Kelsey to get Louisville back among the national elite, with the Cardinals checking in at No. 11 after a 27-win season to start his tenure. The Cardinals were 12-52 in the two seasons before his arrival.

Louisville is one of five programs with a second-year coach in the preseason poll, joining Michigan, BYU, Kentucky and No. 14 Arkansas with John Calipari.

Kansas checked in at No. 19, the lowest preseason rank for Bill Self's Jayhawks since starting at No. 24 in the 2008-09 season as the reigning national champion. Kansas had been ranked outside the top 10 only once since that year (No. 13 in 2011-12) while starting at No. 1 in 2019-20 as well as each of the last two seasons in that stretch. 

Auburn opens at No. 20 as it enters its first season since the unexpected retirement of coach Bruce Pearl following last year's Final Four run.

Pearl stepped aside last month after 11 seasons, triggering a transition to his 38-year-old son Steven, who climbed his father's staff through the elder Pearl's Auburn tenure but has never been a head coach nor coached elsewhere in college.

The Southeastern Conference, Big Ten and Big 12 each had six ranked teams to make up 72% of the field. The Atlantic Coast Conference and Big East were next with three each, while the West Coast Conference had one with No. 21 Gonzaga. The Big 12 was the only league of that group to have three top-10 teams.

Will Wade's arrival at N.C. State and subsequent roster shakeup has the Wolfpack as the first team outside the poll, sitting just three points behind 25th-ranked rival North Carolina from the ACC. Oregon is lurking close behind entering its 16th year under Dana Altman.

General Motors will record a negative impact of $1.6 billion in its next quarter after tax incentives for electric vehicles were slashed by the U.S. and rules governing emissions are relaxed.

Shares fell less than 2% before the opening bell Tuesday. 

The EV tax credit ended last month. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones. 

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working on easing rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions as the Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric. President Donald Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California's ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales. It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles.

General Motors, which had led the way among U.S. automakers with plans to convert production to an electric fleet of vehicles, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that it will have to book charges that include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion due to EV capacity adjustments. There's also $400 million in charges mostly related to contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments.

GM warned that it may take additional hits as it adjusts production, with non-cash charges potentially impacting operations and cash flow in the future.

The company said that its EV capacity realignment doesn't impact its retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs currently in production, and that it expects those models to remain available to consumers.




EVs were considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM had announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles in the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

In 2021 GM said that it planned to have more than half of its North American and China factories be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025. 

A year later, GM CEO Mary Barra said that the automaker would sell more electric vehicles in the U.S. than Tesla by the middle of the decade. GM also had a goal of making the vast majority of the vehicles it produces electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral, including operations, five years after that. 

Yet U.S. automakers are being hampered in some of their long-term planning, with drastic changes in economic and environmental policy from one administration to the next. The automakers are also facing increased competition from automakers such as China's BYD, which announced in July that its sales grew 31% in the first six months of the year to 2.1 million cars.

BYD's sales have skyrocketed on the back of a government-driven EV boom in China. The rise of BYD and other Chinese electric vehicle makers is a challenge for Tesla and the world's other major automakers as Chinese competitors push into Europe, Southeast Asia and other overseas markets with a relatively affordable option for drivers who want to go green.

EXCLUSIVE — GE Aerospace is launching a new $30 million initiative to bolster the industry's workforce in alignment with an April executive order signed by President Donald Trump.

Trump's order, titled “Preparing Americans for High-Paying Skilled Trade Jobs of the Future,” directs the administration to produce a report within 90 days outlining “opportunities to integrate systems and realign resources to address critical workforce needs.”

The report, written by the Department of Labor in July, directs the government to “seek businesses' help to co-design work-based training and credentialing opportunities, including Registered Apprenticeships for new and incumbent workers.”

Christian Meisner, chief human resources officer for GE Aerospace, suggested to the Washington Examiner that the new initiative, a series of multiyear grants distributed across a five-year window, will not only benefit GE but also the entire American aerospace industry.

“The President has put out a vision to revitalize US manufacturing, and, as a proud US manufacturer, we're wholeheartedly aligned with that,” he said in a statement. “We're doing these initiatives because we believe it's the right thing for the industry and the right thing for GE Aerospace.”

White House officials chose not to comment on GE Aerospace's Tuesday morning announcement.

GE Aerospace officials told the Washington Examiner that the grants will significantly scale up existing apprenticeship and technical skills training programs, such as the Advanced Manufacturing Training Expansion Program in Lynn, Massachusetts. GE Aerospace previously invested a million dollars into AMTEP in February of this year.

In total, the new initiative is expected to train roughly 10,000 workers by 2030 in both pre- and after-market specialties, including airframe and powerplant mechanics, welders, inspection technicians, and more.

Those same officials explained that while the company has expanded its manufacturing workforce beyond pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, the same can't be said of many of their suppliers.

“We're only as good as our supply base, and so part of the thinking here is helping develop the kind of next generation workers for us, yes, but frankly, just as much for our supply base,” one official said.

Furthermore, GE Aerospace officials likened the initial investment to a pilot program, saying they expect other industry players to become involved after the launch.

“Everyone can agree that high-paid, high-tech, often unionized American manufacturing jobs are something we can all get behind,” one official explained. “And so this is one of those things where I think people would love to help. We just need to do a better job of explaining what help we need.”

GE Aerospace Chairman and CEO Larry Culp is expected to speak on the new program Tuesday morning in Cincinnati, Ohio.

A federal judge in Alabama has fined and reprimanded a lawyer who used artificial intelligence to draft court filings that contained inaccurate case citations.

U.S. District Judge Terry Moorer penned an 18-page order that chastised the conduct of Loxley-based lawyer James Johnson, FOX10 Mobile reported.

"The Court further has no difficulty finding that Mr. Johnson's misconduct was more than mere recklessness. … The insertion of bogus citations is not a mere typographical error, nor the subject of reasonable debate," he wrote. "It is just wrong."

Moorer fined Johnson $5,000 and ordered him to alert current and future clients about the error, according to the report.

The judge also referred Johnson to the court's advisory panel to consider removing him from the list of attorneys eligible for court-appointed criminal cases.

Moorer wrote that his reasoning for a reprimand beyond a monetary fine was because it "has become clear that basic reprimands and small fines are not sufficient" to deter this type of misconduct, citing dozens of lawyers making similar errors in cases across the country.

"Yet, the improper use of generative AI is a problem that sadly is not going away despite the general knowledge in the legal community that AI can hallucinate and make up cases. … Somehow the message still has not been hammered home as the epidemic of citing fake cases continues unabated," Moorer wrote.

Four men have been arrested in connection with a mass shooting in Mississippi that left six dead and at least 20 wounded during a high school homecoming weekend celebration, officials said.

Three men — Teviyon Powell, 29, William Bryant, 29, and Morgan Lattimore, 25 — have been charged with capital murder, while Latoya Powell, 44, has been charged with attempted murder, according to the FBI's Jackson Field Office.

The shooting erupted around midnight Saturday in downtown Leland, a small city in Washington County, following the local high school's homecoming football game. Authorities believe the violence stemmed from a personal dispute, though the FBI said no final motive has been confirmed.

MISSISSIPPI HOMECOMING TURNS DEADLY WITH AT LEAST 4 KILLED, 12 INJURED IN SHOOTING

Four of the victims were pronounced dead at the scene, where abandoned shoes and bloodstained pavement were visible the following day. Two others later died in the hospital.

The victims were identified by the county coroner as Oreshama Johnson, 41; Calvin Plant, 19; Shelbyona Powell, 25; Kaslyn Johnson, 18; Amos Brantley, 18; and JaMichael Jones, 34, according to local outlet WBLT.

On Sunday, the FBI released a "seeking information" poster featuring four suspects with unknown identities. Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves shared those images on X, writing that those responsible would be "brought to justice."

"This is not who we are as a community," Leland Mayor John Lee said. "Our hearts are broken for these families."

The FBI, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, and local police continue to investigate and said more arrests are possible.

Gov. Janet Mills (D-ME) launched her campaign Tuesday for next year's Maine Senate race, presenting what Democrats believe will be incumbent Sen. Susan Collins‘s (R-ME) toughest opponent.

The term-limited Mills, who is serving her second consecutive term as governor, boosts Democrats' longtime hopes of picking off one of the Senate's most centrist Republicans in the battleground seat.

“I've never backed down from a bully, and I never will,” Mills said in her launch video, which focused heavily on President Donald Trump. “Honestly, if this president and this Congress were doing things that were even remotely acceptable, I wouldn't be running for the U.S. Senate. But when Trump rips away healthcare from millions of Americans and drives up costs on everything from groceries to housing to trucks and cars, then turns around and gives corporate CEOs a massive tax cut — and Susan Collins helps them do it after she helped him overturn Roe v. Wade — I hear my father's voice saying, ‘Fight back, Janet.'”

JANET MILLS' MAINE SENATE RUN SETS UP GENERATIONAL CLASH AMONG DEMOCRATS

As the only GOP senator serving in a state won by former Vice President Kamala Harris, Collins is viewed by Senate Democrats as the most vulnerable incumbent seeking reelection as the party seeks to overcome an unfavorable midterm map and retake the majority.

But Collins has fought off Republican and Democratic challengers for decades, proving to be a formidable opponent as one of the most centrist and bipartisan members of the Senate. Her second-quarter campaign filings showed a steady stream of money from supporters, raising $2.4 million in the three-month period that ended with June and had $5.25 million cash on hand.

Mills, a top recruit of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), is unable to seek a third consecutive term under Maine law but could seek a third nonconsecutive term in 2030. 

She joins an already crowded field of other Democratic Senate hopefuls who are mostly political newcomers, including brewer Dan Kleban, oysterman Graham Platner, and former congressional aide Jordan Wood. Platner is endorsed by progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

But with the support of Schumer and other national Democrats, as well as her political stature, Mills is considered the de facto front-runner whose election and political experience buoy her party's hopes to unseat Collins.

“There are too many politicians in Washington, including Susan Collins … who've forgotten their principles and let bullies like Trump have their way,” Mills said.

Mills preemptively announced her campaign last week before deleting a launch video and donation link that were posted. Currently 77 years old, she would be 79 when sworn in, marking the oldest freshman senator in U.S. history. Mills's candidacy also tees up a generational clash in the party against several younger political newcomers vying for the nomination. 

DEMOCRATS TARGET SUSAN COLLINS OVER CONGRESSIONAL STOCK TRADING BAN IN NEW AD

Republicans sought to capitalize on what could be a messy primary, as well as Mills's age, in their countermessaging.

“Maine Democrats are locked in a bruising fight between Chuck Schumer's out-of-touchestablishment and Bernie Sanders's far-left radicals,” said Joanna Rodriguez, the communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “Janet Mills wants to be the oldest freshman senator in American history after a record of failure that turned Maine into one of the weakest economies in New England. No matter which Democrat emerges, we're confident Mainers will continue to trust independent problem solver Susan Collins to keep delivering for them.”

            Douglas Jackson, a service-disabled veteran who was laid off during Friday's federal government layoffs, couldn't believe it when he heard the vice president say the Trump administration was being forced to choose between Americans and “federal bureaucrats.”
    


            “I'm an Orlando veteran. I'm not a DC bureaucrat,” he told CNN, just days after the White House sent reduction in force — or RIF — notices to more than 3,500 federal workers. “Either they don't know who they're firing, or they just don't care.”
    


            Jackson, who served in the Marines for four years during which he was exposed to burn pits in Iraq, described a feeling of disgust and betrayal when he heard President Donald Trump say most of those laid off “happen to be Democrat-oriented.”
    


Will the federal government shutdown affect you? Tell us about it



            “There's no way he could know our party affiliation,” Jackson said, noting he's not registered with either party and has voted for Democrats and Republicans alike.
    


            The 40-year-old had been reinstated earlier this year to his public affairs job in the IRS' Large Business and International Division after being cut as part of the Department of Government Efficiency's downsizing. But the latest layoff has left him feeling as if the administration has reneged on its pledge to protect veterans, treating him and others as pawns in the political fight over how best to fund the government.
    


            The Trump administration pulled the trigger on layoffs across seven federal agencies on Friday, dismissing employees who handle a wide range of topics — from IRS matters like those Jackson works on to housing grants, special education programs and defending the country against cyberattacks.
    


            The layoffs came after the White House warned for several weeks that it would use the government shutdown as an opportunity to continue culling the federal workforce. Another wave of RIFs could be on their way, the administration said in a court filing.
    


            The White House Office of Management and Budget advised agencies in late September that the shutdown would provide an opportunity to cut programs that are deemed “not consistent” with Trump's priorities. And although the idea did not sit well with many congressional Republicans, the administration opted to proceed.
    


            Trump doubled down late Friday afternoon, saying that he plans to fire “a lot” of federal workers in retaliation for the government shutdown, vowing to target those deemed to be aligned with the Democratic Party. He did not elaborate on what he meant.
    


            Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that layoffs during the government shutdown are needed to continue critical federal assistance programs, including the WIC nutrition assistance program, and to pay the military.
    


            “We have to lay off some federal workers in the midst of this shutdown to preserve the essential benefits for the American people that the government does provide,” he said on NBC's “Meet the Press,” blaming Democrats for the reductions.
    


            However, budget experts pointed to several reasons why Vance's statement wasn't true. Among them, many federal workers aren't being paid during the shutdown, so laying them off wouldn't free up any funds — plus, if they were being paid, the money wouldn't be available for 60 days, when most must actually leave their jobs, said Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress and a former OMB official during the Biden administration. Also, the Trump administration last week said it will extend WIC's funding using tariff revenue.
    


            What's more, any funds saved by laying off several thousand federal employees would be only a tiny fraction of what's needed to fund WIC and the military, said Michael Linden, a former senior OMB official during the Biden administration who is now a senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth.
    


            Meanwhile, AFGE, along with another union representing federal workers, filed a lawsuit in a California federal court seeking to stop the Trump administration from initiating the mass layoffs, calling them illegal.
    


            The unions pressed District Court Judge Susan Illston on Friday to immediately halt the RIFs now that the administration had started carrying them out. The Friday filing from the government revealing the number of people affected followed unions' request last week for a temporary restraining order to block the administration from carrying out its threat. She has yet to rule on the request.
    


            Jackson also questioned the legality of the layoffs.
    


            “It's retaliatory, it's retribution,” he said. “It creates uncertainty for everyone affected, and I don't know how this stands up in court.”
    


            Here's what we know about the layoffs:
    


            At least 1,300 IRS employees received RIF notices last week, according to a source familiar with the matter. The layoffs affected staff like Jackson in the agency's Large Business and International (LB&I) Division, which handles tax administration for domestic and foreign corporations, as well as in the Information Technology Division and the Office of Privacy, Governmental Liaison and Disclosure (PGLD), a key office that had raised internal legal concerns about certain taxpayer data-sharing initiatives between the IRS and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
    


            The cuts also reached IRS University, the agency's centralized training organization, according to the source. IRS University was established to modernize and streamline employee training and ensure consistent skill development across the agency. The source familiar with the program told CNN, “This was our organization within HR looking at improving and modernizing our training.”
    


            Staff in the department's Office of Minority Economic Impact were informed on Friday of plans for a major reorganization. The division “contains programs, projects or activities that are inconsistent with the Administration's priorities,” according to a memo obtained by CNN.
    


            The letter added that, as a result, the office “will be undergoing a major reorganization, and your position may be reassigned to another organization, transferred to another function, or abolished.” The office is responsible for assessing how the department's energy programs, policies and regulations affect minority communities.
    


            HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD), which oversees grants to support low-income communities, housing and homelessness programs, also faces workforce reductions.
    


            The agency said the cuts followed “determinations made by identifying programs not in alignment with the President's management agenda or the Administration's priorities,” according to a memo from HUD Deputy Secretary Andrew Hughes to union officials, which CNN obtained.
    


            The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at DHS, which is responsible for defending against cyberattacks and safeguarding the nation's critical infrastructure, is among the offices affected by the layoffs. CISA's mission includes improving emergency communications, assessing risks to vital systems and strengthening public-private partnerships to bolster national resilience.
    


            “During the last administration, CISA was focused on censorship, branding, and electioneering. This is part of getting CISA back on mission,” an agency spokeswoman told CNN.
    


            Employees at the EPA's Office of Land and Emergency Management received intent to RIF notices on Friday. The division focuses on hazardous waste cleanup and responding to hazardous waste sites, including overseeing the Brownfields program that helps states clean up and reuse previously contaminated sites.
    


            “It is appalling that the Trump administration is using the government shutdown as an excuse to fire federal workers, including dedicated EPA employees who provide critical services to communities across the country,” Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238 said in a Friday statement.
    


            Workers who had been laid off included employees who oversaw battery recycling and safety, plastics reduction, data collection on national solid waste data collection and recycling grants, Chen said.
    


            Reached for comment on Friday, an EPA spokesperson said, “It's unfortunate that Democrats have chosen to shut down the government and brought about this outcome. If they want to reopen the government, they can choose to do so at any time.”
    


            The Education Department has cut nearly all of its staff that handles special education, multiple sources within the agency tell CNN.
    


            The layoffs largely hit the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS), with the exception of a small contingent of mainly top officials, the sources told CNN.
    


            The office supports programs that serve millions of children, youth and adults with disabilities nationwide.

            “Despite extensive efforts to minimize impact on employees and programs during the ongoing government shutdown, the continued lapse in funding has made it necessary to implement the RIF (reduction in force),” the letter sent to some employees being laid off said.
    


            It is not clear how many of the 466 people laid off at the agency are in the OSERS office.
    


            A Department of Education spokesperson told CNN that “some” of the office's employees will be impacted but would not answer specifics about how many would be affected overall.
    


            Around 1,300 workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received layoff notices late Friday night, but approximately 700 were reinstated on Saturday, according to AFGE. That leaves about 600 who remain laid off.
    


            Staff at CDC's Washington office, in its Violence Prevention programs, and in the Office of the Director of the Injury Center, remain separated from the agency.
    


            Among reinstated employees are staff that publish the agency's flagship journal, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report; the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; the Global Health Center; and the Public Health Infrastructure Center, which manages more than $3 billion in grants to 107 state and local governments to help build local public health workforces. Also, staff and officers at the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service who were able to check their emails received notices that their firings were in error.

            The Trump administration's cancellation of the largest solar project in the United States has sparked confusion and concern among Republicans and Democrats alike.
    


            Known as the Esmerelda 7, the collection of seven solar projects in rural Nevada was set to generate up to 6.2 gigawatts of energy when complete, enough to power 2 million homes. That's an eye-popping amount of power to add to an electrical grid that desperately needs more of it, due to the insatiable demand from AI-related data centers and increasing residential needs.
    


            Under former President Joe Biden, the federal government was moving the sprawling project through the federal permitting process as one proposal. Developers had planned to use 118,000 acres of federal land in Nevada's desert as the home for solar arrays and batteries to store the sun's energy.
    


            Last week, the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management quietly changed the project's status to “canceled” on its federal permitting webpage. An Interior Department spokesperson said the status change was unrelated to the ongoing government shutdown and that project developers and the federal government had agreed to “change their approach” as part of “routine discussions” about the project.
    


            There may still be a path forward for the Esmerelda 7; the Interior spokesperson said developers “will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM” for approval. However, environmental impact analyses can drag on for months or years, making the approval process much longer. And the federal government can also cancel individual projects again.
    


            The project's cancellation was first reported by Heatmap News.
    


            Although the project was greenlit by the Biden administration, it remained controversial with some conservation groups and residents, who feared the sheer size of the solar arrays would impact critical desert wildlife habitat.
    


            Desert tortoises and Joshua trees live in the area that would be developed for the solar array, said Erik Molvar, executive director of the Western Watersheds Project.
    


            “It doesn't make sense to trade off gains in climate while sacrificing biodiversity,” Molvar said. “We don't see the conversion of vast areas of public land to renewable energy as the right solution to the climate crisis.”
    


            NextEra Energy, one of the developers involved, said they “remain committed” to pursuing the project “and will continue to engage constructively” with the Bureau of Land Management, according to company spokesperson Neil Nissan.
    


            The move to pull the plug on the project's permitting approvals drew rare criticism from politicians of both parties.
    


            “This is how we lose the AI/energy arms race with China,” Utah's Republican Gov. Spencer Cox posted on X. “Solar with batteries can now be close to baseload power and we should keep these projects rolling until we get the gas/nuclear/geothermal plants we need.”
    


            Nevada's two Democratic senators blasted the move and urged Interior Sec. Doug Burgum to clarify the project's future.
    


            “The Trump Administration's lack of transparency around wind and solar projects has caused chaos and confusion,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said in a statement, adding solar has been a major economic driver in her sunny state.
    


            “Nevada is a national leader in solar energy as the state with the most solar jobs per capita, and the Trump Administration's attack on this industry will have dire effects on our economy,” added Sen. Jacky Rosen in a statement.
    


            While the Trump administration has largely targeted wind projects via a series of stop work orders and cancellations, it has also created additional hurdles for solar projects to get through federal review. Earlier this year, Trump and congressional Republicans effectively killed tax credits for wind and solar projects, dramatically shortening the timeline during which developers could claim the credits.
    


            An independent analysis from think tank Energy Innovation released this summer showed killing the tax credits would further raise US household energy bills over the next decade.
    


            Since 2022, retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation, according to the US Energy Information Administration, which predicts prices will continue to rise through next year. Electricity prices are Americans' second biggest annual energy expense, after paying for gasoline to fuel their vehicles, the EIA found.
    


            President Donald Trump has made his distaste for wind and solar known in speeches and posts on social media, as well.
    


            “We will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar,” Trump posted on Truth Social in August, calling renewables “the scam of the century.”
    


America was already losing to China on clean energy. Trump just sealed its fate

﻿Maybe we don't want to centralize power over elections in this particular federal government?

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is among the most successful laws in US history. And it is one of the most morally righteous things the United States of America has ever done.

The law was America's first serious attempt since Reconstruction to build a multiracial democracy, and it succeeded beyond even the most radical post-Civil War Republicans' dreams. On the day President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, Black voter registration rates in the Jim Crow haven of Mississippi were just 6.7 percent. Two years after the VRA became law, that rate was 60 percent.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

So the Voting Rights Act, which the Republican justices are expected to take another bite out of during the Supreme Court's new term, was a triumph. But it also rests on assumptions about how power is distributed in the United States that may no longer be true. The sad reality is that we may no longer be able to trust either the executive or the judicial branch with the powers given to them by the Voting Rights Act.

The central problem that the VRA targeted was illiberal states, ruled by white supremacists determined to cut Black Americans out of political power. In the mid-1960s, the federal government were the good guys on racial equality, led by its greatest champion to occupy the White House since President Ulysses S. Grant. In addition to the Voting Rights Act, Johnson signed laws banning race discrimination in employment, schools, hotels, restaurants, theaters, and housing.

So it made sense that his signature voting rights law centralizes power in the federal government. One key provision, which the Republican justices effectively repealed in 2013, required states with a history of race discrimination in elections to “preclear” any new election laws with federal officials in Washington, DC. Another, which is now before the Supreme Court in Louisiana v. Callais, allows federal judges to intervene when a state enacts a law that “results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any US citizen to vote on account of race or color.”

The central premise of the VRA, in other words, was that federal officials in both the executive and judicial branches could be trusted to pursue the goal of racial equality in elections — without regard to which political party would benefit if this goal became a reality.

It is tough to argue that this premise still holds today. The Trump administration gleefully wields power to punish Trump's perceived enemies, and to selectively advantage Republicans. And the Republicans who control the federal judiciary are increasingly no different. How else can one explain Trump's extraordinary winning streak in the Supreme Court?

Thus far, the Court's Republicans have only sought to dismantle the Voting Rights Act. Chief Justice John Roberts, in particular, crusaded against the law for nearly half a century. As a young Reagan administration lawyer, he was a central player in a failed effort to convince Ronald Reagan to veto a 1982 law strengthening the VRA's protections against race discrimination.

If Roberts and his fellow Republican justices strike down the VRA, their party is likely to benefit. The Callais case targets the Voting Rights Act's restrictions on racial gerrymandering. Moreover, while racial gerrymandering is a separate legal concept from partisan gerrymandering (which occurs when the majority party draws maps to reduce representation by the minority party) the two concepts are intertwined. This is especially true in states with large numbers of Black voters. Because Black Americans overwhelmingly prefer Democratic candidates to Republicans, Republicans can often use race as a proxy to determine which voters they want to disempower.

Thus, in the likely event that the VRA's restrictions on racial gerrymandering fall, it will be easier for red states — especially in the South — to eliminate districts that elect Democrats of color and replace them with districts that elect white Republicans. In the South in particular, many red state congressional delegations could become entirely white, as the Republican state legislature draws new maps that deny representation to (predominantly Black) Democrats.

But the justices could do something even worse. The Court's Republican majority frequently applies one set of rules to abortion opponents, and another, more favorable set of rules to the religious right. They manipulate their own calendar to grant swift relief to Trump, while slow-walking decisions that might benefit Democrats.

The Voting Rights Act's language is quite broad, and unscrupulous judges could easily manipulate it to partisan ends. In the future, the law may be worse than insufficient at protecting Americans from disenfranchisement, racial or otherwise. Partisan judges may use this very law, aimed at ending discrimination at the ballot box, as the justification for discriminating at the ballot box.

Democrats, in other words, may need to rethink whether it makes sense to centralize power over something as important as elections in a federal government that is increasingly controlled by illiberal Republicans eager to entrench their own rule.

In the Callais case — the Voting Rights Act case that the Supreme Court will hear on October 15 — the current crop of justices will decide whether to overrule a 1986 case called Thornburg v. Gingles. That case set the framework for when federal judges should strike down legislative maps because they dilute minority representation — and it grew out of a political fight that Roberts lost.

In City of Mobile v. Bolden (1980), the Court ruled that plaintiffs alleging that a state law violates the VRA must show that the state legislature enacted that law with “racially discriminatory motivation.” That's a tough bar to clear, because neither voting rights lawyers nor judges are mind readers. And, by the 1980s, states rarely enacted laws that explicitly discriminated on the basis of race in the blatant way many Southern states did during the Jim Crow era.

In response to Mobile, Congress amended the VRA to add its current language targeting any state law that “results” in someone being denied the right to vote because of their race. Thus, even if a Voting Rights Act plaintiff cannot prove that a particular state law was motivated by racism, the law may still violate the VRA if it has a negative impact on minority representation.

The amended VRA's language is sufficiently broad that illiberal judges could easily read it to achieve much more nefarious ends.

Although Roberts was one of several White House and Justice Department officials who tried to convince Reagan to veto this amendment, Reagan signed it into law in 1982.

To the Reagan era justices' credit, the Supreme Court responded to this rejection of the Mobile decision with good faith attempts to implement the amended VRA. In Gingles, the Court considered what impact the 1982 amendments had on claims that a state's congressional or state legislative maps unlawfully prevented voters of color from electing their preferred candidates. And the Court's answer to that question was fairly ingenious.

Authored by Justice William Brennan, a liberal lion who Justice Antonin Scalia once described as “the most influential Justice of the twentieth century,” the Gingles framework is fairly complicated. But it primarily turns on two questions: 1) whether a state is residentially segregated by race; and 2) whether the states' voters are racially polarized, meaning that voters of one race tend to vote for one party while voters of another race tend to vote for the other party.

The genius of Brennan's approach is that it recognized that, when residential segregation and racial polarization coexist, they produce two separate political communities who will consistently vote for opposing candidates. And, in a state with separate political communities, the majority community can draw maps that leave the minority community with little, if any, representation in the legislature.

Thus, to ensure that both communities are represented, Gingles held that judges must sometimes redraw a state's legislative maps if the state's original maps dilute a minority community's representation. Gingles also has a built-in sunset. As a state grows more integrated, and as its voters become less racially polarized, the VRA plays less and less of a role.

But, if the Republican justices overturn Gingles as expected, Gingles will sunset before many states have fully integrated. And those states could quickly return to the circumstances Brennan was trying to prevent, where white lawmakers intentionally draw maps that deny representation to non-white members of the other political party.

The 1982 amendments' language — which, again, prohibits a state law that “results” in someone being denied the right to vote because of their race — is open-ended. The way the Court read that language in Gingles is certainly a permissible reading of the amended VRA. But it is also safe to say that the elaborate framework Brennan laid out in Gingles does not inexorably flow from the Voting Rights Act's broadly worded text. Brennan, the Supreme Court's great liberal, understood that the primary problems that 20th-century civil rights laws were supposed to address are racial segregation and racial exclusion from the political process. And so he read the VRA in light of this historical purpose.

But the amended VRA's language is sufficiently broad that illiberal judges could easily read it to achieve much more nefarious ends.

Lots of state election laws will, at least at the margins, have a disproportionate impact on one race or another. A MAGA judge could simply read the Voting Rights Act to strike down laws that have even the slightest negative impact on white Republican voters, perhaps stating that they are the racial and political class that needs protection from discriminatory maps. Meanwhile, the same judge could uphold state laws that have much greater negative impacts on racial groups that favor Democrats. Such a judge might even order blue states to draw maps that maximize congressional representation for white Republicans.

Indeed, this scenario isn't even particularly far-fetched, as the current Supreme Court often gives favorable treatment to Republicans and to causes that are favored by the Republican Party.

As I laid out in detail here, the Supreme Court's Republican majority applied one set of rules to Joe Biden and a better set of rules to Donald Trump, and they applied one set of rules to abortion providers and another, less favorable set of rules, to abortion opponents. The Republican justices hand out favors to the religious right like indulgent parents dolling out candy to trick-or-treaters. And, of course, this is the Court which held that Donald Trump is allowed to use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes.

So they could just as easily apply the Voting Rights Act selectively to strike down state laws that supposedly burden white Republicans — while simultaneously blessing voting restrictions that target racial groups that tend to favor Democrats.

In fairness, the current crop of Republican justices have largely resisted this temptation. While their decisions limiting the Voting Rights Act often take extraordinary liberties with the Constitution and with the VRA's text, they've largely attempted to shut down the Voting Rights Act rather than to weaponize it to benefit Republicans. The Republican justices' decision in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), for example, effectively neutralized the VRA's provision requiring certain states to preclear new election laws with federal officials. It didn't green-light red state voter restrictions, while blocking progressive voting legislation in the blue state of Virginia.

But that could change overnight if Trump gets to fill more seats on the Supreme Court. While Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett may not want to use the Voting Rights Act to lock their political party into power, it's easy to imagine a Supreme Court staffed by MAGA judges like Andrew Oldham, James Ho, Aileen Cannon, and Emil Bove doing so.

For a window into how many younger Republican judges approach election cases, consider Oldham's opinion in Republican National Committee v. Wetzel (2024), which was joined by Ho. Oldham claimed that an 1872 law setting the date for federal elections prohibits states from counting absentee ballots that are mailed prior to Election Day, but that arrive after that date — and that somehow no one noticed this prohibition for the previous 152 years.

Trump and his Republican Party have targeted mailed ballots because, in recent elections, Democrats were more likely to cast a ballot by mail than Republicans.

It's difficult to even find a legal argument in Oldham's opinion. But he does spend three whole sentences claiming that Congress's decision to set an election date implicitly requires state election officials to know how many ballots they need to count by the end of that day. He cites no legal authority that supports this argument.

Wetzel shows just how far the next generation of Republican judges are willing to stretch the law to lock their party into power. If they can read a law setting an election date as a license to toss Democratic ballots in the trash, imagine what they could do with the open-ended language of the VRA.

The Voting Rights Act only works if we can trust the people who administer it. And it is potentially a very dangerous weapon in the hands of a hyperpartisan judiciary.

The American left has historically been skeptical of federalism, the idea that some political power should be held by the states and not the federal government, and for good reason. It was a strong Union that defeated the Confederate states and ended slavery. And it was a strong federal government that enacted laws like the Voting Rights Act, which broke the back of Jim Crow.

If American democracy survives the second Trump administration, and if Democrats do regain power in a future election, they must reckon with the question of whether too much power is concentrated in the federal government.

More recently, Republicans have often used dubious appeals to federalism to attack liberal victories in Congress. The first major lawsuit seeking to repeal Obamacare, for example, was at least nominally rooted in an appeal to federalism. Republicans claimed that only the states, and not the federal government, can require people to buy health insurance — even though the federal government has long taxed Americans to pay for federal health insurance programs such as Medicare or Medicaid.

But federalism is also one of the most important checks on Trump's attempts to consolidate his authoritarian rule. Trump, for example, is pressuring Republican states to redraw their congressional maps to lock Democrats out of power in the US House — something Texas has already done. But these red state gerrymanders can only do so much, because not all states are red. And blue states like California may enact their own gerrymanders to balance out the impact of the new Texas maps.

In an alternative version of the United States where congressional maps were drawn by Congress, by contrast, the GOP could redraw the maps in all 50 states to maximize their own power. At a minimum, states having the power to draw their own maps prevents Congress or the president from manipulating maps in Democratic-controlled states to Republicans' benefit.

Similarly, another important check on federal power is that the US government does not actually employ very many law enforcement officers. And, under the Supreme Court's “anti-commandeering” doctrine, the federal government is not allowed to take control over state or local police — or, at least, it cannot do so without the state's consent. So this aspect of US federalism prevents Trump from transforming every beat cop in America into his own personal enforcement squad.

Right now, liberals and Democrats — at least at the federal level — can only watch in impotent horror as Trump tries to become an American Viktor Orbán. Democrats have little power in Congress. And the federal judiciary, which is supposed to be the Constitution's last defense against an aspiring dictator, is led by a Supreme Court dominated by Republicans who've acted like sycophants toward Trump.

But, if American democracy survives the second Trump administration, and if Democrats do regain power in a future election, they must reckon with the question of whether too much power is concentrated in the federal government. Laws like the Voting Rights Act were written on the assumption that federal officials, and particularly federal judges, could be trusted to apply the law in a fair and nonpartisan way. But that assumption is no longer true. And the courts will only grow more partisan and more sympathetic to MAGA authoritarianism as Trump fills more seats on the federal bench.

Perhaps, by 2028, American voters will be so sick of MAGA Republicanism that they will give Democrats the power to do something even President Franklin D. Roosevelt couldn't accomplish at the height of his power and popularity: packing the Court with more Democratic justices to dilute the votes of its current Republican majority. But, realistically, that is unlikely to happen. The federal judiciary is likely to be controlled by highly partisan Republicans for decades.

And that sad reality, at the very least, requires liberals and Democrats to confront the question of whether we can still have nice things — at least when those nice things depend on the premise that federal judges can be trusted.

Gov. Janet Mills (D-ME) announced her long-expected candidacy Tuesday for the Maine Senate seat held by Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), teeing up a perennial high-stakes battleground race against two longtime politicians with broad name recognition.

The campaign by Mills, 77, exposes a trend this cycle of Senate Democrats' establishment wing relying on an older string of candidates to carry the party's long-shot quest of retaking the upper chamber.

MAINE GOV. JANET MILLS LAUNCHES SENATE CHALLENGE TO SUSAN COLLINS

Mills would be 79 if she takes office, making her the oldest freshman senator in U.S. history. She joins Democrats such as former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and former Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who are also seeking to knock off Republican senators in their respective states. If elected and sworn in, Cooper will be 69, and Brown will be 74.

With the Senate's average age nearly 65, the Senate hopefuls aren't much older than many of their would-be colleagues. But the trio, if they secure their party's nominations, would buck a growing trend among Democrats of calls for generational change among its aging members.

If she's reelected to a sixth consecutive six-year term, Collins would be 74 when sworn in. Mills preemptively announced her campaign last week before deleting a posted launch video and donation link.

“I'm not sure it's the age that matters. I think what matters is they've been around so long,” Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said of the party's candidates. “It's more that they're perceived by young progressives as part of a political establishment they don't like very much. That is a problem Mills is going to have to cope with.”

Mills joins an already crowded primary field of mostly younger political newcomers, but she's viewed by national Democrats and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) as the strongest competition to Collins. Others in the race include 48-year-old brewery owner Dan Kleban, 35-year-old former congressional chief of staff Jordan Wood, and 41-year-old military veteran and oyster farmer Graham Platner, backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

In a nod to the large age gap between her and her opponents, Mills pledged to only serve one term, calling her campaign “urgent” to take on President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.

“Honestly, I would not plan to serve for more than one term,” Mills told NBC News. “But this time is vital, and this moment in our history is urgent and very troublesome. And I believe I'm the most qualified person for the seat, for the campaign, because I have run two statewide elections, and I have the energy and the wherewithal to do it.”

The campaign arm of Senate Republicans is seeking to make age and the generational and ideological split among the Democratic primary contenders an issue in the race.

“Maine Democrats are locked in a bruising fight between Chuck Schumer's out-of-touchestablishment and Bernie Sanders' far-left radicals,” said Joanna Rodriguez, the communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “Janet Mills wants to be the oldest freshman senator in American history after a record of failure that turned Maine into one of the weakest economies in New England. No matter which Democrat emerges, we're confident Mainers will continue to trust independent problem solver Susan Collins to keep delivering for them.”

The NRSC unveiled a new anti-Mills opposition website and digital ad, which was generated, in part, using AI software.

“As governor, Janet Mills failed Maine. Now, she wants a promotion,” the ad states, citing her stances on state taxes, transgender athletes, immigration, and the economy. “Luckily for Maine, the answer is simple. No thanks, Janet.”

Susan Wild, a former Pennsylvania Democratic congresswoman who was narrowly unseated last year by Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-PA), lamented that Mills was too old to run.

“Janet Mills is ten years older than I am, and now I'm wondering why I decided not to run for Congress again next year because I didn't want to be part of the aging problem in Congress,” Wild posted. “And, if she wins, her term would be SIX years, making her 84 at the end of her first term.”

In the House, where the average age is younger at 57.5, older Democrats face increasing pressure to step aside for younger generations but have so far rebuffed such calls. Three House Democrats, all in their 70s, have died while in office since March.

Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), 88, is seeking a 19th consecutive term as a nonvoting delegate. She's being challenged by other Democrats, including former Democratic National Committee official Kinney Zalesne and D.C. Council members Brooke Pinto and Robert White Jr.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), 49, has called on Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD), the 86-year-old who stepped down in 2022 as the House Democratic leader, to “step aside” over his ties to the pro-Israel lobbying group American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

“And you wonder why the majority of Democrats are fed up with our leaders & are done with the status quo,” Khanna recently posted. “Step [aside], make way for new leaders.”

The age debate boiled over earlier this year at DNC headquarters after national party leaders ousted former Vice Chairman David Hogg for stirring controversy by pledging to financially bolster primary challengers to older Democratic incumbents. Hogg's Democratic youth-focused group, Leaders We Deserve, along with other similar organizations, endorsed Platner on Tuesday.

MAINE GOVERNOR JANET MILLS ANNOUNCES RUN FOR SENATE, BUT TOOK DOWN CAMPAIGN POST

But Bannon, the Democratic strategist, also sees a potential scenario in Maine reminiscent of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, where anti-establishment progressives still rallied behind Joe Biden in a unified effort to defeat Trump in the general election.

“I think even insurgent Democrats are so intent on beating, and getting rid of, Collins and eking out a Democratic Senate majority just to slow Trump down that they're going to be willing to overlook their concerns about establishment figures,” Bannon predicted.

News organizations including The New York Times, The Associated Press and the conservative Newsmax television network said Monday they will not sign a Defense Department document about its new press rules, making it likely the Trump administration will evict their reporters from the Pentagon.

Those outlets say the policy threatens to punish them for routine news gathering protected by the First Amendment. The Washington Post, The Atlantic and Reuters on Monday also publicly joined the group that says it will not be signing. AP confirmed Monday afternoon that it would not sign. 

“Reuters is bound by its commitment to accurate, impartial and independent news,” the agency said in a statement. “We also steadfastly believe in the press protections afforded by the U.S. Constitution, the unrestricted flow of information and journalism that serves the public interest without fear or favor. The Pentagon's new restrictions erode these fundamental values.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reacted by posting the Times' statement on X and adding a hand-waving emoji. His team has said that reporters who don't acknowledge the policy in writing by Tuesday must turn in badges admitting them to the Pentagon and clear out their workspaces the next day.

The new rules bar journalist access to large swaths of the Pentagon without an escort and say Hegseth can revoke press access to reporters who ask anyone in the Defense Department for information — classified or otherwise — that he has not approved for release.




Newsmax, whose on-air journalists are generally supportive of President Donald Trump's administration, said that “we believe the requirements are unnecessary and onerous and hope that the Pentagon will review the matter further.”

Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the rules establish “common sense media procedures.”

“The policy does not ask for them to agree, just to acknowledge that they understand what our policy is,” Parnell said. “This has caused reporters to have a full blown meltdown, crying victim online. We stand by our policy because it's what's best for our troops and the national security of this country.”

Hegseth also reposted a question from a follower who asked, “Is this because they can't roam the Pentagon freely? Do they believe they deserve unrestricted access to a highly classified military installation under the First Amendment?”

Hegseth answered, “yes.” Reporters say neither of those assertions is true.

Pentagon reporters say signing the statement amounts to admitting that reporting any information that hasn't been government-approved is harming national security. “That's simply not true,” said David Schulz, director of Yale University's Media Freedom & Information Access Clinic.

Journalists have said they've long worn badges and don't access classified areas, nor do they report information that risks putting any Americans in harm's way.

“The Pentagon certainly has the right to make its own policies, within the constraints of the law,” the Pentagon Press Association said in a statement on Monday. “There is no need or justification, however, for it to require reporters to affirm their understanding of vague, likely unconstitutional policies as a precondition to reporting from Pentagon facilities.”

Noting that taxpayers pay nearly $1 trillion annually to the U.S. military, Times Washington bureau chief Richard Stevenson said “the public has a right to know how the government and military are operating.”

Trump has applied pressure on news organizations in several ways, with ABC News and CBS News settling lawsuits related to their coverage. Trump has also filed lawsuits against The New York Times and Wall Street Journal and moved to choke off funding for government-run services like the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

OpenAI on Tuesday announced a council of eight experts who will advise the company and provide insight into how artificial intelligence could affect users' mental health, emotions and motivation. 

The group, which is called the Expert Council on Well-Being and AI, will initially guide OpenAI's work on its chatbot ChatGPT and its short-form video app Sora, the company said. Through check-ins and recurring meetings, OpenAI said the council will help it define what healthy AI interactions look like.

OpenAI has been expanding its safety controls in recent months as the company has faced mounting scrutiny over how it protects users, particularly minors.

In September, the Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry into several tech companies, including OpenAI, over how chatbots like ChatGPT could negatively affect children and teenagers. OpenAI is also embroiled in a wrongful death lawsuit from a family who blames ChatGPT for their teenage son's death by suicide.

The company is building an age prediction system that will automatically apply teen-appropriate settings for users under 18, and it launched a series of parental controls late last month. Parents can now get notified if their child is showing signs of acute distress, for instance.

OpenAI said it began informally consulting with members of its new expert council as it was building its parental controls. The company brought on additional experts in psychiatry. psychology and human-computer interaction as it formalized the council, which officially launched with an in-person session last week.

In addition to its expert council, OpenAI said it is also working with researchers and mental health clinicians within the Global Physician Network who will help test ChatGPT and establish company policies. 

Here are the members of OpenAI's Expert Council on Well-Being and AI:

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday suggested the central bank is nearing a point where it will stop reducing the size of its bond holdings, but gave no long-run indication of where interest rates are heading.

Speaking to the National Association for Business Economics' conference in Philadelphia, Powell provided a dissertation on where the Fed stands with "quantitative tightening," or the effort to reduce the more than $6 trillion of securities it holds on its balance sheet.

While he provided no specific date of when the program will cease, he said there are indications that the Fed is nearing its goal of "ample" reserves available for banks.

"Our long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions," Powell said in prepared remarks. "We may approach that point in coming months, and we are closely monitoring a wide range of indicators to inform this decision."

Though balance sheet questions are in the weeds for monetary policy, they matter to financial markets.

When financial conditions are tight, the Fed aims for "abundant" reserves so that banks have access to liquidity and can keep the economy running. As conditions change, the Fed aims for "ample" reserves, a step down that prevents too much capital from sloshing around the system.

During the Covid pandemic, the central bank had aggressively purchased Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, swelling the balance sheet to close to $9 trillion.

Since mid-2022, the Fed has been gradually allowing maturing proceeds of those securities to roll off the balance sheet, effectively tightening one leg of monetary policy. The question had been how far the Fed needed to go, and Powell's comments indicate that the end is close.

He noted that "some signs have begun to emerge that liquidity conditions are gradually tightening" and could be signaling that reducing reserves further would hinder growth. However, he also said the Fed has no plans to go back to its pre-Covid balance sheet size, which was closer to $4 trillion.

On a related matter, Powell noted concerns over the Fed continuing to pay interest on bank reserves.

The Fed normally remits interest it earns from its holdings to the Treasury general fund. However, because it had to raise interest rates so quickly to control inflation, it has seen operating losses. Congressional leaders such as Sen. Ted Cruz, (R-Texas) have suggested terminating the payments on reserves.

However, Powell said that would be a mistake and would hinder the Fed's ability to carry out policy.

"While our net interest income has temporarily been negative due to the rapid rise in policy rates to control inflation, this is highly unusual. Our net income will soon turn positive again, as it typically has been throughout our history," he said. "If our ability to pay interest on reserves and other liabilities were eliminated, the Fed would lose control over rates."

On the larger issue of interest rates, Powell generally stuck to the recent script, namely that policymakers are concerned that the labor market is tightening and skewing the balance of risks between employment and inflation.

"While the unemployment rate remained low through August, payroll gains have slowed sharply, likely in part due to a decline in labor force growth due to lower immigration and labor force participation," he said. "In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen."

Powell noted that the Federal Open Market Committee responded in September to the situation with a quarter percentage point reduction on the federal funds rate. While markets strongly expect two more cuts this year, and several Fed officials recently have endorsed that view, Powell was noncommittal.

"There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate the tension between our employment and inflation goals," he said.

The Fed has been hampered somewhat by the government shutdown and the impact it has had on economic data releases. Policymakers rely on metrics like the nonfarm payrolls report, retail sales and various price indexes to make their decisions.

Powell said the Fed is continuing to analyze conditions based on the data that is available. 

"Based on the data that we do have, it is fair to say that the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting four weeks ago. "Data available prior to the shutdown, however, show that growth in economic activity may be on a somewhat firmer trajectory than expected."

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has said it has called workers back to prepare the monthly consumer price index report, which will be released next week.

Powell said available data has showed that goods prices have increased, largely a function of tariffs rather than underlying inflation pressures.

President Donald Trump could still slap China with 100% tariffs on Nov. 1 or sooner, depending on Beijing's next move in a dispute over rare earths, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC Tuesday.

"A lot depends on what the Chinese do," Greer told CNBC in an interview. "They are the ones who have chosen to make this major escalation."

China announced sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports last week that would disrupt U.S. defense, technology, semiconductor and automobile industries if implemented.

Trump retaliated with the threat of massive tariffs that would effectively shut down trade between the world's two largest economies. But the president appeared to dial back his rhetoric earlier this week, saying saying "it will all be fine" with China.

"We can't have a situation where the Chinese keep this regime in place, where they want to have veto power over the world's high tech supply chains," the U.S. trade representative said.

The restrictions took the White House by surprise ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit later this month in Seoul, South Korea.

Trump and Xi are still scheduled to meet, Greer said, though he suggested those plans are subject to change depending on how the situation develops.

"Whether it will go through or not, I don't want to precommit either ourselves or the Chinese," Greer said of the meeting. "But I think it makes sense for people to talk when they can."

U.S. and Chinese officials at the senior staff level spoke as recently as Monday in Washington about the rare earth dispute, Greer said.

"We think we'll be able to work through it," Greer said of the trade dispute.

The U.S. stock market erased about $2 trillion in value on Friday in response to Trump's tariff threat against China. The White House watches the market, Greer said, but the administration is focused on building long-term economic success by bringing supply chains back to the U.S., and reducing dependence on China.

"We want to make sure that the market is also responding to appropriate information," Greer said. "You've seen the market settle out this week as they realize that the president and his team, we want to work with the Chinese."

Rare earths are critical minerals used to manufacture magnets, which are key inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, the semiconductor industry and other applications.

China controls about 60% of rare earth mining and more than 90% of refining worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency. The U.S. is dependent on China for roughly 70% of its rare earth imports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The Department of Justice has seized about $15 billion worth of bitcoin held in cryptocurrency wallets owned by a man who oversaw a massive "pig butchering" fraud operation based in Cambodia, prosecutors said Tuesday.

The seizure is the largest forfeiture action by the DOJ in history.

An indictment charging the alleged pig butcher, Chen Zhi, was unsealed Tuesday in federal court in Brooklyn, New York.

Zhi, who is also known as "Vincent," remains at large, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York.

He was identified in court filings as the founder and chairman of Prince Holding Group, a multinational business conglomerate based in Cambodia, which prosecutors said grew "in secret .... into one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organizations. 

U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella said that Zhi "directed one of the largest investment fraud operations in history, fueling an illicit industry that is reaching epidemic proportions."

"Prince Group's investment scams have caused billions of dollars in losses and untold misery to victims around the world, including here in New York, on the backs of individuals who have been trafficked and forced to work against their will," Nocella said.

The Prince Group, which operates businesses in more than 30 countries, ran "forced-labor scam compounds across Cambodia," the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a press release.

"Individuals held against their will in the compounds engaged in cryptocurrency investment fraud schemes, known as 'pig butchering' scams, that stole billions of dollars from victims in the United States and around the world," the release said.

The scams duped people contacted via social media and messaging applications online into transferring cryptocurrency into accounts controlled by the scheme with false promises that the crypto would be invested and produce profits, according to the office.

"In reality, the funds were stolen from the victims and laundered for the benefit of the perpetrators," the release said. "The scam perpetrators often built relationships with their victims over time, earning their trust before stealing their funds."

Prosecutors said that hundreds of people were trafficked and forced to work in the scam compounds, "often under the threat of violence."

Zhi and a network of top executives in the Prince Group are accused of using political influence in multiple countries to protect their criminal enterprise and paid bribes to public officials to avoid actions by law enforcement authorities targeting the scheme, according to prosecutors.

Multiple major U.S. airports are refusing to air a video showing Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats in Congress for the ongoing federal government shutdown.

The Transportation Security Administration sent requests to airports to air the video on screens near security lines.

Noem in the video says, "It is TSA's top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe," according to MSNBC.

"However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay," says Noem, whose department oversees the TSA.

Some airports that refused to show Noem's video cited its political nature, with a few directly pointing to the Hatch Act, which prohibits certain political activities by government employees.

The airports that refused to show Noem's video include the three major airports in the New York City area — John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in Queens, and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.

"The Port Authority's longstanding policies prevent airing of politically partisan messages at our facilities, so airports are not airing the video on airport-controlled screens," said a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates those three airports.

A spokesperson for the Port of Seattle, which operates Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, in a statement, said, "The Port of Seattle will not play the video on its screens at SEA Airport, due to the political nature of the content."

"We continue to urge bipartisan efforts to end the government shutdown and are working to find ways to support federal employees working without pay at SEA during the shutdown," the spokesperson said.

A spokesperson for Charlotte Douglas International Airport said, North Carolina municipal law as well as CLT Airport's policy for digital content do not permit the referenced video."

"Additionally, TSA does not own any monitors at the airport's checkpoints," the spokesperson said. "The limited digital screens owned by CLT are designated for static content that supports wayfinding, provides essential travel information and promotes CLT's revenue-generating services."

Spokespeople for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas said those facilities declined to post the video because of policies barring political content.

"Per airport regulations, the terminals and surrounding areas are not designated public forums, and the airport's intent is to avoid the use of the facility for political or religious advocacy," a spokesperson for Harry Reid International said.

"Additionally, as a facility that hosts federal operations, we remain mindful of the Hatch Act's restrictions on political activity in government workplaces. We remain committed to providing travelers with clear information that supports a smooth and efficient screening process."

The Port of Portland, which operates Portland International Airport in Oregon, received a request from TSA to show Noem's video message about the shutdown. "However, we did not consent to playing the video in its current form, as we believe the Hatch Act clearly prohibits use of public assets for political purposes and messaging," Molly Prescott, aviation communications manager for the Port told CNBC by email. 

"Additionally, Oregon law states no public employee can promote or oppose any political committee, party, or affiliation. We believe consenting to playing this video on Port assets would violate Oregon law."

Cleveland Hopkins International Airport has reportedly refused to show Noem's video. CNBC has reached out to representatives for the airport. 

In a statement to CNBC, Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, reiterated comments that Noem made on the video.

"While this creates challenges for our people, our security operations remain largely unimpacted at this time," McLaughlin added.

"It's unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship," she said.

"Our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government."

A shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown has caused flight delays and disruptions, CNBC reported last week.

On Friday, airlines told travelers to brace for delays over the Columbus Day holiday weekend due to staffing shortages.

Last week, delayed flights occurred across the U.S. at airports including Burbank, California, and Nashville, Tennessee. Bad weather was also expected to contribute to the delays.

Air travel was snarled during the more than monthlong government shutdown that ended in January 2019, hours after a shortfall of air traffic controllers disrupted flights in the New York area.

Before that, some airport security checkpoints were closed due to elevated sick calls from Transportation Security Administration screeners who are also working without pay.

On Tuesday, air traffic controllers received their first partial paycheck. If the shutdown continues, they will miss a full paycheck on Oct. 28.

The government shutdown began Oct. 1 after the Senate failed to pass stopgap funding measures that would have maintained normal operations, at least for a while.

Republicans, who hold a majority in the Senate, want to approve a so-called clean resolution passed by the House that would provide only short-term funding. Democrats insist that any such continuing resolution include a provision to extend the life of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.

Those credits, which are due to expire at the end of 2025, lower the cost of health insurance for 22 million Americans who purchase plans from Obamacare marketplaces.

The Senate is expected to vote again on Tuesday on funding resolutions, which have little chance of passing.

A surge in artificial intelligence infrastructure spending is lifting GDP and driving market optimism, but some experts warn the boom could be concealing underlying economic weakness.

Global AI investment is forecast to reach $375 billion in 2025 and top $500 billion by 2026, according to UBS. That flood of capital is reshaping how and where money is flowing across the economy.

"It's the start of trillions being spent in this build out of the fourth Industrial Revolution," said Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities.

"Big tech right now is doing the equivalent of building Vegas in the 1950s where there was just sand. Dubai 30 years ago. That's what's happening with this AI infrastructure build out from the chips to the data centers to the grid. You're really building out the future economy for consumers and enterprises," he added.

But some experts are skeptical of the sustainability of the AI-driven momentum.

A September 2025 analysis from Deutsche Bank argued that without AI-related investment, the US economy might already be in a recession.

"GDP is being driven by all this investment," said Barry Knapp, managing partner at Ironsides Macroeconomics. "Earnings growth is being driven by all this investment. The S&P 500... [is] pretty unbalanced right now. And that does create a vulnerability to an investment bust at a point when we've blown out government spending to unprecedented levels."

Many are comparing the moment to the dotcom bubble in the late 90s. Unlike the dot-com boom, where companies had little revenue, many of today's AI giants are bringing in a lot of cash, but some experts are worried it may not be enough to sustain the elevated level of spending. Some companies are turning to the bond market to finance the infrastructure expansion by issuing debt that they plan to pay back later. Oracle, Meta and CoreWeave have each raised billions in debt or private credit to finance new data center infrastructure.

"As we go through the rest of these incredible estimates of how much capital is going to be required to build out this infrastructure to avoid seeing electricity prices continue to go up for the public, is going to require a lot of debt over time," Knapp said.

"The labor market looks very, very weak to me," he added. "It's on the precipice of a more pronounced decline."

Despite the risks, many see long-term upside from the current investment cycle and bullish investors remain optimistic.

"Will there be bumps along the road? Yeah but I don't fear that this is too big to fail given it's propped up by tech. Trillions on the balance sheet, generating another $3 to $400 billion of cash a year," Ives said.

"The reality is it's an arms race US versus China," Ives added. "And they don't have time to slow down because China is accelerating as well. And I think that's bullish in terms of the capex cycle that I really view as an AI supercycle."

Walmart said Tuesday it has struck a deal with OpenAI to allow shoppers to make faster purchases directly through artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT.

With the move, the retail giant and largest U.S. grocer is trying to keep up with changes in how consumers discover items to buy. Along with purchasing items they see on social media or products recommended by retailers, shoppers are increasingly going to ChatGPT or similar AI chatbots for gift ideas or help finding the best deals.

"For many years now, eCommerce shopping experiences have consisted of a search bar and a long list of item responses," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a news release. "That is about to change."

He said the AI feature will be "multi-media, personalized and contextual," adding that Walmart is "running towards that more enjoyable and convenient future."

The company did not say when shoppers would be able to start buying Walmart items on ChatGPT.

In late September, OpenAI first announced the Instant Checkout feature that will soon allow shoppers to buy items through Walmart, and said it would initially support single-item purchases from Etsy sellers. OpenAI said at the time that more than one million Shopify merchants, including Skims and Glossier, would be coming soon.

The Instant Checkout feature is a new moneymaker for OpenAI. Walmart did not disclose any financial terms of the deal, but OpenAI has previously said it will charge companies a fee for transactions completed through ChatGPT.

Along with the OpenAI deal, Walmart has an AI-powered shopping assistant on its app called Sparky.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused China of trying to weaken the global economy by slapping export controls on resources vital for technology.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Bessent said the moves over rare earths and minerals are an attempt by China "to pull everyone else down with them."

"If they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most," he said.

The move by China comes just ahead of a scheduled meeting between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping. 

In an Oct. 9 announcement Beijing said it won't allow the export of rare earths materials for military use, the first time it has targeted that specific use. The U.S. uses rare earths magnets for many of its most important weapons systems such as the F-35 warplane, Tomahawk missiles and smart bombs.

Trump has responded with 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 and has threatened to cancel the meeting with Xi. Markets have been volatile since the dispute escalated, with Wall Street stock averages down sharply to start the day Tuesday.

"They are in the middle of a recession/depression, and they are trying to export their way out of it. The problem is they're exacerbating their standing in the world," Bessent told the FT.

Government bonds rallied across the globe on Tuesday as risk-off sentiment gripped equity markets and saw investors piling into safer assets.

Stocks listed in Europe and Asia lost ground and U.S. stock futures dropped as investors weighed the potential fallout from renewed U.S.-China trade tensions after President Donald Trump slapped new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods. The levies, which will apply to Chinese imports from Nov. 1, came in response to Beijing tightening export controls on critical rare earth minerals.

Trump's initial announcement on Friday saw $2 trillion in value wiped off of stock markets.

Government bonds rallied across the globe on Tuesday. The yield on the U.K.'s benchmark 10-year government bonds, known as gilts, lost 8 basis points by 1:46 p.m. in London (8:46 a.m. ET), while yields on U.S. 10-year Treasurys were 3 basis points lower, paring deeper losses seen earlier in the day. Yields on government bonds in France, Germany, Italy, Australia and Japan also edged lower.

One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Bond yields reflect borrowing costs for the governments who issue them, but can have an effect on mortgage rates, investment returns, the wider economy and personal borrowing.

Certain markets have their own domestic issues at play. An uptick in unemployment in the U.K., political instability in France, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown are also influencing investors in those respective markets, for example.

However, market watchers told CNBC that Tuesday's rally in sovereign bonds was largely due to a broad move into safer assets. Alongside bonds, gold, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc — all typically regarded as safe haven assets in times of uncertainty or volatility — moved higher.

Investors are seeking options to ride out fresh tariffs-induced volatility, according to Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at London's ADM Investor Services.

"The move lower in [developed markets] yields is broad based, and a function of flight to safety due to rising volatility in risk assets, even if a lot of this is very knee-jerk, and as we saw yesterday can turn on sixpence into renewed risk appetite," he said in an email.

Monday saw a brief reprieve for equities following Friday's selloff, with Wall Street's major averages clawing back some of the previous session's losses, while European stocks also notched gains.

"It is all tied to the now typical ambiguous and posturing headlines and measures from the U.S. and China in respect of trade relations and negotiations, and unlikely to dissipate in the near term," Ostwald added on Tuesday.

"Longer term concerns about political instability … and headwinds from the high level of government debt, which no DM government is doing anything to address, will tend to temper gains, [but] this week's speeches at the IMF/World Bank … which may offer hints on relaxing bank capital rules with regards to purchases of [U.S. Treasurys] could also give bonds something of a tailwind," he said in reference to the IMF and the World Bank's Annual Meetings taking place in Washington, D.C., this week.

Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, agreed that the bond markets could be responding to a shift in overall sentiment.

"Western sovereign bond yields are moving lower, and thus prices are moving higher. This may be the result of an easing in risk appetite – Asian and European headline equity indices are generally down today, thanks to ongoing worries over U.S.-China trade relations," he told CNBC via email on Tuesday.

Mould also pointed to broader concerns over the economy and key industries, with the high profile collapse of First Brands raising concerns and sending jitters through markets.

"[These are] worries which will not ease in the context of a profit warning from another company which supplies the car industry, namely France's Michelin," he said. "Yield curves are flattening a touch, too, again to perhaps reflect concerns over economic softness and to price in further interest rate cuts from central banks."

Tim Hynes, head of credit research at Debtwire, also told CNBC on Tuesday that bonds were rallying due to concerns about the possible reignition of a Sino-U.S. trade war, attributing the market moves to "trade tension and growth fears."

"The renewed U.S.–China trade escalation is tilting sentiment toward risk-off," he said. "Investors, fearing weaker demand, are piling into government bonds."

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

OpenAI made its latest artificial intelligence partnership official yesterday, announcing a custom chip deal with Broadcom. Shares of the chipmaker closed Monday's session nearly 10% higher following news of the partnership, though the stock pulled back by 3% in premarket trading this morning.

Here's what to know:

Major financial institutions kicked off the new earnings season on a positive note this morning.

JPMorgan Chase beat expectations for the third quarter and reported record trading revenue of close to $9 billion in the period. Goldman Sachs reported better-than-expected earnings, a day after announcing it would acquire venture capital firm Industry Ventures. 

BlackRock and Wells Fargo also surpassed analyst expectations, while Citi posted stronger revenue than Wall Street projected. Don't miss BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" at 9:30 a.m. ET.

President Donald Trump traveled to Israel and Egypt yesterday to finalize a peace deal he said ended the war in Gaza. Trump first arrived in Tel Aviv to mark the release of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas during its 2023 invasion of Israel, saying in a speech at the Israeli parliament that the "long and painful nightmare" was over for both Israelis and Palestinians.

Experts told CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco that despite the ceasefire, ocean carriers likely won't return to the Red Sea in the near future. The Houthi rebels who have launched attacks on trade vessels in the body of water said they will not stop targeting the maritime routes.

Shares of U.S. rare earth miners are continuing to rally before the opening bell this morning. The stocks notched solid gains in Monday's session after China's tightening of export controls led Trump to reignite the U.S.-China trade dispute.

As CNBC's Spencer Kimball reports, Beijing's restrictions on rare earth exports could hit the U.S. defense industry, in particular. The Defense Department is reportedly speeding up its effort to stockpile $1 billion worth of the critical minerals, which are crucial components of several U.S. weapons systems. The fact that the U.S. doesn't have its own rare earth reserve is "scandalous," Jeremy Siegel of the University of Pennsylvania told CNBC yesterday.

The average price for a new car reached new highs last month. According to Cox Automotive, the average price paid in September surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever.

But while price tags climb and well-off consumers shell out, auto loan delinquency rates among people with low credit ratings are sitting near all-time highs. As CNBC's Mike Wayland reports, it's the latest example of a "K-shaped" economy in the U.S.

Oracle's CEOs sat down with CNBC's David Faber yesterday at the company's AI World conference. Watch the full interview here.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure on Tuesday announced it will deploy 50,000 Advanced Micro Devices graphics processors starting in the second half of 2026.

AMD shares climbed about 2%. Oracle shares sank 4% while Nvidia was more than 3% lower.

The move is the latest sign that cloud companies are increasingly offering AMD's graphics processing units as an alternative to Nvidia's market-leading GPUs for artificial intelligence.

"We feel like customers are going to take up AMD very, very well — especially in the inferencing space," said Karan Batta, senior vice president of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

Oracle will use AMD's Instinct MI450 chips, which were announced earlier this year.

They are AMD's first AI chips that can be assembled into a larger rack-sized system that enables 72 of the chips to work as one, which is needed to create and deploy the most advanced AI algorithms.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appeared with AMD CEO Lisa Su at a company event in June to announce the product.

Earlier this month, OpenAI announced a deal with AMD for processors requiring 6 gigawatts of power over multiple years, with a 1-gigawatt rollout starting in 2026. As part of the deal, and if the deployment goes well, OpenAI may end up owning as many as 160 million shares of AMD, or about 10% of the company.

In September, OpenAI entered into a five-year cloud deal with Oracle that could be worth as much as $300 billion.

OpenAI has historically been closely linked with Nvidia, whose chips were used to develop ChatGPT. Nvidia's chips dominate the market for data center GPUs with more than 90% market share. Nvidia also invested in OpenAI in September.

But OpenAI leaders say the company needs as much computing power as possible, which means it needs AI chips from multiple suppliers. OpenAI also has plans to design its own AI chips with Broadcom.

"I think AMD has done a really fantastic job, just like Nvidia, and I think both of them have their place," Batta said.

Tuesday at Oracle AI World, founder and Chairman Larry Ellison is set to take the stage and share his views on the latest OpenAI deal and what his company is doing to stay ahead of its main cloud competitors – Microsoft, Amazon and Google. 

"Oracle has already shown it is willing to place big bets and go all in to meet the AI moment. The company must now prove that beyond capacity, it can capitalize on its massive underlying data and enterprise capabilities … to add meaningful value to the enterprise AI wave," said Daniel Newman, CEO of The Futurum Group, on the sidelines of Oracle's conference.

Oura said Tuesday that it raised over $900 million in a new Series E funding round, bringing the company's valuation to $11 billion.

The fundraise, led by Fidelity Management & Research Company, also includes new investor ICONIQ and contributions from Whale Rock and Atreides.

"With this investment, we will accelerate innovation, expand our global reach, and set a new standard for what wearables can achieve in advancing preventive health," said CEO Tom Hale in a statement.

The Finnish company, which ranked No. 23 on CNBC'S 2025 Disruptor 50 List, has raised approximately $1.5 billion, according to a release.

Known for its Oura Rings, the company competes with other smart ring makers like Samsung and RingConn, as well as fitness-focused devices from Whoop and Garmin.

Oura announced in September that it has sold over 5.5 million Oura Rings since the product's launch in 2015, a significant jump from 2.5 million rings announced in June 2024. The company reported revenue of over $500 million in 2024, more than double from the year prior, and expects to reach $1 billion in sales this year.

Looking to broaden further in the wearable category, Oura has also been expanding its features to compete with more general wearable devices like Apple or Samsung watches.

Along with its new Oura Ring 4 Ceramic, the company recently unveiled Health Panels, a blood testing feature that allows users to schedule and view their lab results directly in the Oura App.

Users can keep track of up to 50 biomarkers and can receive their health data summary as well as diet or activity suggestions from Oura's AI-powered Advisor.

The ring maker also partnered with Dexcom, a leader in glucose monitoring technology, late last year to integrate Dexcom glucose data with biometrics collected by Oura so users can monitor their glucose levels.

"We're proud to be building not just a product, but a global movement toward proactive health—helping people understand their bodies, make better lifestyle decisions, and connect more effectively with their healthcare providers," Hale said.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lara Sophie Bothur, Deloitte Germany's first corporate influencer. Bothur now works freelance as a tech influencer. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

I joined the Big Four firm Deloitte in February 2021 as a business analyst in the innovation consulting division. A year later, I'd transformed that consulting role into something entirely new: I became Deloitte's first corporate influencer.

The job developed very naturally. Around eight months in, a partner who knew that I had a background in marketing suggested I help on a campaign for the innovation team.

My job was to talk to Deloitte's experts in quantum, AI, blockchain, smart manufacturing, and smart mobility teams. Techies are brilliant, but they are not the best storytellers. I didn't understand everything they said, which made showcasing their work tough.

Around that time, I had a conversation with my 101-year-old grandpa that changed things.

I visited him in Berlin, and when I told him I'd arrived by car sharing, he asked what that meant. His curiosity made me realize how powerful it is when complex ideas become understandable. By explaining it to him, I turned something abstract into something emotional and relatable, and it made me realize I could do the same with how I communicate technology at work.

I wrote a LinkedIn post about that conversation. It went viral, reaching 350,000 people. I was shocked and impressed by the power of LinkedIn.

A Deloitte partner saw it and suggested I try it out full time. In January 2022, we created a new role called "Voice for Innovation."

It wasn't the most engaging title, so half a year later, when a business magazine called me the first full-time corporate influencer in Germany, I embraced it.

In the beginning, I worked hard to actively build up my network — connecting with 100 relevant people each week. There was no template to follow, but we figured out what worked week by week.

If you have a character in a movie that you can identify with, you feel part of the story. That is what I was doing for Deloitte — making people feel connected to the brand.

I wasn't reposting job advertisements or promoting the firm like a PR. We wanted to show that Deloitte is not just an auditor, so it was my job to present the work and demonstrate our culture through storytelling.

I was still a salaried employee and earned the same as consultants. I spent my days traveling, visiting tech hubs, attending and moderating events, networking with potential clients, and generating content around it all. No one else was doing that community and content management. I wrote the text and cut the videos.

I also ran LinkedIn workshops internally and externally, and wrote posts for a Deloitte leader.

My work impacted talent, clients, partnerships, and the brand. One LinkedIn post generated a whole new project — a company that needed a cloud transformation had seen the post, but hadn't been aware that Deloitte had a partnership with Google Cloud.

Another time, a woman told me she chose to join Deloitte over BCG because she'd seen me speak at an event and liked that they were clearly supporting my career as a young woman.

We're entering a new era of business communication and influencer marketing, where it's about employees becoming the face of a company. LinkedIn is a very, very powerful tool for that.

I am a LinkedIn Top Voice and have one of the largest and most influential profiles on LinkedIn for tech translation. Last year, I reached 400 million impressions globally — which has a marketing value of $13 million — and I generated 10,000 marketing leads for Deloitte.

You can pay for advertising, or you can make your employees visible and position your topics through them. They are the best marketing tool: letting your people speak is the most authentic way to communicate.

But you should never point at someone and say, "You are the next corporate influencer." There must be an intrinsic motivation to communicate a topic that you're passionate about, and you need to share the company's values. If that's there, you're a perfect match for a corporate influencer.

Deloitte Germany now has around 250 employees working part-time as corporate influencers. I trained them on how to use LinkedIn best, and two have become LinkedIn Top Voices.

It's not easy being the face of a company.

Last year, I faced criticism from some German media outlets. They questioned my rapid growth on LinkedIn and said I must have bought followers and engagement. It was shocking, but trust is one of our key values at Deloitte, and we proved them wrong. It helped that Deloitte is an auditor — I had help from its data and statistics experts.

Through explaining my approach, I earned the name "LinkedIn algorithm whisperer" in Germany.

Any time you're public online, people form opinions. I make sure my posts aren't about me, but about the company and its people. I often bring others onstage to share the spotlight.

Still, as a corporate influencer, you must balance the company and your individual persona. This influencing approach requires followers to understand you and your values. That's how you build trust. I focus on tech and innovation, and that's what people follow me for.

Deloitte checked my posts to make sure they're accurate and to avoid controversy to protect me. I never post about politics or religion, but that doesn't mean I can't stand up for my values.

Stepping out of the group can feel dangerous — but that's what innovation is.

Authenticity requires engagement. You must connect offline, and online, you need to respond to comments and shares quickly — especially in the first hour, when the LinkedIn algorithm decides if a post will take off.

Sometimes it's pretty hard, but if you have a mission, and I have one, then you can do it. You really follow what you believe, and I believe in translating tech to people.

Toward the beginning of 2025, I started taking on some self-employed work moderating and speaking, and this summer, I decided it was time to leave Deloitte.

I've become one of the most influential tech influencers in Europe, and I wanted the freedom to work with multiple companies. Requests have been pouring in since I announced my departure.

I'll still collaborate with Deloitte, but can now partner internationally with new major clients, including SAP, Salesforce, AWS, Meta, and HP. 

Financially, it's a good move — I wouldn't do it if it wasn't profitable. But I also believe this field is the future.

We talk about AI taking jobs, but new roles are being created, and corporate influencers are one of them — especially in the tech world. These roles didn't exist a few years ago, but now they're essential.

There's so much new technology and so many businesses, but they don't speak the same language. If companies don't become more personal, more human, and more visible, they'll be left behind. It's my mission to help them.

Any young professional making their career on Wall Street will tell you that building skills means a ton of learning on the job. For Madison Crutchfield, one element of her background gave her a head start in mastering the busy trading floor: Being a Division I lacrosse player at Duke University.

Crutchfield started out as a sophomore summer intern at Goldman Sachs in 2016, and has worked her way up the firm for the last seven years as a full-timer. Today, she's a vice president in equity derivative sales, and attributes a lot of her success to the skills she gained from playing lacrosse.

She's one of many athletes who have joined the Wall Street behemoth over the years, as BI previously reported. In an interview, she told us how her days on the field have helped prepare her for the trading floor, including words of wisdom from her coach and what she expects from student-athlete job candidates.

The questions and answers below have been edited for length and clarity.

BI: What was life as a student athlete like? How did your background as a student athlete help you get to Goldman?

MC: It required a lot of discipline, a lot of time management, but also provided the reward of such an incredible network and camaraderie of teammates and girls who I got to see day in and day out.

Lacrosse conditioned in me a mindset and temperament that I leaned on throughout the networking, the application, and when it came to it, the interviewing stages. I draw on these intangibles — such as the need to think quickly on my feet, to stay resourceful, and to be a self-starter — every day.

BI: What about life as a student athlete is similar to life on Wall Street?

MC: My coach would always say: 'Play fast, not hurried.' And that's really transferable in the world of sales and trading, where there's usually some 'game clock' ticking — be it you're executing an order, showing pricing for an order, answering a client, meeting a project deadline, whatever it might be. Having the ability to be efficient but not rushed is a critical edge.

BI: What other lessons from sports do you use in your job now?

MC: I think sports teach you how to win and lose. Seasons are marathons, not sprints, and you quickly learn not to get too high or too low — staying even keeled and patient is a must in order to stay focused.

Missed calls by officials, inclement weather, showing up late to a game because of bus engine problems (which did happen), a rowdy crowd — I can't do anything about those things. Similarly, in corporate America, you have to battle back. Success is so often found in how you respond to situations — to shortcomings, to failed attempts. It really rewards those who are resilient, who, rather than shutting down, become a quick study and turn it into a learning experience. Adjust and be ready for the next opportunity, the next rep, the next play.

BI: When you see an applicant who's a student athlete, how does that help you assess that person?

MC: If someone was a student athlete, it tells me that they're accustomed to collaborating and know how to approach work with that 'we' mindset. When you're on a team, there's a commitment to each other and to a common goal, and it tells me that they likely understand and value the importance of doing their job in order for the team to succeed.

It tells me that they've had to hone some level of emotional IQ to navigate diverse teammates and communication styles, that they've been forced to fail and learn to rebound from it, and that at some point they've been asked to sacrifice comfort for progress.

BI: What advice would you give to student athletes eyeing Wall Street careers?

MC: Just as you did when evaluating sports programs, it's important to not only assess the caliber but the culture of the company. Oftentimes, I've found that the two go hand in hand.

My advice would be to focus on the culture of your target workplace and how that firm operates. Not only on its deliverables, its achievements, and its awards, but how that firm operates, but the camaraderie and the fellowship of its people. It's important to ask yourself, 'Will this firm develop me, not only as a professional, but as a person?'

Every startup lives with the same tension: a large incumbent can copy or crush it at any time.

For Harvey, an artificial intelligence startup that builds tools for law firms and enterprises, the model-maker that powers its tech also has the power to destroy it.

From Harvey's Manhattan office on Friday afternoon, cofounders Winston Weinberg and Gabe Pereyra put it bluntly. Harvey's toughest competitor isn't another niche startup; it's OpenAI.

"Our largest competitor is by far, indirectly, OpenAI," Weinberg said. "I mean that in the sense of just — you need to make sure that your product gives so much more value than whatever the general products they're releasing are."

Harvey's biggest rival is also a backer. The OpenAI Startup Fund wrote one of the first checks into Harvey and has continued to increase its stake with additional funding. To date, Harvey has raised over $800 million.

The startup, last valued at $5 billion, has counted on being domain-specific to attract large law firms. Harvey just signed its 50th client in the Am Law 100, a group of the largest US law firms by revenue, the company said.

The founders say they tell their team that customers will measure Harvey against whatever general-purpose tool OpenAI ships next, even if it doesn't specifically target legal work.

Surveys by the American Bar Association and the Thomson Reuters Institute indicate that lawyers are already using ChatGPT to draft memos, conduct legal research, and predict case outcomes — with mixed results. Judges are increasingly catching fake citations in court documents.

Across the software market, concerns are growing that the foundation model companies will launch specialized tools for narrow domains or use cases. Recently, OpenAI blogged about a set of internal tools — a contract review tool among them — that it uses to run its own business.

OpenAI may be famous for its chatbot, but since 2022, it has emerged as a default partner for startups to build frontier tech for their industries without training their own large language models. Harvey builds on its models and works closely with the company to deploy custom-trained models and features for legal professionals.

OpenAI hasn't publicly released the tools it showed off. Still, the blog posts fanned fears that it could one day compete with the startups it now enables.

Harvey's founders say the threat persists whether OpenAI targets lawyers or not.

Pereyra argued that big cloud and model providers will continue to perfect general-purpose AI platforms — helpful developments, but not a focus for Harvey. "They're solving a very different problem," he said.

Harvey wants to build the operating system for law firms: software that knows what a matter is, routes tasks to the right people, pulls the right documents at the right moment, and can swap in different models under strict controls.

In that view, the founders say the value isn't in packaging ever-better models; it's in the application layer that makes those models useful inside a law firm.

"If you think about them as the main competitor," Weinberg said, "all that does is make you create better tools for your vertical faster."

OpenAI is trying to become the next big tech platform, and it's been rolling out a host of new products, tools, and features to appeal to developers, including a new AI-flavored App Store.

Richard Murby, whom I met while waiting in a long line to get into OpenAI's DevDay conference last week, agrees. He's the director of business development at Devpost, which helps developers participate in hackathons.

I asked Murby how OpenAI is appealing to developers and what it still has to do to challenge Apple and Google. This Q&A has been edited for clarity and length.

Q: From what you witnessed at DevDay, is OpenAI now a force to be reckoned with in the minds of developers? Or does it still have work to do here?

They deserve massive credit for changing the world with the first generative AI consumer product and providing the model that powered GitHub Copilot, but it's far from won. From our vantage point at Devpost, they are in a race for developer engagement and trust, and that's exactly the problem we help companies solve. (Full disclosure, we work with OpenAI and their competitors.) The speed of innovation means that developers have numerous options, and the companies that win are those that can cut through the noise and get developers' hands on their tools.

Q: Take me inside the mind of a developer. Why would they be clamoring to engage with OpenAI? What's the payoff for developers to build things on this nascent/emerging platform?

The modern developer's toolkit is astonishingly rich. GenAI offers a direct payoff for most developers, assisting them with everything from bug fixes to feature development. This speed and utility mean that they, and their executives, want to leverage this technology now.

OpenAI is competing to be a developer's default choice. They've provided top-quality models and continue to expand what's available in the API, but the real game-changer is the new app directory and SDK. This is a clear signal that OpenAI is attempting to create a platform where developers can find users and earn revenue, much like Apple did with the App Store.

Q: What are the drawbacks for developers building on OpenAI's platform? What did you see on Monday that changes this situation, if anything?

With such fierce competition and an intense pace of innovation, the primary challenge for developers is simply keeping up. They face a strategic dilemma: do they go all-in on one platform, or do they spread their bets across multiple tools? This is compounded by the fact that new AI benchmarks are surpassed almost weekly by different competitors, and internal security and IT teams can only ingest so many new tools at once.

In the meantime, as the race is on, developers are utilizing these tools both at work and in their free time. This is why hackathons are so critical—they provide a dedicated space for companies to test tools and for developers to gain hands-on experience, all while providing valuable feedback. This is our specialty, and it is a key component of a successful developer strategy.

From what we saw on Monday, OpenAI is making a significant statement that it wants to be the next platform. Their investments in infrastructure, the new app directory, and a new coding agent all signal that they are here to stay and want to be the default choice for developers.

Q: How far away is OpenAI from challenging the current major platforms, Apple iOS, Google Android etc? What's missing or different here?

The comparison to Apple and Google is a red herring. What OpenAI is doing is not a traditional platform play — it's a straight-up attempt to build the dominant conversational operating system of the future. The platform is moving from the device to the conversation itself. This is a massive new challenge: creating a community of developers that will build on top of this conversational platform, regardless of the device. That's a new frontier, and I feel incredibly fortunate to be a part of it and see how it unfolds.

Q: What else struck you from DevDay?

One of the things Jony Ive said really stuck with me. To paraphrase, "Why would we run this new generation of technology through the last generation's interfaces?"

That's a brilliantly simple and profound thought that makes me incredibly excited to find out what they are working on. I just really wish they had told us!

The latest round of federal worker firings could leave laid-off public servants with student loans high and dry.

Over the past week, the Trump administration implemented another force reduction across federal agencies, impacting over 4,100 federal workers, as the government shutdown continues.

Fired federal workers could lose progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.

Are you a federal worker? Do you have student loans? Share your story with this reporter at asheffey@businessinsider.com or via Signal at asheffey.97.

For payments to count toward PSLF, a borrower must be working for a qualifying employer, like the federal government, when the payments are made. That means that a federal worker impacted by the RIF will not receive credit toward PSLF unless they get hired at a different employer that would qualify for the program. Once they get a new qualifying employer, they will be able to pick up where they left off with their PSLF payments. 

Carolyn Fast, director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider that she recommends borrowers affected by the federal cuts document their PSLF payment count now and make sure they have copies of it to avoid any issues down the road when they have to verify their payments to receive relief.

She also said that borrowers who are at the 120 payment mark should apply for forgiveness as soon as they can.

"The regulation talks about how you need to be at the eligible employment when you apply for the forgiveness after you make the amount of payments," Fast said. "So it'd be important to do that while you're still a federal worker."

The PSLF buyback process could also be beneficial for some federal workers, Fast said. Buybacks allow borrowers to "buy back" months spent in deferment or forbearance periods by making payments equal to what they would have owed at the time, if those payments would enable them to reach the 120 payment threshold.

Federal workers with over 10 years of public service but who have not yet received forgiveness should consider whether they might qualify for a buyback, Fast said.

Employees who received a RIF notice were placed on administrative leave beginning October 10, according to the notices reviewed by Business Insider, and the terminations will become effective in early December.

The student-loan repayment system is undergoing major changes. The Department of Education held negotiations in July on President Donald Trump's executive order to limit PSLF eligibility, which the department said could end up delaying or blocking relief for some borrowers.

At the same time, the department is working to implement a repayment overhaul that Trump signed into law as part of his "big beautiful" spending legislation passed in July. The changes include eliminating existing income-driven repayment plans and replacing them with two options: a standard repayment plan and a new Repayment Assistance Plan. The department also proposed new caps on graduate and professional borrowing.

The US economy is strong, but America may be entering an era of "jobless growth" because of artificial intelligence, Goldman Sachs wrote in a Monday note.

"The modest job growth alongside robust GDP growth seen recently is likely to be normal to some degree in the years ahead," analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote.

They added that this trend is likely to continue, with most potential growth coming from AI-driven productivity. Meanwhile, population and lower immigration would contribute only modestly to the labor supply.

There are already signs of a weaker job market, wrote the analysts.

The analysts pointed out that job growth outside the healthcare industry has turned negative in recent months, and that corporate management teams are increasingly focused on using AI to reduce labor costs — a shift that could weigh on hiring long term.

However, concerns about technology displacing workers are nothing new, Goldman's analysts acknowledged.

Over the past decade, there have been growing concerns that new technologies could eliminate jobs faster than they create new ones. Until recently, that disruption hasn't shown up clearly in the data.

But that may be starting to change.

"Over just the last few years, AI does appear to be hurting the employment prospects of the most closely exposed workers, such as young technology workers," the analysts wrote.

Employment growth has already turned negative in the most AI-exposed industries, even if the broader impact remains modest for now, they added.

"While we are skeptical of the boldest claims that rapid technological progress could lead to very high unemployment, some transitional friction is possible," wrote Goldman's analysts.

They described that friction as a normal part of the economy adjusting to new technologies.

"Innovation and greater spending power as output and income rise will also create new work opportunities that offset job losses," they wrote.

The bank's research shows that past waves of technological progress have temporarily increased unemployment and forced more workers to change occupations.

The kind of innovation matters, too: Some technologies create jobs, while others, like many AI tools, replace them.

"If AI is mainly labor-substituting, it could present a greater challenge to maintaining full employment," the analysts warned.

Still, the true test for the AI economy may not come until the next downturn, Goldman's analysts wrote.

"In past recessions, employment of workers in routine occupations has dropped sharply — especially when they followed productivity booms — and did not recover after," they wrote.

The analysts point to the early-2000s "jobless recovery" as a case in point. After the 2001 recession, US GDP bounced back quickly thanks to tech-driven productivity, but total employment lagged for years as companies used the downturn to cut jobs.

"A leading explanation for this phenomenon is that companies use recessions to restructure and streamline their workforce by laying off workers in less productive areas," they wrote.

"This is especially true when recessions follow productivity booms that give companies some pent-up ability to cut labor costs and improve efficiency without significantly hurting their productive capacity," they added.

Higher unemployment isn't the only risk. AI could also deepen inequality, rewarding workers who can leverage new technology while squeezing out midlevel jobs.

AI could "hollow out" middle-income white-collar roles, much like factory automation once displaced skilled blue-collar workers, the analysts wrote. Early evidence suggests that in some cases, the technology might actually help lower-skilled workers more than higher-skilled ones.

There's one upside to all this: Faster productivity growth tends to keep inflation in check, they wrote.

That could give the Federal Reserve room to cut rates even if unemployment drifts higher, mirroring its approach during the early-2000s recovery.

Goldman's latest report on AI's impact comes as the US grapples with a range of uncertainties, including the lack of official job data amid the government shutdown, the fallout from President Donald Trump's import tariffs, and the seismic disruption caused by AI.

In September, the private sector lost 32,000 jobs, according to ADP data.

The outlook wasn't brighter by other metrics.

Workforce analytics firm Revelio Labs reported a 17.2% drop in job openings from a year earlier. Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that hiring plans have fallen to their lowest level since the Great Recession, with the smallest number of new hires announced in the first nine months of a year since 2009.

Business Insider Edition 

France has airlifted Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina out of the country after weeks of youth-led protests and military defections plunged the Indian Ocean nation into chaos.


        The dramatic evacuation, reportedly carried out on a French military aircraft, follows mass demonstrations demanding Rajoelina's resignation and marks the latest in a wave of youth-driven uprisings shaking governments across Africa.
    


        Rajoelina confirmed in a late-night address posted on the presidency's social media accounts that he had left the country, citing threats to his life.
    


        “I left to go to a secure location to protect my life,” he said. The president vowed not to “allow Madagascar to be destroyed,” but did not disclose his location and has so far ignored growing calls to step down.
    


        A senior military source told Reuters that Rajoelina departed on a French military aircraft from Sainte Marie airport on Sunday. “Five minutes later, a helicopter arrived and transferred its passenger into the Casa,” the source said, identifying the passenger as Rajoelina.
    


        French radio RFI reported that the president had reached a deal with French President Emmanuel Macron before leaving the country.
    


        Speaking in Egypt after a summit on the Gaza ceasefire, Macron declined to confirm whether France facilitated the evacuation.
    


        He said constitutional order must be maintained in Madagascar but cautioned that youth frustrations “must not be exploited by military factions.”
    


        Siteny Randrianasoloniaiko, the leader of Madagascar's parliamentary opposition, told reporters that Rajoelina left after key army units defected to join demonstrators demanding his resignation. “We called the staff of the presidency and they confirmed that he left,” Randrianasoloniaiko said, adding that the president's whereabouts remained unknown.
    


        The unrest began on September 25 as small protests over power and water shortages but quickly morphed into a nationwide uprising.
    


        Thousands of young protesters took to the streets, denouncing corruption, rising poverty and years of political mismanagement.
    


        The demonstrations form part of a broader wave of youth-led movements worldwide, echoing recent protests in Nepal, where the prime minister resigned last month, and in Morocco, where young people have rallied against unemployment and inequality.
    


        Rajoelina's authority began to unravel when CAPSAT, an elite military unit that helped him seize power in a 2009 coup, joined the protests.
    


        Over the weekend, CAPSAT troops marched with demonstrators in Antananarivo, the capital city, refusing to fire on civilians and declaring they no longer recognised the president's command.
    


        A day later, a faction of the paramilitary gendarmerie also declared its support for the protesters, naming a new commander in a televised ceremony witnessed by senior government officials.

        On Monday, thousands gathered in Antananarivo's Independence Square, waving flags and chanting, “The president must quit now.”
    


        At least 22 people have been killed in clashes between protesters and security forces since the unrest began, according to the United Nations.

        In one of his final official moves before leaving, Rajoelina reportedly pardoned several prisoners, including two French nationals convicted of plotting a coup in 2021, a gesture widely interpreted as an attempt to shore up diplomatic goodwill with Paris.
    


        Despite being the world's largest producer of vanilla and rich in minerals including nickel, cobalt, titanium, and graphite, Madagascar's 30 million people face extreme poverty, with over 75% living on less than $2 a day. 
    


        Rural communities struggle with climate shocks, and decades of political instability have left the economy volatile, according to the World Bank.

Doug Lebda, founder and CEO of LendingTree, which is widely credited for transforming the financial services landscape, died at 55 in an ATV accident on Sunday.

The company he founded and the example he set for young entrepreneurs will live on.

Lebda launched LendingTree, which was originally called CreditSource USA, in 1996, following his own frustrating experience navigating the mortgage process.

The company pioneered online loan comparison shopping and now connects users with a network of 300 lenders for mortgages and personal loans. LendingTree doesn't offer loans directly, but it helps consumers compare rates.

On September 26, a few weeks before his passing, he appeared on "The Deal Ranch," a finance and real estate podcast hosted by Matt Lutz, to share his experiences as a founder. Here is some of Lebda's advice for those looking to found a business.

Lebda said that "wet feet" moments — instances of personal inconveniences — tend to spur entrepreneurial ideas.

Lebda was working for PwC when he needed to visit the bank to obtain a mortgage for a condo. However, in the pre-Internet era, Lebda said his journey to obtain an ideal rate was difficult because he had to physically visit each bank to compare rates, and the rates were often not the same as advertised in the newspapers.

At the same time, Lebda watched as some of his clients easily made trades based on the natural gas price difference between Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Seattle, all within a quick and automated system.

"I was thinking back to my mortgage situation, going 'Wait a minute. You can trade this obscure freaking financial instrument, and you can't even go get price clarity on a mortgage somewhere. It's ridiculous!" said Lebda.

"And so that was really the 'aha,'" Lebda added.

Lebda did his market research in the most affordable way possible before deciding that LendingTree was a viable idea.

"One of the very earliest things I did when I was in business school in '96 to '97, and I was debating whether to do this, is I spent — I believe it was $500 — on Yahoo ads," Lebda said.

At the company's earliest founding, Lebda said he asked people to fill out a form and promised that he would be able to get them the credit they deserved. He received hundreds of responses, with individuals willing to provide their names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and credit scores.

"So I used that to model out what my customer acquisition cost would be," Lebda added.

Lebda said that a non-technical founder must partner with a strong technical counterpart in order to succeed.

"I learned later in business school that it's statistically impossible for a non-technical entrepreneur to start a tech business unless you have that person, because you need to iterate back and forth," said Lebda.

Lebda said this is why he brought on board Jamey Bennett as a cofounder, who had previous experience as an entrepreneur, as well as Rick Stiegler, who has experience in trade, as LendingTree's CTO. Stiegler died in March 2004.

"So, for example, I hired Rick from Wall Street who had built trading systems like high volume trading stuff that needed to be precise and accurate in volume and speed," Lebda said.

LendingTree is leveraging AI to reimagine the boring work that nobody really wants to do.

"Everybody's job has drudgery and joy," said Lebda. "Automate the drudgery. Spend more time on the joy. And that's what we're trying to get everybody at LendingTree to do right now."

Lebda said that his chief of staff invented "Doug's daily digest," where ChatGPT reads all his emails and links to the important things he needs to dedicate time to.

"For the average employee, you're sitting there with Slack, email, text messages, conversations, notes, summaries — it's not centralized," Lebda added. "But with like a ChatGPT enterprise, you can see the day where you've got like an institutional memory of the company, and everybody's on the same page."

For Lebda, leadership is contextual, and the role is constantly changing.

"It's a continuous change management job, and you have to be more like a conductor sometimes than a general. But sometimes you need to say, 'We're cutting x million dollars out of this budget by this period of time, go do it,'" said Lebda.

For Lebda, he likes to focus on curating the consumer experience as his main area of focus and what he does best

"I think it's knowing when to dig in, when to let go, when you actually can add value, when you can't, and then trying to work on stuff that only you can uniquely do," Lebda added.

The shophouses of Penang, Malaysia, have long been admired from the outside. Shane Low wanted travelers to experience what they're like inside, too.

He grew up in a family involved in property development and was inspired by how countries like Japan had reimagined traditional homes into guest accommodations.

He's now doing the same in Penang's George Town — a UNESCO World Heritage site since 2008.

In 2023, Low started Aayu Homes, a property management company, with his wife, Chong Xin Pei, an architectural designer. His childhood friend, Andy Ooi, joined the company a year later and oversees daily operations and business development.

"We felt that whenever you travel, staying in something very local is more authentic than staying in high-end hotels," Low, 33, told Business Insider.

Low said he hopes that Aayu Homes can make heritage living more accessible to travelers who want an authentic experience.

Nightly rates for a room in one of their guesthouses range between 125 and 200 Malaysian ringgit, or about $30 and $50, while full homes start from 500 ringgit.

The company manages 15 listings.

"We don't own any properties; our model is asset-light," Low said. Instead, Aayu Homes either rents the shophouses or partners with owners and investors to run them.

Most properties need little work — just two months of renovations — and the company aims to break even within six months.

Many owners are locals or foreigners living elsewhere who buy shophouses as future homes, often for retirement. In the meantime, they rent them out, but keep the flexibility to stay there whenever they're in town, he said.

"In terms of our portfolio for the rentals and the ones from investors or individual owners, it's actually 50-50," Low said.

For the rental model, the company leases shophouses and uses its own capital for renovations, Low said.

When it comes to getting owners on board, they pitch ideas for how the space could be used and oversee the improvements needed to realize it.

The biggest design challenge is working with the existing structure without making major alterations, Chong, 33, told Business Insider.

"Every shophouse is different — some are narrower, some have lower ceilings, some come with little backyards. There's no one-size-fits-all solution for these houses, so each space requires its own design approach," she said.

In terms of interior design, Low says they like to keep things simple, with a warm color palette that makes the spaces feel inviting.

"We don't want to overdo stuff," he said. "We want them to feel calm when they enter the house."

Low says they typically take around 30% of the revenue.

The rows of historic shophouses in George Town, dating back to the 1790s and blending Chinese, Malay, Indian, and colonial influences, played a big role in its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Today, those shophouses, alongside Penang's food and cultural heritage, remain key to its tourism appeal. In 2024, Penang received 8.23 million hotel guests, up from 7.27 million the previous year, per data from the Malaysian Tourism Board.

Couples make up the bulk of Aayu Homes' bookings, Low said. Families also stay with them, typically renting entire houses. Most visitors tend to be European travelers, he added.

Aayu Homes is now a team of 15, including guest assistants and housekeepers.

Working together has come easily for the trio, thanks to their long friendship and complementary strengths, Ooi, 33, told Business Insider.

"Of course, being the third wheel in a business marriage has its perks — I get double the ideas and only half the arguments," Ooi said.

As for what it's like to work with her husband, Chong says their dynamic comes naturally, mostly because their roles within the company are clearly defined.

"Each of us has the final say within our own scope, so this minimizes any potential conflict," Chong said.

Aayu's homes are listed on Airbnb and Booking.com, where they average 4.9 and 9.5 stars, respectively, with thousands of reviews.

However, there are still occasions when the stay doesn't align with a guest's expectations. Low said.

Because of the long floor plans, some rooms don't have windows, and the old structures also mean sound insulation isn't perfect, Low said.

"Heritage houses are not for everyone. And for some people, it's just a product mismatch," he said.

Beyond adding more houses, Low says the company is focused on curating experiences that connect guests with Penang's local culture.

Guests can book cooking classes and heritage walks, or shop at a small store in one of the shophouses that sells local pottery and running gear.

"It becomes a whole ecosystem. Not only do you have houses — you have everything that is local around, from experiences, to products, and shops," Low said. "At the end of the day, it's to enhance the experience of our customers."

Correction: October 14, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Chong Xin Pei's job title. She is an architectural designer, not an architect.

At the 2025 CO—100 Small Business Forum, Intel and Coinbase leaders shared how AI and cryptocurrency are transforming the way small businesses market, manage payments, and scale globally.

From generative AI tools to digital payments, small businesses are adopting cutting‑edge technology faster than ever before. These emerging tools are helping entrepreneurs scale smarter and faster to close the gap with large enterprises. 

During the CO— 100 Small Business Forum, Senior Features Editor Barbara Thau sat down with Byron Wirtz, Technical Sales Director at Intel, and Sid Coelho‑Prabhu, Senior Director of Product Management at Coinbase, to explore how AI and crypto are unlocking new opportunities for small business owners. Their discussion focused on practical, real‑world solutions, from automating marketing and streamlining tech management to reducing payment fees and reaching global customers.

It's no surprise that Wirtz named AI as the biggest technological disruptor in recent years, since it helps businesses of any size innovate and compete. He noted that companies like Intel and Dell are now embedding AI directly into laptops and devices, which makes tech easier to manage for teams with limited IT support.

On the front end, small businesses are using generative AI to create marketing content. Wirtz pointed out that many small business owners are using these tools to create emails, design ad campaigns, or even brainstorm new offerings in a fraction of the time it used to take, freeing staff to focus on core operations. 

“Anytime you can help move the focus from dealing with technology to dealing with your own business … that's a win,” he said.

Another tech innovation that has come to the forefront recently is cryptocurrency, which is currently used by one in five small businesses. 

Coelho‑Prabhu noted that many of these businesses use stablecoins like USDC, which operate on the blockchain and are tied 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins allow you to send money anywhere in the world in under one second, for less than a penny in fees, thereby reducing reliance on banks and payment networks.

“If you take your money and you make it fast, global, and free, that's an instant cost change,” said Coelho‑Prabhu. “It changes your cost structure. It lets you serve more markets [and] … more customers … from different places in the world.”

Aside from its greater global reach, crypto's lower transaction fees can have a dramatic impact on profit margins.

“Instead of paying the 3% acceptance fee [for traditional card payments] … you could take that money and … reinvest it in your growth [and] … hire global talent,” Coelho‑Prabhu told CO—.

While AI and crypto may seem complex, small businesses can easily access and apply these technologies in practical ways with the right strategies. 

To help small businesses adopt AI responsibly, Intel and Dell offer free startup programs that include workshops, expert mentoring, and commercial-grade hardware discounts. These programs are designed to help business owners focus on where AI can actually solve problems in their day-to-day operations, rather than using AI for the sake of it.

“If you have questions about how [you] can … apply technology to make [your] business run better [and] … help with your business goals in a better way, these programs are available for you for exactly this reason,” Wirtz explained.

On the crypto side, Coinbase's recent Shopify partnership allows any new and existing merchant on the platform to accept cryptocurrency payments. Coelho-Prabhu said this opens small businesses up to a larger global audience, especially younger consumers who prefer crypto payments.

“This … makes every business more global,” he added. “[It] makes it easier for them to scale when they can set up a Shopify store and start accepting payments from … anyone in the world.”

Coelho-Prabhu also discussed the launch of Coinbase Business, a new platform that helps companies expand their reach and lower operating costs through digital payments.

“People are seeing a very real pain point being solved around fees,” he said. “The demand has been so strong.”

Oops, something went wrong

New on-chain data suggests that the US government hacked wallets for its $14 billion Bitcoin seizure. Although it indicted major criminals, the BTC in question had been taken from them five years ago.

Sleuths identified a few inconsistencies in the Treasury's official narrative. If this is true, then law enforcement may begin aggressive seizures to fill a Bitcoin Reserve.

Earlier this morning, the US government's $14 billion Bitcoin seizure attracted a lot of excitement in the crypto community. However, crypto sleuths have examined the on-chain data, discovering a few potential inconsistencies with the official story.

This led some to claim that the US actually hacked these wallets, which could radically change the story.

First of all, although the Cambodian crime ring was a pig butchering operation, it also ran other criminal and legitimate enterprises.

One of these was a Bitcoin mining pool, which was hacked in 2020. Over the last five years, these assets sat idle in wallets, and a report claimed that they had vulnerable private keys:

In other words, crypto sleuth ZachXBT made some revolutionary connections between these incidents. Today's seizure might have had nothing to do with the Cambodian crime ring; instead, the US government may have hacked them from other hackers.

If this is true, it might have huge implications for the US Strategic Crypto Reserve. The government holds billions in BTC, but it must reimburse most of them to their initial owners.

If, however, these funds were hacked from other indicted criminals, the US government might just keep them.

Between this unprecedented behavior and the inconsistencies in the official story, the US government might be getting more aggressive here. If buying Bitcoin to fill the Reserve becomes too expensive, the US could simply pursue hacks like this.

Until today, US law enforcement has taken a methodical approach to all Bitcoin seizures. It took them, reimbursed them to victims if applicable, and sold them in open auction if not.

However, if the US has a new directive to acquire Bitcoin through methods like hacking, it could upend all that precedent.

In other words, Trump's administration may be politicizing this ostensibly neutral process. Moving forward, law enforcement might take a proactive role in filling Uncle Sam's bags.

Monad, an upcoming layer-1 blockchain network designed to rival Solana and Ethereum, shared further details of its upcoming MON token airdrop on Tuesday, including outlining the community recipients and opening an eligibility checker. 

Eligible users may be able to see their allocation as early as October 28, though the claim will remain open until November 3—at which point it is expected that the token will be claimable. 

“This airdrop allocates tokens to 5,500 members of the Monad community, as well as to nearly 225,000 members of the wider crypto community,” the Monad Foundation wrote in its announcement. “The MON airdrop is designed to make people who eat, sleep, and breathe crypto the initial stakeholders in the Monad network.” 

In building its airdrop recipient base, the Monad Foundation used strict anti-sybil measures, or criteria designed to weed out bots and those performing low-value activities apparently just to farm a potential token airdrop. 

Beyond anti-sybil efforts, the Foundation focused on identifying the Monad community, on-chain users that participated in major DeFi protocols on-chain, high value DEX traders, and long-term holders of notable NFT collections to receive MON tokens. 

Specifically, holders of popular Ethereum NFT collections like CryptoPunks, Azuki, Moonbirds, Pudgy Penguins, Meebits, and others based on a September 30 snapshot were eligible for MON. 

Additionally, significant traders using protocols like Solana token launchpad Pump.fun, Virtuals, Hyperliquid, and recent participants in on-chain governance of major Ethereum DAOs will have an allocation of MON tokens set aside. A select group of contributors to crypto education and builders in the Monad ecosystem will also receive tokens.

on a serious note: 

the airdrop claim is open for 3 weeks, you DO NOT need to rush, be careful and beware of scams

you DO need to claim to receive your airdrop, please don't put it off and forget to claim

godspeed

— internbrah (@internbrah) October 14, 2025



Exact tokenomic details remain outstanding, though eligible participants were able to reveal an “airdrop strength level” based on their on-chain activity and social media presence. Crypto users on X have begun speculating on the potential value of an ensuing airdrop for each level, though nothing has been confirmed by Monad. 

Monad was founded in 2022 and raised $225 million to build an EVM-compatible network that could accommodate for extremely high traffic while staying cheap, secure, and fast. The network officially unveiled its Monad testnet earlier this year.   

Pre-market trading of the MON token on Hyperliquid has it changing hands at a price of around $0.08 on more than $7.3 million in 24 hour volume.

U.S. authorities dropped a legal hammer on global firm Prince Group as an operator of forced-labor global scam operations — including infamous pig butchering schemes — based in Cambodia, indicting the company's leader and imposing sanctions.



UK and Cambodian national Chen Zhi, the founder and chairman of Prince Group, was indicted in New York on Tuesday for allegedly conspiring to launder money and committee wire fraud, according to the Department of Justice. In that case, the DOJ took what it said was its largest-ever crypto seizure of 127,271 bitcoin BTC$112,782.19, worth about $14.4 billion at current value.



"Today's action represents one of the most significant strikes ever against the global scourge of human trafficking and cyber-enabled financial fraud,” said U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi, in a statement.



And in a coordinated effort, the U.S. Department of the Treasury said it sanctioned Prince Group on Tuesday, designating it a transnational criminal organization and blocking its financial activity and the ability for people to do business with it without U.S. repercussions.



According to a DOJ statement, the defendant and his executives secretly "grew Prince Group into one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organizations." One of the leading money generators, according to the U.S. authorities, was so-called "pig butchering" in which people — largely in the U.S. — are scammed for crypto assets they often believe are going toward remote romantic partners. "Prince Group carried out these schemes by trafficking hundreds of workers and forcing them to work in compounds in Cambodia and execute the scams, often under the threat of violence," the statement said, describing barbed-wired compounds, political influence and sophisticated crypto laundering efforts.



The CEO, who is at large, and those accused as co-conspirators are said to have used proceeds on lavish lifestyles, including in one case the purchase of a Picasso painting.



On the same day, the Treasury finalized a rule to entirely sever Cambodian conglomerate Huione Group from the U.S. financial system — the most potent action in the U.S. international financial arsenal. It said Phnom Penh-based Huione had been laundering proceeds of crypto scams.



"The rapid rise of transnational fraud has cost American citizens billions of dollars, with life savings wiped out in minutes,” said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, in a statement.



The Treasury Department has steadily been circling Cambodian criminal enterprises, targeting individuals allegedly connected with the vast array of illicit activities there. Those crypto-funded operations have long been a focus of digital assets analytics firms, investigators and even congressional inquiry.



Though the system hasn't yet been established in the U.S., the Treasury Department has been trying to implement President Donald Trump's order to set up a bitcoin reserve. That "strategic" reserve is meant as the destination of any bitcoin seized by the U.S. government, suggesting a potential final stop for the billions in assets taken in this case.

Oops, something went wrong

Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a rare appearance on Crypto Twitter (aka X) timelines early Tuesday to sing the praises of Bitcoin's energy consumption. It appears to mark a change of heart years after he criticized the electricity consumption of Bitcoin mining in 2021.

Musk was weighing in on a discussion of AI becoming the “new global arms race,” and reasoning that precious metals and Bitcoin have been soaring because “it's the ‘debasement' to fund the AI arms race.”

A debasement trade refers to investors seeking a hedge—like silver, gold, or BTC—against a weakening dollar or other fiat currencies.

Musk agreed, adding, “This is why Bitcoin is based on energy: You can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy.”

In doing so, he repeated one of the main arguments the Bitcoin community has used to brush off criticism of its energy consumption. The rationale is that while governments can generate more money, Bitcoin only enters circulation when miners expend energy to process new blocks of transactions and earn it as a reward.

Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, one of the most vocal defenders of BTC, then entered the chat. “The laws of nature are superior to the laws of man,” he said.

One of Musk's earliest mentions of Bitcoin occurred during an interview at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit in 2014.

The interviewer segued from talking about PayPal being spun off by then-parent company eBay to asking Musk about Bitcoin.

“I think Bitcoin is probably a good thing, but it is essentially—I think it's primarily going to be a means of doing illegal transactions," Musk replied. "That's not necessarily, entirely bad. Some things maybe shouldn't be illegal."

He added: “I don't own any Bitcoin, by the way.”

A few years later, in 2017, when people began to speculate that Musk might be the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, he denied the rumor. “Not true,” he said on X. “A friend sent me part of a BTC a few years [ago], but I don't know where it is.”

What the ‘Debasement Trade' Means for Bitcoin

In early 2021, Tesla began accepting Bitcoin as a payment method. But a few months later, it stopped.

At the time, Musk criticized Bitcoin's energy consumption in a tweet, saying “Energy usage trend over past few months is insane” alongside a screenshot from Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. He went on to explain that the electric vehicle maker would accept BTC again if there were “confirmation of reasonable clean energy usage by miners,” adding that reasonable use would mean 50% of all Bitcoin miners.

Elon Musk Wants Bitcoin to Use '50% Clean Energy'—But How Will He Know?

Meanwhile, Tesla has held Bitcoin since February 2021, according to BitcoinTreasuries. The company's 11,509 BTC is worth approximately $1.28 billion at current prices. Tesla, which trades on the Nasdaq under the TSLA ticker, used to own more Bitcoin.

At its height, in May 2021, Tesla's Bitcoin treasury included 43,200 BTC. But the company sold a portion of its holdings the same month it stopped accepting Bitcoin as payment, then sold 75% of its holdings in July 2022, citing “Bitcoin impairment.” At the time, the sale generated roughly $936 million.

The European Parliament is currently working on legislation for the introduction of a digital euro. Members of Europe's Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) Committee requested data from the European Central Bank on two key points relating to the digital euro: the impact on financial stability and the costs of developing the central bank digital currency (CBDC). As context, previously banking associations have raised concerns about the digital euro driving an outflow of deposits from banks with a consequent impact on financial stability. Hence, in order to protect banks, holding limits are planned. While the ECB is expected to make a decision on the limit, several EU countries are not keen on conceding that control.

Most research has examined holding limits of between €500 and €3,000. A recent ECB survey indicated that the central bank was considering limits of up to €10,000. One German banking survey claimed that with a €3,000 holding limit, only 56 of 714 institutions would meet legally required liquidity buffers. By contrast, the ECB's latest research found far more benign results. However, as highlighted below, there's a data dimension that is omitted from both the latest report and the digital euro survey results published earlier this year. 

Before exploring the results, the central bank makes two valid points. Firstly, the ongoing digitalization trend is reducing the demand for cash and increasing bank deposits. This could partially (or entirely) offset any drain on deposits from the introduction of a digital euro. Secondly, in a flight to safety scenario, if there were a €3,000 holding limit, that might attract some deposits. But the existence of dollar stablecoins without caps could present a far larger financial stability risk, although we'd argue probably not yet, given crypto is not yet entirely mainstream.

The world's largest asset manager is developing its own technology related to digital representations of traditional assets, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on Tuesday.

If the company—which disclosed a record $13.46 trillion in assets under management—could move toward offering ETFs as tokens to investors, then that would broaden access to capital markets and reduce fees, he said during the firm's third-quarter earnings broadcast.

As BlackRock leans deeper into digital assets, Fink said the firm is already “having conversations with all the major platforms” in finance about how they can play a role in BlackRock's tokenization push, within the context of digital wallets.

Since Fink touted tokenization as the future of markets in 2022, he has remained as a high-profile backer of the technology on Wall Street, serving as a potential harbinger for how the most influential financial institutions could adopt digital assets over time. 

“It is our belief that we need to be moving rapidly,” Fink said of tokenization. “We need to be tokenizing all assets, especially assets that have multiple levels of intermediaries.”

Although BlackRock isn't focusing on digital representations of real estate, Fink highlighted it as one area that tokenization could reduce fees. Because every intermediary involved is charging fees, Fink said tokenization could make home ownership more affordable.

Tokenized assets have seen some adoption among individual investors, but Fink said “young people” are the ones that are heavily using them. Introducing them to more traditional assets sooner could allow investors to better prepare for life events like retirement, he posited.

BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUIDL, which debuted last year, is among the largest tokenized assets at $2.8 billion, according to data from RWA.xyz. As of Tuesday, it had 89 holders, while being issued by a firm called Securitize.

BlackRock led a $47 million strategic funding round in Securitize this year. BlackRock's Global Head of Strategic Ecosystem Partnerships, Joseph Chalom, called the firm's investment “another step in the evolution of our digital assets strategy” at the time.

BlackRock is behind the largest ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have $93 billion and $17 billion worth of assets under management, respectively, according to CoinGlass data.

Although BlackRock is racing towards tokenized markets, Fink suggested that it might be a while before the public gets a clearer look at what the Wall Street titan has in store

“I do believe we have some exciting announcements in the coming years on how we could play a larger role on this whole idea of the tokenization and digitization of all assets,” he said. “We're spending a great deal of time on the tech. I'm trying to develop our own technology related to this."

Elon Musk said on Tuesday that Bitcoin's value stems from its reliance on real energy, contrasting it with traditional fiat currencies that governments can create at will.

The world's richest man, who has a history of criticizing government spending, once again publicly placed digital gold above traditional finance.

Musk claimed that Bitcoin's value is rooted in real-world energy use, arguing that while governments can print money, they cannot “fake” the energy that underpins Bitcoin's creation.

Responding to a post by financial blog ZeroHedge on X about AI driving up global energy demand, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO wrote:

“True. That is why Bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy.”

True. 

That is why Bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 14, 2025 



ZeroHedge had described AI as the “new global arms race,” suggesting that while governments will pour vast sums into developing the technology, the real constraint will be energy supply.

“The money is not the problem… But you can't print energy,” the account said.

ZeroHedge linked the rise in prices of gold, silver, and Bitcoin to what it called the “debasement” of money, the gradual loss of purchasing power that occurs when more currency is created to fund major national projects.

Historically, debasement referred to reducing the precious metal content in coins. In modern economies, it often describes the effects of monetary expansion, such as central banks “printing money.”

Crypto advocates have long argued that Bitcoin is designed to resist debasement, due to its fixed supply of 21 million coins and energy-intensive mining process.

They claim this helps prevent manipulation by governments or central banks, unlike fiat currencies, which can be issued in unlimited quantities.

The laws of nature are superior to the laws of man.

— Michael Saylor (@saylor) October 14, 2025 



One of the world's leading Bitcoin advocates, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, responded to Musk's post:

“The laws of nature are superior to the laws of man.”

Bitcoin's actual energy consumption has reached levels comparable to those of entire nations, drawing growing criticism over its environmental footprint.

The network uses about 250 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity each day — a scale of demand that rivals the daily power consumption of several smaller countries.

In an article  by Steven Ferrey, a professor of law at Suffolk University Law School, he claimed the cost of crypto has had an “astronomical” impact on the energy industry.

Ferrey noted that some residents in New York towns have seen their energy bills increase by more than 30% in some cases.

Over a year, that amounts to roughly 91,500 GWh, more than the annual energy use of over 80 nations.

To illustrate the magnitude, Bitcoin's daily electricity use equals nearly 228 days of energy consumption in Somalia.

In U.S. terms, the same amount of energy could power around 8.4 million homes for an entire day.

Artificial intelligence, or AI, is transforming the way we live and work, from tools like ChatGPT to advances in healthcare, business and education. 

But as AI grows more powerful, so do the threats against it.

Watch NBC6 free wherever you are

One of the biggest risks is “data poisoning,” when hackers use malicious information into the AI data systems that they rely on to learn.

AI is built on massive amounts of data, and it's able to process it at lightning speeds to impressive results and even help machines “think.” But it's that dependence on data that is also its greatest weakness. 

“Data poisoning is a type of cyberattack that can happen at different stages of developing an AI system,” said Dr. Hadi Amini, associated professor of computer science at Florida International University. 

He explains that poisoned data can be secretly inserted in an AI system to trick everything from drones to self-driving cars into making dangerous mistakes.

Amini showed NBC6 how a green laser pointer or other subtle signal can trick an AI-powered camera into misreading a red traffic light as green. 



“For that red light, now it thinks it's a green light with a probability of over 80 percent,” Amini said. “A small green spot was able to deceive this specific computer vision system.” 

The consequences of that deception could be catastrophic. 

“It could have major deadly consequences,” Amini warned.

To help protect against these types of attacks, Amini and his team of 10 FIU Ph.D. students are developing a new AI security framework called blockchain-based federated learning, or BCFL. It uses the same decentralized blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to add extra layers of protection to AI systems. 

“Instead of solely relying on the camera of your car, we are using the cars or autonomous systems around you,”  Amini explained. “All of these cameras should agree on the decision, whether it's a green light or red light.” 

By working together, devices can identify and reject poisoned data before it ever reaches the decision-making process.

Ph.D. candidate Ervin Moore compared it to referees reviewing a foul during a sports game. 

“If you imagine like referees in a sports game, if one referee finds a foul, all the referees congregate and look over the information,” he said. “That's essentially what the system does to verify the data.” 

Autonomous vehicle companies already have strong security protocols in place to prevent these types of data poisoning attacks, but the FIU team hopes its BCFL algorithm can add an extra line of defense. 

“We've added multiple layers of verification,” Moore said. “We look at input data and verify that it hasn't been poisoned before it gets to the car's system.”

The FIU team is now working with partners to test their blockchain-based federated learning algorithm in real-world scenarios. They hope the technology will be ready for full use within the next couple of years.

BlackRock (BLK), the asset management giant overseeing more than $13 trillion of assets, is ramping up efforts to bring traditional finance (TradiFi) onchain, seeking a bigger role in tokenization as a way to unlock access to markets and streamline how assets are traded.

Teams across the firm are exploring how to use tokenization to make markets more efficient and accessible, with leadership hinting at bigger moves ahead, CEO Larry Fink said during an earnings call following its earnings release Tuesday. 

"I do believe we have some exciting announcements in the coming years on how we could play a larger role on this whole idea of the tokenization and digitization of our assets," Fink said.

Fink said that he sees digital asset — a market currently worth over $4.5 trillion — growing "significantly" over the next few years.

BlackRock was among the firsts to issue spot-based bitcoin BTC$112,218.68 and ether ETH$4,008.00 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., and are the largest products of their kind with $93 billion and $17 billion in assets under management (AUM), respectively.

The asset manager is also behind the largest tokenized money market fund on the market, the $2.8 billion BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) issued with tokenization specialist Securitize and available across various blockchains including Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche. BlackRock led Securitize's $47 million fundraising round last year betting on tokenization gaining traction.

BlackRock's AUM grew to $13.4 trillion in the third quarter of the year, up from $11.4 trillion in the previous year. The firm reported $61 million in revenue from its digital asset products, only a fraction of the company's total revenue of $6.5 billion, per the earnings release. 

BlackRock shares traded around 1.5% higher during morning trading on Tuesday.

Home - Crypto Presales - Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Price Expected To Further Dump As Remittix ICO Raises Over $27.4 Million

Shiba Inu (SHIB) price prediction is turning bearish once again as sentiment in the market becomes uncertain after a turbulent crypto weekend. Following months of uneven performance, investors are becoming increasingly doubtful with SHIB's potential for recovery with growing signs that meme coin hype is rapidly fading.

Shiba Inu, once a popular meme coin, is gradually losing market share to newer, more thrilling projects like Remittix (RTX) — a DeFi token that is revolutionizing cross-border payments. Remittix ICO has already raised over $27.4 million, pulling massive attention from traders considering real-world utility and long-term prospects. 











Shiba Inu is currently trading at $0.00001098, following a significant gain of 6.76% rise in the last 24 hours with trading volume of $403.48 million, up by 26.26%.











This rebound shows some relief buying after last Friday's sell-off, which saw panic erupt after Donald Trump issued a bold warning of 100% tariffs for China and the export ban of rare earth. 

Though SHIB Price has experienced a small rebound, the experts remain cautious in expecting sustainable growth under low token utility and ongoing market uncertainty. 

The majority of recent Shiba Inu News points towards profit trading in the short term but no long-term faith, especially with investors looking for crypto with usable use cases and lower gas charges.

Amid this market reset, Remittix is currently one of the best crypto presale 2025 contenders, having exceeded $27.4 million funded and selling more than 678 million tokens at $0.1166 per token. 

Unlike meme-based tokens, the Remittix DeFi project is focused on developing a cross-chain cryptocurrency-to-fiat bridge, enabling users to send cryptocurrencies to bank accounts in more than 30 countries.

Its Beta Wallet is live today, allowing community test users to observe real-time crypto payments, gas fee-efficient transactions, and immediate FX conversions between 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. With future listings already in the bag on BitMart and LBank, the project's visibility and liquidity are going to surge exponentially in the next few months.

The Remittix project is now officially verified by prominent blockchain auditor CertiK. More astonishingly, Remittix is ranked #1 on CertiK for pre-launch tokens, which reflects its technical competence, transparency, and trustworthiness.











With speculative investments such as Shiba Inu Coin being volatile, platforms like Remittix are gaining recognition for offering financial solutions in the real world. In unifying secure verification, live product testing, and worldwide payment functionality under one roof, RTX stands as one of the top performing cryptocurrency under $1 with long-term value.

 Researchers have uncovered a new Android vulnerability that allows malicious apps to reconstruct on-screen content, such as recovery phrases and two-factor authentication codes. 

A newly discovered Android vulnerability enables malicious applications to access content displayed by other apps, potentially compromising crypto wallet recovery phrases, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes and more.

According to a recent research paper, the “Pixnapping” attack “bypasses all browser mitigations and can even steal secrets from non-browser apps.” This is possible by leveraging Android application programming interfaces (API) to calculate the content of a specific pixel displayed by a different application.

This is not as simple as the malicious application requesting and accessing the display content of another application. Instead, it layers a stack of attacker-controlled, semi-transparent activities to mask all but a chosen pixel, then manipulates that pixel so its color dominates the frame.

By repeating this process and timing frame renders, the malware infers those pixels to reconstruct on-screen secrets. This, fortunately, takes time and limits the attack's usefulness against content that is not displayed for more than a few seconds.

One kind of particularly sensitive information that tends to stay on screen for much longer than a few seconds is crypto wallet recovery phrases. Those phrases, which allow full, unchecked access to the connected crypto wallets, require users to write them down for safekeeping. The paper tested the attack on 2FA codes on Google Pixel devices:

While a full 12-word recovery phrase would take much longer to capture, the attack remains viable if the user leaves the phrase visible while writing it down.

The vulnerability was tested on five devices running Android versions 13 to 16: the Google Pixel 6, Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8, Google Pixel 9 and the Samsung Galaxy S25. The researchers said the same attack could work on other Android devices since the exploited APIs are widely available.

Google initially attempted to patch the flaw by limiting how many activities an app can blur at once. However, the researchers said they found a workaround that still enables Pixnapping to function.

According to the paper, Google rated the issue as high severity and committed to awarding the researchers a bug bounty. The team also reached out to Samsung to warn that “Google's patch was insufficient to protect Samsung devices.”

The most obvious solution to the issue is to avoid displaying recovery phrases or any other particularly sensitive content on Android devices. Even better would be to avoid displaying recovery information on any internet-capable device.

A simple solution to achieve just that is to use a hardware wallet. A hardware wallet is a dedicated key management device that signs transactions externally to a computer or smartphone without ever exposing the private key or recovery phrase. As threat researcher Vladimir S put it in an X post on the subject:

 The FCA has outlined a roadmap to help asset managers adopt blockchain and tokenization, aiming to boost efficiency and competition. 

The United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) revealed a roadmap to help asset managers adopt blockchain technology for fund tokenization.

In a Tuesday announcement, the regulator said the initiative aims to “provide firms with additional clarity” to adopt tokenization and “drive innovation and growth in asset management.”

“Tokenization has the potential to drive fundamental changes in asset management, with benefits for the industry and consumers,” said Simon Walls, executive director of markets at the FCA. “There are many things that firms can do under our existing rules and more that become possible with the changes we propose enacting now,” he added. 

According to the FCA, tokenized products can increase competition, reduce costs and broaden investment access, particularly to private markets and infrastructure. By digitizing fund operations, asset managers could also lower reconciliation and data-sharing costs.

The plan includes guidance for operating tokenized fund registers under existing rules via the UK Blueprint model, a simplified dealing framework for processing both traditional and tokenized fund units and a roadmap for blockchain-based settlement. 

The FCA also intends to explore how regulation may need to evolve as tokenization becomes more widespread. “The UK has the opportunity to be a world-leader here and we want to provide asset managers with the clarity and confidence they need to deliver,” Walls said.

Last month, Coinbase asked users to support a public petition calling on the UK to develop a pro-innovation strategy for blockchain and stablecoins. The petition called for a framework including stablecoin and tokenization regulation, blockchain adoption and the appointment of a blockchain “czar.”

The UK's approach to crypto regulation has drawn criticism from industry stakeholders. In June, analysts from the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), an independent think tank, warned that Britain has squandered its early lead in distributed ledger finance.

In July, Coinbase also released a satirical video titled “Everything is Fine,” taking aim at Britain's financial system. The footage used lyrics and music that brag about the country's strong finances while depicting scenes of inflation, poverty and financial struggles. 

The industry pressure appears to have paid off. Last week, the FCA lifted its 2019 ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) for retail investors, allowing trading on FCA-approved, UK-based exchanges. 

Furthermore, the Bank of England is reportedly easing proposed limits on corporate stablecoin holdings, considering exemptions for firms needing larger fiat-backed reserves.

Home » News » Blockchain associations partner to bridge state, federal stablecoin policies

The North American Blockchain Association (NABA) and the Blockchain Association (BA) are launching a strategic alliance to bridge state and federal stablecoin policy coordination. 

The partnership will focus on ensuring that state policymakers understand the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, or GENIUS, Act, and can effectively develop supporting state-level regulations.

This is the first formal collaboration between NABA, the leading coordinator of state-level blockchain policy efforts, and the BA, the leading federal blockchain advocacy organization. 

“This partnership fills a vital gap in our policy ecosystem by connecting state-level implementation with federal innovation frameworks,” Jessi Goostree, executive director of the North American Blockchain Association, said. “NABA represents the collective voice of states, territories, and provinces working to advance coherent blockchain policies. Partnering with the Blockchain Association ensures our state-level constituents have direct access to federal policy expertise as they navigate this new regulatory landscape.”

With the GENIUS Act establishing federal stablecoin regulations, both organizations recognize the importance of equipping state officials and regulators with a thorough understanding of federal requirements as they develop state policies. The partnership will focus on preventing conflicting regulatory approaches that could fragment the national stablecoin framework.

“The GENIUS Act represents a landmark opportunity to modernize U.S. payment infrastructure through innovation, with both federal and state regulators playing important roles in the Act's implementation,” Michael Postupak, policy engagement manager at the Blockchain Association, said. “Through this partnership, we're ensuring that state policymakers have the tools, knowledge, and federal context they need to unlock the full promise of stablecoin technology for their state economy, in addition to consumers and businesses alike.”

The two organizations will work to develop targeted educational initiatives for state officials, coordinate policy messaging between state and federal levels, and facilitate knowledge sharing to promote consistent regulatory approaches nationwide.

Quick Facts:

Bitcoin is king.

It's the most secure, battle-tested blockchain in history, and has proven its resilience again and again.

When the latest crypto market instability resurfaced, wiping hundreds of billions off the total crypto market cap, Bitcoin wobbled, plunged – and then rebounded, weathering the storm just like it always has.



Yet, for all its dominance, Bitcoin, as a blockchain, still struggles with growing pains: slow transfers, high fees during congestion, and a lack of a native environment for DeFi or complex smart contracts.

Could Hyper be the upgrade Bitcoin's ecosystem needs?

At its core, Bitcoin is a rigid, ultra-secure ledger designed for trustless settlement. But that same rigidity creates bottlenecks:

These limitations constrain BTC's trajectory, restricting it to a passive store of value rather than an active application platform or even its original vision as a digital payment.

Hyper directly targets those limitations.

Bitcoin Hyper designs a bridge between Bitcoin's impregnable base layer and a high-speed execution layer. Its blueprint features:

Hyper adapts Solana's runtime environment to run smart contracts, parallel execution, and composable dApps – giving Bitcoin access to a high-throughput application layer.

Users deposit $BTC into a trustless bridge. Wrapped $BTC is minted on Hyper, enabling users to use their $BTC in the faster L2. When they want to exit, the wrapped token is burned, and $BTC is released on L1, validated via proofs.

Bitcoin Hyper batches L2 transactions, compresses them into succinct proofs (zero-knowledge or ZK proofs), and commits to Bitcoin's base chain. That ensures correctness without congesting the base layer.



On the utility side, the $HYPER token enables:

The native $HYPER token is central to the economy, serving as fuel for gas, staking incentives, governance, and developer rewards. Its fixed supply (21B) and deflationary burner options give it a built-in scarcity model.

Bitcoin Hyper's presale powers on, with tokens currently priced at $0.013115. The rate escalates periodically, rewarding early backers.

Token allocation is designed to fuel growth but also reward stakeholders:

Stakers can earn high APYs – currently 50% – in the early stages of the project. To reap the greatest rewards, learn how to buy and stake $HYPER during the presale.



As network usage grows, demand for $HYPER to pay gas, stake, and vote increases. Since supply is fixed, the potential upside is already built in. Combined with Bitcoin's own recovery, $HYPER could be a turbocharged, leveraged play on $BTC's resurgence.

Our price prediction forecasts $HYPER potentially reaching $0.32 by the end of the year as Bitcoin regains ground. Multiyear scenarios – especially if the ecosystem grows – show the chance that $HYPER could reach the heady territory of $1.50.

Meanwhile, with Bitcoin down roughly 10% over the past week, the story $HYPER tells is a simple one: Bitcoin Hyper is your way to not just ride Bitcoin's rebound but push the boundaries of what Bitcoin can do.

Execution is hard: building secure bridges, ZK proof systems, fallback dispute layers, and seamless UX won't be easy.

Notable purchases include:

There's growing interest in a protocol that unlocks Bitcoin's full utility for the ever-expanding crypto economy.

In that sense, Bitcoin Hyper isn't merely a speculative token – it presents itself as an essential upgrade for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Hyper could thrust $BTC into the future as not only digital gold, but also programmable money, capable of supporting real-time applications, DeFi flows, and a new generation of use cases.

Bitcoin Hyper's own utility is clear: investors can ride $BTC's recovery while also betting on the migration of capital and utility into Bitcoin's upgraded layer. If that feedback loop ignites, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could become the next crypto to 1000x, propelling both $HYPER and $BTC to new heights.

As always, do your own research; this isn't financial advice.

U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a combined net outflow of $755 million on October 13, as investors reacted to the aftermath of one of the largest liquidation events in crypto history.

The sell-off, which wiped more than $500 billion from the market over the weekend, has shaken investor confidence following renewed U.S.–China trade tensions.

 to data from SoSoValue, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw total outflows of $326.52 million, while Ethereum spot ETFs recorded $428.52 million in net withdrawals, their third consecutive day of losses. Source: 

The outflows mark a sharp reversal from the strong inflows seen earlier in the month, suggesting heightened caution among institutional investors.BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Holds Firm as Crypto Funds Face $500M Outflows

Among Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was the only product to record inflows, adding $60.36 million on the day. IBIT now holds $93.11 billion in total net assets and maintains cumulative inflows of $65.32 billion, continuing to dominate the sector. 

In contrast, Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) posted the highest daily outflow at $145.39 million, bringing its cumulative net outflow to $24.35 billion. Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also reported withdrawals of $93.28 million.Source: 

As of October 13, the total net asset value of Bitcoin spot ETFs stood at $157.18 billion, representing 6.81% of Bitcoin's total market capitalization. Trading volumes reached $6.63 billion for the day, underscoring elevated activity amid market uncertainty.

Ethereum spot ETFs even deeper redemptions. BlackRock's Ethereum ETF (ETHA) led the decline with $310.13 million in outflows, followed by Grayscale's ETHE with $20.99 million and Fidelity's FETH with $19.12 million.Source: 

The total net asset value of Ethereum spot ETFs fell to $28.75 billion, equal to 5.56% of Ethereum's market capitalization. Cumulative inflows across all Ether ETFs now stand at $14.48 billion, down from $15.08 billion earlier in the week.

The broader market downturn was triggered after U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed plans to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, sparking fears of an extended trade war.

Beijing by warning it was ready to “fight to the end,” deepening global market jitters. Bitcoin prices dropped 2.54% to $112,283, while Ethereum fell 3.39% to $4,030.

Despite the weekend's volatility, data from CoinShares earlier this week showed that crypto investment products had attracted $3.17 billion in inflows over the previous week, even as markets faced heavy selling pressure. 

Bitcoin funds led with $2.7 billion in inflows, while Ether funds gained $338 million before the latest reversal.

However, total assets under management for crypto funds slipped to $242 billion from $254 billion the week prior. 

CoinShares noted that trading volumes during the correction reached record highs, with $10.4 billion traded on Friday alone, reflecting heightened activity as investors adjusted positions.Bitcoin and Ethereum Slide Ahead of Powell Speech as Traders Brace for Volatility

Bitcoin and Ethereum extended their declines this week as traders brace for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech, which could determine whether the crypto market stabilizes or faces further losses.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell 3.1% in the past 24 hours and nearly 10% over the week, trading at $111,700, about 11% below its record high of $126,080. 

Ethereum (ETH) dropped to $3,974, down 5.1% on the day and 15.2% over seven days. The broader market slipped 3.2%, bringing total capitalization to $3.8 trillion.

Analysts say Powell's comments at the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) meeting in Philadelphia could influence sentiment on interest rate cuts. A more hawkish tone could extend selling pressure across risk assets, including crypto.

Meanwhile, traders are closely watching Bitcoin's tightening volatility. According to analyst Tony “The Bull” Severino, the cryptocurrency's Bollinger Bands on the weekly chart are showing “record compression,” a condition that has historically preceded large price swings. 

Severino warned that the current setup could lead to either a parabolic breakout or the end of the ongoing bull cycle within the next 100 days.

Despite the downturn, institutional interest remains firm. BitMine, the world's largest corporate Ether holder, disclosed that it had increased its ETH holdings during last weekend's crash, purchasing over 202,000 ETH valued at $827 million. 

The move raised its total stake to more than 3 million ETH, roughly 2.5% of the total supply, at an average price of $4,154.

New paper by Bindseil/Senner suggests sovereignty at risk, also from the home team 

The ‘digital euro does not appear to be the solution to any of these problems' is a familiar refrain in central bank digital currency discussions with incumbent commercial bank and payments players, but is perhaps unexpected from the man charged with piloting digital euro legislation through the European Parliament.

The challenges range from the decline of cash use, the dominance of non-European players in payments to the anticipated rise of stablecoins. Fernando Navarette, the ‘rapporteur' in question, is challenging the European Central Bank project head on, lobbying instead for a commercial bank-oriented answer, while regulators and the central bank would vouchsafe interoperability and set the framework for the private sector to operate in.

The Eurosystem presses on, less controversially, with wholesale CBDC in response to accelerating distributed ledger technology-based finance in the US. However, a more contentious battle still rages over the future of European retail payments. Here, complicated technical and political considerations find themselves alongside sophisticated lobbying on behalf of vested interests. Those, a new paper contends, may be harming not only Europe's monetary sovereignty but its (quasi-)national sovereignty.

Building a case for the digital euro

The provenance of the paper is significant, authored by Ulrich Bindseil, formerly director general, market infrastructure and payment systems at the ECB and a progenitor of the digital euro project, together with Richard Senner from the Swiss National Bank. It appears to rebut claims such as that by Markus Ferber, economic spokesperson for the European People's Party in the European Parliament, that ‘vague notions of monetary sovereignty do not cut it' as a compelling case for the digital euro.

Bindseil and Senner open their paper with an argument between the US and Brazil about Pix, Banco Central do Brasil's instant payments platform. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has complained unfairly benefits the Brazilian government system at the expense of US commercial interests. which exemplifies the increasingly brutal potential impact of resurgent mercantilism on the freedom of sovereign nations to act in their own monetary interests.

This new reality, coupled with the essentially boundless nature of technology, is changing the calculations that policy-makers should make about versions of money and payments. India, Brazil and China have concluded that the state needs to continue to treat payments as a public good in the digital realm, even if the private sector is to play an important role in it. These major jurisdictions also found a way to work with initially reluctant banks on these projects – the economic impact in India has been particularly pronounced.

Broadening definition of sovereignty

In the joint paper, Bindseil/Senner propose to define monetary sovereignty as ‘the freedom and ability of a nation's people to effectively govern themselves such as to decide and implement the best policies in their present and future interest regarding the creation and the usage of currency, including the unit of account, means of payment, and store of value functions'. While uncontroversial, the logic quickly flows into practically contentious areas: ‘no dependency and vulnerability to hostile foreign actors, fraud prevention, consumer protection, restricting the abuse of market power', along with the ability to collect seigniorage, and prevent the collection of information by foreign actors. At meetings with OMFIF's Digital Monetary Institute, a wide range of conservative-leaning European market participants have referenced so-called ‘kill switches in Washington'. As of 2022, international card schemes represented 61% of payments in Europe.

Bindseil/Senner's broader definition of sovereignty rests on a notion of the public good and the perspective of the people, who in their view should be the ultimate sovereign, rather than merely the freedom of a government to act as it wishes. The contention is that, while populists may appear to advance national interests, they may, in practice, undermine sovereignty. This happens not merely by pursuing zero-sum mercantilism, but also by by actually favouring vested interests of industry lobbies instead of those of the people. Not infrequently, populists object to public versions of digital money.

Battle of public and industry interest

Threats to European monetary sovereignty might lie much closer to home in the form of careful lobbying by European banking groups looking to protect transaction services revenues and deposits. So far, central bank money in the form of cash has been a viable alternative to private solutions, but with the current trend towards electronic payments, this may soon be over, implying that banks could benefit from liquidity inflows (when banknote holdings decline) and higher fees collected through private payment solutions to which they participate (such as interchange fees).

The exit of central bank money would not only increase the market share of the private sector, but also reduce competition in a market dominated by network effects and thereby enlarge the scope for abusive fee setting. Preserving the role of central bank money would therefore be in the interest of the people, while its exit would be in the interest of the industry.

This lobbying has already resulted in a partial neutering of the digital euro project through the adding of holding limits – anticipated to be €3000 or lower – and a guarantee that it will not be remunerated. These decisions are designed to lessen the attractiveness of the instrument in comparison to bank money.

The private sector has so far not covered itself in glory with the creation of a pan-European payments champion. One observer suggested that recent attempts to achieve an interoperability solution between EPI and EuroPA, was merely a vehicle for banks to argue that CBDC is unnecessary, and stall for time.

European public money finds itself therefore in a peculiar limbo. With widespread but rapidly declining cash use, no credible private-sector player yet to join Mastercard and Visa in payments facilitation, potential disruption from new private versions of money in the form of stablecoins, new risks from military or commercial adversaries, including former allies, and lobbyist pressure to prevent state vehicles stepping in to remedy what might be described in the short term as a market failure, Bindseil/Senner would contend that this case is far from ‘vague'.

Silicon Valley crypto billionaire Tim Draper and his associates are expanding their blockchain venture studio outside of Los Angeles for the first time — to Troy.

Draper Goren Blockchain, located at 3221 W. Big Beaver Road, will serve as the firm's second office location, as a strategic hub for incubating and accelerating portfolio companies, which include real estate technology startups, according to a news release.

It will also house DGB's expanding team of operators, which includes six employees, and serve as a meeting space and coworking environment for Michigan-based portfolio companies and teams flying in from out of town, David Bleznak, founding partner of DGB, told Crain's in an email. The office will also be led by Bleznak, who was born and raised in the area.

Draper Goren Blockchain was founded in 2023 in Los Angeles by Tim Draper, Alon Goren, and Bleznak. The firm has several Michigan-based portfolio companies, “and with our current and planned growth, it made sense to establish a centrally located space for these teams,” Bleznak said.

The office will not only serve local portfolio companies, but will also serve the firm's out-of-town companies “to give them a home base, meeting spot and connections within the mortgage epicenter of America,” Bleznak said.

"I'm incredibly excited to see our companies thriving at this level," Alon Goren, founding partner at DGB, said in the release. "Opening a second home base in Michigan is a testament to our success, and I couldn't be prouder to have it led by my incredible partner, David Bleznak."

The expansion to the Detroit-area market comes on the heels of exceptional performance from the firm's PropTech portfolio companies, including Troy-headquartered mortgage broker LitFinancial and Birmingham-based AIVRE, an AI-powered appraisal software platform.

The firm makes regular investments averaging about one new portfolio company a month, Bleznak said, but also doubles up on its growing teams and continually invests in them. These additional investments can be through the firm's partners within the Draper Venture Network, like Draper Associates, or through funds that Goren and Bleznak manage directly as the Draper Goren managers.

Though the firm invests exclusively in real estate-related technologies, Draper — a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who made early investments in Tesla, SpaceX and Hotmail — invests in startups across the board in his "Shark Tank"-style show, “Meet the Drapers,” for which he filmed an episode of its 10th season Sept. 26 at Newlab in Detroit.

Four startups from across Michigan were selected from 250 applications to participate in the pitch competition: Marquette-headquartered aerospace logistics company Kall Morris Inc.; East Lansing-based public transit technology company; Detroit-based cybersecurity company Block Harbor, which is headquartered in Newlab; and BRCĒ, an East Lansing-headquartered company developing patented shoelaces.

Detroit was one stop on Draper's tour across the U.S., designed to bring attention to America's startup ecosystem. "Meet the Drapers" will air on the show's website as well as on YouTube. The winner of the Detroit-based competition will be revealed when the episodes air next year, and that founder will move on to the show's semifinals.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group has expanded its crypto derivatives by launching option products for Solana SOLUSDT and XRP. The new products were approved by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which went live on October 13 on CME's US platform. 

XRP and Solana Launch on CME

The world's largest derivatives marketplace has now introduced options on SOL and XRP, marking a major step in broadening its altcoin offerings. This means traders can now exchange these altcoin options on the CME exchange in the same way as trading Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

These newly introduced options allow traders to receive actual SOL and XRP futures, which are available in both standard and micro contract sizes. They have daily, monthly, and quarterly expiration. This move not only shows investors' confidence in CME but also underlines the growing demand for XRP and Solana.

Since 2017, after launching Bitcoin on its platform, CME has continued to expand its offerings and strengthen its crypto derivatives portfolio. It also plans to make its crypto futures and option products available 24/7 by early 2026. 

Moreover, CME also reported more than 540,000 contracts after its launch of Solana in March 2025, which surged to over $22.3 billion in volume. Meanwhile, XRP also saw rapid adoption, with 370,000 contracts traded and $16.2 billion in volume. So, this move of launching crypto derivatives is a direct response to this increasing demand. 

XRP & Solana Price

Currently, both assets are experiencing a downturn in price and trading volume. XRP is trading at $2.45, marking a 6.73% drop from the previous day, while SOL is priced at $194.58 with a 1.20% dip. Followed by the fear of a trade war between the US and China, investors began selling their cryptocurrencies, which resulted in this plunge. 

However, some are still hopeful for bullish market sentiment as the deadline for crypto ETF approval nears. 

FAQs

Traders can trade SOL and XRP options in standard or micro contracts, with daily, monthly, or quarterly expirations.

CME expanded to meet growing demand for altcoins, offering more futures and options after seeing strong SOL and XRP trading volumes.

Currently, both are down—XRP at $2.45 and SOL at $194.58—impacted by market fears like US-China trade tensions.

Robot Consulting, a company expanding from HR solutions into legal tech and the metaverse, announced on the 13th October the appointment of Soryu Taro as its Head of Cryptocurrency Shareholder Engagement, effective on 26 September 2025.

The move signals a strategic shift for the company as it deepens its foray into the digital asset space following its Nasdaq listing on 18 July 2025.

According to the official announcement, Soryu Taro is a Gen Z investor who began participating in stock markets in elementary school. Boasting a combined following of over 146,000 users on X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube, the company expects his influence and communication power to help expand its investor base and strengthen ties with younger demographics.

Beyond operating its cloud-based HR management system, Labor Robot, the company is also developing the “Robot Lawyer” project, which integrates blockchain technology into legal services. In his new role, Soryu will collaborate with Masaaki Seki, former Representative Director of bitFlyer Holdings, to advise on the company's Ethereum (ETH) investment strategy.

The appointment of a Gen Z influencer is backed by several strategic calculations. The company reported a 2.5% year-on-year decrease in revenue to 6.756 billion yen for the 2025 fiscal year, highlighting the need to develop new revenue streams.

Robot Consulting plans to invest approximately 10 billion yen (roughly $64 million USD*) into Ethereum, utilizing funds raised from its recent IPO.

In an official statement, CEO Amit Turkle said, “Through our participation in Ethereum and engagement with crypto investors, we aim to strengthen our financial foundation, create synergies with our businesses, and provide long-term value to our shareholders.”

The company intends to integrate Ethereum's smart contract infrastructure and blockchain ecosystem into its legal tech division to develop innovative solutions. This includes combining blockchain with AI data to enhance services like automated compliance checks and dispute resolution.

The investment process is scheduled to begin in Q4 2025 or spring 2026. The value of the held Ethereum assets will be updated quarterly, with valuation gains and losses reflected in its financial statements, marking cryptocurrency investment as a key future growth driver.

U.S. spot bitcoin and ether exchange traded funds saw a combined net outflow of $755 million on the first day after the historic crypto liquidations event over the weekend.

According to SoSoValue data, spot bitcoin ETFs recorded $326.5 million in negative flows yesterday. 

Grayscale's GBTC had $145.4 million worth of outflows and Bitwise's BITB had $115.64 million in outflows. While funds from Fidelity, Ark & 21Shares and VanEck also recorded outflows, BlackRock's IBIT reported a positive flow of $60.36 million.

Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a heavier $428.5 million net outflow, with funds moving out from seven ether ETFs with no inflows on the day. BlackRock's ETHA saw $310 million net outflows, which marks its second worst performance since debut.

"Monday's outflows reflect post-liquidation caution," said Vincent Liu, CIO at Kronos Research. "Investors are pausing, clearly waiting for clearer macro signals before putting more capital to work. Sentiment is driving activity more than fundamentals now."

Crypto saw one of its largest liquidation events in history last weekend, wiping out over $500 billion from the market that pushed down entire crypto prices by 10%. This was triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's confirmation that he would impose a 100% tariff on Chinese imports.

Despite the major decline, market prices quickly recovered as Trump softened his tone on the trade conflict. The Kronos Research analyst predicted that ETF flows will see a "measured return" as traders seek clearer macro signals.

"The outflows appear to reflect short-term institutional risk management rather than a structural shift in sentiment," Min Jung, Research Associate at Presto Research, also told The Block. "Looking ahead, ETF flows should begin to stabilize as markets absorb the weekend's volatility and broader macro uncertainty."

Jung added that the market will remain sensitive to U.S.-China trade headlines, which may continue to drive short-term volatility across crypto and other risk assets.

Earlier on Tuesday, China reportedly said that it is ready to "fight to the end" in the trade war with the U.S., suggesting that tension between the two largest economies in the world will persist in the near term.

Crypto prices have already reacted negatively to the news, with bitcoin falling 2.54% to $112,283 while ether dropped 3.39% to $4,030, according to The Block's crypto price page.

                    Crypto analysts said this was the largest wipeout in a 24-hour period in the market's history [File]

Following the largest crypto liquidation in history last Friday, options market investors are bracing for more volatility and further declines in bitcoin and ether, aggressively positioning in trades that offer protection against another potential freefall.

Market participants said the crypto sector on Friday saw more than $19 billion in liquidations across leveraged positions as panic selling and low liquidity triggered sharp swings. The plunge came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced late on Friday a 100% tariff on Chinese imports and threatened export controls on critical software.

Crypto analysts said this was the largest wipeout in a 24-hour period in the market's history, nine times larger than the February 2025 crash and 19 times bigger than the March 2020 meltdown and the FTX collapse in November 2022.

Bitcoin fell as low as $104,782.88 during the October 10-11 period, down more than 14% from its high of $122,574.46 on Friday. It was last up 0.6% at $115,718.13. The world's largest cryptocurrency hit a record high above $126,000 on October 6.

Ether, the second biggest digital currency, dropped 12.2% to a low of $3,436.29 on Friday. It last changed hands at $4,254, up 2.4% on the day.

Altcoins took an even bigger hit as HYPE (-54%), DOGE (-62%), and AVAX (-70%) all experienced steep drawdowns before recovering to post more modest losses.

Trump over the weekend softened his rhetoric on China, however, noting that "it will all be fine" and the U.S. did not want to "hurt" China. That helped the crypto recovery. China on Sunday blamed the U.S. for the escalation, but did not roll out further countermeasures.

"Last Friday, you saw volatility just jump across the board, not only for short-dated, but also for long-dated maturities. The sentiment around short-dated volatility is that more people are worried about downward turns," said Sean Dawson, head of research at Derive.xyz in Canberra.

Data from Derive.xyz, a crypto options trading platform, showed heavy "put" buying from traders in bitcoin and ether, which suggested hedging against potential downside risks.

In bitcoin, there were hefty purchases of puts conferring the right to sell bitcoin at strike prices of $115,000 and $95,000 for the October 31 expiry, according to Dawson. There was also a sharp reversal from call buying to call selling at the $125,000 strike for the October 17 expiry, suggesting a bearish short-term view.

Calls in the options market reflect expectations that the price will increase.

For ether, Nick Forster, Derive.xyz co-founder, said traders focused on the $4,000 strike for the October 31 expiry and $3,600 strike for the October 17 expiry. He also noted substantial buying of $2,600 puts for the December 26 expiry. Those strikes, he said, are indicative of growing bearish sentiment through year-end. Despite the meltdown, Willy Woo, a leading onchain crypto analyst with more than a million on X, noted that bitcoin investor flows have been holding up well and may be the reason it fared better than expected against a sharp decline in stocks.

In contrast, Woo said he saw a large drop in ether flows while Solana continued a decline. He believes that capital in altcoins is likely rotating into bitcoin rather than leaving the system.

Altcoins, also known as alternative coins, refer to cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin, which are often treated as high-risk, high-reward investments. Some altcoins deliver massive returns, but many fail or lose liquidity.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is widely viewed as a "blue-chip" crypto asset, widely-held by institutions.

"The good news is that this (crash) has cleaned out the excessive leverage and reset the risk in the market, for now," said Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau.

"However, bitcoin now faces another uphill battle to break past key resistance levels that will allow it to reach a meaningful new all-time high this year."

Scientists at the Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute (Stevens INI) at the Keck School of Medicine of USC have created a pioneering brain imaging method that captures how the brain's smallest blood vessels pulse in time with each heartbeat. These subtle movements may offer vital insights into aging and conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.

Published in Nature Cardiovascular Research, the study presents the first noninvasive approach for measuring "microvascular volumetric pulsatility" -- the rhythmic swelling and shrinking of tiny blood vessels -- in living humans. Using ultra-high field 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the researchers found that these microvessel pulses become stronger with age, particularly in the brain's deep white matter. This region is essential for communication between brain networks but is also vulnerable to reduced blood flow from distal arteries, which carry blood from the heart to the outermost parts of the body. As these pulses intensify, they may interfere with brain function and contribute to memory decline and Alzheimer's progression.

"Arterial pulsation is like the brain's natural pump, helping to move fluids and clear waste," said Danny JJ Wang, PhD, professor of neurology and radiology at the Keck School of Medicine and senior author of the study. "Our new method allows us to see, for the first time in people, how the volumes of those tiny blood vessels change with aging and vascular risk factors. This opens new avenues for studying brain health, dementia, and small vessel disease."

Scientists have long recognized that stiffness and excessive pulsation in large arteries are linked to stroke, dementia, and small vessel disease. However, until now, it has been nearly impossible to observe these rhythmic changes in the brain's smallest vessels without using invasive procedures limited to animal studies.

To overcome this, the USC team combined two advanced MRI techniques -- vascular space occupancy (VASO) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) -- to monitor subtle shifts in microvessel volume throughout the cardiac cycle. Their results revealed that older adults exhibit stronger microvascular pulsations in deep white matter compared to younger individuals, and that hypertension further intensifies these effects. "These findings provide a missing link between what we see in large vessel imaging and the microvascular damage we observe in aging and Alzheimer's disease," said lead author Fanhua Guo, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Wang's lab.

Excessive vascular pulsation may also disrupt the brain's "glymphatic system," a recently discovered network that removes waste substances such as beta-amyloid, a protein that accumulates in Alzheimer's disease. Over time, interference with this fluid circulation could hasten cognitive decline.

"Being able to measure these tiny vascular pulses in vivo is a critical step forward," said Arthur W. Toga, PhD, director of the Stevens INI. "This technology not only advances our understanding of brain aging but also holds promise for early diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders."

The researchers are exploring how the method could be adapted for wider clinical use, including on more commonly available 3T MRI scanners. Future studies will test whether microvascular volumetric pulsatility predicts cognitive outcomes and whether it can serve as a biomarker for early intervention in Alzheimer's disease and related conditions.

"This is just the beginning," Wang said. "Our goal is to bring this from research labs into clinical practice, where it could guide diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies for millions at risk of dementia."

Cases of influenza are surging in Japan.Credit: Kota Kawasaki/Yomiuri Shimbun via AP/Alamy

Japan's health authorities have declared an influenza epidemic, with thousands of people infected with the respiratory virus. The number of infections is unusual for this time of year, researchers say, and could seed outbreaks in countries that are heading into winter in Asia and Europe — although it is unlikely to become a global pandemic.

As of 10 October, 6,013 cases of influenza virus have been reported in Japan. More than 100 schools have closed, and nearly half of the 287 people who were hospitalized for flu in September were children aged 14 or younger. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare declared a nationwide epidemic on 3 October. Outbreaks are classified as epidemics when the number of infections is higher than expected in a given area over a particular period of time.

Outbreaks of influenza virus tend to occur seasonally each year, predominantly in winter across countries with temperate climates. In Japan, that usually occurs around the end of November. This year, the increase in people being treated for flu started five weeks earlier than usual, says Vinod Balasubramaniam, a molecular virologist at Monash University Malaysia in Subang Jaya.

Japan has had early starts to the flu season in the past few years, but not this early, says Ian Barr, a researcher and deputy director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, who is based in Melbourne, Australia. “You might see cases in October, but not epidemic-type numbers,” says Barr.

Increasing international travel since the COVID-19 pandemic is one factor that could be behind the early start to the flu season, says Balasubramaniam. Other factors include climate change and a lack of exposure to the circulating virus, particularly for elderly people and young children.

Information about which strains are circulating in Japan has not yet emerged, but Barr says the outbreaks there could be caused by a strain of influenza A, called H3N2, that surged in Australia and New Zealand over the past two months, coinciding with the end of winter in the Southern Hemisphere. People from Australia are travelling to Japan in huge numbers, he says, meaning there are more chances for virus transmission between hemispheres.

Experts believe the site where the coins, which date back 2,500 years, were found could have once been a seasonal market.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Celtic-era gold and silver coins excavated in the Czech Republic may be leftover from ancient transactions at a seasonal market. Archaeologists located hundreds of 2,500-year-old coins, some with minting styles never seen before, creating a new mystery surrounding the site. 

Located in the country's Pilsen region to the west, the previously unknown Celtic site has been the subject of excavation for five years. Along with the coins, the team from the Institute of Archaeology of the Czech Academy of Sciences said they also uncovered pieces of gold jewelry, several metal objects (bronze buckles, bracelets, and a horse figurine, for example), and even fragments of both gold and silver ingots. 

“These could have played an independent role in the exchange,” David Danecek, archaeologist with the institute, said regarding the ingots in a translated statement from the Czech Republic, “but they could also have been mined under the supervision—with the consent—of the regional ruler.” 

There's still some mystery surrounding many of the coins that came from a previously unknown mint, a number of which depict animals. There's enough intrigue for Daniel Stranik, an archaeologist from the Museum and Gallery of the Northern Pilsen Region in Mariánská Týnice, to note that the find “may change the current view of Celtic coinage in Bohemia.” 

The discovery dates anywhere between the sixth and first centuries B.C.E. “The main goal of the project was primarily to save movable archaeological finds that are directly threatened by illegal prospectors, plowing, and natural influences,” Jan Marik, director of the institute, said in a statement. Treasure hunters wielding metal detectors are the reason the exact location is a secret.

The size of the previously unknown site mimics that of smaller regional centers in Austria or Moravia, but without clear evidence of a permanent settlement, its past use is unknown. “It could therefore be a place with a significantly seasonal nature of activities, during which people accidentally lost mainly small to very small objects, such as coins,” Danecek said. “The found chopped gold and silver ingots would also correspond to the commercial focus of the site.” 

Already, the museum has started to show a small portion of the find, but the largest and most unique items are currently stored in a safe place, museum director Pavel Kodera said, and will only go on display after a “complete professional evaluation.”

Large language models (LLMs) are transforming laboratory automation by enabling self-driving laboratories (SDLs) that could accelerate materials research. However, current SDL implementations rely on rigid protocols that fail to capture the adaptability and intuition of expert scientists in dynamic experimental settings. Here, we show that LLM agents can automate atomic force microscopy (AFM) through our Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant (AILA) framework. Further, we develop AFMBench—a comprehensive evaluation suite challenging LLM agents across the complete scientific workflow from experimental design to results analysis. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with basic tasks and coordination scenarios. Notably, models excelling at materials science question-answering perform poorly in laboratory settings, showing that domain knowledge does not translate to experimental capabilities. Additionally, we observe that LLM agents can deviate from instructions, a phenomenon referred to as sleepwalking, raising safety alignment concerns for SDL applications. Our ablations reveal that multi-agent frameworks significantly outperform single-agent approaches, though both remain sensitive to minor changes in instruction formatting or prompting. Finally, we evaluate AILA's effectiveness in increasingly advanced experiments—AFM calibration, feature detection, mechanical property measurement, graphene layer counting, and indenter detection. These findings establish the necessity for benchmarking and robust safety protocols before deploying LLM agents as autonomous laboratory assistants across scientific disciplines.

Scientific experimentation demands exceptional domain expertise, from exploration or hypothesis-driven experimental design to precision execution and rigorous data analysis. This complexity creates bottlenecks in scientific discovery, particularly as experimental techniques grow increasingly sophisticated. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has propelled the development of self-driving laboratories (SDLs) that integrate diverse information sources for automated planning1 and experimentation. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-agents2,3 and SDLs have already achieved several feats in materials or molecular discovery4,5,6, chemistry research7, and inorganic materials synthesis. The promise of SDLs toward achieving sustainable development8 has resulted in enormous efforts to harness their potential in high-throughput experimentation and discovery9. Efforts to streamline SDLs have resulted in orchestration architectures such as ChemOS10. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the capability of SDLs can be enhanced by a human-in-the-loop framework that handles disambiguation, thereby enabling better planning and execution11,12. While early demonstrations of LLM-based lab assistants showed promise in chemistry and materials science1,2,3, their operational reliability remains largely uncharacterized beyond specific applications or repetitive use cases with predetermined protocols13,14,15,16,17.

Current research predominantly addresses well-documented or predefined protocols and single-objective tasks, failing to capture the intricate interplay between experimental planning, multi-tool coordination, and result interpretation or online intervention10. While recent investigations incorporating planning elements have demonstrated success in achieving specific experimental objectives, they have not systematically evaluated SDL reliability across the broader spectrum of laboratory automation tasks13,14. Although several studies have benchmarked LLMs15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 and vision language models13,14,24,25 through question-answer protocols to assess their potential as materials research co-pilots, a crucial knowledge gap persists: understanding how these AI systems handle novel experimental scenarios and their fundamental limitations.

To address this challenge, we here introduce AILA (Artificially Intelligent Lab Assistant), an LLM-powered framework augmented with specialized tools. We selected scanning probe microscopy18, specifically atomic force microscopy (AFM), as our experimental testbed, given its inherent complexity and broad applicability in materials research. There have been several efforts to automate microscopy techniques using AI and human-in-the-loop approaches due to their extensive applications in materials characterization26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35. These efforts focus exclusively on advancing specific operational aspects, such as analysing moving objects or optimizing illumination conditions, with an emphasis on improving individual steps within the broader experimental protocol. In addition to these targeted advancements, Liu et al.36 explores the integration of LLMs with Application Programming Interface (API) to enhance workflow preparation, instrument operation, and data reproducibility in scanning probe microscopy research. AFM operation demands expertise across multiple domains—from probe calibration to parameter optimization and data interpretation—making it an ideal platform for evaluating AI agents' ability to manage sophisticated experimental workflows.

Using AFM as the model system, we probe AILA's capabilities through AFMBench on five critical aspects of scientific automation: experimental workflow design, multi-tool coordination, decision-making, execution of open-ended experiments, and data analysis. Our systematic evaluation reveals key failure modes and areas requiring enhancement. We demonstrate AILA's practical utility through five real-world experiments: (1) identification and analysis of an indentation mark on a glass sample, including inference of the indenter type used; (2) detection of graphene flakes on a silicon wafer and determination of the number of graphene layers present; (3) automated microscope calibration; (4) high-resolution imaging of graphene step edges; and (5) load-dependent friction characterization on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG).

AILA's architecture prioritizes modularity, enabling seamless integration with diverse experimental and analytical platforms. At its core lies an LLM-powered planner—the framework's cognitive centre—which orchestrates user interactions and coordinates specialized agents (Fig. 1a). This planner directly takes query from a user and identifies the appropriate agent to handle the task. The agent makes tool calls to carry out the necessary steps to complete the experiment. The agent-to-agent coordination is invoked by two keywords, namely, “NEED HELP” and “FINAL ANSWER”. While the former flag invokes a routing function that transfers the unresolved task to the next appropriate agent, the latter flag results in the termination of the experiment. Thus, AILA employs a dynamic routing, exploiting available agents and tools, for completing the task given by the user (see S2.4 in Supplementary Information for additional details).

For AFM operations, AILA deploys two agents: the AFM Handler Agent (AFM-HA) for experimental control and the Data Handler Agent (DHA) for analysis. The AFM-HA interfaces with a document retrieval system comprising AFM software documentation and a code execution engine that translates Python commands into experimental actions. A Python-based API establishes the hardware-software interface, enabling direct control of the AFM system through vendor-specific protocols (Fig. 1b). The DHA manages image optimization and analysis through dedicated tools: an Image Optimizer that fine-tunes Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) parameters for high-fidelity imaging and an Image Analyzer that extracts targeted features from experimental data. For queries beyond agent capabilities, the planner generates alternative approaches or recommended actions.

In an AFM experiment, the workflow usually involves two key steps: capturing the image and analysing the results. The imaging part starts with choosing the right cantilever, then setting the imaging parameters. Afterwards, the tip is gently moved toward the sample surface, and the scan is carried out. For every stage, AILA creates a specific Python script and executes it, controlling the AFM instrument in real-time through an API. This connection allows the digital commands to directly translate into physical movements on the instrument. Once the scan is complete, the image is saved automatically and opened for analysis. The technical specifications and implementation details of each module are explained in the Methodology section.

To demonstrate AILA's operational workflow, we present a multi-step experiment: acquiring an AFM image of HOPG and extracting its friction and roughness parameters (Fig. 1c). This open-ended task exemplifies real-world complexity, offering multiple solution pathways. Upon receiving the query, AILA dissects it into sequential objectives: image acquisition via AFM-HA followed by DHA-led analysis. AFM-HA retrieves relevant documentation, generates executable code, and captures the image. Following successful acquisition, AILA transitions control to DHA, which directs the Image Analyzer to compute the specified parameters. This orchestrated sequence exemplifies AILA's core strengths: the ability to parse complex natural language queries, develop strategic workflows, and coordinate multiple agents toward achieving experimental objectives.

AFMBench comprises 100 expertly curated experimental tasks (see S3.1 in Supplementary Information for a few examples of tasks; all the tasks are available in the GitHub repo37), manually designed to rigorously evaluate autonomous AFM operations across multiple dimensions of complexity. Unlike conventional LLM benchmarks or simulation-based evaluations, AFMBench task demands physical execution on AFM hardware, introducing real-world temporal constraints and experimental variability. Analysis of the tasks reveal distinct patterns in resource utilization and operational complexity. In Fig. 2a, tool coordination requirements highlight a systematic preference for sophisticated workflows, with 69% of tasks demanding multi-tool integration, while 31% operate through single-tool protocols. Agent deployment analysis reveals a distribution: 83% of operations utilize single-agent protocols, while 17% require multi-agent coordination—enabling evaluation of both targeted expertise and system-wide integration capabilities.

Source data are provided as a Source data file.

In Fig. 2b, the operational landscape is divided into two primary complexity tiers: basic operations (56%) encompassing fundamental microscopy tasks and advanced procedures (44%) requiring more sophisticated experimental workflows (for example questions see Fig. 2e). Core system components—the AFM Handler, Document Retriever tool, and Code Executor tool—demonstrate maximum engagement, each activating in 66 distinct tasks (see Fig. 2c). The Data Handler Agent and Image Analyzer tool exhibit selective activation patterns (52 and 48 tasks, respectively), while the Image Optimizer tool engages exclusively in critical parameter optimization scenarios (4 tasks).

Task distribution across functional domains reveals three primary clusters: documentation (50 standalone tasks), analysis (14 tasks), and calculation (10 tasks) (see Fig. 2d). A significant overlap between these domains emerges through integrated tasks that combine multiple functional requirements, reflecting the interconnected nature of experimental workflows. This carefully constructed distribution enables systematic evaluation of AI systems across a spectrum of experimental complexity—from basic instrument control to advanced multi-step procedures requiring mathematical reasoning and dynamic decision-making—effectively mirroring the cognitive hierarchy of expert atomic force microscopists.

Systematic evaluation of AILA using three advanced closed-source and one open-source language models—GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo-0125, Claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022, and Llama-3.3-70B-versatile—unveils distinctive execution patterns and operational efficacies. GPT-4o exhibits exceptional proficiency in documentation-centric operations, achieving an 88.3% success rate, complemented by robust execution in analysis (33.3%) and computational tasks (56.7%) (see Fig. 3a). The model's strength lies in its ability to navigate interconnected workflows: 23.3% success in merged documentation-analysis procedures and 36.7% in documentation-calculation sequences. These metrics highlight GPT-4o's capacity to replicate the integrative reasoning characteristic of expert microscopists.

Claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022 model exhibits significantly lower performance than GPT-4o except in tasks involving standalone documentation (85.3%). While it is able to perform some cross domain tasks, we observe that the performance is notably lower than GPT-4o. These findings stand in stark contrast to previous benchmarking results in the materials domain17,20, where Claude consistently outperformed other models, suggesting that the performance advantages may not transfer across different types of scientific tasks and interaction formats. In marked contrast, GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 displays poor performance even in standalone tasks: 63.7% accuracy in documentation, and 3.3% in mathematical operations. However, its performance degrades significantly when confronted with multi-domain challenges, registering null success rates in tasks demanding simultaneous expertise across domains. This limitation suggests insufficient development of cross-functional reasoning capabilities essential for autonomous experimentation. The open-source Llama-3.3-70B-versatile model demonstrates accuracy superior to GPT-3.5 in all standalone tasks. However, it completely fails in tasks requiring cross-domain analysis or expertise.

To further investigate whether the poor performance originates from the LangGraph framework, we implemented the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to assess the performance of Claude (see Section S3.4 in the Supplementary Information for detailed results). We observe that the results from both the frameworks are consistent, confirming that the diminished performance is inherent to the model and not a result of the framework.

For evaluation of our multi-agent AILA framework, all successful trials were assessed across operational, token efficiency, and performance metrics (see Methodology and Fig. 3b for details). Operational analysis revealed significant disparities in agent coordination capabilities: Llama-3.3-70B exhibited substantial tool-agent confusion, requiring an average of 10 steps per task, whereas GPT-4o demonstrated superior contextual grounding and agent selection efficiency with only 6 average steps per task. Token utilization patterns correlated directly with these operational inefficiencies, where Llama-3.3-70B consumed the highest average prompt tokens, indicating verbose or redundant intermediate reasoning processes, while GPT-4o achieved task objectives with minimal token usage, suggesting focused and deliberate reasoning pathways. Critical deficiencies in agent disambiguation and task-instruction alignment were observed in GPT-3.5 and Claude-3.5, which failed all three trials involving the Data Handler agent. For AFM Handler operations, GPT-4o demonstrated optimal efficiency with approximately 2.5 agent calls per task, contrasting with Claude-3.5, which generated the highest completion token counts and tokens-per-step ratios, indicating excessively elaborate intermediate outputs. Performance metrics revealed substantial variation in task completion success rates: GPT-4o achieved 65% success while GPT-3.5 performed inconsistently at 32.8%. Latency analysis showed Claude-3.5 suffered the highest mean response time (17.31 s), whereas Llama-3.3-70B demonstrated the lowest latency (7 seconds). These comprehensive metrics indicate that while Llama-3.3-70B offers reduced latency, GPT-4o provides the optimal balance between operational efficiency and execution precision, establishing it as the most suitable model for complex multi-agent coordination in autonomous laboratory environments.

Component utilization analysis reinforces these observations. GPT-4o achieves consistently elevated engagement across system modules (see Fig. 3c, d). For tasks of varying complexity, GPT-4o demonstrates the highest accuracy, while GPT-3.5 performs the worst on advanced and basic tasks. Across all models, performance is generally higher for basic tasks compared to advanced ones. In multi-agent and multi-tool collaborative tasks, GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy, whereas GPT-3.5 has the lowest. GPT-3.5 performance, in both single-agent and multi-agent collaborative task settings, is lower than that of the other models. These results highlight the fundamental importance of model architecture in autonomous experimental platforms, with GPT-4o's advanced integrative capabilities positioning it as the superior choice for sophisticated experimental automation.

Source data are provided as a Source data file.

To assess whether direct tool integration with AILA yields equivalent performance to the multi-agent framework, we conducted a comparative analysis. A representative subset of 10 questions from the AFMBench dataset was systematically evaluated across both single-agent and multi-agent architectures, with each question assessed through three independent trials to ensure statistical reliability and account for inherent variability. The comparative analysis revealed framework-dependent performance variations: GPT-4o demonstrated superior performance in the multi-agent configuration (70% success rate) compared to direct tool integration (58% success rate). For alternative models, performance differences were minimal, as most architectures exhibited fundamental limitations in cross-domain tasks that inherently require multi-agent coordination, regardless of framework structure (see Section S6 of the supplementary material for detailed results). These findings indicate that while computational efficiency favors single-agent architecture implementations, the enhanced coordination capabilities of multi-agent architecture provide measurable performance gains for advanced models capable of complex reasoning.

Detailed examination of failure cases revealed distinctive error patterns between all the language models (see Fig. 4), offering insights into their operational limitations. Note that for computing evaluation metrics, successful tasks are defined as those where all three trials for a given task are successful. Whereas, for error mode distribution, all the trials for each task are counted individually, totalling to 300 task instances. GPT-4o exhibits a total error rate of 29%, with errors distributed across three primary categories: code generation (21.7%), agent selection (1.3%), tool selection (0.3%), and instruction adherence (5.7%). The predominance of code generation errors suggests challenges in translating conceptual understanding into executable commands despite the model's strong performance in task comprehension.

Error patterns among different models: GPT-4o (top left), GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 (top right), Llama-3.3-70B-versatile (bottom left) and Claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022 (bottom right). Segments represent a proportional distribution of error types: Instruction adherence (blue), agent selection (pink), tool selection (green) and code generation (gray). Source data are provided as a Source data file.

GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 demonstrates a markedly higher total error rate of 66.6%, with errors concentrated in four categories: code generation (32%) and agent selection (27.3%), tool selection (0.3%). Notably, the model shows less fundamental query interpretation errors (7.0%), indicating robust natural language processing capabilities. However, the elevated frequency of code generation errors, coupled with significant agent or tool selection failures, points to underlying deficiencies in translating comprehension into actionable experimental protocols.

Llama-3.3-70B-versatile and Claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022 demonstrate substantial error rates of 60.6% and 51.6%, respectively, with distinct failure patterns. Llama-3.3-70B-versatile exhibits a notably high frequency of code generation errors (32.0%), manifesting as incorrect argument formulation for tool execution and non-functional code production. Specifically, it struggles to construct appropriate argument structures required for successful tool invocation. In contrast, Claude-3.5-sonnet's deficiencies primarily stem from agent selection errors (28.3%), where it consistently misattributes tasks between AFM-HA and DHA, resulting in the delegation of experimental procedures to inappropriate agents.

A critical finding emerged regarding LLM's instruction adherence. In one of the four recorded errors, GPT-4o exceeded its designated operational limits, performing actions that were not authorized by the provided guidelines. For instance, it carried out potentially risky tip movements while it was only instructed to change the cantilever (see S3.2 in the Supplementary Information). In another case, GPT-4o was instructed to capture an image and calculate surface friction. Instead of staying within the scope of the task, it performed additional actions. This behavior was not restricted to GPT4o but was observed in other LLMs as well. Although sometimes the final result may have been correct, the failure to follow instructions highlights concerns about AI-agent behavior and raises safety risks in automated lab environments. Similar to the observation of hallucination in LLMs38, these results present a unique challenge—SDLs tend to take arbitrary actions, potentially based on memory rather than following the instructions, referred to hereafter as sleepwalking. These issues are especially critical in sensitive experimental settings, where strict protocol adherence is essential to ensure both equipment safety and the validity of results.

The AILA framework incorporates iterative debugging protocols to address code generation failures through systematic error resolution. Upon error detection, AILA captures comprehensive error logs and initiates iterative correction cycles, with a maximum threshold of 20 iterations established to optimize the balance between thoroughness and computational efficiency. Analysis of debugging outcomes reveals two distinct failure modes: (1) Iteration Limit Exhaustion, where the system terminates after 20 unsuccessful correction attempts, with persistent errors classified as code generation failures; and (2) Sleepwalking, where AILA generates functional code that exceeds the specified requirements, demonstrating functionality beyond the original instructions—a phenomenon indicating instruction drift or algorithmic overfitting, categorized as instruction adherence errors. This binary classification system enables systematic characterization of failure modes while the iteration threshold ensures computational tractability without compromising debugging efficacy in autonomous laboratory operations.

This error distribution illuminates critical areas for framework enhancement. While GPT-4o's balanced error profile suggests the need for targeted improvements across multiple domains, GPT-3.5-turbo-0125's concentrated error patterns indicate fundamental limitations in experimental execution capabilities. These findings underscore the necessity for specialized training in automated experimental systems, particularly focusing on the translation of scientific protocols into executable code sequences.

To understand the safety challenges39 of AI agents, we evaluate the effectiveness of implementing a safety framework in AILA. First, we establish restricted access protocols for critical AFM functions, coupled with ethical system prompts (see S2.1 in Supplementary Information) that constrain code generation to predefined documentation40. To implement this, we classified all the operations that could be performed on an AFM as per the instrument's documentation into two categories. (i) General operations—these include setting imaging parameters, controlling the tip, selecting the scanning area, and other standard tasks. (ii) Critical operations—these involve sensitive adjustments such as factory calibrations, laser alignment, piezo calibration, and thermal calibration. Even a minor coding error in critical operations could seriously damage the instrument.

We restricted the access to the documentation of critical operations in AILA, while allowing complete access to the documentation of general operations. The critical functions are limited to trained human experts. Note that general operations were selected in such a fashion that any experiment that could potentially be performed on an AFM could be carried out using some combination of these operations. Thus, the predefined documentation in AILA does not restrict any new experiment to be performed on the AFM instrument. Note that an alternate approach to implement safety is to identify risky actions and involve a human-in-the-loop mechanism to review the actions. This could also enhance the robustness and overall performance of the framework. However, such a framework requires human supervision, limiting the high-throughput nature that an autonomous system can otherwise achieve, with human response becoming the bottleneck. Hence, this approach was not implemented in AILA and could be explored as part of future work.

Second, we develop strict operational boundaries that permit dynamic code generation solely for image analysis while preventing external software installation or system modifications. Evaluation of the improved protocol demonstrates the effectiveness of these safeguards—AILA appropriately failed when prompted to install external Python libraries. (see S3.3 in Supplementary Information for complete validation logs). These findings underscore the critical importance of robust safety protocols in SDLs, emphasizing the necessity of comprehensive benchmarking and operational guardrails.

Finally, to demonstrate AILA's capabilities in real-world scenarios, we demonstrate five experimental tasks that typically require expert intervention: automated AFM calibration, high-resolution feature detection, load-dependent friction measurement, graphene layer analysis, and indenter profiling.

AFM imaging requires precise calibration of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) gain values, which traditionally demand expert intervention due to the continuous nature of these parameters. This dependency on skilled operators presents a significant barrier to broader AFM adoption. We demonstrate AILA's capability to autonomously optimize these parameters by minimizing the forward-backward scan differential on standard calibration grids. To this end, after loading the calibration sample, AILA was prompted to optimize the imaging parameters (see S4 in Supplementary Information for the complete prompt and output log). A total of 45 images are generated, with 3 images produced in each of the 15 generations. Figure 5a presents experimental AFM data acquired by AILA for the 1st and 15th generation of variable PID configurations, with corresponding line scan analyses that quantify trace-retrace symmetry. Initial scans with suboptimal parameters (P: 93–208, I: 1747–6623, D: 0–39) exhibit poor SSIM scores (0.392–0.768), manifesting as visible distortions in topographic data. Note that a higher SSIM value, closer to 1, indicates a perfect match, while a value of 0 represents no similarity. Through iterative optimization, AILA achieves superior scan quality (SSIM > 0.81) with optimized parameters (P: 246–249, I: 8676–8957, D: 17–30; see Fig. 5a).

a Evolution of AFM image quality under varying PID parameters. The left panels show topographic images of the calibration grid; the right panels display corresponding line scan profiles (solid: trace, dashed: retrace). Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) scores quantify trace-retrace correlation, with higher values indicating superior imaging quality. Optimal parameters (Proportional (P) gain: 249, Integral (I) gain: 8957, Derivative (D) gain: 26) achieve SSIM = 0.818. b Large-area scan demonstrating consistent imaging quality using optimized parameters across multiple grid features. c Convergence plot showing genetic algorithm optimization efficiency.

Top panels: topographic images at different height (Z) ranges; bottom panels: corresponding line profiles revealing surface features. Source data are provided as a Source data file.

The genetic algorithm's convergence efficiency is demonstrated in Fig. 5c, where optimal PID configurations are achieved within 15 generations. Both maximum and mean SSIM values show rapid improvement, stabilizing above 0.8, indicating robust parameter optimization. Figure 5b validates the optimized parameters (P:249, I:8957, D:26) across a larger scan area, maintaining high-quality imaging across multiple grid features.

Surface characterization through AFM is challenged by noise sources such as thermal drift, mechanical vibrations, and electronic interference41,42,43, which can obscure subtle topographic features like graphene step edges. In this study, we leverage the advanced analytical capabilities of AILA to address these challenges using HOPG as a model system. AILA autonomously determines the necessity for baseline correction based on feature size, recognizing that baseline artifacts predominantly affect smaller features. To further demonstrate this, we tested two different prompts with samples of distinct morphologies (see Fig. S3 in Supplementary Information). In both cases, AILA correctly selected the appropriate baseline correction. For instance, in the raw image (Fig. 5d), the graphene step edge remains indiscernible due to baseline distortions. AILA applies a fifth-order polynomial baseline correction to generate the 1st generation image (Fig. 5d), which serves as the foundation for PID gain optimization. Following a process similar to the calibration grid optimization, the image is refined through iterative PID adjustments, resulting in the final optimized image in the 10th generation, where atomic steps become distinctly visible. The automated optimization process surpasses conventional manual adjustments, offering an enhanced resolution of nanoscale features. Additionally, further analysis of the processed data, including the determination of graphene step height, was facilitated through specific prompts, with the prompts and results detailed in the Supplementary Information S5. Note that in the AILA framework, edge detection is not based on a fixed algorithm. Instead, the system generates custom code to solve the problem, whereas, for feature detection, AILA uses the built-in Image Segment tool (see Methodology) that applies Otsu's thresholding to automatically segment images by finding the most effective intensity-based thresholds.

The experiments discussed thus far are routine, with limited number of steps and hence, complexity. Now, we conduct a comprehensive load-dependent friction analysis of HOPG (see Fig. 6a). The experiment requires iterative adjustments of AFM parameters, including setting a range of setpoints, capturing images, and analyzing the corresponding friction data. Manually performing this procedure is time-intensive, involving parameter modifications, image acquisition, data extraction, and result plotting, making a case for automation.

Source data are provided as a Source data file.

However, based on the experiments conducted above and this experiment, we observed that the performance of the LLMs could be directly affected by the prompts. To evaluate this effect, we analyzed the effect of prompting (see Methodology and Table S3) by systematically varying the prompts from simple to complex, from compact to descriptive. Our findings revealed that GPT-4o demonstrated variable task completion rates across different prompt structures, ranging from partial execution to complete fulfillment. Significantly, more elaborate and detailed prompts consistently enhanced the model's performance reliability and execution accuracy, suggesting that comprehensive contextual information improves complex task handling. Based on these experiments, we designed the prompts consistently across the experiments and ensured that prompt optimization was not carried out to arrive at desirable results.

AILA was instructed (see S5 in Supplementary Information for the complete prompt and output log) to vary the setpoint voltage from 0.2 V to 1.2 V in increments of 0.2 V. At each setpoint, AILA independently captured the AFM image, calculated the average friction value, and generated the corresponding plot. Figure 6a presents the graph of average friction versus setpoint voltage for both manually obtained and AILA-captured images using the GPT-4o model. The raw image generated by AILA can be found in the Supplementary Information Fig. S2. The entire process was conducted without additional user input regarding figure formatting or parameter settings. Remarkably, AILA autonomously develops the required Python script, executes the experimental protocol, and generates the output, including raw, unedited plots. This automation significantly reduces the time and effort compared to manual execution. The results not only validate the capability of AILA in handling AFM experiments but also demonstrate its efficiency in generating reproducible and high-quality outputs for scientific analyses.

To evaluate the performance of AILA in a real-world experimental setting, we designed two distinct experiments. In both cases, an experimentalist is required to identify a specific feature of interest, capture it, and then carry out the experiment. Further, the results need to be analyzed to draw meaningful conclusions. In the first experiment (see Fig. 6b), the objective is to locate a graphene flake and determine the number of atomic layers in it. To accomplish this, AILA performs image segmentation using Image Segment tool within a user-specified region, identifies the largest visible flake, and extracts it for further analysis. Through a sequence of intermediate processing steps, AILA autonomously generates code, processes the image, and ultimately provides an estimate of the number of graphene layers present in the selected flake. The second experiment (see Fig. 6c) involves identifying the type of indenter used to create an impression on a sample surface. The intended image is analyzed by AILA, including an inspection of the indentation line profile. Based on this analysis, it infers and concludes, along with a detailed explanation, that the indenter used was most likely of Vickers-type geometry. Thus, in both the cases, AILA performs the experiment successfully and provides analysis and conclusions similar to human experts. Specifically, in the first case, it uses the knowledge of the thickness of graphene along with numerical computation to identify the number of layers, whereas in the second, it uses the knowledge on the characteristics of Vickers and conospherical indenters along with reason to identify the appropriate indenter. The complete set of raw user inputs and unprocessed outputs is presented in (Fig. 6b, c). The log files of both the experiments are available in our GitHub repository37.

AILA's modular design, along with AFMBench, establishes quantifiable metrics in experimental automation through systematic benchmarking. The framework's comprehensive performance metrics in AFM operations establish standards for autonomous laboratory evaluation, while AFMBench introduces reproducible protocols for systematic assessment across experimental domains. Successful execution of tasks—from automated image optimization to nanomechanical measurements—validates the framework's capabilities for sophisticated materials characterization.

Several outcomes merit detailed examination. The measured limitations in tool coordination across different LLMs establish quantifiable thresholds for improving inter-module communication protocols. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent architectures systematically outperform single-agent configurations, with the primary advantage extending beyond mere instruction execution to encompass task modularization, specialized agent collaboration, independent reasoning, and dynamic decision-making regarding subtask sequencing and tool selection. These findings align with established literature demonstrating the superiority of multi-agent architecture over single-agent implementations across diverse computational domains44,45,46. These observations also establish an empirical baseline for balancing specialized and integrated operations—a metric applicable to automation across analytical platforms, from mass spectrometers to X-ray diffractometers.

However, the observed tendency of LLM agents to exceed operational boundaries through sleepwalking phenomenon during experimental execution presents critical safety concerns for autonomous laboratory deployment. This phenomenon, documented here for the first time in autonomous experimental systems, highlights urgent development priorities in instruction alignment and operational safety protocols. Additionally, despite providing direct access to comprehensive documentation and code snippets, persistent code generation errors indicate fundamental limitations in current retrieval-augmented generation frameworks. These findings necessitate the development of enhanced code generation architectures that incorporate domain-specific constraint validation and formal verification protocols to minimize coding errors—representing an immediate opportunity for systematic improvement in autonomous laboratory reliability.

These findings suggest specific architectural improvements for next-generation autonomous laboratories. Enhanced integration protocols between specialized agents could address the observed limitations in multi-tool coordination. Similarly, dedicated code generation modules might mitigate the predominant error mode, potentially incorporating specialized scientific programming frameworks.

The implications of this work extend beyond materials characterization. The unexpected underperformance of Claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022 compared to GPT-4o highlights a critical insight: question-answer proficiency in a specific domain does not necessarily predict effectiveness in agentic implementations. Rather tool coordination capabilities of LLMs prove to be an important aspect for effective agentic implementation. Furthermore, the observed prompt fragility emphasizes the necessity for developing rigorous evaluation frameworks prior to deployment in research environments. Specifically, developing systematic and principled approaches to generate prompts and make systems that are robust to minor variations in prompts plays a crucial role in the wider acceptance of agentic systems. To this end, quantitative benchmarks such as AFMBench provide concrete guidance for implementing LLM-driven systems in experimental research settings where precision and reliability are paramount.

Applications span pharmaceutical screening, environmental monitoring, and process optimization. For instance, documented success in parameter optimization could translate directly to automated high-throughput drug screening or catalyst discovery platforms. While current limitations in code generation and tool coordination define immediate development targets, these metrics provide clear objectives for advancing autonomous scientific platforms. The path forward requires focused development in three key areas: enhanced cross-domain reasoning capabilities, robust code generation protocols, and sophisticated multi-agent coordination mechanisms. Success in these domains would enable truly autonomous scientific platforms capable of accelerating discovery across the scientific landscape.

AILA is constructed utilizing the LangChain software framework, incorporating components such as prompts, LLMs, memory, agents, and tools. AILA uses two categories of prompts: system prompts (see S2.1 in Supplementary Information for the system prompts) and user prompts. System prompts define ethical rules for AILA's interactions and describe the responsibilities assigned to each agent, whereas user prompts are variable inputs provided by end-users. AILA's backbone consists of LLMs, namely GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo-0125, Llama-3.3-70B-versatile, and Claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022, which process user input as strings and provide string-based outputs. We used API keys from the developers for GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo-0125, and Claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022. Additionally, we used API keys from Groq AI Inference for Llama-3.3-70B-versatile model. We have used a temperature value of zero for all models, with the parameters set as max tokens 2024, and max retries two. These LLMs are stateless, indicating that they do not save conversational context. Here, all interactions and agent states are stored in a Python dictionary and can be accessed by other agents. AILA consists of two specialized agents: the AFM Handler Agent and the Data Handler Agent, both equipped with unique tools to do specific tasks. These agents possess individual prompts, LLMs, and tools; however, they utilize a shared memory to store and access states, facilitating smooth interaction. The system prompts within the agents offer instructions for tool utilization and ethical guidelines, whereas the outputs from other tools or agents serve as user prompts. The framework utilizes LangGraph, a library that allows the construction of an effective multi-agent workflow, integrating all agents and tools seamlessly. AILA uses two different approaches for selecting algorithms, depending on the task. When performing standard calculations like friction or roughness analysis, AILA relies on established algorithms with adjustable input parameters. This method produces consistent and reproducible results. For exploratory work and data visualization, AILA takes a different approach by creating the code on the fly. This method adapts better to varying data formats and specific user requirements; however, this may introduce variability in the results depending on the complexity of the task.

The architecture for AILA's decision-making process is carefully designed to ensure precise information routing. Where it uses two different routing mechanism: dynamic and static routing. A detailed discussion of both dynamic and static routing is provided in the Supplementary Information. AILA can dynamically select among three primary options: AFM Handler, Data Handler, or FINISH. When AILA identifies the appropriate agent to handle a query, it routes the information to the selected option. In cases where AILA determines that none of the available agents can sufficiently address the question, it generates a well-structured response and selects the FINISH option to conclude the session effectively. The agents within this system are equipped with three distinct operational choices: utilizing their respective tools, transferring information to the next agent, or terminating the session. A system prompt has been integrated to streamline these decisions. Agents append the prefix NEED HELP to their response when transferring information to another agent. Alternatively, if they believe the query has been adequately addressed, they use the prefix FINAL ANSWER to signal the session's conclusion. By analyzing the output for these keywords, the system seamlessly routes the response to the designated agent or tool or finalizes the session. This structured approach enables efficient multi-agent collaboration, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and optimal performance across tasks while maintaining a robust and adaptive framework.

AFM demands precise sequential execution of multiple experimental stages. Image acquisition requires optimization across three critical parameters: imaging conditions, probe selection, and operational mode configuration (tapping/contact). The experimental sequence encompasses surface approach protocols, scanning procedures, and standardized data acquisition—with procedural deviations potentially resulting in equipment damage or data corruption. Our implementation utilizes the DriveAFM instrument (Nanosurf), which is accessed through a Python-based API architecture and designed for universal compatibility with API-enabled AFM systems. To facilitate AFM imaging experiments, we have created the AFM Handler agent, which is integrated with two specialized tools: the Document Retrieval Tool and the Code Executor Tool. Every tool has an individual role, and the AFM Handler agent can dynamically assign tasks to these tools. The agent will assign the responsibility to the Data Handler agent if it finds that neither tool can handle the task.

The documentation for the instrument offers detailed instructions on how to handle and calibrate it. However, providing full access of the documentation to an LLM entails risks, such as inadvertent alterations to factory settings or calibration data, which could potentially result in damage or malfunction of the instrument. To address this concern, we manually extracted the essential information from the AFM documentation necessary for conducting experiments while safeguarding the instrument's integrity. We consolidated all the crucial codes for regulating each parameter of the instrument into a comprehensive Python script. Since Python code relies heavily on precise indentation and line structure, we utilized the Recursive Character Text Splitter from the LangChain library, specifically designed for Python, to divide the script into manageable chunks. The chunk size was set to a maximum of 1000 characters without overlap, adhering to the token limit for embedding models. Each code chunk comprises three sections: the first includes the necessary Python libraries, the second contains the code required to load the application, and the third section features unique Python code specific to the given task. The first two sections are consistent across all chunks (see S2.2 in the Supplementary Information file for more details). These chunks were then combined to generate a document, embedded using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model. This model, with the capability of producing embeddings of size up to 3072 dimensions, delivers exceptional performance compared to other OpenAI embedding models, especially in multi-language retrieval benchmarks like MIRACL47. To store the embeddings, we opted for Chroma, an open-source vector database known for its reliability and efficiency in managing large-scale embedding data. We use a vector store retriever to retrieve the data from the vector store.

A code executor tool has been developed to execute Python scripts generated by the AFM Handler Agent to control the AFM software. This tool is intended to run Python code, provided as a text string, directly on the local system to allow for smooth integration with the workflow of the AFM Handler Agent. The utility executes the code and sends back a success message or a detailed description of the error that occurred. If there is an error, the error message is returned to the AFM Handler agent so it can correct the error and retry executing. Otherwise, if the script runs without errors, it is considered the final result. This iterative process ensures precise control of the AFM system while systematically addressing any issues in the script.

Surface tracking optimization in AFM requires precise calibration of three fundamental parameters: Proportional (P), Integral (I), and Derivative (D) gains. Optimal calibration manifests as convergence between trace and retrace signals, indicating stable scanning conditions. The Data Handler agent interfaces with specialized optimization and analysis modules; these models can access AFM image data stored in local storage systems. The agent can optimize P, I, and D gains or calculate various surface properties, such as average friction and surface roughness, using the help of modules and image files stored locally. While many AFM software packages offer basic data analysis functionalities, they present several limitations in an automated workflow as follows. (i) Most of these software solutions primarily support Windows systems, limiting cross-platform compatibility with operating systems such as macOS and Linux platforms. (ii) Commercial packages require paid licenses, restricting accessibility. (iii) Finally, most packages are not flexible to include additional functionalities beyond what is already included, limiting their customizability. Thus, to ensure broader adaptability and maintain an adaptable, flexible, modular, and open framework, we developed the Data Handler agent within AILA, which has access to several tools—new functionalities can be easily integrated to this agent and the tools based on user needs. Note that this does not restrict the usage of vendor software packages, as they could also be included as a tool in AILA. The agent offers a significantly expanded suite of advanced analytical capabilities, such as:

Customizable and automated image processing workflows tailored to specific experimental needs.

Statistical analysis across multiple datasets, enabling robust comparison of parameters such as average friction, surface roughness, and topographic variations.

Platform independence, ensuring compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux, and eliminating reliance on proprietary or licensed software.

Dynamic code generation via LLM integration, allowing users to automatically generate and execute scripts for plotting and analysing images.

To demonstrate the adaptability of the agent, we developed a custom function to calculate indentation volume (see Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Information). Instructions for integrating additional functions into the Data Handler Agent are provided in a step-by-step guide available on the accompanying GitHub repository37.

The feedback system in an AFM plays a crucial role in maintaining control over the interaction between the cantilever tip and the sample surface. During scanning, variations in surface features alter the interaction forces between the tip and the sample, leading to deflections in the cantilever. These deflections are detected by a photodetector. To ensure that these deflections stay within a specified range, the feedback mechanism continuously adjusts the height of either the tip or the sample stage in real-time. This process is managed by a PID controller, which regulates the position of the z-piezo actuator. By controlling the Z position of the AFM probe, the controller maintains a steady interaction force or adheres to a predefined setpoint, depending on the chosen mode of operation.

Fine-tuning the P, I, and D gain values of the controller is vital for achieving accurate control of the setpoint in AFM imaging. The integral gain is especially important for enhancing image clarity by mitigating drift and reducing steady-state errors. Once the integral gain is optimized, adjusting the proportional gain can provide further refinement. The derivative gain, on the other hand, is particularly beneficial for imaging samples with pronounced edge features. If the gains are set too low, the PID loop may fail to maintain the setpoint effectively, while excessively high gain values can introduce electrical noise into the image due to amplified feedback or overcompensation for deviations. Properly optimized PID parameters ensure that the feedback loop remains stable and responsive, enabling the AFM to accurately track surface topography, even at higher scanning speeds. This balance is especially critical when imaging delicate, irregular, or soft materials, as it preserves the integrity of tip-sample interactions.

A genetic algorithm (GA) was employed for PID gain optimization. The GA parameters included a fixed population size of three and a total of 15 generations, enabling efficient tuning of the gains. Although these parameters can be manually adjusted, but excessive image scanning may degrade the AFM tip. The optimized gains ensure effective feedback control, producing comparable forward and backward images. This can be achieved by calculating the mean squared error (MSE) between forward and backward z-axis images for various PID gain settings. However, this method is sensitive to drift during scanning, and this method also depends on previously acquired images. To address this, the structural similarity index (SSIM) was adopted as the fitness function in the genetic algorithm, providing a robust measure of image similarity between the z-axis forward and backward images, independent of prior image data.

This metric offers advantages over traditional Mean Square Error (MSE) approaches by (i) addressing tip degradation challenges in contact-mode AFM by minimizing required scan cycles and enabling optimization using low-resolution images, (ii) maintaining accuracy under drift conditions, (iii) incorporating structural, brightness, and contrast variations in optimization, and (iv) providing normalized scores between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect similarity.

The SSIM is defined as:

where, \(l(x,y)\) is the luminance comparison, \(c(x,y)\) is the contrast comparison, and \(s(x,y)\) is the structure comparison with \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\gamma\) being the weighting parameters. Note that the individual components are defined as:

where, \({\mu }_{x},{\mu }_{y}\) represent the mean intensities of images \(x\) and \(y\), \({\sigma }_{x},{\sigma }_{y}\) is the standard deviations of images \(x\) and \(y\), \({\sigma }_{{xy}}\) is the cross-covariance between images \(x\) and \(y\), and \({C}_{1},{C}_{2},{C}_{3}\) are constants to avoid instability with \(({C}_{1}={({k}_{1}L)}^{2},{C}_{2}={({k}_{2}L)}^{2},{C}_{3}={C}_{2}/2)\) and \(L\) being the dynamic range of pixel values and \({k}_{1}=0.01\) and \({k}_{2}=0.03\).

Baseline correction. The adaptive baseline correction employed in the step-edge detection of graphene is given by

where, \(B(x,y)\) is the baseline function, \({a}_{{ij}}\) are the polynomial coefficients, \(i\) and \(j\) are the polynomial degrees \((0\le i,j\le n)\) with \(n\) being the maximum polynomial degree.

AFM instrument stores the image data as a *.nid file in the local system. This *.nid file contains deflection, friction force, and z-axis images for both backward and forward scans. To further process any image from the file, exact data must be extracted from the file. To conduct this, we have used the NSFopen Python library in the Image Analyzer tool, which takes the query from the data handler agent regarding the specific image data and its location and returns the image data in an array to the data handler agent. To conduct further processing of the images, any Python script generated by the data handler agent can be executed in the Image Analyzer tool, and the result can be returned to the data handler agent. Note that there is no database available to guide the LLM model in generating the Python script. It can generate the Python script by itself. There is a total of 6 input parameters for this tool:

path (str): directory path to search for the latest file (default: None).

Filename (str): specific image file to display (default: None).

Dynamic_code (str): Python code for processing image data (default: None).

Calculate_friction (bool): option to compute average friction (default: False).

Calculate_mean_roughness (bool): option to compute mean roughness (default: False).

Calculate_rms_roughness (bool): option to compute RMS roughness (default: False).

Returns: a dictionary with the status, image data, or error details.

Average friction was calculated using the following formula:

where \({f}_{{ij}}\) and \({b}_{{ij}}\) are the element at position \(\left(i,j\right)\) in the array of the forward and backward friction image data. We have used the formula in this tool to calculate the mean roughness and RMS roughness values

where \({z}_{{ij}}\) is the element at position \((i,j)\) in the array, \(\bar{z}\) is the mean of all elements in the array, \(M\) is the number of rows in the array, N is the number of columns in the array of the z-axis forward image data.

An Image Segment and an Image Scanner tool have been created to analyse AFM-scanned images. The Segment tool use the Otsu algorithm to segment images according to the various features present in the sample. Upon detection of features, the tool produces bounding boxes and allocates distinct grain IDs to each feature. This bounding box information is subsequently utilized by LLMs for additional data processing. Note that we used text-based LLM models that cannot discern any features inside the sample, whether they pertain to the material or represent alien inclusions. Following its analysis, the LLM can transmit designated grain IDs to the Image Scanner tool, which instructs the AFM instrument to meticulously scan those particular characteristics.

To evaluate the performance of the AILA, we have manually created a set of 100 questions, carefully categorized into three distinct groups. The first classification is based on whether a question requires one or multiple tools and agents to be solved. The second category assesses the complexity of the questions, distinguishing between basic and advanced levels. Lastly, the questions are grouped by their requirements, such as documentation analysis or calculations. The complexity of each question is determined by the number of agents involved and the steps required to achieve the solution. For instance, modifying a parameter in an AFM system typically requires documentation review and the use of a single agent, categorizing it as a basic task. Conversely, capturing an AFM image and analyzing its surface roughness involves multiple agents, documentation analysis, and calculations, making it an advanced task. A comprehensive JSON file has been created, encapsulating detailed metadata about each question, including its respective category, for streamlined analysis and evaluation. This file serves as a structured resource for further investigations and testing. All questions, along with their relevant classifications and details, have been made accessible on GitHub37 (https://github.com/M3RG-IITD/AILA) to support transparency and reproducibility in research.

We developed a graphical user interface (GUI) using Streamlit, an open-source Python framework, to streamline user interaction with AILA. The GUI allows users to input text-based queries, select the desired LLM model, and specify a log file name. It then executes AILA in the backend, saving the output log file locally and enabling users to observe results directly within the AFM software. Any output images or figures generated by AILA are also stored in the local system for further analysis. To ensure robustness, we manually evaluated all questions using each model, verifying the output log files and AFM software results multiple times in collaboration with different researchers to eliminate potential human errors. The evaluation of AILA's performance was categorized into two metrics: accuracy and efficiency. For accuracy, questions were divided into categories based on complexity and tool or agent usage, with a percentage of correct answers calculated for each category. For efficiency, uniform parameters were maintained across models in the AFM software, including default settings of 0.1 s as time per line and 128 as lines per frame, when not specified by the user. To ensure precise efficiency measurements, scanning time for images and the time taken by questions with incorrect answers were excluded from the analysis. Average response times were computed for each category to assess AILA's overall efficiency.

To assess the evaluation of questions in terms of accuracy, we classified the answers provided by AILA into three categories: fully correct answers, incorrect and partially correct answers. A fully correct answer was considered accurate and given a score of 1, while any partially correct response was given a score of 0.5. Given that some questions require manual inspection of the AFM software to verify whether specific parameters are set correctly and whether the AFM image is captured as intended, multiple researchers were involved in verifying the results. They carefully checked the outcomes to ensure error-free results. For measurements of different properties, such as average friction, roughness, and RMS value of roughness, we used the Gwyddion software to verify the accuracy of the results. Subsequently, the questions were clustered into appropriate groups, and the corresponding average percentage of correct answers was calculated. The detailed evaluation process is provided in the Supplementary Information.

Additional evaluation metrics are defined as following. Based on the scoring, Success rate is computed as the average score (out of 100) across three iterations for all the tasks. For all the successful runs, following metrics are employed.

AFM handler calls: the average number of times the AFM Handler agent was called to resolve a task (calls per task). An elevated score may signify a greater dependence on the AFM Handler for coordination.

Data handler calls: the average number of times the Data Handler agent was called during task solving.

Number of steps: the average number of discrete actions (represented by tool or agent call) taken by the AILA to arrive at a solution.

Total tokens: total number of LLM model tokens is processed on an average for each task, considering both input (prompt) and output (complete) tokens.

Prompt tokens: number of tokens utilized in the conversation's input or instruction segment for each task.

Completion tokens: the average number of tokens that the system's answers create for all assignments.

Tokens per stage: this tells how many tokens were utilized on average for each stage in the process of solving a task.

Latency: the average amount of time (in seconds) it takes to complete a task from the first to the final step.

Time per step: the average amount of time (in seconds) spent on each step, representing the pace with which the system can perform different tasks.

Latency per 1000 tokens: the average amount of time (in seconds) taken to process 1000 tokens.

We systematically investigated how prompt structure and phrasing influence GPT-4o's ability to perform load-dependent friction measurements, one of our most challenging open-ended tasks. LLMs process information hierarchically based on input format and length, making them sensitive to prompt design. Even subtle modifications can activate different training exemplars, altering response patterns and reasoning pathways. To evaluate performance within the AILA framework, we constructed multiple input prompts to assess task completion efficacy. In AILA, inter-agent collaboration is triggered when the model outputs “NEED HELP”, while “FINAL ANSWER” signals task completion. We developed and tested four distinct prompt categories: (1) concise task descriptions, (2) comprehensive task elaborations, (3) sequential task decompositions, and (4) explicit inclusions of the signaling phrases with case variations. By systematically combining these elements, we designed five system prompts, with detailed performance metrics documented in the Supplementary Information (Table S3).

In the face of something that threatens survival, a certain group of neurons can produce a molecule that acts as a painkiller.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Arthritis. Endometriosis. Fibromyalgia. Multiple Sclerosis. Postherpetic neuralgia. Sometimes, chronic pain doesn't even come with a diagnosis, but is the aftermath of an injury that never fades. It is also notoriously underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Though nearly a quarter of Americans and a fifth of people overall live with chronic pain, its neural source has remained elusive. Only some groups of brain cells that are activated during bouts of pain had been identified in the central and peripheral nervous systems. 

But now, after a series of experiments on mice, biologist Nicholas Betley from the University of Pennsylvania has discovered that a previously overlooked group of neurons in the parabrachial nucleus  is switched on in individuals with chronic pain. He and his research team also found that there is a molecule that the brain can release for pain relief.

“We focused on the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN), a major entry point of sensory information from the periphery and the first site of integration of many affective behavioral states,” Betley said in a study recently published in the journal Nature. “Populations of neurons in the lPBN […] respond to acute [pain-related] stimuli, and prolonged activation of excitatory lPBN neurons can drive a chronic pain-like state.”

The parabrachial nucleus is made up of different neuron clusters in the dorsolateral pons of the brainstem. Known as Y1R neurons, they transmit sensory information (such as taste and temperature) in addition to pain, also regulating appetite and threat signals. While Y1R neurons exist in various subpopulations, what they have in common is the expression of receptors for neuropeptide Y or NPY, which regulates types of brain activity like metabolism, heart rate, immune function, blood pressure, and even stress reduction. Other studies that involved monitoring neural activity and running computer models showed a link to chronic pain.

Betley and his research team used painful stimuli (such as exposure to a hot surface) to activate Y1R neurons in mice, and as they predicted, the mice showed behaviors associated with persistent pain, such as paw licking. When the Y1R neurons were blocked, pain became much less persistent, and the mice only had short pain responses after being exposed to the same stimuli. There was one group of Y1R neurons that stayed active during licking, which suggests that a subpopulation of Y1R neurons is responsible for part of the Y1R response during extended periods of pain. 

While Y1R neurons do not directly cause pain, they are thought to be involved in a larger network that is behind painful sensations. The way these neurons are organized allows them to receive sensory inputs, including pain signals sent from the spinal cord, which the neurons then send to multiple regions of the brain.

Something else the researchers wanted to see was whether pain took precedence over survival. They temporarily deprived the mice of food and water and also introduced a frightening stimulus (like the scent of a predator), and when faced with these perceived threats to their survival, the mice experienced significantly less pain. It turned out that production of neuropeptide Y increased in the parabrachial nucleus when the animals were faced with something that could literally mean life or death. Betley's findings could mean that someday, a drug that signals neurons to produce more NPY could be a viable and safe alternative to painkillers such as opioids.

“This mechanism is an efficient and tunable system that enables urgent needs to shift brain state away from pain and towards other states that promote survival,” he said. “Future work could build from these findings to test other endogenous or pharmacological interventions that curb pain state.”

The early diversification of dinosaurs produced a major ecological change in the terrestrial ecosystems, culminating with tetrapod assemblages dominated in abundance by dinosaurs by the Triassic/Jurassic boundary (~201 million years ago (Ma)). Therefore, studying the initial diversification of dinosaurs is crucial to understand the establishment of Mesozoic assemblages. However, the lack of stratigraphically continuous fossil data in the few geological units that preserve the oldest known dinosaurs (~233–227 Ma, Carnian age) obscures our understanding of this initial diversification. The Ischigualasto Formation in northwestern Argentina (231.4–225.9 Ma) yields a rich vertebrate assemblage and new studies resulted in an abundant and stratigraphically near-continuous fossil record, which offers new insights into the early diversification of dinosaurs. Among the discoveries, we report Anteavis crurilongus gen. et sp. nov., an early-diverging theropod, which supports the notable diversity of small- to medium-sized dinosaurs during the late Carnian. Anteavis is recovered outside Neotheropoda, but it has features previously thought to be exclusive to that group. We show that dinosaur diversity and abundance in the Ischigualasto Formation were higher than previously recognized, particularly among small herbivores (<30 kg) and medium-sized (30–200 kg) predators. This diversification occurred in Ischigualasto during a climatic shift to semi-arid conditions, but the return of more humid conditions resulted in a gap in the dinosaur record that started at 228.91 ± 0.14 Ma. Only 15 million years (Myr) later, in the middle Norian age, the dinosaur record recovered its abundance and diversity in the basin, but now it was characterized by larger-bodied species. Our findings demonstrate an early dinosaur diversification probably punctuated by a climate-driven faunal turnover in, at least, southwestern Pangaea.

CRISPR gene editing has made its way into every corner of modern biology, but not into every corner of the cell. Although researchers have used these systems to develop treatments for sickle-cell anaemia and blood cancers, to unlock the secrets of multicellularity and to discover the role of thousands of overlooked proteins, there's one place CRISPR can't easily reach: mitochondria.

The rings of DNA inside mitochondria are inaccessible to these techniques, which means that precise edits to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) remain frustratingly out of reach. “Mitochondria missed the CRISPR–Cas9 revolution that exploded 12 years ago,” says Michal Minczuk, a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, UK.

But researchers are eager to access this DNA, says Minczuk. Mitochondria are bean-shaped organelles that power cells and have myriad other cellular tasks. Exploring their DNA is essential for understanding the energy production and exchange that underlies metabolic health. And more than 300 mutations in this DNA cause mitochondrial diseases — incurable genetic disorders with a wide range of symptoms that can rob people of their sight and hearing, trigger muscle problems and spark seizures1. These disorders affect roughly 1 in 5,000 people.

Because CRISPR can't help with these problems, researchers have been looking for other ways to precisely edit the mitochrondrial genome. And the past few years have brought some success: the tools are already proving to be a boon for creating accurate animal models of mitochondrial diseases. “The progress has been remarkable,” says Jin-Soo Kim, a chemical biologist who develops mtDNA editing tools at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea.

If researchers can make mtDNA editing safe and accurate enough, it could eventually be used to treat, and even cure, these genetic conditions. “It would be a medical breakthrough,” says Kim.

The exact origins of mitochondria are murky, but the leading theory holds that the organelle's story started around 1.5 billion years ago when a single-celled microorganism called an archaeon gobbled up a roaming bacterium that survived inside its host. This event marked the beginning of the eukaryotes — the large group of organisms, including plants, animals and fungi, in which cells contain organelles that are enclosed inside membranes. The swallowed bacterium retained its characteristic circular DNA as it settled into its new home, but over time it sacrificed most of its genes to the nuclear genome of its host.

In the evolutionary lineage that gave rise to humans and other animals, this genetic transfer whittled the resident bacterium's genome down to just 37 genes that code for 13 proteins involved in energy production, turning it into a specialized organelle.

The small amount of mitochondrial DNA that stuck around in animals differs in key ways from nuclear DNA, which in humans encodes around 20,000 genes. For a start, mtDNA is typically inherited solely from the mother. There can be several copies of mtDNA in each mitochondrion, and the organelle has its own built-in machinery for making RNA and proteins from that DNA.

Mitochondrial DNA is also much more error-prone, with a mutation rate estimated to be 10–20 times greater than that of nuclear DNA. This is in part because it has to contend with a barrage of damaging reactive oxygen species — unstable molecules that are generated in mitochondria during normal energy production. But it's also because it doesn't have histones: the proteins that protect and package nuclear DNA.

Compared with its counterpart in the nucleus, mtDNA's toolkit for repairing itself is rudimentary. The nucleus is quick to fix a snapped DNA strand using an arsenal of repair mechanisms, but mitochondria can mend only some defects. They often simply throw away their broken DNA. This difference limits the options for gene-editing tools, because nearly all such tools for nuclear DNA use its inherent repair pathways.

It has been notoriously challenging to develop approaches for modifying mitochondrial DNA, says Stephen Ekker, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas at Austin. “Its bacterial origins are revealed when you start trying to edit it,” he says.

The most crucial hurdle for scientists trying to tinker with the mitochondrial genome is that it is locked behind a wall of membranes that doesn't allow external nucleic acids to pass into the organelle. Although there have been hints that CRISPR-based gene-editing tools — which rely on RNA to guide them to the correct sequence — might be able to overcome these barriers, many researchers remain unconvinced.

Still, there are other ways in. More than a decade before CRISPR became a research tool, mitochondria researchers began experimenting with other editing tools that could cross mitochondrial membranes and coax the organelles into ditching their problematic DNA2.

Every cell contains a vast number of mitochondrial genomes, because cells contain thousands of mitochondria and each one can carry several copies of mtDNA. Healthy and mutated mtDNA often coexist: a state known as heteroplasmy. It's when the proportion of mutated mtDNA reaches 60–80% in a particular tissue or cell type that mitochondrial diseases manifest3.

Cells are swapping their mitochondria. What does this mean for our health?

If researchers could reduce the faulty copies of mtDNA in cells, they could eliminate the resulting disease. So, they turned to enzymes called zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) to snip the double-stranded mtDNA. Whereas targeted snipping of nuclear DNA cajoles the cut DNA strands to glue themselves back together without the harmful mutation, the cut DNA in mitochondria is simply cast out. This elimination triggers the remaining intact copies to replicate themselves so that the correct level of mtDNA is maintained.

In most cases, the mutated copies will be reduced to an acceptable level as the normal copies are replicated. “That's going to make up for what you're destroying,” says Carlos Moraes, a geneticist at the University of Miami in Florida.

Although there has been progress with this approach, it hasn't made its way out of the laboratory. And even if it did reach the clinic, the technique would be powerless against diseases caused by mutations that are often present in all copies of a person's mtDNA, such as Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a rare condition that causes rapid vision loss.

What researchers need are tools that do more than cut DNA but that don't rely on guide RNA.

When CRISPR–Cas9 emerged as a tool in 2012, it became the go-to gene editor for all kinds of application. A guide RNA directs the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence, where the enzyme does the cutting. Genetic changes are introduced as the DNA repairs itself.

The approach became even more useful in 2016, when David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his colleagues introduced a more precise technique called base editing4. In this case, researchers modify the Cas9 enzyme and rely on another enzyme, called a deaminase, to convert one DNA base letter to another — such as cytosine (C) to thymine (T) or adenine (A) to guanine (G).

Although base editing and other CRISPR techniques took off for nuclear DNA, Liu and other research teams couldn't get it working on mtDNA. Because CRISPR's guide RNA doesn't readily pass through a mitochondrion's double membrane, using precise tools on mtDNA remained a pipe dream. “We did not have much success,” says Liu. 

A solution materialized in 2018 when Joseph Mougous, a microbiologist then at the University of Washington in Seattle, and his colleagues stumbled across a toxin made by the bacterium Burkholderia cenocepacia. This enzyme, a deadly weapon against other bacteria, wreaks havoc by ultimately converting base C to T across the bacterial genome5.

Mougous, now based at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, e-mailed Liu asking whether the enzyme, called DddA, would be of any use to him. “I knew exactly what it might be used for — base editing mtDNA!” says Liu. 

But switching every C to a T would be lethal to cells. Liu and his colleagues set out to “tame the beast”. They split DddA into two inactive pieces so that the enzyme would do its handiwork on mtDNA only when the pieces were brought together in a particular orientation. And instead of using guide RNA, Liu and his colleagues modified proteins found in TALENs to direct the DddA segments to their target sequences (see ‘Making the edit').

Which Anti-Inflammatory Supplements Actually Work?

Experts say the strongest scientific studies identify three compounds that fight disease and inflammation

By Lori Youmshajekian edited by Josh Fischman

Capsules of omega-3 fatty acids show some of the best evidence as anti-inflammatories.

Inflammation has two faces. It can be short-lived like the swelling after a twisted ankle or a two-day fever when you get a mild flu, both part of the healing process. Or it can be a longer-lasting and more damaging affliction—chronic, low-grade inflammation that lingers in the body for years without obvious symptoms, silently harming cells. A steady stream of studies has connected this type of chronic inflammation to many serious conditions, including Alzheimer's, heart disease, some cancers, and autoimmune illnesses such as lupus.

These findings have begun to reframe how scientists think about disease and some of its causes. They've also created a booming market for supplements promising to lower chronic inflammation. These pills, capsules and powders are projected to become a $33-billion industry by 2027, offering consumers a sense of control over a complex and confusing ailment. Although thousands of products claim to “support immunity” or “reduce inflammation,” most lack solid evidence.

Chronic inflammation is damaging because it involves immune system cells and proteins that typically fight short-term battles against bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. But when these immune system components stay activated for years, they begin to hurt healthy cells and organs. They are intended to break down invading microbes, but over time their ongoing activity can harm blood vessels, for instance, by damaging normal cells that make up the vessels' inner linings or promoting the growth of plaques. That can lead to clots that interrupt or cut off blood flow, increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

We reviewed dozens of studies and spoke with researchers to find out whether any supplements demonstrate anti-inflammatory activity not just in laboratory animals and cultured cells but in human trials. Just three compounds, it turns out, have good evidence of effectiveness: omega-3 fatty acids, curcumin and—in certain ailments—vitamin D.

What is good evidence? We looked for consistent results across several studies that scientists described as large and well designed. Many of the more convincing trials focus on biomarkers that researchers use to track inflammation in the body. These include C-reactive protein (CRP), a molecule produced by the liver when inflammation is active, and cytokines, which are chemical messengers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), both secreted by immune and fat cells.

Still, interpreting these markers isn't straightforward. “We don't have a universally accepted or standardized measurement,” says Frank Hu, chair of the department of nutrition at Harvard University. And inflammation involves hundreds of different types of cells and many signaling pathways, adds Prakash Nagarkatti, director of the National Institutes of Health Center of Research Excellence in Inflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases at the University of South Carolina. This complexity makes it difficult to prove that any supplement works consistently.

The compounds that do show promise will not cure cancer or halt dementia. But they may help quiet the kind of underlying inflammation that has been tied to risks of illness.

Among the hundreds of supplements tested for their effects on human health, omega-3 fatty acids are supported by some of the most compelling evidence. And scientists understand why they work. Two of the main types of omega-3s are eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, better known as EPA and DHA. The body metabolizes them into signaling molecules that block the production of certain cytokines and disrupt the nuclear factor κB pathway, which governs the expression of genes tied to inflammation.

Multiple studies suggest that omega-3 supplements can reduce markers of chronic inflammation, Hu says, especially among people with underlying health conditions. A large, carefully controlled trial called VITAL (officially the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial), which followed more than 25,000 adults for about five years, found that omega-3 supplements slightly reduced CRP in people who rarely ate fish—fish is a natural omega-3 source, so these people were getting almost all their omega-3s from the supplements. The omega-3 supplements also were associated with a 40 percent reduction in heart attacks among those consuming the least fish. “The people who benefit the most from these supplements are people who start out with lower intake,” says JoAnn Manson, an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School who co-led the study.

Smaller trials have suggested that omega-3 supplementation can reduce certain markers of inflammation—TNF-α, IL-6, CRP and IL-8—especially in people with conditions such as heart failure, Alzheimer's and kidney disease. One 2012 trial found that small amounts—about 1.25 or 2.5 grams per day—lowered IL-6 levels by 10 or 12 percent, respectively, over four months. A similar group got a placebo instead, and their IL-6 levels increased by 36 percent during that period.

Taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements was associated with a 40 percent reduction in heart attacks among people in a trial who ate the least amount of fish.

But the evidence across various trials is hard to compare. “There is still a question regarding which is the optimal dose and the optimal duration because different studies have used different doses,” Hu says. And in healthy people, who have low baseline inflammation, there might be little room for improvement.

Rigorous trials have debunked the once popular idea that vitamin D is a wonder drug for everything from breast cancer to diabetes. For a few autoimmune conditions, however, the vitamin can be helpful. In the VITAL trial, people who took vitamin D daily for five years had a 22 percent lower risk of developing autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and lupus. “High-dose vitamin D has the effect of tamping down inflammation,” Manson says. “So conditions that are really directly related to inflammation may benefit.”

Lab studies have suggested that vitamin D may interfere with molecular pathways involved with inflammation, in addition to suppressing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. And in a handful of clinical trials in people with autoimmune conditions, vitamin D supplementation appeared to reduce levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, as well as CRP. In one small study of women with type 2 diabetes, a high dose—50,000 international units (IU) every two weeks—reduced CRP. It also increased levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory molecule.

A separate study in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) found that a combination of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids helped to lower CRP levels. And two analyses that grouped together results from several studies back up the idea that the vitamin can cause a significant, though small, reduction in CRP. Another trial in women with PCOS found that a daily dose of 3,200 IU of the vitamin improved patients' insulin sensitivity and liver function. It didn't affect inflammatory markers, however.

Other studies haven't found consistent effects. The VITAL study reported that people who took vitamin D saw a 19 percent drop in CRP levels by the two-year mark, but this difference disappeared by the fourth year. Whether that two-year dip in inflammation translates into long-term benefits remains unclear, the researchers note. Even then, the findings may also depend on baseline levels. Most people in the VITAL study started with normal levels of vitamin D, Manson says. “People who are already getting reasonable intake may not benefit further from the supplement,” she says. A review of other trials looking at inflammation-related biomarkers such as CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α found that vitamin D supplementation at several different doses didn't have a big effect.

As with omega-3s, the varying doses in the different trials may be behind the inconsistent results. Very high weekly doses—40,000 or 50,000 IU—may be necessary. (The recommended daily vitamin D intake for adults is 600 IU.) But high doses carry their own risks, such as too much calcium in the blood.

Although the findings on autoimmune illnesses are intriguing, the American College of Rheumatology still has a conditional recommendation against the use of supplements, instead advocating that people make dietary changes to try to get the recommended vitamins and nutrients from food. Inflammation is central to illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis, says Arthur M. Mandelin II, a rheumatologist at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, but he is interested in vitamin D only as a therapy for patients with demonstrated deficiencies.

The pigment that gives turmeric its yellow color, curcumin, is another promising compound for fighting chronic inflammation. The substance seems to interfere with the nuclear factor κB pathway, “the apex of inflammatory cascades in the body,” explains Janet Funk, a professor of medicine and nutritional sciences at the University of Arizona, who has evaluated hundreds of human trials on the compound.

Funk's review found that the most convincing evidence for curcumin's anti-inflammatory activity was among small clinical trials. People in those trials had preexisting conditions such as metabolic disorders and osteoarthritis. In a few cases, curcumin's effects resembled those of over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen. “These small trials—and there are a lot of them—all sort of point to it probably being beneficial,” Funk says.

The caveats in Funk's language, however, reflect the ambiguity of other results. A large Canadian trial found no measurable benefit for inflammation in people who were taking curcumin after surgery, and other trials have been inconclusive. One reason for the inconsistency is curcumin's bioavailability: the substance is poorly absorbed in the gut, rapidly metabolized and quickly cleared from the body. Some supplement manufacturers encase curcumin in nanoparticles to improve its absorption, but these formulations aren't always used in clinical trials, nor are they consistently available over the counter.

Some commercial turmeric and curcumin powders have even been found to contain harmful contaminants such as lead. “People buy turmeric powder based on its color,” Funk says. “Partly to make it a more beautiful color, [manufacturers] add lead chromate.”

Other compounds such as flavanols in green tea and dark chocolate or resveratrol in red wine are often promoted as anti-inflammatory agents. But their supporting evidence is weaker, Hu says. They can be hard for the body to absorb, which limits their effectiveness. In the case of resveratrol, the compound is metabolized and cleared so quickly it's unlikely to have any true impact. And even though a recent trial of cocoa flavanols found a promising effect on cardiovascular health, possibly because of reduced inflammation, any benefit might be outweighed by the many extra calories one would consume if they got the compounds by eating chocolate.

Supplements aren't regulated like drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't require supplement companies to prove that their products improve health, unlike pharmaceuticals. So there's little financial incentive for these companies to run rigorous clinical trials because, as Funk asks, “What if they find out it doesn't work?”

Such trials would also be difficult to run. Supplement ingredients can vary from batch to batch, especially for botanically derived products, in which concentrations depend on where the plants are grown and how the crucial components are extracted. Even when trials are well designed, they can come up against ethical challenges. “You cannot really preselect people on the basis of being deficient or profoundly deficient in these essential vitamins,” Manson says, “because once you identify them as being profoundly deficient, you really should be treating them” and not giving half of them placebos in a multiyear trial.

Still, the appeal of supplements is obvious. We all want simple solutions to complex medical problems, especially as we learn more about the damaging effects of chronic inflammation on health. “The patient who spends a good deal of the visit focusing on diets and supplements is also that patient who's very fearful of medication,” says Mandelin, the Northwestern rheumatologist. “They're ready to write [the names] down as if there is some magic answer, and unfortunately there isn't.”

Instead experts recommend what good medical studies have shown to work: a healthy and balanced diet. Mediterranean-style diets, which are rich in vegetables and whole grains with some fish and poultry, have especially been shown to reduce chronic disease and to promote good health. Regular physical activity helps, too. “Many people think that they can just take a dietary supplement, pop the pill, and that replaces a healthy diet,” Manson says. “That is not at all the case.”

Mysterious Rocks Could Rewrite Evolution of Complex Life

Controversial evidence hints that complex life might have emerged hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thought—and possibly more than once

By Asher Elbein edited by Kate Wong

Deena So‘Oteh

In his laboratory at the University of Poitiers in France, Abderrazak El Albani contemplates the rock glittering in his hands. To the untrained eye, the specimen resembles a piece of golden tortellini embedded in a small slab of black shale. To El Albani, a geochemist, the pasta-shaped component looks like the remains of a complex life-form that became fossilized when the sparkling mineral pyrite replaced the organism's tissues after death. But the rock is hundreds of millions of years older than the oldest accepted fossils of advanced multicellular life. The question of whether it is a paradigm-shifting fossil or merely an ordinary lump of fool's gold has consumed El Albani for the past 17 years.

In January 2008 El Albani, a talkative French Moroccan, was picking over an exposed scrape of black shale outside the town of Franceville in Gabon. Lying under rolling hills of tropical savanna, cut in places by muddy rivers lined by jungle, the rock layers of the Francevillian Basin are up to 2.14 billion years old. The strata are laced with enough manganese to support a massive mining industry. But El Albani was there pursuing riches of a different kind.

Most sedimentary rocks of that age are thoroughly “cooked,” transformed beyond recognition by the brutal heat and pressure of deep burial and deeper time. Limestone is converted to marble, sandstone to quartzite. But through an accident of geology, the Francevillian rocks were protected, and their sediments have maintained something of their original shape, crystal structure and mineral composition. As a result, they offer a rare window into a stretch of time when, according to paleontologists, oxygen was in much shorter supply and Earth's environments would have been hostile to multicellular organisms like the ones that surround us today.

El Albani had been invited out by the Gabonese government to conduct a geological survey of the ancient sediments. He spent half a day wandering the five-meter-deep layer of the quarry, peeling apart slabs of shale as if opening pages of a book. The rocks were filled with gleaming bits of pyrite that occurred in a variety of bizarre shapes. El Albani couldn't immediately explain their appearance by any common sedimentary process. Baffled, he took a few samples with him when he returned to Poitiers. Two months later he scraped together funding to head back to the Francevillian quarry. This time he went home with more than 200 kilograms of specimens in his luggage.

In 2010 El Albani and a team of his colleagues made a bombshell claim based on those finds: the strangely shaped specimens they'd recovered in Franceville were fossils of complex life-forms—organisms made up of multiple, specialized cells—that lived in colonies long before any such thing is supposed to have existed. If the scientists were right, the traditional account of life's beginning, which holds that complex life originated once around 1.6 billion years ago, is wrong. And not only did complex multicellular life appear earlier than previously thought, but it might have done so multiple times, sprouting seedlings that were wiped away by a volatile Earth eons before our lineage took root. El Albani and his colleagues have pursued this argument ever since.

Rocks from the Francevillian Basin in Gabon are filled with gleaming shapes that have been interpreted as fossils of complex life-forms from more than two billion years ago.

The potential implications of their claims are immense—they stand to rewrite nearly the entire history of life on Earth. They're also incredibly controversial. Almost immediately, prominent researchers argued that El Albani's specimens are actually concretions of natural pyrite that only look like fossils. Mentions of the Francevillian rocks in the scientific literature tend to be accompanied by words such as “uncertain” and “questionable.”

Yet even as most experts regard the Francevillian specimens with a skeptical eye, a slew of recent discoveries from other teams have challenged older, simpler stories about the origin of life. Together with these new finds, the sparkling rock El Albani held in his hands has raised some very tricky questions. What conditions did complex life need to emerge? How can we recognize remains of life from deep time when organisms then would have been entirely different from those that we know? And where do the burdens of proof lie for establishing that complex life arose far earlier than previously thought—and more than just once?

By most accounts, life on Earth first emerged around four billion years ago. In the beginning, the oxygen that sustains most species today had yet to suffuse the world's atmosphere and oceans. Single-celled microbes reigned supreme. In the anoxic waters, bacteria spread and fed on minerals around hydrothermal vents. Then, maybe 2.5 billion years ago, so-called cyanobacteria that gathered in mats and gave rise to great stone domes called stromatolites began feeding themselves using the power of the sun. In doing so, they kick-started a slow transformation of the planet, pumping Earth's seas and atmosphere full of oxygen as a by-product of their feeding.

That transformation would eventually devastate the first, oxygen-averse microbial residents of Earth. But amid a gathering oxygen apocalypse, something new appeared. Roughly two billion years ago a symbiotic union between two groups of single-celled organisms—one of which was able to process oxygen—gave rise to the earliest eukaryotes: larger cells with a membrane-bound nucleus, distinctive biochemistry and an aptitude for sticking together. Somewhere in the vast sweep of time between then and now, in something of a glorious accident, those eukaryotes began banding together in specialized ways, forming intricate and increasingly complex multicellular organisms: algae, seaweeds, plants, fungi and animals.

Scholars have long endeavored to understand when that transition from the single-celled to the multicellular happened. By the mid-19th century researchers noticed that the fossil record got considerably livelier at a certain point, which we now know was around 540 million years ago. During this period, called the Cambrian, multicellular eukaryotes seemed to explode in diversity out of nowhere. Suddenly the seas were filled with trilobites, meter-long predatory arthropods, and even the earliest forerunners of vertebrates, the backboned lineage of animals to which we humans belong.

Jen Christiansen

But it wasn't long before scientists began finding older hints of multicellular organisms, suggesting that complex life proliferated before the Cambrian. In 1868 a geologist proposed that tiny, disk-shaped objects from sediments more than 500 million years old in Newfoundland were fossils—only for other researchers to dismiss them as inorganic concretions. Similarly ancient fossils from elsewhere in the world turned up over the first half of the 20th century. The most famous of them—discovered in Australia's Ediacara Hills by geologist Reginald Claude Sprigg, who took them to be jellyfish—helped to push the dawn of complex life back to least 600 million years ago, into what came to be called the Ediacaran period.

Still, a gap of more than a billion years separates the earliest known eukaryotes and their great flowering in the Ediacaran. The contrast between the apparent evolutionary stasis of the bulk of this period and the eventful periods before and after it is so stark that researchers variously refer to it as “the dullest time in Earth's history” and the “boring billion.” Why didn't many-celled eukaryotes start diversifying earlier, wonders Susannah Porter, a paleontologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara? Why didn't they explode until the Ediacaran?

Researchers have historically blamed environmental conditions on ancient Earth for the delay. The dawn of the Ediacaran, they note, coincided with a noticeable shift in global conditions 635 million years ago. In the wake of a world-spanning glacial event—the so-called Snowball Earth period, when great sheets of ice scraped the continents and covered the seas—the available nutrients in the oceans shifted amid a surge in levels of available oxygen. The friendlier water chemistry and more abundant oxygen provided new opportunities for eukaryotic organisms that could exploit them. They diversified quickly and dramatically, first into the stationary animals of the Ediacaran and eventually into the more active grazers and hunters of the Cambrian. It's a commonly cited explanation for the timing of life's big bang, one that the field tends to accept, Porter says. And it may well be correct. But if you asked El Albani, he'd say it's not the whole story—far from it.

As a kid growing up in Marrakech, El Albani wasn't interested in geology; football and medicine held more appeal. He drifted into the field when he was 20 largely because it let him spend time outside. He then fell in love with it in part because like his father, a police officer, he enjoys a good investigation, working out what happened in some distant event by laying out multiple lines of evidence.

In the case of the ancient Gabon “fossils,” the first line of evidence involves the unusual geology of the Francevillian formation. Unlike most sedimentary rocks laid down two billion years ago—fated for deep burial and transformative heat and pressure—the Francevillian strata sit within a bowl of much tougher rock, which prevented them from being cooked. The result: shales able to preserve both biological forms and something close to the primary chemicals and minerals present in the marine sediments. “It gives us the possibility of actually reconstructing this environment that existed in the past, at a scale that we don't see anywhere around this time,” says Ernest Chi Fru, a biogeochemist at Cardiff University in Wales, who has worked with El Albani on the Francevillian material. If you were searching for fossils of relatively large, soft-bodied multicellular organisms from this period, the Francevillian is exactly the kind of place you'd look in.

“I don't know what we need to show to prove, to convince.” —Abderrazak El Albani University of Poitiers

El Albani's team has recovered quite a few such specimens. Three narrow rooms in the geology building at the University of Poitiers house the Francevillian collection. More than 6,000 pieces—all of them collected from the same five-meter scrape of Gabonese shale—sprawl over wood shelves and tables and glass display cabinets, the black slabs arranged in puzzle-piece configurations under white walls. El Albani is eager to show them off. He plucks out rock after rock, no sooner highlighting one when he's distracted by another. Here are the ripplelike remnants of bacterial mats. There are the specimens encrusted with pyrite: the common, tortellinilike “lobate” forms that made the cover of the journal Nature in 2010, “tubate” shapes that resemble stethoscopes and spoons, and other forms similar to strings of pearls several centimeters long. There are strange, wormlike tracks that the team has suggested could be traces of movement. There are nonpyritized remains, too: sand-dollar-like circles ranging from one to several centimeters across imprinted on the shales.

“Et voilà,” El Albani says, tapping one specimen and then another. “You see? This is totally different.” The sheer variety of forms is why he's always surprised that people could look at them and assume they aren't in fact fossils. Nevertheless, his lab has been exploring ways to attempt to prove their identity.

One approach El Albani's lab has taken recently is looking into the chemistry of the specimens. Eukaryotic organisms tend to take up lighter forms, or isotopes, of elements such as zinc rather than heavy ones. When examining the sand-dollar-shaped impressions in 2023, the team found that the zinc isotopes in them were mostly lighter forms, suggesting the impressions could have been made by eukaryotes. (An independent team ran a similar study of one of the pyritized specimens and reached a similar conclusion.)

Earlier this year El Albani's Ph.D. student Anna El Khoury reported another potential chemical signal for life in the contested rocks. Organisms in areas thick with arsenic sometimes absorb the poisonous chemical instead of necessary nutrients such as phosphate. Whereas confirmed mineral concretions from the Francevillian show a random distribution of arsenic in the rock, the possibly organic specimens El Khoury looked at showed dramatic concentrations of the toxin only in certain parts of the specimens, as would be expected if an organism's cells were working to isolate the absorbed substance from more vulnerable tissues.

What El Albani and his colleagues find most telling, however, are the environmental conditions that are now known to have prevailed when the putative fossils formed. The sediments that make up the Francevillian strata appear to have been deposited in something like an inland sea. The rocks show signals of dramatic underwater volcanism and hydrothermal vent activity from long before the first fossil specimens appear, which left the basin awash in nutrients such as phosphorus and zinc that are crucial for the chemical processes that power living cells.

Chemical analyses of the Francevillian specimens suggest that they are the remains of eukaryotic organisms.

What is more, the Francevillian samples, like the Ediacaran fossils, are from a time after a major period of ice ages: the Huronian glaciation event, wherein a surge in oxygen levels and a reduction in the greenhouse effect 2.4 billion to 2.1 billion years ago unleashed massive walls of ice from the poles. According to some analyses, that spike in oxygen levels might have hit a peak close to that in the Ediacaran before eventually falling again. In other words, the same environmental conditions that are thought to have allowed complex life to flower during the Ediacaran also occurred far earlier and could have set the stage for the emergence of Francevillian life-forms.

Talk with the people in El Albani's lab about the Francevillian, and they'll paint you a picture of an alien world. Ancient shorelines run under the brooding gaze of distant mountains, silent but for the wind and the waves. Thick mats of bacteria stretch across the underwater sediments. Swim down 20 meters offshore, through waters thick with nutrients and heavy metals such as arsenic, and you might see colonies of spherical and tube-shaped organisms clustered amid the mats. In the oxygen-rich water column, soft-bodied organisms drift like jellyfish, sinking now and then into the mire. Below the silt, unseen movers leave spiraling mucus trails in the ooze.

What were these strange forms of life? Not plants or animals as we understand them. Based on the sizes, shapes and geochemical signatures of the putative fossils, El Albani thinks they might belong to a lineage of colonial eukaryotes—perhaps something resembling a slime mold—that independently developed the complex multicellular processes needed to survive at large sizes. These colonial organisms would have been comparatively early offshoots of the eukaryotic tree, making them an entirely independent flowering of complex multicellular life from the Ediacaran bloom that took place more than a billion years later.

The Francevillian organisms flourished for a time, but they did not last. After a few millennia, underwater volcanism started up again, and oxygen levels crashed. A billion years would pass before another global icebox phase and another oxygen spike gave multicellular eukaryotes another shot at emergence.

This story flies in the face of decades of thinking about how complex life arose. El Albani's team argues that rather than long epochs of stillness and stasis, rather than the rise of complex life being an extraordinary and long-brewing accident in Earth's long history, multicellular organisms might not have been a singular innovation. “It seems to me that [the Francevillian material] is showing that complex life might have evolved twice in history,” Chi Fru says. And if ancient complex life can emerge so quickly when conditions are right, who knows where else in Earth's rocks—or another planet's—signs of another blossoming might turn up next? “If,” of course, being the operative word.

Skeptics of El Albani's Francevillian “fossils”—and there are many—have tended to gather around similar sticking points, says Leigh Anne Riedman, a paleontologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. For one thing, the bizarre shapes of the rocks show a lot more variety than tends to be seen in accepted early complex multicellular forms, and with their amorphous, asymmetrical features, they do not scan easily as organisms.

The pyritized nature of the rocks may also be cause for concern. Colonies of bacteria living in oxygen-poor environments often deposit pyrite as a by-product. Although such colonies can grow a sparkling rind around biological material, the mineral concretions can also develop on their own, developing lifelike appearances without any biological process. Critics of the Francevillian hypothesis point to a well-known phenomenon of pyrite “suns” or “flowers,” superficially fossil-like accumulations of minerals that occasionally turn up in sediments rich in actual fossils. Shuhai Xiao, a paleontologist at Virginia Tech specializing in the Precambrian era, notes that the Francevillian material resembles similar-looking inorganic structures from Michigan that date to 1.1 billion years ago.

If ancient complex life can emerge so quickly when conditions are right, who knows where else signs of another blossoming might turn up next?

Even scientists who are more amenable to the idea that El Albani's specimens are fossils tend to conclude that the pyritized specimens are probably just the remains of bacterial mats, not complex life-forms. An independent radiation of colonial eukaryotes at such an age? That's a hard sell. “I have no problem with there being oxygen oases and there being certain groups that proliferated during those periods,” Riedman says. But the idea that they would have proliferated to that size—a jump in scale that another researcher equated to that between a human and an aircraft carrier—without any similar fossils turning up elsewhere gives her pause. “It just seems a little bit of a stretch.”

Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, however. In the case of the Proterozoic fossil record, the lack of other candidate fossils of complex life as old as those from the Francevillian may reflect a lack of effort in searching for them. That is, the apparent quiet of the deep past may be an illusion—less the “boring billion” than, as Porter puts it, the “barely sampled billion.”

The dullness of vast chunks of the Proterozoic has been a self-fulfilling prophecy, Riedman says. After all, who wants to devote time and scarce funding to a period when nothing much is supposed to have happened? “That name, man,” Riedman says of the boring billion. “We've got to kill it. Kill it with fire.”

Recent findings may help reform the Proterozoic's cursed reputation—and cast the Francevillian rocks in a more plausible light. Just last year Lanyun Miao of the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and her colleagues announced that they had discovered the oldest unequivocal multicellular eukaryotes in 1.6-billion-year-old rocks from northern China. The fossils preserve small, threadlike organisms. They're a far cry from the much larger, more elaborate forms associated with complex multicellularity. But they show that these simpler kinds of multicellular life existed some 500 million years earlier than previously hypothesized.

There's good reason to think the roots of the eukaryote family tree could run considerably deeper than that. Analyses of genome sequences and fossils have hinted that the earliest common ancestor of all living eukaryotes may have appeared as long as 1.9 billion years ago.

Critics argue that the forms evident in the Francevillian rocks are merely mineral concretions, not fossils of complex eukaryotic organisms.

And complex multicellularity itself may develop surprisingly fast. In a fascinating experiment published a few years ago, a team at the Georgia Institute of Technology was able to get single-celled eukaryotes—in this case, yeasts—to chain together in multicellular forms visible to the naked eye in just two years. These findings, along with the growing fossil record, suggest to some researchers that multicellular eukaryotes have a deeper history than is generally recognized.

But recognizing early life in the rock is notoriously tricky. Brooke Johnson, a paleontologist at the University of Liège in Belgium, has visited Ediacaran outcrops in the U.K. with his colleagues and sometimes struggled to spot the specific fossils he knows are there.

Assessing unfamiliar structures is even more fraught. Researchers constantly second-guess themselves for fear of overinterpreting any given shape or shadow in the stone. The specter of crankhood—of being the kind of researcher who drives their work off a cliff by refusing to be proved wrong—hangs over everybody. “It's very easy to get yourself tricked into thinking that you can see something that isn't there, because you're used to seeing a particular pattern,” Johnson says.

One spring morning in 2023, while working through hundreds of samples of rock more than one billion years old from drill cores from Australia, Johnson knocked over one of the pieces. The rock rolled into a strip of sunlight cutting through the blinds. Johnson abruptly noticed structures picked out by the low-angle light like tiny, quilted chains across the surface of the stone. A careful reexamination of many of the drill cores—rocks many previous geologists had handled without comment—showed the structures were common across the samples.

Johnson speaks cautiously about the structures and has yet to publish his findings on them formally. But he thinks they might be some type of colony-living eukaryote of a size significantly larger than the microscopic examples known from elsewhere in the early fossil record.

The fact that Johnson noticed the structures in the drill core samples only by chance has shaken his initial skepticism of El Albani's work. “Something like the Francevillian stuff, people might have found it already in other rocks and just not seen it,” he says. “It just might be because they haven't looked at it in the right way.”

The sheer vanity of forms is why El Albani is surprised that people could look at them and assume they aren't fossils.

Dealing with material like the Francevillian requires trying to understand a time when Earth looked virtually nothing like the world we know now, Porter says. Much of the history of multicellular life occurred across an abyss of time on what was effectively an alien planet, with environmental conditions that were remarkably different from those of the past 600 million years. These conditions affected life in ways that are still only dimly understood. And the further back in time one goes, the more likely it is that any fossils will be difficult to recognize, to say nothing of categorize.

The temptation for the field to dismiss “fossil-ish” forms as mineral concretions or the product of some other nonbiological process rather than a biogenic one therefore exerts a nearly gravitational pull. “I would imagine they're probably frustrated [and thinking], ‘Why isn't everybody already excited about this and coming along with us?'” Riedman says of El Albani and his colleagues. “And we're just like, ‘We're stuck on step one, man. We haven't gotten past the biogenic part.'”

“I don't know what we need to show to prove, to convince,” El Albani says, his expression hangdog. He's sitting in his office below a poster of the cover of a June 2024 issue of Science in which he and his team published their discovery of a remarkable trilobite fossil. “There's no trouble with trilobites,” he remarks wistfully. El Albani is not a bomb thrower by nature and is not in a rush to name names. But a visible exasperation creeps in when he discusses the Gabonese specimens, along with a tendency to simultaneously pick at and try to dismiss the wound.

At the end of the day, it is a question not really of belief but of arguments, El Albani says. If his critics believe the Gabonese specimens are concretions, they need to try to prove that rather than simply asserting it. If they disagree that the rocks contain fossils of eukaryotes, nothing is stopping them from subjecting the specimens to their own analyses. So far he feels that nobody has published any research that takes their conclusions apart point by point and reckons with all the strands of evidence they've marshaled. “If I give my opinion that your iPhone is Samsung,” he says, pulling a phone across the desk, “I should explain why!”

Porter, the U.C.S.B. paleontologist, agrees. She's not convinced by the team's arguments for what the Francevillian samples represent—an independent lineage of colonial multicellular organisms, swiftly flowering, swiftly snuffed out. But the idea that they're all just mineral concretions has never satisfied her. If they're concretions, that's something researchers need to affirmatively show, she says. Doing so, after all, would add to the field's knowledge about how pseudofossils form in a way that simply writing them off does not. “We don't want to discourage people from publishing these weird structures that are difficult to understand,” Porter says.

“It's fine if they're wrong,” Porter says of El Albani and his colleagues. Everyone is offering competing hypotheses, which are always subject to new evidence from the fossil record. In the end, “we'll probably all be somewhat wrong about our interpretation, actually.”

Seventeen years after El Albani first stopped to examine a glinting blob in the Gabonese shale, his lab shows no signs of slowing down. There are always more specimens to publish, avenues of research to pursue, dissertations to finish. Members of the group are working on closer comparisons between the different environments preserved in the Francevillian quarry and the Cambrian deposits, between the chemistry of the Gabonese specimens and fossils from the Ediacaran and the Burgess Shale.

They're also digging further into the question of how, precisely, chemistry can definitively distinguish between biological and nonbiological origins for a given specimen. Findings from research like theirs could eventually be used to evaluate rock samples from other planets. In 2020 a team of researchers reported that the NASA Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity had photographed millimeter-size, sticklike structures in an ancient lake bed that resembled fossils left by miniature tunnelers on Earth. To date, it's been impossible to disprove nonbiological explanations for their presence. But if a lab could develop a reliable conceptual model for chemically distinguishing between signs of life and nonlife, “you could apply this on Mars or another planet based on the sediment,” El Albani says.

Every year El Albani and his team make the trip to Gabon to work the scrape of black stone that reoriented his life. There they comb the flaking shales, prying apart slabs, alert to the glimmer of pyrite or the soft, subtle impression of a circular form stamped in the petrified silt. Sometimes El Albani live-streams the expeditions to French schoolchildren, explaining to them how the cellular revolution that gave rise to them lies far back in the mists of prehistory. Sometimes he bends down to examine a glittering form in the rock. It's probably something. The question, as always, is what.

Humans aren't very efficient movers—until you put us on a bicycle, when we become some of the most energy-efficient land travelers in the animal kingdom. For Scientific American's 180th birthday, we've updated a classic graphic comparing different forms of animal locomotion, first published in this magazine in 1973.

Travel involves two main expenditures of energy: fighting gravity and propelling yourself forward. Most terrestrial animals must expend energy first to stand up, then to take each step forward. (Longer-legged land creatures tend to be more efficient because they get more distance out of each step, which explains why mice are so inefficient.) Flying animals, though, can move forward cheaply by gliding through the air, carried more by currents than by their own power. Swimming animals can similarly glide through water while letting their natural buoyancy minimize the need to fight gravity.

Bikes allow us terrestrial folk to be more like fish. Wheels, a simple machine, let us coast without putting in power by pedaling, and the rigid frame supports the sitting rider against gravity. “They turn humans into this hyperefficient terrestrial locomotor because they make being on land more like swimming,” says Tyson Hedrick, a comparative physiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The main drawback is our clunky human shape; bicyclists aren't streamlined like bluefin tuna, so they must overcome more drag. Hedrick calculates that bicycles with an aerodynamic shell, called velomobiles, can let humans move with even more aquatic efficiency.

Achieving the global temperature targets set in the Paris climate agreement requires deep, rapid cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, and therefore the swift phase-out of fossil fuels. Many factors stand in the way. One of the most pernicious is carbon offsets.

Offsets are tradable credits from projects that claim to reduce emissions, either by avoiding them or by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Businesses and countries trade these credits — each representing the equivalent of one tonne of CO2 — to ‘neutralize' their own emissions.

Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise

Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise

Although conceptually appealing, this reliance on offsets has fatal flaws. In practice, it's difficult to ensure that they represent real emissions reductions rather than ‘hot air', with the claimed climate benefits existing only on paper. Equally challenging is ensuring that emission reductions are ‘additional', meaning that they would not have occurred without the incentive provided by the sale of carbon credits. For projects credited for sequestering carbon, it is also crucial to ensure that the CO2 is locked away permanently and not released back into the atmosphere later.

Most carbon-offset schemes fall foul of one or more of these requirements. Thus, offsets undermine decarbonization by enabling companies and countries to claim that emissions have been reduced when they have not. This results in more emissions, delays the phase-out of fossil fuels and diverts scarce resources to false solutions.

Yet, climate-policy processes continue to rely on them. The operationalization of Article 6 of the Paris agreement and full implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, both achieved in 2024, are set to turbocharge demand for carbon credits. In parallel, voluntary carbon markets are promising to raise standards as a way of further legitimizing and scaling up offsets.

Of greatest concern is the expanding role of offsets in domestic carbon-pricing schemes, such as emissions trading and carbon taxes. Although the European Union's Emissions Trading System phased out offsets in 2020, they still feature in most major carbon-pricing schemes outside Europe, including in China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, California, Canada and Australia. They are even permitted as a substitute for paying carbon taxes in countries such as South Africa, Mexico, Chile and Colombia.

Such practices threaten to undermine global decarbonization efforts. Low-quality offsets artificially depress carbon prices, which dilutes the incentive for industries to cut their emissions and weakens the effectiveness of carbon-pricing schemes.

Here, we outline the problems and call on decision makers to exclude offsets from carbon-pricing schemes.

Carbon offsetting sounds simple on paper. In practice, it is anything but.

It is extremely difficult to evaluate the emission reductions achieved by offset projects because calculations require comparing outcomes with ‘business-as-usual' projections. For example, calculating the climate benefits from a project that avoids deforestation involves comparing a forest's actual carbon stock to that in a counterfactual scenario in which the project did not happen. The hypothetical nature of such calculations invites manipulation and can tempt project developers to overestimate business-as-usual emissions to generate more credits.

Fundamental imbalances in the information used in offset schemes leave them vulnerable to these outcomes. In most cases, only project leaders and developers know whether their projects are dependent on credit revenues and are therefore truly additional. This makes it difficult for administrators to screen out shoddy projects.

Even where projects are additional, errors can arise from inaccurate measurement of emissions and carbon stocks. These risks are most acute when the sources and sinks are variable. For example, stocks of soil organic carbon vary naturally across landscapes and through time. This is a product of diversity in soil characteristics, topography and vegetation cover, as well as in seasonal, annual and decadal changes in temperatures and rainfall. The variability makes it difficult to accurately measure changes in the carbon stock and ensure that the credited carbon storage is fully attributable to the project1.

It is also difficult to ensure that credited carbon removals remain sequestered. Many carbon sinks are susceptible to natural disturbances, such as droughts and wildfires, which can release carbon stored in trees and soils. Carbon stocks can also be lost through the clearing of vegetation and other changes in land-management practices. Despite these risks, most offset schemes mandate that credited sinks be maintained for only 40 years or even less. Given that CO2 emissions require thousands of years to be reabsorbed by Earth's climate system2, credited removals need to lock away carbon for a similar period to genuinely neutralize the warming caused by the emissions that are claimed to be offset.

In most markets, the risks associated with the supply of low-quality goods and services can be alleviated if consumers are able to judge quality and seek redress when standards are not met. With offsets, however, the complexity and a lack of transparency make it close to impossible for buyers to make informed decisions about the quality of most credits. Moreover, many buyers are not incentivized to care. Typically, their priority is to procure credits at the lowest possible cost, a fact evidenced by a 2024 study revealing that the largest corporate buyers consistently choose low-priced credits over higher-quality alternatives3.

Why the green-technology race might not save the planet

Why the green-technology race might not save the planet

For these reasons, the integrity of offset schemes hinges on the skills and efforts of administrators, but they are often incentivized to prioritize supply over integrity. In voluntary offset markets, registries rely on project registrations and credit issuances for revenue, while competing with one another for market share. Tightening integrity standards can therefore reduce revenue and put this business model at risk.

Government-regulated offset programmes linked to carbon-pricing schemes show a similar dynamic. The main reason that pricing schemes allow the use of offsets is to lower compliance costs for polluters, thereby reducing resistance to climate policies4. Yet the focus on cost reduction places pressure on regulators to ensure a plentiful supply of low-cost credits, frequently at the expense of environmental integrity.

These interlinked issues make integrity failings inevitable. The science reflects this, with studies repeatedly showing that few of the major offset types in use today deliver real, additional or permanent abatement. A 2024 meta-analysis examining some 2,300 offset projects — amounting to around one-fifth of all issued credits — found that less than 16% achieved the emissions reductions claimed by developers5. In-depth evaluations of avoided deforestation6, renewable energy7 and clean cooking-stove projects8 have also exposed persistent problems with additionality, inaccurate measurement and impermanence.

Recognizing these flaws, some stakeholders advocate a shift from projects that avoid emissions to those that remove carbon from the atmosphere. However, carbon-removal projects tend to have similar integrity problems. Engineering-based techniques are scarce, and so most removal projects currently involve less durable nature-based approaches, such as tree planting, improved soil management and production of biochar (plant-derived charcoal). And just as with emissions-avoidance projects, studies reveal persistent integrity failings, particularly regarding the crediting of non-existent and non-additional removals9,10.

Bad offsets cheat the climate by failing to deliver their promised emission reductions. And they do further damage by distorting carbon-pricing schemes.

Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them

Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them

In a well-functioning emissions trading scheme, the carbon price will reflect the marginal cost of reducing emissions, whether at a polluting facility or through an offset project. When offsets lack integrity, credit prices reflect the cost of supplying pretend, rather than real, emission reductions, which artificially lowers the carbon price. The same is true for carbon taxes: low-integrity credits reduce the carbon price faced by polluters by allowing them to surrender cheap credits in place of paying the tax.

Metrics details

Microglia and neuroinflammation are involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the precise underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. We generated single-nuclei transcriptomes from the spinal cord and motor cortex of patients with sporadic ALS (sALS) and C9orf72 ALS (C9-ALS). Here we confirmed that C9orf72 is highly expressed in microglia and observed that the hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) results in haploinsufficiency. Whereas sALS microglia transitioned toward disease-associated cell states, C9orf72 HRE microglia exhibited a diminished response, with alterations in endolysosomal pathways. We confirmed these observations using a human microglia xenograft model, in which C9orf72 mutations led to a reduced activation. We also confirmed the endolysosomal alterations in C9orf72 HRE and C9orf72-deficient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia. We also found a diminished response of C9orf72 HRE astrocytes and provided a map of dysregulated ligand−receptor pairs in microglia and astrocytes. Our data highlight variations in the cellular substrate of sporadic and inherited forms of ALS, which have implications for patient stratification and selection of appropriate treatments.

ALS is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons in the motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord1. Loss of motor neurons is accompanied by neuroinflammation and alterations in both microglia and astrocytes2. ALS typically presents with focal muscle weakness, which spreads to neighboring body regions. Other non-motor manifestations, such as cognitive and behavioral impairment, occur in a subset of patients1. Effective therapies are scarce, and the median survival after symptom onset is limited to 3 years1. The widespread nature of this disease, with contributions from distant central nervous system (CNS) regions, represents a challenge when trying to elucidate the underlying cellular mechanisms. To achieve a deep understanding of ALS pathophysiology, it is essential to investigate cell-specific disease mechanisms acting in both the spinal cord and the motor cortex.

ALS has a strong genetic component, where the most common monogenic cause is the GGGGCC repeat expansions in the C9orf72 (chromosome 9 open reading frame 72) gene3, with a repeat length ranging from 38 to approximately 1,600 repeats4,5. C9orf72 has multiple transcript variants that are differentially enriched across cell types in the brain. Both loss-of-function (LOF) and toxic gain-of-function (GOF) mechanisms in neuronal and non-neuronal cells have been implicated in the disease pathogenesis6. C9orf72 is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, including microglia7. Although the exact mechanisms by which the C9orf72 mutations alter microglia function are not fully understood8, experimental studies have shown that its deletion leads to altered immune responses, exacerbated myeloid proliferation and lysosomal dysfunction9,10.

In this study, we investigated the impact of the C9orf72 pathogenic repeat expansion (HRE) in microglia and astrocytes. By single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of C9-ALS, sALS and healthy control motor cortex and spinal cord samples, we demonstrate that the pathogenic expansion in C9orf72 results in haploinsufficiency in microglia and leads to an impaired phenotypic transition of microglia toward reactive cell states when compared to sALS. We confirmed these findings using a xenografted model where both C9orf72−/− and C9orf72 HRE iPSC-derived microglia were transplanted in the mouse brain. We observed an alteration in endolysosomal transcriptional pathways, which was confirmed using both LOF and patient iPSC-derived microglia in vitro systems. Finally, we found that astrocytes are also transcriptionally altered in C9orf72 carriers when compared to sALS, and we suggest that this might be due to defective microglia−astrocyte communication. Our work indicates that, whereas sALS and C9-ALS are clinically indistinguishable, the cellular and molecular substrates underlying both diseases might be different, thus posing additional challenges when aiming at developing new therapeutic strategies.

We performed snRNA-seq on matching motor cortex and spinal cord samples from sALS, C9-ALS and healthy controls (n = 5 per group). We analyzed a total of 156,252 nuclei after batch correction and removal of low-quality nuclei and doublets (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Using publicly available data from recent mouse and human spinal cord and brain atlases11,12,13,14,15,16,17, we defined the different major cell types across the spinal cord and motor cortex. In the motor cortex, we identified six cell types, including astrocytes (SLC1A3, SLC1A2, RYP3), endothelial cells (COBLL1, IGFBP7, SYNE2), neurons (SYT1, GABRB2, RBFOX), microglia (MEF2A, DOCK8, ST6GAl1), oligodendrocytes (MBP, PRP4K2A, RLP1) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (DSCAM, VCAN, LHFPL3) (Fig. 1a,c). By contrast, in the spinal cord, we identified seven major transcriptionally distinct cell types that we annotated into astrocytes (GFAP, CTNND2, NRG3), endothelial cells (SPAG17, DNAH7, DCDC1), microglia (DOCK4, MEF2C, LRMDA), natural killer cells (PARP8, MBNL1, CBLB, B2M), neurons (SYT1, SNAP25, CALY), oligodendrocytes (MBP, PLP1, PEX5L) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (DSCAM, VCAN, NRCAM) (Fig. 1b,c). We did not observe any major changes in the proportion of the different cell types across the different experimental conditions (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d).

Haploinsufficiency of C9orf72 is a key proposed disease mechanism, along with toxicity derived from HRE-containing expanded RNAs and aggregating dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs)6,18. Thus, we assessed the expression of C9orf72 in all the different cell types identified in both the spinal cord and motor cortex. We confirmed that microglia show the highest expression of C9orf72 in the CNS (Fig. 1d) and found that the presence of the C9orf72 HRE results in a reduced expression that is limited to these cells and not observed in other cell types (Fig. 1d). This is consistent with previous findings in blood samples and iPSC-derived microglia from C9orf72 HRE carriers19,20,21.

Next, we sought to determine the impact of the C9orf72 HRE-derived haploinsufficiency in the transcriptome of microglia. We subset, integrated, quality controlled and reclustered the microglial nuclei from the spinal cord (n = 12,547) and motor cortex (n = 4,216) (Supplementary Table 3). We identified six distinct microglia transcriptional states across the spinal cord and motor cortex (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2). To increase the sample size and enhance the accuracy, we incorporated recent data from Gerrits et al.22 into our analysis, which consists of 132,628 microglial nuclei across three brain regions (frontal, temporal and occipital cortex) from both FTD-TDP (n = 88,237) and healthy controls (n = 44,391) (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 5). After integration of both datasets (total of 149,172 nuclei), we retained the exact same six microglial subclusters (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). Using previously described microglial signatures23, we annotated these clusters as homeostatic microglia (HM) (MG1; MERTK, MRC1, NHSL1), transitioning microglia (TM) (MG2; lower expression of CX3CR1, P2RY12 and a background of HSP1A1, HSSPA1B, KCNPI1), ribosomal microglia (RM) (MG3; FTH1, RP transcripts), disease-associated microglia (DAM) (MG4; GLDN, SPP1), hypoxia-associated microglia (MG5; NAMPT, HIF1A) and cytokine response microglia (CRM) (MG6; CCL3, CCL4, IL1B, NFKBIZ) (Fig. 2c). The distribution of these clusters among all individuals and experimental groups is shown in Extended Data Fig. 2e.

Lines represent the log2FC threshold of ±0.2. Positive log2FC values display enrichments in disease states; negative log2FC values display enrichments in healthy controls.

Given the widespread anatomical distribution of the samples included in our analysis, we wondered whether microglia displayed any regional transcriptomic differences. To explore this, we quantified shifts in abundances of cell states across brain and spinal cord using Milo24. We grouped transcriptionally similar microglia into neighborhoods of 50–200 cells, and, for each neighborhood, we determined the proportion of cells from each patient group as well as each anatomical region. Then, we assessed the differential abundance of each CNS region in each neighborhood and categorized them into seven distinct groups (Fig. 2d). Although most of the groups did not show any regional enrichment, we found that group 6 was specifically enriched with microglia from the spinal cord (Fig. 2e). Additionally, we observed that the marker genes from group 6 overlap mostly with the transcriptomic profile of MG5 (hypoxia) microglia (Fig. 3f). Nevertheless, we observed no correlation between the gene expression of each neighborhood group with the differentially expressed analysis between either C9-ALS or sALS versus controls (Extended Data Fig. 2g,h). This suggests that, whereas microglia display certain transcriptional heterogeneity across major regions of the CNS, there is no evidence that links this diversity to the pathological changes observed in ALS.

Timepoint analyzed: C9-HRE and C9-ISO 3 months, CTRL and C9KO 6 months. FC, fold change.

Next, we performed a differential expression analysis between C9-ALS versus healthy controls and sALS versus healthy controls to determine the transcriptional impact of the C9orf72 haploinsufficiency in microglia (Fig. 2g, Extended Data Fig. 2f and Supplementary Tables 7–15). We observed strong differences between groups, with C9-ALS microglia generally displaying a much lower general transcriptional response to pathology in the motor cortex and especially the spinal cord (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Comparison between C9-ALS and sALS microglia showed that spinal sALS microglia display transcriptomic changes consistent with a transition toward the reactive RM, DAM and cytokine response microglia (CRM) states, with an increased expression of marker genes of clusters MG3, MG4 and MG6, such as FTH1, CD14, FTL, FCGR1A, HLA-DPB1 and HLA-E, and a downregulation of homeostatic markers such as P2RY12. On the contrary, spinal C9-ALS microglia did not show any clear upregulation of genes associated with reactive states and, in turn, expressed higher levels of P2RY12, which is classically defined as an HM marker25 (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 2f). This indicates that, whereas sALS microglia are able to transit toward responsive states, C9-ALS microglia are less able to engage in this phenotypic switch. Next, we mapped the atlas of transcriptomic signatures of human microglia that we previously obtained using a human brain cellular xenograft (HBCX) model onto our single-nuclei dataset26. We confirmed that, contrary to sALS, spinal C9-ALS microglia displayed a reduced enrichment in both DAM and antigen-presenting HLA gene sets (Fig. 2h). This is consistent with our differential expression analysis as well as with previous findings in C9orf72 knockout mice that show an impaired phenotypic transition toward DAM27 and, therefore, resembles the LOF scenario described in several Alzheimer's disease genetic mutations, such as TREM2 or APOE26,28. This suggests that there might be strong similarities in the impact of disease-causing or risk-modifying mutations in microglia across different neurodegenerative disorders23.

Given that mutation in both C9orf72 and GRN results in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with TDP-43 pathology, and that both genes are highly expressed in microglia29,30,31, we wondered whether C9-ALS microglia shared any similarities with GRN-deficient cells. We performed a comparison of the differentially expressed genes in patients with C9-ALS, sALS and GRN-FTD22. Interestingly, we observed that, whereas C9 and GRN-deficient microglia gene expression were positively correlated, sALS and GRN-deficient microglial responses were negatively correlated (Fig. 2i,j and Supplementary Table 16). This could indicate that C9orf72 HRE and GRN deficiency may result in similar downstream functional alterations in microglia.

To link the transcriptional alterations that we observed with relevant microglial functional pathways, we performed an unbiased weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). We focused on the spinal cord, where we found the most pronounced changes in our differential expression analysis. We identified seven distinct gene co-expression clusters, many of them with differential significant enrichment across sALS, C9-ALS and healthy controls (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 17). The blue cluster appeared particularly relevant, as it contained a high number of genes (Extended Data Fig. 3b) and was significantly enriched in sALS versus both C9-ALS and healthy controls (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Genes in this cluster were associated with functional pathways related to neurodegeneration, immune system, phagocytosis, autophagy−lysosomal function, ubiquitin−proteasome system, oxidative stress and apoptosis, confirming a strong immune component in the pathogenesis of sALS (Extended Data Fig. 3d). C9-ALS microglia showed no enrichment in these pathways, which is consistent with the C9orf72 HRES leading to a defective engagement in reactive DAM and HLA states (Fig. 3c). In turn, C9-ALS microglia showed an enrichment of clusters turquoise and yellow, which encompassed general biological pathways such as cell proliferation, migration, general metabolic processes, protein biogenesis and degradation (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). To confirm these observations, we performed a targeted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) focusing on lysosomal, phagocytic, inflammatory and metabolic transcriptional pathways. Whereas sALS microglia showed increased transcription of genes involved in lysosomal and phagocytic pathways, both C9-ALS and sALS displayed an enrichment in genes related to oxidative phosphorylation (Extended Data Fig. 4). This is consistent with our differential expression analysis and is in line with previous findings32,33,34.

Our data indicate that the C9orf72 HRE prevents the transition of microglia toward reactive states as opposed to sALS, therefore indicating that the pathogenic contribution of microglia could be different in sporadic and inherited forms of ALS.

To further validate our postmortem findings and determine whether the transcriptomic changes that we observed are at least partially mediated by a direct effect of the C9orf72 haploinsufficiency in microglia, we used an HBCX model (Fig. 3a)26,35,36. We transplanted iPSC-derived microglial precursors from a C9orf72 patient line (C9-HRE) carrying the repeat expansion and the corresponding isogenic control in which the mutation was corrected via CRISPR−Cas9 genome editing (C9-ISO)37. We also transplanted microglial precursors generated from C9orf72 knockout (C9KO) and isogenic control iPSC lines, which we previously characterized38, to evaluate the impact of C9orf72 LOF in human engrafted microglia without the potentially confounding factor of other C9orf72-associated phenotypes. Microglial precursors were transplanted into the brain of wild-type immunodeficient mice (Rag2−/−Il2g−/−hCSF1KI)26,35,36.

After 3 months or 6 months upon transplantation, we isolated the human microglia by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) labeled with CD11b and hCD45 (refs. 26,35,36) (Extended Data Fig. 5a) and performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). In total, we analyzed 21,826 cells, after removal of low-quality cells and doublets and correction for batch effects (Extended Data Fig. 5b–d). Using a combination of unbiased clustering, differential expression and microglial gene signatures scores that we previously described in xenograft mouse models26, we identified eight distinct microglial clusters: HM (P2RY12, CX3CR1), transitioning CRM (tCRM: HSPA1A, JUN, RHOB), cytokine response microglia 1 and 2 (CRM1 and CRM2: CCL2, CCL3, CCL4), RM (RPL3, RPL13A, RPL29), antigen-presenting response (HLA: HLA-DPA1, HLA-DRB5), DAM (CD9, LGALS3, GPNMB) and interferon response microglia (IRM: CXCL10, IFIT3, IFITM1) (Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Table 18).

In line with our postmortem data, we observed reduced C9orf72 expression in the C9-HRE microglia compared to the isogenic control, again indicating an HRE LOF scenario (Fig. 3d). We also found that C9-HRE microglia showed a downregulation of HLA genes (for example, HLA-DPA1, XACT) and SPP1, a key regulator of DAM and one of the top downregulated genes in C9orf72 postmortem microglia. Moreover, we observed an upregulation of several homeostatic genes (for example, NAV3, AFF3, DISP1). Overall, these data suggest that the C9-HRE in microglia is sufficient to impair the transition of these cells into reactive cell states. Next, we sought to confirm that these observations were due to the loss of C9orf72 expression. Transplanted C9KO microglia partially phenocopied C9-HRE cells (Fig. 3e) and displayed a significantly lower shift into the HLA-reactive transcriptional state when compared to their isogenic controls (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Tables 19 and 20). We also observed downregulation of several of HLA-related genes, overlapping with what we found altered in postmortem C9-HRE microglia (Fig. 3e).

These data indicate that, although we cannot exclude the contribution of other C9orf72 HRE downstream molecular mechanisms in microglia, the defective transition to reactive states and the downregulation of HLA genes are likely directly driven by a loss of C9orf72 function.

Our data in C9orf72 postmortem brain and transplanted microglia point toward a C9orf72-induced defect in the endolysosomal system. To validate this observation further, we assessed the expression levels of cathepsin D (CTSD), a known lysosomal protease, in the spinal cord of an independent experimental cohort of patients (2 healthy controls, 5 C9-ALS and 5 sALS). Consistent with our WGCNA analysis, patients with C9orf72 HRE showed reduced CTSD levels compared to sALS, especially in the spinal cord (Fig. 4a–c). Additionally, we differentiated a C9-HRE iPSC line into microglia cells35,36 (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b) and observed an increased percentage of cells containing enlarged CTSD-positive lysosomes in vitro (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 6d), further confirming the role of the C9orf72 HRE in altering the microglial endolysosomal compartment.

Source data

Next, we explored the impact of a full C9orf72 loss in iPSC-derived C9KO and isogenic controls (Extended Data Fig. 6a–c). Using resolution-enhancing expansion microscopy, we observed an enlargement and increased clustering of CTSD-positive lysosomes in C9KO microglia versus controls (Fig. 4e). Quantification showed an elevated proportion of cells containing CTSD puncta in the C9KO iPSC-derived microglia compared to controls (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 6d), consistent with what we observed in C9-HRE microglia (Fig. 4d). Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we found an increased density of electron-lucent vesicles in the C9KO microglia (Fig. 4g,h and Extended Data Fig. 6e,f). Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that these structures were LAMP1 and RAB7 positive (a marker of late endosomes) (Fig. 4i) but not EEA1 positive (a marker of early endosomes) (Extended Data Fig. 6g), indicating that the loss of C9orf72 leads to alterations of lysosomal homeostasis with an accumulation of late endosomes/lysosomes. Next, we performed phagocytosis assays to further validate the functional consequences of C9orf72 loss in microglia. We treated the cells with Escherichia coli pHrodo BioParticles that, once internalized, emit fluorescence within the acidic environments of endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 4j). We monitored both the uptake and the degradation of the pHrodo particles over a timecourse of 15 hours using live-cell imaging. We found a significant increase in the overall phagocytosis in the C9KO microglia versus control as measured by the area under the curve (AUC) (Fig. 4k). To explore differences between uptake and degradation, we assessed the levels of fluorescence intensity in the microglia at 30 minutes and 900 minutes, respectively. We observed no differences in the initial uptake of pHrodo (Fig. 4l), which we also confirmed independently via flow cytometry (Extended Data Fig. 6h–k). However, we found significant differences at late stages of the live imaging, indicating a reduced ability of the C9KO microglia to degrade the phagocytic material compared to controls (Fig. 4m). Overall, our data further confirm the impact of C9 LOF on the microglial endolysosomal pathway, potentially leading to a defective functioning of late phases of the degradative pathway.

To determine whether C9orf72 mutations also result in alterations in astrocytes, we first subset, integrated and reclustered both spinal (n = 12,978) and cortical (n = 9,657) astrocytes to define their transcriptomic landscape (Fig. 5a,b, Extended Data Fig. 7a–c and Supplementary Table 4). Unbiased clustering analysis showed eight independent transcriptional states (Fig. 5a). However, after integration with the data from Gerrits et al.22, we refined our analysis to six transcriptional states in 216,574 nuclei (Fig. 5b, Extended Data Fig. 7c and Supplementary Table 6), which parallels previously described astrocyte heterogeneity39,40,41,42. The correlation between the clustering analysis before and after integration can be found in Extended Data Fig. 7c. These six transcriptional states were the following: cluster AS1 was linked to axon guidance and neuronal development (NRP1, GFRAI1, KCNQ3, UNC5C)43; AS2 was related to axon guidance, calcium signaling and heparan sulphate production (CABLES1, HS3ST5, NRP1, SLC1A2); AS3 showed markers indicative of a type of reactive astrocytes (CHI3L1, RASGEF1B, SERPINA3)43,44; AS4 expressed genes associated with cell migration, cell morphogenesis and axonogenesis (SYNPO2, ROBO2, DCLK1, NFASC); AS5 was linked to glutamate receptor and TGFβ signaling (SEMA5A, GRIA1, ID3, DPP10); and AS6 was transcriptionally related to neuron development and modulation of chemical synaptic transmission (RASGRF1, CCK, GPRIN3). AS1 and AS2 were similar to the recently reported astroHO, SLC1A2+ and NRNX1+ subtypes. These clusters were not significantly enriched in any of the experimental groups and were present in all individuals (Extended Data Fig. 7d,e).

Astrocytes are heterogeneous both morphologically45 and transcriptionally46 across different CNS regions. Therefore, we wondered whether regional diversity could be underlying some of our transcriptomic observations. We performed differential abundance testing using Milo to evaluate whether certain transcriptomic profiles had a relative enrichment in the brain or spinal cord. Astrocyte transcriptional neighborhoods were categorized into seven groups (Fig. 5d,e and Supplementary Tables 30–32). The neighborhoods in groups 3, 5 and 6 showed an enrichment in the spinal cord despite not showing any association with any patient group, thus pointing to baseline transcriptomic differences in astrocytes across these two CNS regions (Fig. 5f,g). Overlaying the expression patterns of these neighborhoods with the differential expression performed across C9-ALS, sALS and controls revealed that neighborhoods in group 5 were linked to genes that were specifically upregulated in C9-ALS and involved in pathways such as ribosome, Rap 1 signaling and oxytocin signaling (Fig. 5h). On the contrary, neighborhood 6 was linked to genes specifically upregulated in patients with sALS and grouped in pathways such as MAPK, FoxO and calcium signaling (Fig. 5i). Collectively, the presence of subpopulations of astrocytes specific to the spinal cord that are transcriptionally linked to C9-ALS-associated and sALS-associated genes hints to a role of astrocyte heterogeneity in the selective vulnerability of the spinal cord in ALS, which will require further investigation.

Astrocytes are known to have a reactive profile in ALS47. We first assessed for alterations in the response of astrocytes by performing a differential expression analysis between C9-ALS versus healthy controls and sALS versus healthy controls (Supplementary Tables 21–29). Similar to what we observed in microglia, we found an overall higher extent of transcriptomic changes in spinal astrocytes from sALS compared to C9-ALS (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 7e). When diving into the nature of these changes, we observed that spinal sALS astrocytes exhibited an upregulation of genes associated with the AS3 reactive state (SERPINA3, RASGEF1B, CHI3L1, F3). On the contrary, compared to sALS, spinal C9-ALS astrocytes showed higher levels of genes characterizing AS1 and AS5 clusters and linked to axonal guidance and development as well as glutamate receptor and TGFβ signaling (AQP1, DLC1, SLC35F1) (Fig. 5g,h and Extended Data Fig. 7f). These data indicate that the C9orf72 HRE also results in a defective transition toward reactive astrocytes.

Microglia−astrocyte interactions have been implicated in multiple neurodegenerative disorders and inflammatory conditions48,49,50. It is well accepted that microglia can interact and modulate the response of astrocytes, for example through secretion and physical contact51,52,53,54,55; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this interplay remain unclear. Given that C9orf72 is primarily expressed in microglia56, we wondered whether the impact on astrocytes could be indicative of a defective microglia-to-astrocyte communication. We used CellChat to infer the enrichment of different ligand−receptor pair interactions in the spinal cord of C9 and sALS57. This analysis returned 84 significant predicted ligand−receptor interaction patterns across the three groups (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 32), 35 of which were differentially enriched across the experimental groups (Fig. 6). We constructed a map of cellular interactions, stratified into each of these ligand−receptor pairs into four categories based on the sender and receiver, including microglia to microglia, microglia to astrocyte, astrocyte to microglia and astrocyte to astrocyte (Fig. 6, Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 32). We computed the communication probability and clustered the interaction pairs based on whether they showed an increased communication in C9-ALS, sALS or controls. Additionally, we calculated the levels of expression of each ligand and receptor in every microglia and astrocyte cell state to provide a link to specific cellular phenotypes. Some of the interactions that we report here have already been shown in other diseases—for example, the SEMA4−PLEXIN tandem mediates a detrimental astrocyte−microglia connectivity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis55. Another example is the GAS6-AXL/MERTK axis, activated in microglia−microglia interactions, which have been previously characterized and are expressed in the human brain58 (Fig. 6). It was previously shown that GAS6 can negatively regulate microglial activation59, and GAS6 overexpression worsened cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice60. On the other hand, MERTK/AXL knockout resulted in a reduced plaque load in APP/PS1 Alzheimerʼs disease mice61. This could indicate that the increased GAS6-AXL/MERTK interaction may partially explain the lack of microglial activation and could contribute to C9orf72 HRE-induced pathology. Interestingly, we found multiple putative interactions that have not been described before within the context of microglia−astrocyte communication in neurodegeneration. For example, the microglia-to-astrocyte SPP1/CD44 axis was engaged in sALS (Fig. 6). SPP1 has been shown to be increased in the cerebrospinal fuid of patients with ALS62, and CD44 expression correlates with disease progression in SOD1G93A mice63.

Here we present a unique resource compiling patterns of microglia−astrocyte communication in ALS, including ligand−receptor pairs and their expression across the different cellular states that arise in response to disease. These data identify candidate signals between microglia and astrocytes that may contribute to the pathological changes observed in ALS and serve as a resource for future functional testing of glial communication in neurodegeneration.

Neuroinflammation is a key pathological hallmark for ALS8,64,65. Experimental and genetic evidence66,67,68 indicates that microglia and neuroinflammation are active players, rather than simple bystanders, in the pathogenic events that lead to motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Our study confirms that C9orf72 is highly expressed in microglia in the human CNS7 and that a C9orf72 HRE leads to reduced microglial C9orf72 expression. We report that C9orf72 HRE impairs microglial cell state transition toward DAM and HLA cell states when compared to sporadic cases and induces alterations in transcriptomic pathways related to phagocytosis and lysosomal function. We validated this using an HBCX model, in which the engrafted C9KO and C9orf72 HRE human microglia displayed a downregulation of HLA-related genes. In addition, we identified alterations in the endolysosomal pathways, which were validated using both LOF and patient-derived iPSC microglia in vitro. We also showed that astrocytes from C9orf72 HRE carriers display a generally lower extent of transcriptomic change compared to sporadic ALS, with a defective transition toward reactive states particularly evident in spinal cord samples. Linked to this observation, we found a specific transcriptional subtype of astrocyte enriched in the spinal cord, which could point to a contribution of these cells in the selective vulnerability of this CNS region in ALS. Finally, we provide a resource of altered microglia and astrocyte signaling pathways in sALS and C9-ALS that may serve as foundation for future studies delving into alterations in cellular networks underlying ALS.

Several proposed mechanisms explain the toxic role of the C9orf72 HRE in ALS, including LOF due to reduced C9orf72 mRNA and protein levels69. We show that C9orf72 is highly expressed in microglia compared to other cell types of the brain, as also observed in vitro in two recent studies21,70, suggesting that these cells might be particularly vulnerable to reduced C9orf72 levels. Several studies reported widespread alterations in microglia (and other myeloid cells) after conditional71,72,73,74 or complete C9orf72 deletion9,75,76, including transcriptional alterations, exacerbated production of inflammatory cytokines and lysosomal dysfunction7,56,77,78,79. In line with a predominant impact of C9orf72 LOF in microglia, we found that diminished levels of C9orf72 results in an impaired transition into DAM and HLA microglial responses. In mouse studies, upregulation of a type I interferon signature in C9orf72 knockout microglia and myeloid cells was reported27,80. Although this evidence is interesting and might suggest different effects of the C9orf72 HRE on different microglial subsets, we did not observe upregulation of type I interferon genes in C9orf72 postmortem or xenografted microglia, which can be due to a poor representation of the IRM cell state in our postmortem dataset and/or a mouse-specific microglial response to C9orf72 depletion.

A recent study by Wang et al.81 performed snRNA-seq of the prefrontal cortex from C9orf72 ALS/FTD stratified donors based on phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) abundance. Although the extent of transcriptomic changes was limited, a reduced anti-inflammatory transcriptional program was associated with patients with high levels of pTDP-43 (ref. 81), indicating that the response of microglia could be different depending on the stage of the disease (that is, presence or absence of pTDP-43); thus, investigating microglial activation throughout the disease progression might shed light on additional microglial pathogenic mechanisms. Another recent single-cell study examining prefrontal healthy cortex samples of C9-ALS and FTD cases reported minor gene expression changes in C9-ALS versus healthy control microglia82. All these data collectively indicate a minimal microglial response to disease in the context of C9orf72 HRE. This limited response may stem from various factors, including potential variations in disease stages, as proposed by Wang et al.81, or baseline differences in the biological function of microglia. Our findings revealed more pronounced differences in spinal cord compared to regions such as the motor cortex, underscoring the importance of stratifying patients based on the disease-affected regions. It is also important to consider the parameters of comparison in these studies. In our study, although C9-ALS cases show a modest increase toward activated states when compared to controls, their lack of response to disease becomes more apparent when compared to sporadic cases. Specifically, our findings indicate that, although sporadic cases robustly respond to disease, C9-ALS microglia fail to transition to reactive states. Given these observations, additional studies will be crucial to address the following aspects: (1) stratify patients based on TDP-43 pathology and disease stages with larger sample sizes; (2) conduct a comprehensive comparison of spinal versus cortical material in C9-ALS and C9-FTD cases; and (3) evaluate responses in comparison to other patients with ALS, such as sporadic or other familial cases, to elucidate the distinct and shared cellular responses in disease. The hampered microglial transition to an activated state, as proposed in this study, is not unique to C9-ALS; similar observations exist for other neurodegeneration-linked genetic variants, such as TREM2 and APOE26,28. These results underscore distinct inflammatory substrates and microglial roles in C9orf72 and sALS pathology, and further insights are essential to define tailored therapeutic strategies for groups of patients with different pathogenic contributors.

C9orf72 localizes within lysosomes and phagosomes, and its functional alteration has been associated with disruptions in endosomal–lysosomal and autophagic pathways83. Although most of these findings were obtained from non-immune cells, recent work revealed a negative enrichment in lysosome-associated pathways and alterations in the autophagic process in C9orf72 mutant and deficient human iPSC-derived microglia21,70. In line with this, we observed enlarged CTSD-positive lysosomes in microglia carrying the repeat expansion and upon C9orf72 depletion, mirroring observations in C9orf72 knockout mice and in the motor cortex and spinal cord of patients with C9orf72 ALS56,84,85. In addition, we showed that C9-ALS microglia, compared to sALS, fail to engage in lysosomal and phagocytic pathways, which is accompanied by a defective transition into a phagocytic DAM-like state. At present, the molecular mechanisms through which C9orf72 HRE influences lysosomal and phagocytic pathways in human microglia, as well as the impact on microglial responses, require further investigation. Our in vitro data indicate that C9orf72 LOF alone is sufficient to perturb lysosomal homeostasis in human microglia, although we cannot exclude the potential contribution of GOF mechanisms70,86. Recent studies suggested a synergistic effect of C9orf72 LOF and GOF mechanisms18,84,85,87,88. In vivo studies showed that C9orf72 deficiency exacerbates motor phenotypes and premature death in a C9orf72 GOF mouse model18,84,85. It was proposed that reduced C9orf72 levels might further enhance the pathological accumulation and toxicity of DPRs in neurons18,84,87,88. Moreover, recent studies using C9orf72 GOF mouse models showed that neuronal stress induced by the expression of poly(GR) or poly(GA) activates the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome pathway89,90. As these studies were performed in mice with normal C9orf72 levels, it remains to be elucidated how neuronal stress would act on microglia in which there is a reduced expression of C9orf72.

Several co-culture studies demonstrated deleterious effects of C9orf72 astrocytes on neuronal survival91,92,93,94,95, further supporting the non-cell autonomous nature of the diseases. Despite these findings, the precise mechanisms by which C9orf72 HRE leads to astrocyte-mediated neurotoxicity remain unclear. We found no differences in C9orf72 expression levels between astrocytes in C9orf72 carriers versus healthy controls, in line with previous in vitro observations91. Intriguingly, we found distinct transcriptional profiles in astrocytes derived from sALS and C9-ALS cases. Although sALS astrocytes exhibited an upregulation of genes associated with a reactive state, C9-ALS astrocytes manifested increased levels of homeostatic genes linked to axonal guidance, glutamate receptor function and TGFβ signaling. Supporting our observations, a recent transcriptomic study on sALS postmortem tissue showed a multifaceted astrocyte landscape, with a wide variety of transcriptional states39. However, a recent single-cell study by Li et al.82 did reveal alterations in astrocytes from C9orf72 carriers with FTD and ALS, demonstrating increased activation and structural remodeling. Specifically, increased astrocyte reactivity was found in the prefrontal cortex of patients with C9-ALS/FTD. Moreover, a distinct pattern of transcriptome dysregulation was found in C9-ALS versus C9-FTD, suggesting a possible disease-specific effect of C9orf72 HRE on astrocytes82.

Given that the molecular mechanisms governing the transcriptional changes in both microglia and astrocytes are yet unclear, we sought to construct a ligand−receptor pair interaction map for both C9-ALS and sALS glia. We found several interaction partners that are predicted to be altered, possibly reflecting and altered microglia−astrocyte cellular crosstalk that could potentially contribute to disease. Targeting molecular processes in glial cells was recently successful in SOD1G93A mice, demonstrating the potential of investigating such pathways for new therapeutic opportunities62. Interestingly, beyond the reactive changes that we observed in astrocytes, additional layers of complexity must be considered, as these cells are highly heterogeneous across the CNS. Here we report transcriptomic differences in astrocytes in the spinal cord versus the cortex, with specific subsets of spinal astrocytes showing a higher baseline gene expression of C9-ALS-associated as well as sALS-associated markers. This indicates that astrocyte regional diversity may partially contribute to the increased susceptibility of the spinal cord in ALS and poses new interesting questions as to whether glial regional heterogeneity may serve as a susceptibility factor in neurodegeneration.

In summary, our study indicates that C9orf72 HRE results in reduced C9orf72 expression levels in the microglia and a subsequent reduction in their response to disease, consistent with deficits in phagocytic and lysosomal pathways. We hypothesize that this leads to a defective general glial response that extends to astrocytes, hindering a coordinated response that increases the risk for developing ALS.

This study was conducted in accordance with all relevant ethical regulations and guidelines. The postmortem study protocol was reviewed and approved by the University Hospitals Leuven (UZ Leuven), Netherlands Brain Bank and the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona−d'Investgiacions Biomédiques August Pi I Sunyer (HCB-IDIBAPS) under approval numbers S65097, S59292 and S60803. All human material was collected from donors from whom a written informed consent for a brain autopsy and the use of the material and clinical information for research purposes was obtained by UZ Leuven. All animal experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with protocols approved by the Ethical Committee for Laboratory Animals at the University of Antwerp (ethical file 2021-13), in compliance with national and European Union regulations.

The brain and spinal cord samples were obtained from the Department of Pathology at UZ Leuven, the Netherlands Brain Bank, the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, the HCB and the IDIBAPS. Healthy controls are described as individuals without neurological diseases, excluding hematological and oncological conditions. Samples were obtained prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on demographic data can be found in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

One milliliter of TriPure per 50−100 mg of postmortem tissue was added into a vial containing beads and postmortem tissue. The sample was homogenized in a tissue homogenizer (Magnalyser) for 3 × 30 seconds at 3,970g. The homogenate was transferred to a new RNase-free tube. Then, 200 µl of chloroform (=1/5 volume of TriPure) was added. The sample was mixed by inversion for 15 seconds and incubated at room temperature for 2−10 minutes. The samples were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 13,528g and 4 °C. Three phases became visible: an aqueous phase (colorless) containing RNA, which was transferred to a new RNase-free tube; an interphase (white color) containing DNA; and an organic phase (red color) containing protein. Only in case of low expected yields of RNA, 1 µl of glycogen was added and precipitated with 500 µl of isopropanol (=1/2 volume of TriPure). The sample was mixed by inversion for 15 seconds, incubated at room temperature for 5−10 minutes and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13,528g and 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed with 1 ml of 75% EtOH and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 13,528g and 4 °C. The supernatant was again discarded, and, after drying of the pellet, RNase-free water was added. Per sample, 1 µg of total RNA was used as input. RNA concentration and purity were determined spectrophotometrically using a NanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies), and RNA integrity was assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).

To optimize nuclei isolation96, starting from 50 mg of tissue, we tested the standard nuclei isolation protocol by Habib et al.97, Tween with salts and Tris (TST)96 and Soma-seq98. We observed marginal advantages using the Soma-seq protocol (Extended Data Fig. 1b) and proceeded with it for the following experiments.

The tissue was transferred immediately into a homogenizer containing 1 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (320 mM sucrose, 5 mM CaCl2, 3 mM Mg(OAc)2, 10 mM Tris 7.8, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-360, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol with 5 µl of RNasin Plus). Tissues were homogenized with 10 manual gentle strokes (pestle A) plus 10 manual gentle strokes (pestle B). The homogenate was filtered through 70-µm cell mesh and strainer and washed with 1.65 ml of homogenization buffer to a final volume of 2.65 ml. The nuclei suspension was supplemented with 2.65 ml of gradient medium (5 mM CaCl2, 50% OptiPrep, 3 mM Mg(OAc)2, 10 mM Tris 7.8, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol). A 29% cushion was prepared by diluting OptiPrep with OptiPrep Diluent Medium (150 mM KCl, 30 mM MgCl2, 60 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 250 mM sucrose). The nuclei suspension in the homogenization buffer + gradient medium mix was then layered over the 29% cushion and ultracentrifuged in an SW 41 Ti Swinging-Bucket Rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 5,574g and 4 °C for 30 minutes. The upper supernatant and lower supernatant were removed, respectively, with a Pasteur pipette and a P200 micropipette. Nuclei were resuspended in 50 µl of resuspension buffer (PBS, 1% BSA) and transferred to a new tube. Resuspended nuclei were counted using a LUNA dual fluorescence cell counter (Logos Biosystems).

The tissue was transferred immediately into a homogenizer containing 1 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (146 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris 7.5, 1 mM CaCl2, 21 mM MgCl2, 0.03% Tween 20, 1% BSA, 25 mM KCl, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5× cOmplete Protease Inhibitor (Roche), 0.2 U µl−1 RNasin Plus Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega)). The tissue was homogenized with 15 gentle strokes with a pestle and douncer. The resulting nuclei suspension was filtered using a 40-µm cell strainer. The filtrate was transferred into a low binding tube and centrifuged at 500g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended thoroughly in 1 ml of homogenization buffer without Tween (146 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris 7.5, 1 mM CaCl2, 21 mM MgCl2, 1% BSA, 25 mM KCl, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5× cOmplete Protease Inhibitor (Roche), 0.2 U µl−1 RNasin Plus Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega)) and transferred to a 15-ml Falcon. An additional 1.65 ml of homogenization buffer without Tween buffer was added to a final volume of 2.65 ml. The rest of the protocol for density centrifugation and nuclei enrichment was performed as in the standard protocol.

The frozen tissue was immediately transferred into a homogenizer containing of 1 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 25 mM KCl, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5× cOmpleteProtease Inhibitor (Roche), 0.2 U µl−1 RNasin Plus Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega)). The tissue was homogenized with 15 gentle strokes with a pestle and douncer. The nuclei suspension was filtered using a 70 -µm cell strainer. The filtrate was transferred into a low binding tube and centrifuged at 400g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended thoroughly in 1 ml of homogenization buffer and transferred to a 15-ml Falcon. An additional 1.65 ml of homogenization buffer was added to a final volume of 2.65 ml. The density centrifugation and nuclei enrichment were performed as in the standard nuclei isolation protocol.

We performed snRNA-seq of spinal cord and motor cortex from healthy controls and from patients with C9-ALS and sALS and compared the three methods for number of reads, genes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Both the TST and Soma-seq protocols performed well (Extended Data Fig. 1b). All following experiments followed the Soma-seq method.

cDNA libraries for the scRNA-seq were prepared using 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3' Kit version 3.1 NextGEM chemistry (10x Genomics). The cell count and the viability of the samples were assessed using a LUNA dual fluorescence cell counter (Logos Biosystems) and loaded to the Chromium at a targeted nuclei recovery of 6,000 nuclei per sample. Samples (up to three) were pooled in equal numbers and loaded to a single 10x reaction. scRNA-seq libraries were prepared using the manufacturerʼs recommendations (Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits version 3.1 user guide; CG000204 Rev D), and, at the different checkpoints, the library quality was accessed using a Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). cDNA libraries were sequenced with an expected coverage of 50,000 reads per cell on Illumina's NovaSeq 6000 platform using paired-end sequencing workflow and with recommended 10x version 3.1 read parameters (28-8-0-91 cycles). Library preparation took place in the Fall of 2020.

Raw sequencing data were demultiplexed using the Cell Ranger (5.0.1) mkfastq command; FASTQ files were processed using Cell Ranger count with the –include-introns enabled and using the GRCh38-2020-A index provided by 10x Genomics. Cells passing the default Cell Ranger filter were kept for subsequent analyses. Samples that were multiplexed for droplet generation were demultiplexed into patient-specific matrices. First, a library of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in the general population identified by the 1000 Genomes Project was obtained from http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk specifically; files ALL.chr(1-22,X,Y)_GRCh38_sites.20170504.vcf.gz were obtained and merged into a single vcf file. Chromosomes were renamed to match the scheme used in the index provided by 10x Genomics using BCFTools annotate. SNPs were filtered to remove rare variants and to only include SNPs in the regions of the genome included in the Cell Ranger index using BCFTools filter with the parameters –regions-file (with a BED file containing the abovementioned regions) and -i ‘INFO/AF[0] < 0.90 & & INFO/AF[0] > 0.10'. This final vcf file was used to run freemuxlet from the popscle package (https://github.com/statgen/popscle) with default parameters other than nsample = 2 and using the tools from 7.0 to speed up computation. We used verifyBamID (http://griffan.github.io/VerifyBamID/) to compare the freemuxlet genotype to the bulk RNA-seq data of patient; the highest-scoring match was used to assign patient labels to freemuxlet clusters.

Libraries were individually processed using Scanpy 1.7.2 (ref. 99). First, patient labels and associated metadata were added to the cells, any doublets identified by freemuxlet being removed. Next, scrublet was used to remove remaining identifiable doublets (threshold = 0.25), and samples were combined into two datasets based on their tissue of origin: motor cortex and spinal cord. Nuclei with fewer than 250 genes or more than 5% of total counts associated with mitochondrial genes were removed. The resulting matrices were normalized (to 10,000 counts) and log transformed, and highly variable genes were identified using default parameters. Number of UMIs and percentage of mitochondrial reads were regressed out, and the data were scaled to a maximum of 10. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensions of the data; Harmony100 was used to integrate the PCA components based on the ‘Patient' batch key; and the pcacv workflow from vsn-pipelines (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3703108) was then used to determine the number of principal components to continue with (76 for motor cortex and 82 for spinal cord). Neighborhood embedding, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) were calculated using the number of principal components listed above, and clusters were identified at various resolutions (0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0) using the Leiden algorithm. The resulting data were exported to a loom file and uploaded to SCope; cell type annotations were provided via SCope by experts based on marker gene expression. All plots were generated with ggplot2 (version 3.3.5) in R version 4.1.2.

To investigate microglia subsets, we isolated microglia nuclei from both the motor cortex and spinal cord and merged them using Seurat (version 4.1.0) under R version 4.1.2 (ref. 101). The data were log normalized, and the highest variable genes were identified, followed by scaling of the data and PCA. The data were batch corrected with Harmony (version 0.1.0) based on patient identifiers and location. Cells were clustered using the first 20 principal components, and UMAP plots were generated with standard methods. Five other cell subsets were identified (peripheral macrophages n = 898, synaptosomes n = 821, oligodendrocytes n = 200 and proliferating cells n = 143). The clusters contained low expression of microglia markers CXCR3 and P2RY12 with subset-specific markers for peripheral macrophages (CD163, MRC1, F13A1), oligodendrocytes (MBP, SHROOM4, PLP1, PCDH9, EDIL3) and synaptosomes/astrocytes (SNAP25, RORA, DPP10, ROBO2, LSAMP). The oligodendrocytes were most likely doublets of microglia and oligodendrocytes, the same for the synaptosomes. Proliferating cells (TOP2A, MIK67, MELK, KIF11) were excluded from final analysis. Next, we extracted the astrocytes (n = 23,483) from the spinal cord and motor cortex and re-identified the astrocyte population. Apart from astrocytes, two other clusters were identified: one of oligodendrocytes n = 500 cells (ELMO1, IL1RAPL1, SLC24A2, SHROOM4) and one with doublet/low-quality n = 348 cells (PCLO, WARS, RUNX1), the latter being a cluster with markers of multiple cell types that could not be confidently annotated. All plots were generated with ggplot2 (version 3.3.5) in R version 4.1.2.

Individual libraries were extracted from GSE163122, and nuclei with at least 250 features and features in at least three cells were retained. Scrublet was used to remove doublets as described previously. Nuclei with a number of features higher or lower than mean ±2s.d. and more than 5% mitochondrial transcripts were excluded. All libraries were integrated, resulting in a total of 402,569 nuclei. Microglia and astrocytes were extracted individually and integrated with the microglia and astrocytes from the ALS cohort using Seurat r-PCA in R version 4.1.2.

Differential expression testing was performed using DESeq2 in Seurat FindMarkers. Genes with adjusted P < 0.05 and log2 fold change ± 0.20 were considered as differentially expressed. Heatmaps were generated with ComplexHeatmap_2.10.0.

Specific microglia functions were assessed by extracting human-specific genes (taxon: 9606), three Gene Ontology terms (GO:0005764, GO:0006954 and GO:006906) and one pathway in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (HSA00190).

Matrices for microglia and astrocytes were extracted from each tissue and were used to perform WGCNA102 to identify modules of co-expressed genes using the hdWGCNA package (version 0.1.1.9005)103. Genes were filtered to include only those expressed within at least 5% of the cells within a dataset using the SetupForWGCNA function, and MetacellsByGroups was used to create metacells by the combination of ALS status, patient and library of origin using values of 25 for the number of cells to be combined and a maximum number of shared cells of 10. Finally, metacells were normalized using NormalizeMetacells. Next, the groups of interest (healthy, sALS and C9-ALS) were selected to build the co-expression network using SetDatExpr, and TestSoftPowers was used per dataset to select a soft threshold (Spinal Cord – Astrocytes: 5, Spinal Cord – Microglia: 7, Motor Cortex – Astrocytes: 5, Motor Cortex – Microglia: 4). ConstructNetwork was used with default parameters to generate the co-expression networks and modules. Finally, module eigengenes were corrected for between-patient batch effects using Harmony.

To identify WGCNA genes modules that may be correlated with ALS status, a one-way ANOVA (via the scipy Python package version 1.7.3) was performed using the module eigengene values for each module across all datasets. P values across all tests were corrected using Benjamini−Hochberg correction (via the statsmodels Python package version 0.12.2). A Tukey honestly significant difference test was then performed (also using statsmodels) on modules discovered in the ANOVA as having at least one significantly different mean, with the goal of identifying the specific statuses that are different.

Gene Ontology enrichment was performed using the g:OSt functionality of gProfiler104 via the gprofiler-official Python package (version 1.0.0).

Differential abundance testing was performed using MiloR (2.0.0) in R version 4.4.1 (ref. 24). Microglia and astrocytes were randomly downsampled to equal numbers of nuclei per each location/patient. Milo was run with a proportion of 0.2 as input sample and k = 15 and d = 15 as well as a false discovery rate set of 0.1. The differences in regional abundance in neighborhoods were tested as a comparison of the brain versus spinal cord.

The FASTQ files were aligned by Cell Ranger (version 7.1.0) against the human genome database (GRCh38, Ensembl 98, refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A). Filtered count matrices were imported in R (version 4.4.0) for data analysis. The datasets were analyzed using the Seurat R package (version 5.1.0). Cells were demultiplexed with HTODemux with positive.quantile = 0.99. Subsequently, low-quality cells (thresholds defined by is.Outlier in scuttle 1.14.0, with high and/or low library size; a high percentage of reads mapping to mitochondrial genes; or cells with a low number of detected genes) were removed from each individual library. For one of the libraries, the high nCount threshold was determined to be 33,306; this threshold was adjusted to 26,439, aligning it with the maximum value observed in the other libraries. Individual libraries were processed with SCTransform with the parameters layer = ‘counts' and vst.flavor = ‘v2'. PCA was calculated on the ‘SCT' assay. Layers were integrated with rPCA on the SCTransformed data. Standard clustering analysis was performed in Seurat on the integrated dataset—that is, FindNeighbors() and FindClusters with resolution parameter set to 0.1 and, finally, RunUMAP(). Microglia (n = 21,826), proliferating microglia (n = 425), macrophages (n = 2,591) and doublets (n = 522) were assigned. Subsequent analysis was performed on microglia alone. Cells were clustered using the first 26 principal components, and UMAP plots were generated with Seurat standard methods. Differentially expressed genes were calculated with Seurat's FindMarkers using default settings. Seurat version 4 fold changes were calculated according to Seurat version 4. Plots were generated in R version 4.4.2 with ggplot2 version 3.5.1.

Microglia−astrocyte communication was assessed with CellChat (version 1.5.0)57 in R version 4.1.2. Microglia and astrocytes transcriptomes were extracted from the spinal cord and combined to generate a CellChat object per patient group using CellchatDB.human. Overexpressed genes and interactions were detected with default settings before computing and filtering the communication probabilities and calculating centrality scores. CellChat objects of the different patient groups were merged to assess differences in communication patterns with mergeCellChat. For the identification of pairwise changes, computeNetSimilarityPairwise was used. Average expression of the ligands and receptors was extracted from Seurat (version 5.1.0) with AverageExpression. Plots were generated in R version 4.4.2 with ggplot2 version 3.5.1.

Quantification of CTSD levels was performed on brain lysates from healthy controls, C9-ALS cases and sALS cases. Protein extraction was carried out by transferring 50 mg of tissue into 1.5-ml RNase-free microfuge tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM12400). Next, 0.5 ml of 2% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) containing TBS and protease inhibitor (cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail; Sigma-Aldrich, 1836170001) was added. Each sample was mechanically homogenized by using pellet pestles (Sigma-Aldrich, Z359971) under a laminar flow without putting the samples on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 20,000g for 30 minutes at room temperature. The supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5-ml RNase-free microfuge tube, and the pellet was discarded. Protein quantification was performed on the supernatant using a Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23235) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, samples were supplemented with SDS containing reducing sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 39000), boiled for 10 minutes at 95 °C and loaded into 4–20% precast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, 4568094). After electrophoresis (100 V, 1.5 hours), the gel was transferred onto a 0.2-µm PVDF membrane (trans-blot turbo transfer pack; Bio-Rad, 1704156) for 10 minutes at 1.5 Å. After transfer, the membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dried milk for 1 hour at room temperature (Sigma-Aldrich, M7409-1BTL) diluted in TBS (Sigma-Aldrich, T5912-1L) with Tween (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379-500ML) (TBST). We incubated the membrane with anti-CTSD (1/1,000; Abcam, ab75852) and GAPDH (1/1,000; Cell Signaling Technology, 2118) and imaged them with an ImageQuant LAS 4000 Biomolecular Imager (GE Healthcare). Protein bands were quantified with ImageQuant TL version 7.0 software (Cytiva). Samples (n = 2 healthy controls, n = 5 patients with C9-ALS and n = 5 patients with sALS) were run in parallel across two independent membranes.

The C9orf72 HRE iPSC lines used (C9-1 and C9-2 and corresponding isogenic controls used for in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively) were previously generated and characterized37. The C9KO line was generated using a SYNTHEGO multi-guide system targeting exon 2 of the C9orf72 gene, as described in ref. 38. IPSC lines were cultured on 0.5 mg ml−1 growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning) with mTeSR 1 basal medium, supplemented with mTeSR 1 5× supplement (STEMCELL Technologies), 100 U ml−1 penicillin−streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 100 U ml−1 RevitaCell (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The experiments were performed under ethical approval 2021-1705 by the Antwerp University Hospital.

Microglia progenitors were produced as previously described in Fattorelli et al.35. At day 25 or day 32 of the microglial differentiation protocols, cells were plated in TIC medium and allowed to mature into microglial-like cells for 10 days. Medium change was performed every 2 days. TIC medium consisted of DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 5 µg ml−1 N-acetyl-L-cysteine (Merck), insulin (1:2,000) (Merck), 100 µg ml−1 apo-transferrin (Merck), 100 ng ml−1 sodium selenite (Merck), 1.5 µg ml−1 cholesterol (Merck), 1 µg ml−1 heparan sulphate (Merck), 50 ng ml−1 M-CSF, 50 ng ml−1 IL-34 (STEMCELL Technologies), 25 ng ml−1 TGFβ (STEMCELL Technologies) and 10 ng ml−1 CX3CL1 (STEMCELL Technologies). For in vitro experiments, no statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications21,70. When sample size allowed, data were assessed for normality. Data were normally distributed unless otherwise stated.

Cells were harvested and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, 74004), and sequencing was performed by BGI Genomics. The analysis was performed in-house with a standardized pipeline integrated in GenomeComb105. The pipeline used fastq-mcf for adapter clipping. Reads were aligned to the hg38 genome reference106 using STAR107 in two-pass mode, and the resulting SAM file was converted to CRAM using SAMtools108. BAM files were sorted109,110, and, at the initial stage, positions with a coverage <8 or a genotype quality score <25 were considered unsequenced. Gene counts were obtained using RNA-SeQC111. The matrix with gene counts was read into R. Genes with zero count in all samples were removed. Raw gene counts were normalized using size factors estimated via the median ratio method described by Anders and Huber112 and subsequently transformed using variance stabilizing transformation (VST) from the DESeq2 package (version 1.44.0) with blind = TRUE to stabilize variance across the mean113. Plots were generated in R version 4.4.2 with ComplexHeatmap version 2.22.0.

We xenotransplanted microglial progenitors from C9KO, CTRL, C9-HRE and C9-ISO into the brain of Rag2−/−Il2g−/−hCSF1KI immunodeficient mice (male and female), as described in Fattorelli et al.35. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications26. We transplanted approximately 500,000 cells per mouse. We used Total-Seq A hashing antibodies (BioLegend) to demultiplex individual mouse replicates. Mice were provided with unrestricted access to food and water and kept in groups of 2−5 under a 14-hour light/10-hour dark cycle at a temperature of 21 °C and a relative humidity of 32%.

At 3 months (C9-HRE and C9-ISO) or 6 months (CTRL and C9KO) of age, xenotransplanted mice were euthanized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital and immediately perfused with ice-cold 1× DPBS (Gibco, 14190-144) supplemented with 5 U of heparin (LEO). After perfusion, one brain hemisphere per mouse was placed in FACS buffer (1× DPBS, 2% FCS, 2 mM EDTA) + 5 µM actinomycin D (ActD; Sigma-Aldrich, A1410-5MG) for transcriptomics. Brains were dissociated using Miltenyi Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit P (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-092-628) supplemented with 5 µM ActD. Samples were then passed through a 70-µm strainer (BD2 Falcon), washed in 10 ml of ice-cold FACS buffer with 5 µM ActD and spun at 300g for 15 minutes at 4 °C. ActD was included during tissue collection and enzymatic dissociation to stop transcriptional activity, and it was stopped after the myelin removal step to minimize toxicity from prolonged exposure. After dissociation, myelin was removed using 30% isotonic Percoll (GE Healthcare, 17-5445-02) solution. Cells resuspended in Percoll were centrifuged at 300g for 15 minutes at 4 °C. After centrifugation, layers of myelin and cellular debris were discarded, and FC receptors were blocked in FcR blocking solution (1:10; Miltenyi Biotec, 130-092-575) in cold FACS buffer for 10 minutes at 4 °C. Cells were then washed in 5 ml of FACS buffer, pelleted and incubated with the following antibodies: PE-Pan-CD11b (1:100; Miltenyi Biotec, 130-113-806), BV421-mCD45 (1:100; BD Biosciences, 563890), APC-hCD45 (1:50; BD Biosciences, 555485), Total-Seq A cell hashing antibodies (1:500; BioLegend) and viability dye (1:2,000; eFluor 780; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 65-0865-14), in cold FACS buffer for 30 minutes at 4 °C. Cells were then washed, pelleted down and resuspended in 500 µl of FACS buffer. Cells were passed through a 35-µm strainer before sorting and loaded into the input chamber of a MACSQuant Tyto Cartridge. Human cells were sorted based on CD11b and hCD45 expression at 4 °C (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

For scRNA-seq, 15,000–20,000 human microglia (CD11b+hCD45+) from each mouse were sorted on a MACSQuant Tyto and diluted to a final concentration of 1,000 cells per microliter. In total, 2,000 human microglia per mouse were pooled and loaded onto a Chromium Next GEM Chip G (PN no. 2000120). The DNA libraries were generated following the manufacturer's instructions (CG000315 Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits version 3.1 Dual Index). Hashtag oligo libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (BioLegend, Total-Seq A Antibodies and Cell Hashing with 10x Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit version 3 3.1 Protocol) using 16 cycles for the index polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of five libraries were sequenced, targeting a 90% mRNA and 10% hashtag oligo library (50,000 reads per cell), on a DNBSEQ-G400 platform following the 10x Genomics workflow. Libraries were sequenced by BGI Genomics.

Cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15−20 minutes and washed three times, 5 minutes, with PBS. Permeabilization was performed for 20 minutes at room temperature, using permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS). Samples were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature in blocking solution containing 5% normal donkey serum (NDS) (Bio-Connect) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Next, the cells were incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% NDS at 4 °C overnight. The cells were rinsed three times, 5 minutes, with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with the secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. The cells were washed three times, 5 minutes, with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and stained for 20 minutes at room temperature with Hoechst (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS and mounted on Superfrost Plus Adhesion Microscope Slides (Epredia) using Dako Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Agilent). The cells were visualized under an LSM 700 confocal laser scanning microscope or with a Zeiss LSM 900 with Airyscan 2, using ZEN software (Zeiss). Images were analyzed, formatted and quantified with ImageJ software (Cell Counter plugin). Anti-Iba1 (Abcam, ab5076, 1:500, goat), anti-CTSD (Abcam, ab75852, 1:500, rabbit), Lamp1 (DSHB, ab2296838, 1:200, mouse), EEA1 (SYSY, 237002, rabbit, 1:100) and Rab7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PA5-52369, rabbit, 1:100) primary antibodies were used. As secondary antibodies, donkey anti-goat (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A32758, 1:1,000), donkey anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A31573, 1:1,000, and Biotium, 20802, 1:500) and donkey anti-mouse (Biotium, 20015, 1:500) were used.

For expansion microscopy, a protocol based on Chozinski et al.112 was used. Microglia progenitor cells were plated in a 24-well plate on 12-mm glass coverslips (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11708701). The cells were differentiated for 10 days and fixed for 10 minutes at room temperature with a solution containing 3.2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde, followed by a wash with PBS. Next, the cells were reduced for 5 minutes at room temperature using 10 mM NaBH4 (Merck). Cells were washed three times for 5 minutes with PBS. After fixation, cells were blocked with normal serum (1:500) and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS-T (PBS with 0.02% Triton X-100 and 0.5% BSA) for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Incubation with primary antibodies was performed in PBS-T for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing steps (four for 5 minutes and one for 30 minutes), samples were incubated with secondary antibody diluted in PBS-T for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C and washed twice in PBS-T for 5 minutes and three times in PBS for 5 minutes. Nuclear staining with Hoechst was performed for 5 minutes in 1/20,000 dilution, followed by four washes in PBS for 5 minutes. Samples were then treated with an anchoring solution (0.25% glutaraldehyde in PBS) for 10 minutes at room temperature and washed three times in PBS. Next, a solution made of monomer solution (1× PBS, 2 M NaCl, 2.5% acrylamide (Bio-Rad, 1610140), 0.15% bisacrylamide (Bio-Rad, 1610142), 8.625% sodium acrylate (Sigma-Aldrich, 408220), 0.2% ammonium persulfate (APS) solution, 0.2% TEMED (ChemCruz, sc-29111)) was added to the samples for 1 hour at 37 °C. After the polymerization of the gel, a digestion step was performed. Digestion mix was made of 1× TE, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.8 M guanidinium hydrochlodride and 8 U ml−1 proteinase K. Samples were incubated with digestion mix for 30 minutes at 37 °C. The gel was then expanded using high-purity water, which was replaced every 15−30 minutes as the gel expanded for typically 45−90 minutes. The gel was then cut to fit a WillCo dish (50 mm), and a 2% agar solution (UltraPure LMP Agarose; Invitrogen, 16520-050) was added to fill the dish completely. Once the agar solidified, samples were stored at 4 °C until processing. The cells were visualized under an LSM 700 confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss) at a magnification of ×63 using a water immersion C-Apochromat 1.2 W Korr ×63 objective UV-VIS-IR (Zeiss) and imaged with ZEN software (Zeiss).

For TEM experiments, microglia progenitor cells were plated in a 24-well plate on glass coverslips. Cells were differentiated for 10 days and then fixed using a solution containing a 1:1 dilution of medium and fixative (4% formaldehyde (ProSciTech) and 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Merck)) dissolved in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (Merck) for 10 minutes, followed by 1-hour incubation with fixative only. Both incubations were performed at room temperature on a shaking plate. After fixation, the cells were washed three times for 30 minutes with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. Cells were post-fixed in 1% OsO4 (Aurion, 19150) at 4 °C overnight on a shaking plate. After washing in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, cells were left for 2 hours in 1% uranyl acetate at 4 °C on a shaking plate. Cells were then dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (7%, 15%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 95%, 100% ethanol). Dehydration was followed by embedding in Spurr's resin for 8 hours. The polymerization was performed at 70 °C overnight. The cells were visualized under a Jeol JEM-1400plus TEM microscope using TEM Center software (Jeol). The captured images were analyzed using Ilastik (Anna Kreshuk's laboratory at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory) by building a machine learning classifier (pixel classification workflow) that segments (1) background (no cells), (2) late-endosomal/lysosomal and (3) cytoplasmic/nuclear regions. The resulting binary masks were used to extract the fraction of late-endosomal/lysosomal pixels to all non-background pixels per image (Fig. 4g). In Extended Data Fig. 6f, images were quantified with ImageJ software (Cell Counter plugin).

For the live-cell imaging, the microglia progenitor cells harvested at days 25 and 32 were plated in an eight-well glass chamber slide (ibidi) in TIC medium (50,000 cells per well) for 10 days. At day 10, pHrodo Green E. coli BioParticles (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P35366, 20×) were added to the iPSC microglia. pHrodo particles are designed to have minimal fluorescence under neutral pH and become increasingly fluorescent in an acidic environment. The plate was loaded into a Zeiss Axiovert imaging system, and the cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to monitor the real-time uptake and degradation of pHrodo BioParticles. The cells were imaged using a ×20 objective at an interval of 15 minutes for 15 hours (900 minutes). To determine the phagocytic and degradation index of each genotype (C9KO and CTRL), images were analyzed using ImageJ. Raw.zvi files containing three-slice z stacks (acquired during imaging) were first processed to generate a maximum intensity projection. In each projection, individual cells were segmented to delineate the regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to cell areas. Next, the green fluorescence emitted by pHrodo-labeled particles was quantified for each ROI. Background intensity was subtracted from the integrated density measurements and ROI areas. Finally, the summed background-corrected integrated green fluorescence values for each well were calculated and further plotted using RStudio. The median of the pHrodo background-subtracted intensity was first calculated to summarize intra-well measurements (n = 3 images per well) per each timepoint. These values were then further aggregated by computing the median across wells (n = 3 wells for each independent replicate). For visualization, the processed data from the different individual replicates (n = 6 per genotype) were plotted using ggplot2, with geom_smooth() applied to depict temporal trends. This function fits a locally smoothed curve (LOESS) to the data (Fig. 4j).

At days 25 and 32, microglia progenitors were plated in a 12-well plate on glass coverslips in TIC medium (500,000 cells per well). After 10 days, cells were incubated either for 1 hour at 37 °C with pHrodo Green E. coli BioParticles (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P35366, 20×) or for 3 hours at 37 °C with β-amyloid (1−42, HiLyte Fluor 488-labeled, AS-60479-01, Anaspec, 2 µM). After three washes with DPBS (1×, Thermo Fisher Scientific), cells were incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C with 500 µl of viability dye (e780; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 65-0865-14) in 2000 µl of Accutase. After 15 minutes, the cells were collected in 3.5 ml of MACS buffer (0.5% BSA (Miltenyi Biotec) in 1× DPBS) and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 300g. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of MACS buffer and transferred to an Eppendorf tube and placed on ice. The phagocytic activity of the cells was measured as median fluorescence intensity with a MACSQuant10 analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec) using MACSQuantify software (Miltenyi Biotec). The obtained data were analyzed by FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).

Metrics details

Earth's bulk composition has elemental and isotopic characteristics that cannot be fully reconciled with a mixture of known primitive meteorite compositions1,2,3. One potential explanation for this is that the proto-Earth accreted materials with isotopic signatures distinct from those accreted after the Moon-forming giant impact. Here we report high-precision mass-independent potassium isotopic measurements from thermal ionization mass spectrometry of terrestrial rocks from various ancient and modern sources in the crust and mantle that we argue are consistent with this explanation. Specifically, we found that some mafic Archaean rocks derived from the Hadean–Eoarchaean mantle (including samples from Isua, Nuvvuagittuq and the Kaapvaal Craton) and certain modern ocean island basalts (from La Réunion Island and Kama'ehuakanaloa volcano, Hawaii) exhibit an average 40K deficit of 65 parts per million compared to all other terrestrial samples analysed. The deficit distinguishes these samples from the bulk silicate Earth and any known meteorite group and cannot result from magmatic processes. Therefore, we propose this 40K deficit represents primitive proto-Earth mantle domains that largely escaped mantle mixing after the giant impact and exist in the present-day deep mantle, contributing to some modern hotspot volcanism.

Forty-five repeated measurements of K standard yielded an ε40K two standard deviation (2 SD) of 0.28.

Source data

(a) SiO2 vs. total alkali (Na2O + K2O) (b) SiO2 vs. K2O. Data are from49. Blue circles denote the samples measured for K isotopic composition in this study. Sample RU0709, which shows no resolvable K anomaly, has the highest K2O content (0.73%) among the suite of La Réunion samples and plots above the 95% confidence interval of the correlation, suggesting a likely contamination with crustal K.

Source data

The labeled percentage indicates the addition amount of crustal materials in the mixture. The blue dashed lines mark the resolvability of 40K anomaly (ε40K = ± 0.3) and the shaded area indicates no resolvable 40K anomaly. The ε40K values of OIB and crustal materials used for the mixing curve are -0.6 ± 0.1 and 0, respectively. The K2O concentrations of OIB and crustal materials are assumed to be 0.35% and 2%, respectively. The mixing curve shows that an OIB sample contaminated with >15% crustal materials would result in ε40K values unresolvable from the modern mantle.

Source data

Elevated 234U/238U and 86Sr/87Sr ratios indicate seawater alteration and contamination with hydrothermally altered rocks, respectively. The most pristine sample 6K491-2 shows a resolvable K isotopic anomaly. In contrast, samples 1804-1 and 1803-16 do not show resolvable K isotopic anomalies, which may reflect the overprint of the original mantle K during alteration and crustal contamination.

In the early universe, a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, the first stars emerged from vast, untouched clouds of hydrogen and helium. Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) suggest that some of these early stars may have been unlike the familiar (nuclear fusion-powered) stars that astronomers have studied for centuries. A new study led by Cosmin Ilie of Colgate University, together with Shafaat Mahmud (Colgate '26), Jillian Paulin (Colgate '23) at the University of Pennsylvania, and Katherine Freese at The University of Texas at Austin, has identified four extremely distant objects whose appearance and spectral signatures match what scientists expect from supermassive dark stars.

"Supermassive dark stars are extremely bright, giant, yet puffy clouds made primarily out of hydrogen and helium, which are supported against gravitational collapse by the minute amounts of self-annihilating dark matter inside them," Ilie said. Supermassive dark stars and their black hole remnants could be key to solving two recent astronomical puzzles: i. the larger than expected extremely bright, yet compact, very distant galaxies observed with JWST, and ii. the origin of the supermassive black holes powering the most distant quasars observed.

Katherine Freese first proposed the idea of dark stars with Doug Spolyar and Paolo Gondolo, publishing their initial peer-reviewed paper on the concept in Physical Review Letters in 2008. That study outlined how dark stars might grow and eventually collapse into supermassive black holes in the early universe. In 2010, Freese, Ilie, Spolyar, and their collaborators expanded on the theory in The Astrophysical Journal, describing two possible processes that could allow dark stars to reach immense sizes and predicting that they could seed the black holes found in the earliest quasars known to exist.

Dark matter is thought to make up roughly a quarter of the universe, yet its nature remains one of science's greatest mysteries. Researchers believe it is composed of a still-undetected type of elementary particle. Decades of experiments have searched for these particles, but so far without success. One leading possibility involves Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). When two WIMPs collide, they are expected to annihilate each other, releasing energy that could heat collapsing hydrogen clouds and cause them to shine as brilliant dark stars.

Conditions a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, within dense regions called dark matter halos, appear to have been ideal for forming such stars. These regions are also where the first generation of normal stars was expected to appear.

"For the first time we have identified spectroscopic supermassive dark star candidates in JWST, including the earliest objects at redshift 14, only 300 Myr after the Big Bang," said Freese, the Jeff and Gail Kodosky Endowed Chair in Physics and director of the Weinberg Institute and Texas Center for Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics at UT Austin. "Weighing a million times as much as the Sun, such early dark stars are important not only in teaching us about dark matter but also as precursors to the early supermassive black holes seen in JWST that are otherwise so difficult to explain."

In a 2023 PNAS study by Ilie, Paulin, and Freese, the first supermassive dark star candidates (JADES-GS-z13-0, JADES-GS-z12-0, and JADES-GS-z11-0) were identified using photometric data from JWST's NIRCam instrument. Since then, spectra from JWST's NIRSpec instrument became available for those, and a few other extremely distant objects. The team, which now also includes Shafaat Mahmud analyzed the spectra and morphology of four of the most distant objects ever observed (including two candidates from the 2023 study): JADES-GS-z14-0, JADES-GS-z14-1, JADES-GS-13-0, and JADES-GS-z11-0 and found that each of them is consistent with a supermassive dark star interpretation.

JADES-GS-z14-1 is not resolved, meaning it is consistent with a point source, such as a very distant supermassive star would be. The other three are extremely compact, and can be modeled by supermassive dark stars powering a nebula (i.e. ionized H and He gas surrounding the star). Each of the four objects analyzed in this study is also consistent with a galaxy interpretation, as shown in the literature. Dark stars have a smoking gun signature, an absorption feature at 1640 Angstrom, due to the large amounts of singly ionized helium in their atmospheres. And in fact, one of the four objects analyzed shows signs of this feature.

"One of the most exciting moments during this research was when we found the 1640 Angstrom absorption dip in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0. While the signal to noise ratio of this feature is relatively low (S/N~2), it is for the first time we found a potential smoking gun signature of a dark star. Which, in itself, is remarkable," Ilie said.

Astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) measured the spectrum of the same object, revealing the presence of oxygen, via a nebular emission line. Researchers said that if both spectral features are confirmed, the object cannot be an isolated dark star, but rather may be a dark star embedded in a metal rich environment. This could be the outcome of a merger, where a dark matter halo hosting a dark star merges with a galaxy. Alternatively, dark stars and regular stars could have formed in the same host halo, as the researchers now realized it is possible.

The identification of supermassive dark stars would open up the possibility of learning about the dark matter particle based on the observed properties of those objects, and would establish a new field of astronomy: the study of dark matter-powered stars. This published PNAS research is a key step in this direction.

No, your new “AI PC” or “Copilot+ PC” is not great at running AI—at least, not with any amount of compute that matters. The real artificial intelligence is being processed behind the closed doors of sprawling data centers that are currently springing up all around the United States. Nvidia, which became a trillion-dollar company thanks to AI, is now asking you to stick an ounce of that cloud on your desk.

Nvidia first announced its $4,000 DGX Spark AI compute machine, then dubbed “Project Digits,” during CES 2025. If you don't remember the specifics, I don't blame you. While CEO Jensen Huang was talking up the AI and graphics capabilities of the firm's RTX 50-series GPUs, Spark was being pushed elsewhere on the floor as an at-home device built specifically for high-end AI workloads. The company went so far as to call it a “new class of computer” in its announcement post—despite the fact that it's powered by a Blackwell chip, an architecture that shows up across several other Nvidia lines.

The DGX Spark is set to start shipping on Wednesday. Nvidia's usual partners like Acer, Asus, Lenovo, MSI, Dell, and Gigabyte are already lined up to put out their own versions of the device. You may not find those products when roaming the sparse halls of your nearest Best Buy, but Nvidia said it will ship them to Micro Center stores in the U.S. Nvidia made a big deal of handing out Sparks to major companies like OpenAI and Microsoft, as well as to Elon Musk at the Starbase headquarters in Texas. Maybe the billionaire founder of xAI will plug it in and use it to vibe code that AI-centric “Wokipedia” competitor—which he promised would help people “understand the universe.”

I saw both Nvidia's and Acer's versions of Spark at IFA 2025. They both looked like big, shiny mini PCs—but they weren't actually running Windows. Spark runs a customized, Ubuntu-based Linux distribution loaded with several of Nvidia's AI tools for AI image models and LLMs, or large language models. A 20-core, ARM-based CPU accompanies a Grace Blackwell GPU. If all that mattered was core count, the Spark would tie Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070, one of its lower-end GPUs.

On its face, those specs don't sound very “supercomputer.” But inside, you'll find much more performance and power draw than a typical desktop PC. The 2.65-pound Spark box holds 128GB of system memory and 4TB of storage. Its Blackwell chip promises 1 petaflop of AI compute performance, which is many times more than the 170 teraflops Nvidia's 2016 DGX-1 AI compute machine offers, though it's worth noting that flops, a measure of how fast a GPU can perform a certain number of floating point operations per second, are a rough metric. The Spark is also running at 240W, compared to the older model's 3,200W power draw.

For another loose example of AI compute capability, the DGX Spark promises to perform around 1,000 TOPS, or trillions of operations per second. Though that comes in below the RTX 5090, which boasts 3,352 TOPS, it surpasses any equivalent PC of the same size, and its memory puts it over the edge for the sake of developing and designing the next chatbot. For comparison, Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme chip is supposed to be much better for AI than its predecessor, thanks to a redesigned neural processing unit, but that can only claim 70 TOPS of AI performance. Your usual PC is still limited to running extremely low-end AI models or background AI tasks.

Oh, and all of that comes with a retail price of around $4,000. Don't worry: Nvidia doesn't expect every Joe Schmoe to buy one of these for the sake of running Windows 11 Recall. The DGX Spark is built for nascent AI developers, students, or, perhaps, curious AI dabblers who can afford to drop the equivalent of two $2,000 RTX 5090 GPUs to buy a specialized computer. Its real mission is to get more developers to create AI applications that people actually want to use—or, in Huang's words, “the next wave of breakthroughs.” Hopefully, that'll take the form of something beyond a chatbot interface promising to fix home decoration or remedy the abstract concept of loneliness.

Palmer Luckey and Mark Zuckerberg never quite cracked virtual reality headsets for consumers, but they're taking another crack at it with the US military as their new audience. On Monday, Luckey's military tech company Anduril announced its AI-powered mixed reality system EagleEye, which will put hardware right into the helmets of Army soldiers and provide them with a heads-up display to view information in real-time.

“We don't want to give service members a new tool—we're giving them a new teammate,” Palmer Luckey, Anduril's founder, said in a statement. “The idea of an AI partner embedded in your display has been imagined for decades. EagleEye is the first time it's real.”

According to Anduril, EagleEye is a modular system that includes configurations for helmets, visors, and glasses. The company also claims its system will balance weight by reducing the “bulk of traditional night vision goggles” while introducing sensors “aligned with a warfighter's center of gravity.”

The helmet module, notably, gives soldiers tactical cat ears. Frankly, we live in a time where it's entirely impossible to know if that is the most efficient design for the effort or if it's just another CEO with the sense of humor of a 13-year-old doing a multi-million dollar meme, a la Elon Musk running a government project named after a memecoin or making Tesla models spell out the word “SEXY.” Luckey used the announcement that his company was taking over a multi-billion-dollar mixed-reality goggles contract with the Army earlier this year to re-create his famous and meme-ified TIME Magazine cover, so it's not like he's above that kind of thing.

The heads-up display is perhaps the most marketable part of Anduril's project, which was made in part with the help of Mark Zuckerberg and Meta, and the company showed it off with a preview video that looks like it was ripped right out of Call of Duty. The display will reportedly give soldiers access to information like mission briefings, map overlays, and real-time insights like identifying the positioning of other actors in the field.

EagleEye is something of a culmination of Anduril's work on the Army's Soldier Borne Mission Command (SBMC) and Soldier Borne Mission Command–Architecture (SBMC-A) programs, which is a rebrand of the Integrated Visual Augmentation System the company took over from Microsoft. Last month, the Army announced that Luckey's Anduril and Mark Zuckerberg's Meta received contracts from the Army to produce prototype mixed-reality combat goggles. We'll see if they have any other plans to UwU-fiy the military.

Data transmitted via satellite may not be as secure as previously thought.

A new study published on Monday found that communications from cellphone carriers, retailers, banks, and even militaries are being broadcast unencrypted through geostationary satellites.

Researchers from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and the University of Maryland scanned 39 of these satellites from a rooftop in Southern California over three years. They found that roughly half of the signals they analyzed were transmitting unencrypted data, potentially exposing everything from phone calls and military logistics to a retail chain's inventory.

“There is a clear mismatch between how satellite customers expect data to be secured and how it is secured in practice,” the researchers wrote in their paper titled “Don't Look Up: There Are Sensitive Internal Links in the Clear on GEO Satellites.” The findings are also being presented this week at an Association for Computing Machinery conference in Taiwan. The paper's title is a clear reference to the 2021 Netflix movie, used in this case as a metaphor for the satellites' lack of security.

“They assumed that no one was ever going to check and scan all these satellites and see what was out there. That was their method of security,” Aaron Schulman, a UCSD professor and co-lead of the study, told Wired. “They just really didn't think anyone would look up.”

Even more surprisingly, the researchers didn't need any fancy spy gear to collect this data. Their setup used only off-the-shelf hardware, including a $185 satellite dish, a $140 roof mount with a $195 motor, and a $230 tuner card. Altogether, the system cost roughly $750 and was installed on a university building in La Jolla, San Diego.

With their simple setup, the researchers were able to collect a wide range of communication data, including phone calls, texts, in-flight Wi-Fi data from airline passengers, and signals from electric utilities. They even obtained U.S. and Mexican military and law enforcement communications, as well as ATM transactions and corporate communications.

Some of the affected organizations included Walmart-Mexico, Santander Mexico, and Banjercito, the researchers said.

When it came to telecoms, specifically, the team collected phone numbers, calls, and texts from customers of T-Mobile, AT&T Mexico, and Telmex. According to the researchers, these signals were exposed because telecom companies often rely on satellites to provide coverage to customers in remote areas. For instance, remote towers in desert regions of the U.S. connect to a satellite, which then relays signals to the carrier's core network. This extra internal step is known as backhaul traffic and was found unencrypted in some cases by the team. It only took the team nine hours to collect the phone numbers of over 2,700 T-Mobile users, along with some of their calls and text messages.

“T-Mobile immediately addressed a vendor's technical misconfiguration that affected a limited number of cell sites using geosynchronous satellite backhaul in remote, low-population areas, as identified in this research from 2024,” T-Mobile said in an emailed statement to Gizmodo. “This was not network-wide, is unrelated to our T-Satellite direct-to-cell offering, and we implemented nationwide Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) encryption for all customers to further protect signaling traffic as it travels between mobile handsets and the network core, including call set up, numbers dialed and text message content. We appreciate our collaboration with the security research community, whose work helps reinforce our ongoing commitment to protecting customer data and enhances security across the industry.”

Additionally, the team obtained unencrypted internet communications from US military sea vessels and even communications regarding narcotics trafficking from Mexican military and law enforcement.

The team said it has notified all affected parties about the security flaws, and several have already confirmed that they have deployed a fix. With permission, the researchers re-scanned the networks and verified that fixes had been implemented for T-Mobile and Walmart.

The researchers pointed to several reasons for the unencrypted signals, including economic incentives. While encrypting data can be an extra cost, it's worth it for some companies when the economics are clear, like satellite TV providers protecting themselves from piracy. But for other organizations, encryption can reduce efficiency and impact service reliability. Other times, encryption can simply be turned off by mistake, but the overall system keeps working without indicating that the data is no longer protected.

And a mysterious configuration.

Intel on Tuesday formally introduced its next-generation Data Center GPU explicitly designed to run inference workloads, wedding 160 GB of LPDDR5X onboard memory with relatively low power consumption. The new unit is codenamed Crescent Island, and it will use the company's upcoming Xe3P architecture when it hits the market next year. 

Intel's inference-optimized Data Center GPU codenamed Crescent Island will carry a GPU (perhaps two) based on the Xe3P architecture, which is a performance-enhanced version of the Xe3 architecture used in the Core Ultra 300-series 'Panther Lake' processors for laptops and compact desktops. The GPU is said to support a 'broad range of data types' relevant for inference workloads and cloud providers. Unfortunately, there is no word regarding the estimated performance for the part. However, there are still some hints in Intel's press release. 

The board will carry 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory (a lot more than one typically expects from a graphics card), which suggests the usage of many LPDDR5X devices. An LPDDR5X DRAM IC features two 16-bit channels, so its total interface width is 32 bits. The highest-capacity LPDDR5X die is 32 GB (8 Gb), so 20 of such chips are needed to equip a graphics card with 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory. This means that the card either carries one massive GPU with an unprecedented 640-bit wide memory interface connecting all 20 memory devices, or two smaller GPUs, each with a 320-bit memory interface and equipped with 10 memory devices. In both cases, it means that Intel will have two high-end graphics processors for inference, and the only question is whether these can also process graphics. 

Keep in mind that since LPDDR5X DRAMs feature two fully independent 16-bit channels, they cannot support butterfly mode (like GDDR6 or GDDR7), so it is impossible to connect 20 ICs using a single 320-bit interface to one GPU. 

Intel says that its inference-optimized Data Center GPU codenamed Crescent Island will be 'power and cost optimized for air-cooled enterprise servers,' so we would not expect the company to build a near-reticle-sized GPU for these cards. 

Intel plans to start sampling its Crescent Island products sometime in the second half of 2026. The company already has samples, and we might hear more details about their performance at the OCP conference or the SC25 trade show.

Combining AMD Instinct graphics chips, AMD Epyc CPUs, and AMD Pensando network hardware.

AMD has showcased its Helios next-generation AI hardware platform built for the Meta OpenRack Wide form-factor at the Open Compute Project Global Summit in San Jose, California. Built for streamlined scalability within an AI-first data center environment, this is AMD's big pitch to compete directly with Nvidia's rack-based GPU and CPU combinations, like the Blackwell and Grace-powered GB300 NVL72.

AMD debuted the Helios platform earlier this year, highlighting its ground-up design using all-AMD hardware. It combines AMD's Epyc server CPUs with Instinct 400 GPUs, AMD Pensando networking interfaces, and AMD ROCm software, giving it what AMD claims is a big advantage for performance and efficiency in the rapidly scaling AI infrastructure industry.

To enhance that scalability, AMD has now demonstrated it as compliant with the new Open Rack Wide specification developed by Meta. It was developed to improve power, cooling, and serviceability for AI systems. Supporting this and OPC standards will allow AMD partners to scale up faster and more effectively, AMD claims.

“Open collaboration is key to scaling AI efficiently,” said Forrest Norrod, executive VP and GM of the Data Center Solutions Group, AMD. “With ‘Helios,' we're turning open standards into real, deployable systems — combining AMD Instinct GPUs, EPYC CPUs, and open fabrics to give the industry a flexible, high-performance platform built for the next generation of AI workloads.”

Each of the MI450 GPUs deployed as part of the Helios system will have access to up to 432GB of HBM4 memory, with a total bandwidth of 19.6 TB/s. With 72 of those GPUs in each Helios system, it should be able to deliver 1.4 exaFLOPS of FP8 performance, with 31TB of HBM4 memory overall.

AMD even took a swipe at Nvidia in the announcement, claiming that this will work out to 50% greater memory capacity than Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin will offer.

AMD also announced the first customers with this Helios system. In what's described as an "expansion of their long-standing, multi-generation collaboration," AMD has partnered with Oracle for the first deployment of the Helios rack system. It will involve Oracle deploying some 50,000 MI450 GPUs starting in Q3 2026, with more to come in 2027.

That shows strong confidence from potential customers already. Although consumers will need to wait for Nvidia and AMD to launch next-generation graphics products designed for gaming, AI developers have a big head start and a better idea of what's coming down the pipe. Although everyone is scrambling for any compute power they can get for AI data center developments, if AMD's hardware couldn't at least offer credible competition to Nvidia's future Vera Rubin designs, it wouldn't be striking deals like this.

— Seattle area tech executive David Azose is now chief technology officer for San Francisco's Airtable. Azose joins the database and workflow automation company from OpenAI, where he was head of engineering for ChatGPT's business products.

Azose began his career at Microsoft, departing the tech giant in 2017 after more than nine years to take the role of director of engineering at Uber's Seattle office. Azose then worked at DoorDash before going to OpenAI last year.

“Airtable helped democratize no-code long before it was fashionable. With the advent of AI, the opportunity to amplify that mission feels inevitable and energizing, and I can't wait for what's ahead,” Azose said on LinkedIn. 

— Microsoft hired former United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as a part-time advisor. He holds similar titles at Anthropic and Goldman Sachs.

In his Microsoft role, Sunak will provide “high-level strategic perspectives on macro-economic and geopolitical trends and how they intersect with technology and society,” according to information he submitted to the UK's Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (ACoBA). 

While Sunak said he will “not be advising on any UK policy matters,”  a report from ACoBA noted, “As the former Prime Minister there is a reasonable concern that you could be seen to offer unfair access to, and influence in, the UK government. This risk is heightened given the ongoing debate and lobbying efforts by large tech companies, including Microsoft, on the approach to best regulate AI.”

Sunak's obligations include speaking at Microsoft's annual summit. 

Sunak served as prime minister for nearly two years, ending in July 2024. He remains a member of Britain's parliament. Sunak is donating his Microsoft salary to The Richmond Project, a charity that helps children and adults with math skills that he launched with his wife Akshata Murty. 

— Jonathan Rosenbluth joined Seattle AI startup Oumi as the head of product and go-to-market. He comes to the role from the Toronto-based AI model and foundation-building company Cohere.

Oumi, which aims to open the “black box” of foundational AI models to spur innovation, came out of stealth in January and has raised $10 million from investors.

“The team is world-class, led by Emmanouil (Manos) Koukoumidis and Oussama Elachqar, with deep technical chops and serious ambition,” Rosenbluth said on LinkedIn. “I feel lucky to be building with them.”

— Reperio Health, a Portland, Ore.-based startup providing in-home health screenings, has added new leadership:

The company's virtual healthcare service is now available in 39 states and Washington, D.C.

Google is launching a new tool that uses AI to make it easier for Gmail users with Google Calendar to schedule their meetings. On Tuesday, the company launched a Gemini-powered “Help me schedule” feature that will surface ideal meeting times based on calendar availability and then display them to the person you're emailing to set up a meeting.

The company notes that the feature is designed to work for one-on-one meetings, not those with multiple contacts or group meetings.

The launch of the new feature comes amid a flurry of Google Workspace announcements that focus on infusing AI more deeply into users' everyday tools. This includes the introduction of Google's latest image editing model, Nano Banana, and Gemini features in Google Slides; tools to share custom AI assistants called Gems with other team members; new formats in NotebookLM; improved AI video tools in Google Vids; and more.

To use the meeting scheduling option, you'll click the new “Help me schedule” button that appears below your email compose screen in Gmail. This will display a series of timeslots where you have open availability. You can click an edit button to change or remove some of the options, then insert them into your email and send it to the recipient as usual. When the recipient picks a time that works for them, the calendar invite automatically appears on both people's calendars. 

While there are several meeting assistants and automated scheduling tools already on the market, like those from Calendly, Doodle, Zoom, HubSpot, and others, Google notes that its tool uses Gemini's AI to use the email's context when it makes its meeting suggestions. For instance, if someone writes in the email that they'd like to book a 30-minute time slot next, then the meeting assistant will only suggest half-hour slots before the end of next week that fit your schedule.

Google previously offered an appointment scheduling feature in Google Calendar, but it wasn't integrated with Gmail, nor did it use AI. 

Separately, Google updated another Workplace feature on Tuesday, noting that Google Keep reminders will now automatically be saved to Google Tasks.

Want a watch strap that's as comfortable as fabric, as light as rubber, as strong as a metal bracelet and as tactile as a Milanese mesh?

Any watch fan looking to tick all of the above boxes would normally expect to be a dab hand with a spring bar removal tool to experience all the above individually, but a new strap developed by Malaysian independent brand Ming appears to now offer the best of all worlds.

The one strap to rule them all has been dubbed the Polymesh, and is 3D-printed from grade five titanium, and comprises 1,693 interconnected pieces (including the buckle) held together without any pins or screws. The only additional parts requiring assembly are the quick-release spring bars at each end that attach it to the watch—the articulated pin buckle is also formed in the same process.

Ming says that the strap, which is made up from rows of 15 equilateral triangles, meshed together and bookended by larger end pieces, “has more motion engineered into the radial axis than the lateral one,” leading to a supple end result that drapes like fabric yet retains the strength of titanium.

It has taken the company seven years to develop, working with partners Sisma S.p.A in Italy and ProMotion SA in Switzerland. Ming says notable challenges included the risk of components fusing together, and the fact that powdered titanium—the raw material from which the strap is laser sintered—is highly explosive. The straps each take several hours to produce, requiring hundreds of layers of additive manufacturing in an inert gas environment.

The company is not the first to use 3D-printing techniques for final products in watchmaking (as opposed to prototyping), but it is the only one using it for straps or bracelets. British start-up Apiar has debuted a 3D-printed watch case, as has Dutch brand Holthinrichs, which has created versions of its Ornament 1 in both 18k gold as well as stainless steel.

To the extent that straps have been an area for innovation in the watch world, recent attention has tended to focus on brands' development of proprietary mechanisms for swappable straps, to varying degrees of success and popularity. Sustainability programmes that focus on leather alternatives such as reclaimed apple peel or mushroom-based material, or textiles woven from ocean plastic. Some have proven difficult to industrialize, and nearly all have been dogged by accusations of greenwashing.

Rolex's 2015  Oysterflex strap featured an elastomer virtually indistinguishable from rubber with thin blades of titanium-nickel alloy embedded within it for strength.

The last time a brand released anything that could realistically be described as an innovative hybrid would probably be Rolex's 2015 introduction of the Oysterflex strap: an elastomer virtually indistinguishable from rubber with thin blades of titanium-nickel alloy embedded within it. But the aesthetic result bears no comparison to Ming's Polymesh; to achieve a slinky, supple feel with a metal bracelet usually requires brands to invest heavily in hand-craft—like that of Patek Philippe's recent Golden Ellipse, which the brand says is crafted by master chainsmiths from 363 components—and the end result will naturally be limited to much more traditional constraints.

Over the years, other companies have sought to improve on traditional straps for various reasons. Some artisanal watches feature curved spring bars (as in fact does the Polymesh), or insist on solid gold (like Berneron); Omega once prototyped a strap woven from synthetic spider silk, which has finally made it to production as the Biosteel nato.

Omega has produced a nato strap woven from a synthetic spider silk called Biosteel.

California start-up Barrelhand whose Monolith is being developed for space exploration uses a strap built by Nick Mankey Designs that it says is “UV resistant, water proof, freeze proof, overstretch resistant, extremely lightweight and machine washable,” from polyester elastic webbing with grade five titanium hardware. Operating since 2018, Mankey last year created the Chronogrip, after two years of development and 90 design iterations. Essentially a unique take on nato straps with two different security measures for strap retention, as Mankey's version doesn't need to pass under the base of the watch case, his design is also good for smartwatches.

Still, there's nothing quite like Ming's revolutionary new take on things. The brand, which says it is also working on a version in stainless steel and will soon offer a 22mm lug width to go with the existing 20mm specification, will be showing off the genuinely innovative Polymesh at WatchTime New York laster this month, and at Dubai Watch Week in November.

Of course, such groundbreaking work from a luxury watch brand to fashion a titanium bracelet that wears like a fabric strap yet feels like metal inevitably does not come cheap. Compatible with any Ming timepiece, the Polymesh is being sold separately (yes, you don't get a watch with this thing) and can be pre-ordered now for CHF 1,500, approximately $1,900, and take six to eight weeks to reach purchasers.

The AirPods Pro 3 might still be brand new, but it looks like Apple is already hard at work devising even more wireless earbuds. According to a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple is developing a new pair of Pro earbuds (maybe more AirPods Pro 3.5 than AirPods Pro 4) as well as updates to its non-Pro AirPods lineup.

Let's start with intel on the Pro. According to Gurman, an upcoming pair of AirPods Pro will feature a new chip, the H3, which could bring benefits including lower latency and improved sound quality. That may not sound like a big deal, but the significance of the H3 addition will likely depend on the latter upgrade. As interesting as the AirPods Pro 3 are from an innovation standpoint, I've not seen too many rave reviews about the leap in sound quality from generation to generation. If Apple plans to successfully sell future generations of wireless earbuds, fidelity seems like an obvious area to target.

There's the possibility, if the H2 chip upgrade from the AirPods Pro 2 is anything to go by, that the H3 will bring other upgrades, including battery life, active noise cancellation (ANC), and—probably the most interesting aspect—health features. In case you missed it: Apple threw a heart rate sensor into the mix with the AirPods Pro 3, signaling that making AirPods part-earbud and part-fitness wearable is a priority. Bloomberg's report suggests that Apple's push into health tracking is far from over, too, with temperature sensing potentially in the pipeline. If I had to guess, I'd say the H3 will play a significant role in what Apple brings to the table on that front, or at least in how accurate and granular its planned health features are.

It's not all about AirPods Pro, though. Apple might also be working on the AirPods 5, an update to its non-Pro wireless line. There's a lot less detail on what we can expect on that front, but Gurman suggests there's one thing the fifth generation likely won't have: health tracking. That's not shocking (Apple has to convince you to pay the Pro premium somehow, right?), but I do have some questions about the next generation of regular AirPods. One thing I'm curious to see is whether Apple maintains the tip-less design. It feels to me like giving the AirPods 4 tips would be an easy way to provide some passive noise-cancellation and maybe sell non-Pro customers a better noise-cancelling experience without needing to tweak anything else.



If you're reading all of this and wondering about the big, AirPods Max-shaped elephant in the room, then I'm right there with you. Apple's only over-ear headphones, which haven't been updated since a minor refresh in 2024 that added USB-C charging, are notably missing from Bloomberg's report. Obviously, the fact that Gurman didn't type the phrase “AirPods Max 2” into his article doesn't mean such a product isn't in the works, but the omission is somewhat deflating, if not entirely unsurprising.

The AirPods Max, which haven't seen a new generation since 2020, are a tougher sell than wireless earbuds. For one, there's the price: Apple's AirPods Max still cost $550, which, last time I checked, is a lot of money for headphones, even if people are conditioned to the Apple premium. There's also the issue of evolution. What exactly could a theoretical second-gen AirPods Max bring to the table? A new chip with better sound, maybe? Better battery and ANC? Those are all welcome, but perhaps not as flashy as the promise of health tracking in Apple's wireless earbuds, and whether they would justify a 2 at the end of the AirPods Max name is debatable.

Either way, with five years in the rearview, AirPods Max are probably top of mind for anyone who eagerly awaits new Apple audio products, and it looks like we'll have to keep on waiting. The good news is that a several-year stint between numbered AirPods Pro generations was worth the wait —so imagine what an even longer lapse could yield.

Coco Robotics, a startup known for its fleet of last-mile delivery bots, is looking to get more information out of the five years' worth of data its robots have collected. Its answer: a physical AI lab with University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) professor Bolei Zhou at the helm.

Coco Robotics, which made the announcement Tuesday, said Zhou has also joined the Los Angeles-based startup as chief AI scientist.

When the company launched in 2020, it used teleoperators to help the bots navigate obstacles on their delivery routes. Coco Robotics co-founder and CEO Zach Rash told TechCrunch the company's goal has always been to operate its last-mile delivery robots autonomously to cut the overall costs of delivery. Now, Rash said the company has collected enough data to dive deeper into automation.

“We have millions of miles of data collected in the most complicated urban settings possible, and that data is incredibly important for training any sort of useful and reliable real world AI systems,” Rash said. “We're now at the point where we have sufficient data scale where I think we can start really accelerating a lot of the research happening around physical AI.”

The decision to tap Zhou to lead the effort was a “no brainer,” Rash said. Zhou's research around computer vision and robotics has largely focused on micromobility, as opposed to full-scale vehicles, Rash said.

Coco Robotics was already collaborating with Zhou, too. Both Rash and his co-founder Brad Squicciarini are UCLA alums and have even donated one of their bots to the school's research lab.

“[Zhou] is one of the leading researchers in the whole world on robot navigation, reinforcement learning, and a lot of the technologies and areas of research that are highly relevant for us,” Rash said. “He's been already very capable of recruiting some of the top researchers in the world who he's worked with in the past to come join Coco and help accelerate things on our end.”

This new research lab is separate from the collaboration the robotics startup has with OpenAI, which allows Coco Robotics to use OpenAI's models while the AI research lab gets access to the company's robot-collected data.

Coco Robotics plans to use the information and research it gathers from the lab for its own purposes for now. Rash said the company doesn't have plans to sell the data to its peers.

Rather, it will be used for the company to improve its automation and efficiency, which will mainly pertain to the local models its robots run on. Rash said they also plan to share their research findings with the cities they operate in when applicable, to help fix obstacles and infrastructure that slows their bots down.

“Success for this lab really looks at us offering a higher-quality service at an extremely low price,” Rash said. “How do we get our costs lower? How do we make this much more affordable for businesses and customers? I think that's going to create a tremendous amount of growth in this ecosystem.”

A powerful rainstorm moving down the California coast could dump more than an inch of rain over multiple burn scar areas in Los Angeles County today, including those of the Eaton and Palisades fires. County officials have issued evacuation warnings and orders for these areas due to the risk of flash flooding, mudslides, and debris flows.

The storm, which started in the Pacific Northwest, brought heavy rain to parts of Southern California late Monday night. National Weather Service forecasters expect it to continue impacting the region through Tuesday. The coasts and valleys could see rainfall totals of up to 1.50 inches (3.8 centimeters), while the foothills and mountains receive up to 4 inches (10 cm).

The risk of flooding, mudslides, and debris flows is especially high in and below burn scars—areas charred by recent wildfires. In January, the devastating Eaton and Palisades fires consumed nearly 40,000 acres (16,000 hectares) in LA County.

“As today's storm intensifies, I cannot emphasize strongly enough the importance of heeding evacuation warnings and orders,” LA County Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger said in a statement. “These alerts are issued to protect lives. Conditions can change quickly, and once debris flows begin, it may be too late for emergency crews to reach you.”

Burned soil can be as water-repellant as pavement, according to the NWS. As plants burn, they release a waxy substance that melts and solidifies on the top layer of soil, causing it to become hydrophobic. At the same time, fire also burns plant stems and leaves that slow rainwater's contact with the ground, as well as roots that stabilize the soil.

As a result, it takes much less rainfall to produce a flash flood, debris flow, or mudslide in a burn scar than in an area unaffected by wildfire. A good rule of thumb is: If you can look uphill from where you are and see a burnt-out area, you are at risk, the NWS states.

The Eaton fire burn scar stretches some 14,000 acres (5,600 hectares) across Altadena and Pasadena, while the Palisades fire scar encompasses nearly 24,000 acres (9,700 hectares) in and around the Pacific Palisades and Malibu. Other areas that could see significant impacts from today's storm include the Hawk, Hurst, Kenneth, Sunset, Lidia, Bridge, Canyon, Hughes, and Franklin burn areas, according to LA County.

Officials expect these wildfire-affected areas to experience moderate debris flows and mudflows, with the potential for some streets to become completely blocked by debris. This may also endanger some structures depending on the location and terrain.

Exactly how this storm will affect communities in burn scar areas remains to be seen, but the risks underscore the lasting impact of wildfire on the landscape and public safety. Californians have become well acquainted with this phenomenon in recent years. Just last week, remnants of Hurricane Priscilla triggered flooding and debris flows in Pine Valley, which was impacted by the Forsyth fire in June.

As climate change increases the frequency and severity of both wildfires and rainstorms, their compounding impacts will only escalate. This is already straining emergency resources in California and the Pacific Northwest, with no real solution in sight as global temperatures continue to rise.

Seattle-based startup Humanly is buying three recruiting technology companies — Sprockets, Qualifi, and HourWork — as it aims to build a comprehensive hiring platform that unites sourcing, screening, interviewing, and post-hire engagement under a single system.

Founded in 2018, Humanly uses automation software to help companies screen job candidates, schedule interviews, automate initial communication, run reference checks, and more. It targets customers with high volume hiring needs. 

The acquisitions each add new tools to Humanly's platform:

Terms of the acquisitions were not disclosed. 

The deals mark a major expansion for Humanly, and comes just after Workday's $1 billion acquisition of Paradox, one of Humanly's main rivals. M&A activity in the HR software sector is up this year.

Humanly's broader goal is to help employers automate outreach and screening for every applicant — not just the small fraction that typically receives a response.

“Anytime there's a two-way conversation with a job candidate, we want to make that more efficient, more equitable,” said Humanly CEO Prem Kumar.

Generative AI tools have dramatically increased application volume as candidates can mass-apply to openings, according to Kumar. This trend is also making it harder to differentiate candidates.

Humanly is equipping companies with AI tools of their own to help sort through applications, including its new AI Video Interviewer, which launched earlier this year and automatically conducts and transcribes interviews.

Kumar said the goal is not to replace recruiters, but to expand access and fill gaps.

“It's helping you get to 100% of candidates, not 5%,” he said.

He added that there is some pushback from job candidates who don't want to engage with an AI system. “But what we're finding is it's not the difference between talking to AI and a human — it's a difference between talking to AI or being ignored,” Kumar said.

Humanly uses the millions of transcripts collected from its AI chat and video systems to train models that score candidates more accurately and help recruiters make decisions.

The startup now claims 600 million candidate profiles and helps companies interview about 250,000 candidates per month.

Kumar said Humanly is intentionally not profitable as it invests ahead in infrastructure. The company employs just over 50 people following the acquisitions; it is hiring some staff from the three acquired firms.

Humanly now has over 100 customers, including Microsoft, Rogers Communications, MGM, and Dish Network. Kumar said the company tripled its revenue in 2025 and plans to raise more investment next year. 

The company raised $7 million in May. Total funding to date is $24 million. 

Kumar previously spent a decade at Microsoft where he helped integrate LinkedIn data into Microsoft's products. He co-founded Humanly with Andrew Gardner and Bryan Leptich. The startup graduated from Y Combinator in 2019.

Sometimes, you can only spot what's wrong when you've been part of the process for a while. That was the case for Michelle Lim, who, while running Warp's growth marketing efforts through last year, realized that the company wasn't updating its website quickly enough.

She noticed that potential customers were asking ChatGPT and other AI bots all kinds of questions about Warp's offering, but the information they sought, such as how the product compared with a newer competitor, wasn't available on the startup's website. Lim felt that this content gap would become even more critical as next-generation AI agents begin actively crawling the internet to gather intelligence for users.

It was clear that Warp needed to add more content, but making and uploading each additional web page was a time-consuming task involving a design agency and multiple people across different departments.

“Marketers just can't wait one month for design and development teams to build the page,” she told TechCrunch. “With AI engines, you need to be producing content a lot faster than before to capture your consumer demand.”

Lim, who had long planned to launch a startup, recognized that this was fast becoming a problem that needed solving. So, in March, she co-founded Flint, an AI platform that lets you set up websites that update themselves. Joining her in the effort was Max Levenson, an engineer who previously led simulation and infrastructure teams for autonomous vehicle startup, Nuro.

On Tuesday, Flint emerged from stealth mode with $5 million in seed funding. The investment was led by Accel, and saw participation from Sheryl Sandberg's fund, Sandberg Bernthal Venture Partners, and existing backer Neo.

Flint's goal is to create websites that continuously optimize themselves, perform their own A/B tests, and dynamically learn from both visitors and market trends, such as a sudden interest in a specific keyword. Flint also aims to generate pages customized to each visitor, much like how Amazon shows you customized product recommendations. 

That said, Flint's technology isn't ready to do all of that just yet. “For now, users still have to tell us what they want to build,” Lim said.

In its current form, once the parameters are set, Flint can automatically generate a webpage's design and layout, interactive elements (like tables and buttons), and also offer form tracking and ad optimization. Lim claims the platform can do all of this in “about a day,” though she didn't give any more details.

“At this point, customers provide their own copy,” Lim said. She added that while Flint's content writing functionality is roughly a year away, future versions will give customers the option to have AI write the text.

Even without that, Lim claims that whipping up a page with all of the necessary components in a day is already a big time-saver for its customers.

Flint says it doesn't design sites or “vibe code” anything. For existing websites, its technology analyzes the look and feel to build and deploy fully coded webpages that are consistent with the design.

The startup is already working with customers like Cognition, Modal, and Graphite, for whom it has created live pages. You can see Windsurf's here, Modal's site, and this is what Graphite's looks like.

Flint's ambition is to help marketers at rapidly growing startups and Fortune 500 companies increase their websites' visibility and create content.

The focus on selling to CMOs is what made Lim so excited to have Sheryl Sandberg join as an investor. “I like to think of her as someone who has influenced the way the internet has monetized over the past decade,” Lim said.

According to Lim, Sandberg instantly understood Flint's vision. “I was showing her this deck, and I was sharing how, in my personal experience, it took five teams three months to build one A/B test just to increase conversion by 10% on our Google ad,” Lim said. “And then she stopped me, [and] said, ‘Michelle, it was 140 people at Meta who had to do this'.”

Security researchers have discovered that as many as half of all geostationary satellites in Earth's orbit are carrying unencrypted sensitive consumer, corporate, and military information, making this data wide open to eavesdropping.

The researchers at UC San Diego and the University of Maryland spent $800 on an off-the-shelf satellite receiver and pointed it at the sky for three years. They found reams of unencrypted data beaming to and from space, including people's private voice calls and text messages, and consumer internet traffic from in-flight Wi-Fi services.

The unencrypted data also included communications between critical infrastructure systems, such as energy and water suppliers, and off-shore oil and gas platforms, according to Wired, which first published the researchers' findings. 

The researchers spent the past year alerting affected organizations to the exposure, including T-Mobile and AT&T's network in Mexico, which began encrypting their data soon after to prevent future eavesdropping. 

But the researchers warn that not everyone has remediated their own exposed data, including some critical infrastructure providers, and that large amounts of satellite data will be exposed for some years to come.

I've been testing DJI's Mini drones since the company launched the series, and one thing has always been consistent: They've stayed comfortably under the crucial 250-gram weight limit. That predictability has been a part of their appeal; if you buy a Mini, you know exactly what flight restrictions you're dealing with (i.e., very few). The DJI Mini 5 Pro breaks with that tradition in a way that feels slightly concerning.

My review sample weighed over 250 grams. Only by a few grams, but that'd be enough to potentially land me in legal hot water if I were to fly it in the same ways and locations as its sub-250-gram predecessor, the DJI Mini 4 Pro. The Mini 5 Pro does have a Class 0 rating in Europe, so the weight shouldn't be an issue in EU countries, but in the UK and the US, the company has essentially shifted responsibility to users.

I enquired about the weight, and a DJI spokesperson sent me the following statement: “The DJI Mini 5 Pro has a design weight of 249.9 grams. Due to manufacturing tolerances, the actual weight of the product may vary slightly within a range of ±4 g. Minor weight fluctuations are normal. We recommend that when UK users are operating the drone, local regulations are complied with, which can be found here.”

The company refers to it as a “near-250g drone”—terminology I'd never encountered from DJI. Frankly, it feels a little evasive. This isn't just pedantic nitpicking over a few grams. I live in the UK, and the 250-gram threshold determines whether you can fly a drone in public parks, on beaches, in towns and cities, near people, and in countless other scenarios without additional certification. Previous Mini models have been just under this limit, and it seems like an oversight during the design process to not keep this one comfortably below it, too.

There's good news, though: With UK drone rules set to change at the beginning of 2026, I don't have too long to wait until the Mini 5 Pro (and, interestingly, the much bigger DJI Air 3S) becomes completely legal to fly in built-up areas, public parks, and close to people.

The tidings for US-based pilots aren't so cheery, though. As with all of its recent products, DJI isn't officially launching the Mini 5 Pro in the US. You can blame the impending DJI ban, and it's a real shame, because, weight issues aside, this is a fantastic camera drone.

The Mini 5 Pro's slight weight increase comes with genuine benefits. The main improvement is the camera, which now features a 12-MP (or 50 MP in Quad Bayer terms) 1-inch sensor, a significant upgrade from the smaller sensors in previous Mini models. The image quality is edging towards DJI's Air range, which is remarkable for a drone this size. You're getting professional-level image quality in a pocketable drone.

The camera improvements extend beyond just sensor size. The gimbal now supports 225-degree roll rotation as well as the same 9:16 "True Vertical Shooting" as the Mini 4 Pro, where the camera rotates 90 degrees to capture native content for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and the like.

Video capabilities are impressive. You can shoot 4K at 60 frames per second in regular modes, and now push things to 4K 120 fps for smooth slow-motion sequences. The footage is 10-bit H.265 with a maximum ISO of 12,800, and there's support for D-Log M and HLG color profiles for those who want maximum flexibility in post-production. DJI claims up to 14 stops of dynamic range, and from my testing, shadow and highlight detail are genuinely excellent.

The 2x digital zoom—essentially a crop that gives you an equivalent 48-mm medium telephoto field of view—is surprisingly usable. Using a digital crop isn't something I'd typically recommend on smaller-sensor drones, but thanks to DJI's processing and the headroom offered by the 1-inch sensor, it's well worth making use of here.

As with most DJI drones, the Mini 5 Pro is a joy to fly. It's zippy and responsive when flown manually. I tested it in genuinely challenging coastal conditions, with gusts up to 30 mph, and while it was visibly fighting the wind, it held its position remarkably well.

Safety features have seen significant upgrades, too. The addition of lidar sensors means the drone can detect forward obstacles even in complete darkness, complementing the omnidirectional vision sensors that handle other directions. During my testing, this proved genuinely useful during golden hour (and later) flight; those lighting conditions are challenging for vision-only systems.

All the usual automated flight features are present and work well. The drone feels stable and predictable, whether you're using subject tracking, waypoint navigation, or just hovering in place. For beginners, it's as approachable as any Mini model, but experienced pilots will appreciate the improved performance.

Interestingly, battery life takes a major hit when using the camera. With the camera rolling and a standard battery fitted, you might get 21 minutes of flight time, but it can be as much as 36 minutes when the camera isn't recording.

The physical design remains excellent. It folds down to a genuinely pocketable size, and DJI includes a protective cover that keeps both propellers and the camera safe when folded. There's now a generous 42 GB of built-in storage in addition to a microSD card slot.

Pricing starts at £689 (around $919) for the basic package, with Fly More Combos available for £869 (with RC-N3 controller) or £979 (with RC 2 touchscreen controller). That's around the same price as the Mini 4 Pro, and here you're obviously getting a lot more for your money.

I'd strongly recommend the RC 2 touchscreen controller version if your budget allows. It eliminates much of the preflight setup faff you get with phone-mounted controllers and leaves your phone free for calls or other tasks. The integrated screen is bright, responsive, and makes the entire flying experience more streamlined.

Coming back to that weight issue: it's genuinely frustrating. The Mini series has always been about simplicity—buy one and fly it almost anywhere without worrying about complex regulations. The Mini 5 Pro muddies those waters in a way that feels unnecessary, especially given DJI's somewhat unsatisfying response to the situation.

If you're in Europe with its Class 0 designation, this isn't a concern. But UK and US users need to be more careful about where and how they fly. It's not a deal-breaker, but it does chip away at one of the Mini series' core appeals.

The Mini 5 Pro represents a significant step forward in camera technology and flight performance, wrapped in DJI's typically excellent design. The image quality improvements are genuine and substantial, and this really does deliver Air-class performance in a much smaller, easy-to-carry package.

But that weight slip-up feels like an uncharacteristic mistake from a company that usually gets these details right. If you can live with the weight complications, the Mini 5 Pro offers the best image quality you'll find in this size category. If you're a UK dweller, just be prepared to pay more attention to local regulations than you would with its predecessors—at least until the laws become clearer in January 2026.

In an effort to protect its underage users from harmful content, Instagram is rolling out new restrictions to teen accounts. Users under 18 will now by default only see content that adheres to PG-13 movie ratings, avoiding themes like extreme violence, sexual nudity, and graphic drug use.

Users under 18 won't be able to change this setting without their parents' or guardians' explicit approval.

Instagram is also introducing a stricter content filter, called Limited Content, that will prevent teens from seeing and posting comments on posts that have the setting turned on. 

The company said starting next year, it will apply more restrictions to the kinds of chats teens can have with AI bots that have the Limited Content filter turned on. It is already applying the new PG-13 content settings to AI conversations.

This move comes as chatbot makers like OpenAI and Character.AI are being taken to court for allegedly causing harm to users. Last month, OpenAI rolled out new restrictions for ChatGPT users under 18, and said it is training the chatbot to refrain from “flirtatious talk.” Earlier this year, Character.AI also added new limits and parental controls.

Instagram, which has been building tools related to teen safety across accounts, DMs, search, and content, is expanding controls and restrictions in various areas for underage users. The social media service will not allow teenagers to follow accounts that share age-inappropriate content, and if they follow such accounts, they won't be able to see content from these accounts or interact with them, and vice versa. The company is also removing such accounts from recommendations, making them harder to find.

The company is also blocking teenagers from viewing inappropriate content linked to them in DMs.

Meta already restricts teen accounts from discovering content related to eating disorders and self-harm. The company is now blocking words like “alcohol” or “gore,” and says it is also making sure that teens don't find content under these categories by misspelling these terms.

The company said it is testing a new way for parents to flag content that shouldn't be recommended to teens using supervision tools. Flagged posts will be sent to a review team.

Instagram is rolling out these changes in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada starting today, and globally next year.

The x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group turns one year old.

AMD and Intel are celebrating one year since the formation of the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group, an alliance designed to coordinate the evolution of the x86 instruction set architecture (ISA) and ensure that new features are supported by both leading CPU designers. In the first year, AMD and Intel have managed to ratify four new features that are set to be supported by the upcoming processors from these companies, including long-awaited memory tagging.

The new cross-vendor capabilities agreed upon by AMD and Intel are ACE (Advanced Matrix Extension) and AVX10 to enhance the performance of matrix multiplication and vector operations, as well as FRED (Flexible Return and Event Delivery) and ChkTag (x86 Memory Tagging) to reduce latency between software and hardware, as well as to detect errors like buffer overflows or use-after free bugs.

Intel's Granite Rapids processors already support AVX10.1 and AMX, whereas Sapphire Rapids were first to support AMX instructions. With the ratification by the x86 EDA, AVX10 and AMX will be supported by AMD's next-generation processors, though we can only wonder whether this will happen with Zen 6 or already with Zen 7. Other capabilities are less well-known.

Intel introduced FRED publicly in 2023, and by now, the capability is well-documented in developer documentation. The technology is described as a replacement for traditional x86 interrupt and exception mechanisms, so ultimately it is designed to simplify context switches, reduce latency, improve performance, and security when working with operating systems that support it.

FRED speeds up how the CPU switches between user mode (ring 3) and kernel mode (ring 0) with a hardware-defined entry and exit path. While this does not sound too impressive, replacing the old x86 mechanism (which uses the Interrupt Descriptor Table and IRET) is a big deal. At present, every time an application interacts with the OS (which happens millions of times per second), the CPU must switch between user mode and kernel mode, which introduces fairly high latencies with today's machines. Since the traditional IDT and IRET mechanisms are software-managed, while FRED provides a hardware-defined and verified entry and return path, replacing the former with the latter also improves reliability and security, in addition to performance

Up until today, AMD's stance on FRED was unclear, but now that the feature is recognized by the x86 EAG as a cross-vendor capability, it will be added to AMD's platforms over time.

Perhaps the most interesting addition to the list of cross-vendor x86 EAG features is the ChkTag (x86 Memory Tagging) capability, which has not been widely discussed before. The feature is added to catch memory safety errors — problems like buffer overflows, use-after-free, and out-of-bounds memory access — directly in hardware. Memory tagging is rapidly becoming a standard feature in modern CPUs as it is valuable (can catch a variety of bugs in hardware) and easy to implement, which is why modern processors from Apple and Ampere now support Arm's MTE technology.

It is hard to say when AMD and Intel plan to implement ChkTag (x86 Memory Tagging) in their processors. The announcement by the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group signals both are committed to supporting this feature, but there is no obligation to implement it within a certain timeframe. Meanwhile, hardware changes of this depth typically require building them into the CPU microarchitecture itself, so expect support of FRED and ChkTag to come several years down the road.

Nexperia is trying to obtain an exemption.

China has blocked the export of certain products produced by the Dutch chip company, Nexperia, according to Bloomberg. This is the same company that the Dutch government recently seized from its Chinese parent company to prevent the transfer of what it called "crucial technological knowledge" from leaving the country. This action appears to be retaliatory and highlights the increasingly multi-polar world that is developing under the umbrella of rapid global expansion in AI capabilities, and a rush to secure important strategic chip development resources.

Chinese trade relations with Western nations have been far more fractious in 2025 than in years past. Following increasingly aggressive global trade policies, China has pivoted from integrating with the wider global economy to focusing more on shoring up its own semiconductor development and nearer-to-hand trading partners. Many Western nations have mirrored this in turn, with the Dutch government's latest actions appearing to be just one more example of nations ensuring their own supply of silicon above almost all else.

This new paradigm is born from the old one, though, and until the time when economies are truly uncoupled, there is always room for retaliation. Just as the Dutch government severed China's ability to make decisions about the future of Nexperia and its technologies, China can inhibit production and export from Nexperia facilities located within its borders, which it has now done. Nexperia has said it is seeking an exception, but considering the broader political and strategic forces at play, that seems unlikely without other counterbalancing actions being taken.

Nexperia has multiple facilities around the world, including manufacturing, assembly, and testing facilities in Germany and the UK, but it also maintains an 80,000 square-meter assembly site in Guangdong province, China. It's that location that will be halted from exporting any products in the near future.

All of this serves as a tertiary backdrop for the heavily anticipated trade negotiations between President Trump and the Chinese Premier, Xi Jinping, which are slated to take place later this month. Although there have been posturing and statements that suggest they may not take place, most of the announcements of trade adjustments and blockades are seen as attempts to strengthen negotiating positions ahead of the talks.

Alongside the Dutch government seizing Nexperia, CEO Zhang Xuezheng (who founded parent company, Wingtech) has been ousted. Nexperia Chief Financial Officer, Stefan Tilger, is now acting as interim CEO, with court-appointed Dutch businessman Guido Dierick as non-executive director.

When used correctly, they can help us unpick some of the mysteries of our biology, and our mortality.

Be honest: Have you ever looked up someone from your childhood on social media with the sole intention of seeing how they've aged? 

One of my colleagues, who shall remain nameless, certainly has. He recently shared a photo of a former classmate. “Can you believe we're the same age?” he asked, with a hint of glee in his voice. A relative also delights in this pastime. “Wow, she looks like an old woman,” she'll say when looking at a picture of someone she has known since childhood. The years certainly are kinder to some of us than others.

But wrinkles and gray hairs aside, it can be difficult to know how well—or poorly—someone's body is truly aging, under the hood. A person who develops age-related diseases earlier in life, or has other biological changes associated with aging (such as elevated cholesterol or markers of inflammation), might be considered “biologically older” than a similar-age person who doesn't have those changes. Some 80-year-olds will be weak and frail, while others are fit and active. 

Longevity clinics offer a mix of services that largely cater to the wealthy. Now there's a push to establish their work as a credible medical field.

Doctors have long used functional tests that measure their patients' strength or the distance they can walk, for example, or simply “eyeball” them to guess whether they look fit enough to survive some treatment regimen, says Tamir Chandra, who studies aging at the Mayo Clinic. 

But over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging. What they've found is changing our understanding of aging itself. 

“Aging clocks” are new scientific tools that can measure how our organs are wearing out, giving us insight into our mortality and health. They hint at our biological age. While chronological age is simply how many birthdays we've had, biological age is meant to reflect something deeper. It measures how our bodies are handling the passing of time and—perhaps—lets us know how much more of it we have left. And while you can't change your chronological age, you just might be able to influence your biological age.

It's not just scientists who are using these clocks. Longevity influencers like Bryan Johnson often use them to make the case that they are aging backwards. “My telomeres say I'm 10 years old,” Johnson posted on X in April. The Kardashians have tried them too (Khloé was told on TV that her biological age was 12 years below her chronological age). Even my local health-food store offers biological age testing. Some are pushing the use of clocks even further, using them to sell unproven “anti-aging” supplements.

The science is still new, and few experts in the field—some of whom affectionately refer to it as “clock world”—would argue that an aging clock can definitively reveal an individual's biological age. 

But their work is revealing that aging clocks can offer so much more than an insta-brag, a snake-oil pitch—or even just an eye-catching number. In fact, they are helping scientists unravel some of the deepest mysteries in biology: Why do we age? How do we age? When does aging begin? What does it even mean to age?

Ultimately, and most importantly, they might soon tell us whether we can reverse the whole process.

The way your genes work can change. Molecules called methyl groups can attach to DNA, controlling the way genes make proteins. This process is called methylation, and it can potentially occur at millions of points along the genome. These epigenetic markers, as they are known, can switch genes on or off, or increase or decrease how much protein they make. They're not part of our DNA, but they influence how it works.

In 2011, Steve Horvath, then a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles, took part in a study that was looking for links between sexual orientation and these epigenetic markers. Steve is straight; he says his twin brother, Markus, who also volunteered, is gay.

That study didn't find a link between DNA methyl­ation and sexual orientation. But when Horvath looked at the data, he noticed a different trend—a very strong link between age and methylation at around 88 points on the genome. He once told me he fell off his chair when he saw it. 

Many of the affected genes had already been linked to age-related brain and cardiovascular diseases, but it wasn't clear how methylation might be related to those diseases. 

If a model could work out what average aging looks like, it could potentially estimate whether someone was aging unusually fast or slowly. It could transform medicine and fast-track the search for an anti-aging drug. It could help us understand what aging is, and why it happens at all.

In 2013, Horvath collected methylation data from 8,000 tissue and cell samples to create what he called the Horvath clock—essentially a mathematical model that could estimate age on the basis of DNA methylation at 353 points on the genome. From a tissue sample, it was able to detect a person's age within a range of 2.9 years.

That clock changed everything. Its publication in 2013 marked the birth of “clock world.” To some, the possibilities were almost endless. If a model could work out what average aging looks like, it could potentially estimate whether someone was aging unusually fast or slowly. It could transform medicine and fast-track the search for an anti-aging drug. It could help us understand what aging is, and why it happens at all.

The epigenetic clock was a success story in “a field that, frankly, doesn't have a lot of success stories,” says João Pedro de Magalhães, who researches aging at the University of Birmingham, UK.

It took a few years, but as more aging researchers heard about the clock, they began incorporating it into their research and even developing their own clocks. Horvath became a bit of a celebrity. Scientists started asking for selfies with him at conferences, he says. Some researchers even made T-shirts bearing the front page of his 2013 paper.

Lifestyle changes could counter some of the deterioration.

Some of the many other aging clocks developed since have become notable in their own right. Examples include the PhenoAge clock, which incorporates health data such as blood cell counts and signs of inflammation along with methyl­ation, and the Dunedin Pace of Aging clock, which tells you how quickly or slowly a person is aging rather than pointing to a specific age. Many of the clocks measure methylation, but some look at other variables, such as proteins in blood or certain carbohydrate molecules that attach to such proteins.

Today, there are hundreds or even thousands of clocks out there, says Chiara Herzog, who researches aging at King's College London and is a member of the Biomarkers of Aging Consortium. Everyone has a favorite. Horvath himself favors his GrimAge clock, which was named after the Grim Reaper because it is designed to predict time to death.

That clock was trained on data collected from people who were monitored for decades, many of whom died in that period. Horvath won't use it to tell people when they might die of old age, he stresses, saying that it wouldn't be ethical. Instead, it can be used to deliver a biological age that hints at how long a person might expect to live. Someone who is 50 but has a GrimAge of 60 can assume that, compared with the average 50-year-old, they might be a bit closer to the end.

GrimAge is not perfect. While it can strongly predict time to death given the health trajectory someone is on, no aging clock can predict if someone will start smoking or get a divorce (which generally speeds aging) or suddenly take up running (which can generally slow it). “People are complicated,” Horvath tells MIT Technology Review. “There's a huge error bar.”

On the whole, the clocks are pretty good at making predictions about health and lifespan. They've been able to predict that people over the age of 105 have lower biological ages, which tracks given how rare it is for people to make it past that age. A higher epigenetic age has been linked to declining cognitive function and signs of Alzheimer's disease, while better physical and cognitive fitness has been linked to a lower epigenetic age.

But accuracy is a challenge for all aging clocks. Part of the problem lies in how they were designed. Most of the clocks were trained to link age with methylation. The best clocks will deliver an estimate that reflects how far a person's biology deviates from the average. Aging clocks are still judged on how well they can predict a person's chronological age, but you don't want them to be too close, says Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, head of machine learning at Shift Bioscience, who was awarded $10,000 by the Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for developing a clock that could estimate age within a range of 2.55 years.

“There's this paradox,” says Camillo. If a clock is really good at predicting chronological age, that's all it will tell you—and it probably won't reveal much about your biological age. No one needs an aging clock to tell them how many birthdays they've had. Camillo says he's noticed that when the clocks get too close to “perfect” age prediction, they actually become less accurate at predicting mortality.

Therein lies the other central issue for scientists who develop and use aging clocks: What is the thing they are really measuring? It is a difficult question for a field whose members notoriously fail to agree on the basics. (Everything from the definition of aging to how it occurs and why is up for debate among the experts.)

They do agree that aging is incredibly complex. A methylation-based aging clock might tell you about how that collection of chemical markers compares across individuals, but at best, it's only giving you an idea of their “epigenetic age,” says Chandra. There are probably plenty of other biological markers that might reveal other aspects of aging, he says: “None of the clocks measure everything.” 

We don't know why some methyl groups appear or disappear with age, either. Are these changes causing damage? Or are they a by-product of it? Are the epigenetic patterns seen in a 90-year-old a sign of deterioration? Or have they been responsible for keeping that person alive into very old age?

To make matters even more complicated, two different clocks can give similar answers by measuring methylation at entirely different regions of the genome. No one knows why, or which regions might be the best ones to focus on.

“The biomarkers have this black-box quality,” says Jesse Poganik at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. “Some of them are probably causal, some of them may be adaptive … and some of them may just be neutral”: either “there's no reason for them not to happen” or “they just happen by random chance.”

What we know is that, as things stand, none of the clocks are precise enough to predict the biological age of a single person (sorry, Khloé). Putting the same biological sample through five different clocks will give you five wildly different results.

Even the same clock can give you different answers if you put a sample through it more than once. “They're not yet individually predictive,” says Herzog. “We don't know what [a clock result] means for a person, [or if] they're more or less likely to develop disease.”

And it's why plenty of aging researchers—even those who regularly use the clocks in their work—haven't bothered to measure their own epigenetic age. “Let's say I do a clock and it says that my biological age … is five years older than it should be,” says Magalhães. “So what?” He shrugs. “I don't see much point in it.”

You might think this lack of clarity would make aging clocks pretty useless in a clinical setting. But plenty of clinics are offering them anyway. Some longevity clinics are more careful, and will regularly test their patients with a range of clocks, noting their results and tracking them over time. Others will simply offer an estimate of biological age as part of a longevity treatment package.

And then there are the people who use aging clocks to sell supplements. While no drug or supplement has been definitively shown to make people live longer, that hasn't stopped the lightly regulated wellness industry from pushing a range of “treatments” that range from lotions to herbal pills all the way through to stem-cell injections.

Some of these people come to aging meetings. I was in the audience at an event when one CEO took to the stage to claim he had reversed his own biological age by 18 years—thanks to the supplement he was selling. Tom Weldon of Ponce de Leon Health told us his gray hair was turning brown. His biological age was supposedly reversing so rapidly that he had reached “longevity escape velocity.”

New movie The Substance showcases how women are thought about in terms of youth and fertility. That idea makes for bad research and health guidance.

But if the people who buy his supplements expect some kind of Benjamin Button effect, they might be disappointed. His company hasn't yet conducted a randomized controlled trial to demonstrate any anti-aging effects of that supplement, called Rejuvant. Weldon says that such a trial would take years and cost millions of dollars, and that he'd “have to increase the price of our product more than four times” to pay for one. (The company has so far tested the active ingredient in mice and carried out a provisional trial in people.)

More generally, Horvath says he “gets a bad taste in [his] mouth” when people use the clocks to sell products and “make a quick buck.” But he thinks that most of those sellers have genuine faith in both the clocks and their products. “People truly believe their own nonsense,” he says. “They are so passionate about what they discovered, they fall into this trap of believing [their] own prejudices.” 

The accuracy of the clocks is at a level that makes them useful for research, but not for individual predictions. Even if a clock did tell someone they were five years younger than their chronological age, that wouldn't necessarily mean the person could expect to live five years longer, says Magalhães. “The field of aging has long been a rich ground for snake-oil salesmen and hype,” he says. “It comes with the territory.” (Weldon, for his part, says Rejuvant is the only product that has “clinically meaningful” claims.) 

In any case, Magalhães adds that he thinks any publicity is better than no publicity.

And there's the rub. Most people in the longevity field seem to have mixed feelings about the trendiness of aging clocks and how they are being used. They'll agree that the clocks aren't ready for consumer prime time, but they tend to appreciate the attention. Longevity research is expensive, after all. With a surge in funding and an explosion in the number of biotech companies working on longevity, aging scientists are hopeful that innovation and progress will follow. 

So they want to be sure that the reputation of aging clocks doesn't end up being tarnished by association. Because while influencers and supplement sellers are using their “biological ages” to garner attention, scientists are now using these clocks to make some remarkable discoveries. Discoveries that are changing the way we think about aging.

Two little mice lie side by side, anesthetized and unconscious, as Jim White prepares his scalpel. The animals are of the same breed but look decidedly different. One is a youthful three-month-old, its fur thick, black, and glossy. By comparison, the second mouse, a 20-month-old, looks a little the worse for wear. Its fur is graying and patchy. Its whiskers are short, and it generally looks kind of frail.

But the two mice are about to have a lot more in common. White, with some help from a colleague, makes incisions along the side of each mouse's body and into the upper part of an arm and leg on the same side. He then carefully stitches the two animals together—membranes, fascia, and skin. 

The procedure takes around an hour, and the mice are then roused from their anesthesia. At first, the two still-groggy animals pull away from each other. But within a few days, they seem to have accepted that they now share their bodies. Soon their circulatory systems will fuse, and the animals will share a blood flow too.

White, who studies aging at Duke University, has been stitching mice together for years; he has performed this strange procedure, known as heterochronic parabiosis, more than a hundred times. And he's seen a curious phenomenon occur. The older mice appear to benefit from the arrangement. They seem to get younger.

Experiments with heterochronic parabiosis have been performed for decades, but typically scientists keep the mice attached to each other for only a few weeks, says White. In their experiment, he and his colleagues left the mice attached for three months—equivalent to around 10 human years. The team then carefully separated the animals to assess how each of them had fared. “You'd think that they'd want to separate immediately,” says White. “But when you detach them … they kind of follow each other around.”

The most striking result of that experiment was that the older mice who had been attached to a younger mouse ended up living longer than other mice of a similar age. “[They lived] around 10% longer, but [they] also maintained a lot of [their] function,” says White. They were more active and maintained their strength for longer, he adds.

When his colleagues, including Poganik, applied aging clocks to the mice, they found that their epigenetic ages were lower than expected. “The young circulation slowed aging in the old mice,” says White. The effect seemed to last, too—at least for a little while. “It preserved that youthful state for longer than we expected,” he says.

The young mice went the other way and appeared biologically older, both while they were attached to the old mice and shortly after they were detached. But in their case, the effect seemed to be short-lived, says White: “The young mice went back to being young again.” 

To White, this suggests that something about the “youthful state” might be programmed in some way. That perhaps it is written into our DNA. Maybe we don't have to go through the biological process of aging. 

This gets at a central debate in the aging field: What is aging, and why does it happen? Some believe it's simply a result of accumulated damage. Some believe that the aging process is programmed; just as we grow limbs, develop a brain, reach puberty, and experience menopause, we are destined to deteriorate. Others think programs that play an important role in our early development just turn out to be harmful later in life by chance. And there are some scientists who agree with all of the above.

White's theory is that being old is just “a loss of youth,” he says. If that's the case, there's a silver lining: Knowing how youth is lost might point toward a way to somehow regain it, perhaps by restoring those youthful programs in some way. 

Horvath's eponymous clock was developed by measuring methylation in DNA samples taken from tissues around the body. It seems to represent aging in all these tissues, which is why Horvath calls it a pan-tissue clock. Given that our organs are thought to age differently, it was remarkable that a single clock could measure aging in so many of them.

But Horvath had ambitious plans for an even more universal clock: a pan-species model that could measure aging in all mammals. He started out, in 2017, with an email campaign that involved asking hundreds of scientists around the world to share samples of tissues from animals they had worked with. He tried zoos, too.   

The pan-mammalian clock suggests that there is something universal about aging—not just that all mammals experience it in a similar way, but that a similar set of genetic or epigenetic factors might be responsible for it.

“I learned that people had spent careers collecting [animal] tissues,” he says. “They had freezers full of [them].” Amenable scientists would ship those frozen tissues, or just DNA, to Horvath's lab in California, where he would use them to train a new model.

Horvath says he initially set out to profile 30 different species. But he ended up receiving around 15,000 samples from 200 scientists, representing 348 species—including everything from dogs to dolphins. Could a single clock really predict age in all of them?

“I truly felt it would fail,” says Horvath. “But it turned out that I was completely wrong.” He and his colleagues developed a clock that assessed methylation at 36,000 locations on the genome. The result, which was published in 2023 as the pan-mammalian clock, can estimate the age of any mammal and even the maximum lifespan of the species. The data set is open to anyone who wants to download it, he adds: “I hope people will mine the data to find the secret of how to extend a healthy lifespan.”

The pan-mammalian clock suggests that there is something universal about aging—not just that all mammals experience it in a similar way, but that a similar set of genetic or epigenetic factors might be responsible for it.

Comparisons between mammals also support the idea that the slower methylation changes occur, the longer the lifespan of the animal, says Nelly Olova, an epigeneticist who researches aging at the University of Edinburgh in the UK. “DNA methylation slowly erodes with age,” she says. “We still have the instructions in place, but they become a little messier.” The research in different mammals suggests that cells can take only so much change before they stop functioning.

“There's a finite amount of change that the cell can tolerate,” she says. “If the instructions become too messy and noisy … it cannot support life.”

Olova has been investigating exactly when aging clocks first begin to tick—in other words, the point at which aging starts. Clocks can be trained on data from volunteers, and by matching the patterns of methylation on their DNA to their chronological age. The trained clocks are then typically used to estimate the biological age of adults. But they can also be used on samples from children. Or babies. They can be used to work out the biological age of cells that make up embryos. 

In her research, Olova used adult skin cells, which—thanks to Nobel Prize–winning research in the 2000s—can be “reprogrammed” back to a state resembling that of the pluripotent stem cells found in embryos. When Olova and her colleagues used a “partial reprogramming” approach to take cells close to that state, they found that the closer they got to the entirely reprogrammed state, the “younger” the cells were. 

Scientific advances, public interest, and an unprecedented level of investment are pushing the longevity industry to help us live longer in better health.

It was around 20 days after the cells had been reprogrammed into stem cells that they reached the biological age of zero according to the clock used, says Olova. “It was a bit surreal,” she says. “The pluripotent cells measure as minus 0.5; they're slightly below zero.”

Vadim Gladyshev, a prominent aging researcher at Harvard University, has since proposed that the same negative level of aging might apply to embryos. After all, some kind of rejuvenation happens during the early stages of embryo formation—an aged egg cell and an aged sperm cell somehow create a brand-new cell. The slate is wiped clean.

Gladyshev calls this point “ground zero.” He posits that it's reached sometime during the “mid-embryonic state.” At this point, aging begins. And so does “organismal life,” he argues. “It's interesting how this coincides with philosophical questions about when life starts,” says Olova. 

Some have argued that life begins when sperm meets egg, while others have suggested that the point when embryonic cells start to form some kind of unified structure is what counts. The ground zero point is when the body plan is set out and cells begin to organize accordingly, she says. “Before that, it's just a bunch of cells.”

This doesn't mean that life begins at the embryonic state, but it does suggest that this is when aging begins—perhaps as the result of “a generational clearance of damage,” says Poganik.

It is early days—no pun intended—for this research, and the science is far from settled. But knowing when aging begins could help inform attempts to rewind the clock. If scientists can pinpoint an ideal biological age for cells, perhaps they can find ways to get old cells back to that state. There might be a way to slow aging once cells reach a certain biological age, too. 

“Presumably, there may be opportunities for targeting aging before … you're full of gray hair,” says Poganik. “It could mean that there is an ideal window for intervention which is much earlier than our current geriatrics-based approach.”

When White first started stitching mice together, he would sit and watch them for hours. “I was like, look at them go! They're together, and they don't even care!” he says. Since then, he's learned a few tricks. He tends to work with female mice, for instance—the males tend to bicker and nip at each other, he says. The females, on the other hand, seem to get on well. 

The effect their partnership appears to have on their biological ages, if only temporarily, is among the ways aging clocks are helping us understand that biological age is plastic to some degree. White and his colleagues have also found, for instance, that stress seems to increase biological age, but that the effect can be reversed once the stress stops. Both pregnancy and covid-19 infections have a similar reversible effect.

Poganik wonders if this finding might have applications for human organ transplants. Perhaps there's a way to measure the biological age of an organ before it is transplanted and somehow rejuvenate organs before surgery. 

But new data from aging clocks suggests that this might be more complicated than it sounds. Poganik and his colleagues have been using methylation clocks to measure the biological age of samples taken from recently transplanted hearts in living people. 

If being old is simply a case of losing our youthfulness, then that might give us a clue to how we can somehow regain it.

Young hearts do well in older bodies, but the biological age of these organs eventually creeps up to match that of their recipient. The same is true for older hearts in younger bodies, says Poganik, who has not yet published his findings. “After a few months, the tissue may assimilate the biological age of the organism,” he says. 

If that's the case, the benefits of young organs might be short-lived. It also suggests that scientists working on ways to rejuvenate individual organs may need to focus their anti-aging efforts on more systemic means of rejuvenation—for example, stem cells that repopulate the blood. Reprogramming these cells to a youthful state, perhaps one a little closer to “ground zero,” might be the way to go.

Whole-body rejuvenation might be some way off, but scientists are still hopeful that aging clocks might help them find a way to reverse aging in people.

“We have the machinery to reset our epigenetic clock to a more youthful state,” says White. “That means we have the ability to turn the clock backwards.”  

They're turning their backs on a technology thought to have saved millions of lives—with the potential to save many more.

Satellites beam data down to the Earth all around us, all the time. So you might expect that those space-based radio communications would be encrypted to prevent any snoop with a satellite dish from accessing the torrent of secret information constantly raining from the sky. You would, to a surprising and troubling degree, be wrong.

Roughly half of geostationary satellite signals, many carrying sensitive consumer, corporate, and government communications, have been left entirely vulnerable to eavesdropping, a team of researchers at UC San Diego and the University of Maryland revealed today in a study that will likely resonate across the cybersecurity industry, telecom firms, and inside military and intelligence agencies worldwide.

For three years, the UCSD and UMD researchers developed and used an off-the-shelf, $800 satellite receiver system on the roof of a university building in the La Jolla seaside neighborhood of San Diego to pick up the communications of geosynchronous satellites in the small band of space visible from their Southern California vantage point. By simply pointing their dish at different satellites and spending months interpreting the obscure—but unprotected—signals they received from them, the researchers assembled an alarming collection of private data: They obtained samples of the contents of Americans' calls and text messages on T-Mobile's cellular network, data from airline passengers' in-flight Wi-Fi browsing, communications to and from critical infrastructure such as electric utilities and offshore oil and gas platforms, and even US and Mexican military and law enforcement communications that revealed the locations of personnel, equipment, and facilities.

“It just completely shocked us. There are some really critical pieces of our infrastructure relying on this satellite ecosystem, and our suspicion was that it would all be encrypted,” says Aaron Schulman, a UCSD professor who co-led the research. “And just time and time again, every time we found something new, it wasn't.”

The group's paper, which they're presenting this week at an Association for Computing Machinery conference in Taiwan, is titled “Don't Look Up”—a reference to the 2021 film of that title but also a phrase the researchers say describes the apparent cybersecurity strategy of the global satellite communications system. “They assumed that no one was ever going to check and scan all these satellites and see what was out there. That was their method of security,” Schulman says. “They just really didn't think anyone would look up.”

The researchers say that they've spent nearly the past year warning companies and agencies whose sensitive data they found exposed in satellite communications. Most of them, including T-Mobile, moved quickly to encrypt those communications and protect the data. Others, including some owners of vulnerable US critical infrastructure whom the researchers alerted more recently—and declined to name to WIRED—have yet to add encryption to their satellite-based systems. Researchers have pointed to the surveillance dangers of unencrypted satellite connections before, but the scale and scope of the new disclosures appear unrivaled.

The researchers' work looked at only a small fraction of geostationary satellites whose signals they could pick up from San Diego—roughly 15 percent of those in operation, by the researchers' estimate. This suggests vast amounts of data are likely still being exposed over satellite communications, says Matt Green, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University who focuses on cybersecurity and reviewed the study. Large swaths of satellite data will likely be vulnerable for years to come, too, as companies and governments grapple with whether and how to secure outdated systems, Green says.

“It's crazy. The fact that this much data is going over satellites that anyone can pick up with an antenna is just incredible,” Green says. “This paper will fix a very small part of the problem, but I think a lot of it is not going to change.”

“I would be shocked,” Green adds, “if this is something that intelligence agencies of any size are not already exploiting.”

The phone calls and text messages the researchers obtained, in particular, were exposed due to telecoms' often overlooked use of satellite communications for offering cellular coverage to normal phone users who connect to cell towers in remote locations. Some towers in desert or mountainous regions of the US, for instance, connect to a satellite that relays their signals to and from the rest of a telecom's core cellular network, the internal communications of the network known as “backhaul” traffic.

Anyone who sets up their own satellite receiver in the same broad region as one of those remote cell towers—often as far as thousands of miles away—can pick up the same signals meant for that tower. Doing so allowed the research team to obtain at least some amount of unencrypted backhaul data from the carriers T-Mobile, AT&T Mexico, and Telmex.

The T-Mobile data was particularly significant: In just nine hours of recording T-Mobile backhaul satellite communications from their single dish, the researchers collected the phone numbers of more than 2,700 users as well as all the phone calls and text messages the researchers received during that time. They could, however, only read or hear one side of those conversations: the content of the messages and calls sent to T-Mobile's remote towers, not sent from them to the core cell network, which would have required another satellite dish near the one T-Mobile intended to receive the signal on the other end.

Cellular towers in remote regions sometimes connect to a satellite that relays their signals to and from the rest of a telecom's core cellular network—the internal communications of the network known as “backhaul” traffic. Anyone who sets up their own satellite receiver in the same broad region as one of those remote cell towers—often as far as thousands of miles away—can pick up the same signals meant for that tower.

“When we saw all this, my first question was, did we just commit a felony? Did we just wiretap?” says Dave Levin, a University of Maryland computer science professor who co-led the study. In fact, he says, the team didn't actively intercept any communications, only passively listened to what was being sent to their receiver dish. “These signals are just being broadcast to over 40 percent of the Earth at any point in time,” Levin says.

Mexican telecom Telmex also transmitted unencrypted voice calls, the researchers found. The researchers further discovered that AT&T Mexico transmitted raw data over satellites that included users' internet traffic—most of which was encrypted with HTTPS by the apps or browsers they used—but also some calling and texting metadata. They also found decryption keys that the researchers believe could likely have been used to decipher other sensitive information the AT&T Mexico network transmitted—though they didn't attempt this.

Starting in December 2024, the researchers began contacting the affected telecoms. T-Mobile responded by encrypting its satellite transmissions within weeks, but responses from other cell carriers were mixed.

“Last year, this research helped surface a vendor's encryption issue found in a limited number of satellite backhaul transmissions from a very small number of cell sites, which was quickly fixed,” a T-Mobile spokesperson says, adding the issue was “not network-wide” and that the company has taken steps to “make sure this doesn't happen again.” In another statement after this story was published, T-Mobile noted that it has also added Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) encryption for all customers across the US “to further protect signaling traffic as it travels between mobile handsets and the network core, including call set up, numbers dialed and text message content.”

A spokesperson for AT&T says the company “promptly” fixed the issue. "A satellite vendor misconfigured a small number of cell towers in a remote region of Mexico,” they say. Telmex did not respond to WIRED's request for comment.

Whether other cellular carriers around the US and world—outside the visibility of the researchers' satellite dish—have encrypted their satellite-based network backhaul data remains an open question. The researchers say they didn't see any unencrypted Verizon or AT&T US traffic from their dish.

The AT&T spokesperson says that its US and Mexico networks are separate, and it is “rare” to use satellites for cellular backhaul. "We typically route traffic on our closed, secure backhaul network,” the spokesperson says. “On those rare instances where data must be transmitted outside our closed network, it is our policy to encrypt it." Verizon did not respond to WIRED's request for comment.

Beyond just cell towers in remote locations, it's possible that a lack of encryption for cellular backhaul data could make anyone on the same network vulnerable, points out Johns Hopkins' Green. Hackers might be able to perform a so-called relay attack with a spoofed cell tower—using the surveillance hardware sometimes called a stingray or IMSI catcher—and route any victim's data to a cell tower that connects to a satellite uplink. “The implications of this aren't just that some poor guy in the desert is using his cell phone tower with an unencrypted backhaul,” says Green. “You could potentially turn this into an attack on anybody, anywhere in the country.”

The researchers' satellite dish also pulled down a significant collection of unprotected military and law enforcement communications. They obtained, for instance, unencrypted internet communications from US military sea vessels, as well as the vessels' names. (A spokesperson for the US Defense Information Systems Agency acknowledged WIRED's request for comment but had not provided a response at the time of writing).

For Mexican military and law enforcement, the exposures were far worse: The researchers say they found what appeared to be unencrypted communications with remote command centers, surveillance facilities, and units of the Mexican military and law enforcement. In some cases, they saw the unprotected transmission of sensitive intelligence information on activities like narcotics trafficking. In others, they found military asset tracking and maintenance records for aircraft like Mil Mi-17 and UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, sea vessels, and armored vehicles, as well as their locations and mission details. “When we started seeing military helicopters, it wasn't necessarily the sheer volume of data, but the extreme sensitivity of that data that concerned us,” says Schulman. The Mexican military did not immediately respond to WIRED's requests for comment.

Just as sensitive, perhaps, were industrial systems communications from critical infrastructure like power grids and offshore oil and gas platforms. In one case, they found that the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), Mexico's state-owned electric utility with nearly 50 million customers, was transmitting its internal communications in the clear—everything from work orders that included customers' names and addresses to communications about equipment failures and safety hazards. (A CFE spokesperson acknowledged WIRED's request for comment but didn't provide a response before publication.)

In other cases they have yet to publicly detail, the researchers say they also warned US infrastructure owners about unencrypted satellite communications for industrial control system software. In their phone calls with those infrastructure owners, some owners even expressed concerns that a malicious actor might have the ability to not only surveil the control systems of their facilities, but also, with enough sophistication, potentially disable or spoof them to tamper with the facility's operation.

The researchers obtained a vast grab bag of other miscellaneous corporate and consumer data: They pulled down in-flight Wi-Fi data for Intelsat and Panasonic systems used by 10 different airlines. Within that data, they found unencrypted metadata about users' browsing activities and even the unencrypted audio of the news programs and sports games being broadcast to them. They also obtained corporate emails and inventory records of Walmart's Mexican subsidiary, satellite communications to ATMs managed by Santander Mexico, as well as the Mexican banks Banjercito and Banorte.

A spokesperson for Panasonic Avionics Corporation said they “welcome the findings” from the researchers, but claim it “has found that several statements attributed to us are either inaccurate or misrepresent our position.” When asked, the spokesperson did not specify what the company considered was inaccurate. “Our satellite communications systems are designed so that every user data session follows established security protocols,” the spokesperson says.

“Generally, our users choose the encryption that they apply to their communications to suit their specific application or need,” says a spokesperson for SES, the parent company of Intelsat. “For SES's inflight customers, for example, SES provides a public Wi-Fi hot spot connection similar to the public internet available at a coffee shop or hotel. On such public networks, user traffic would be encrypted when accessing a website via HTTPS/TLS or communicating using a virtual private network.”

The researchers reported the swaths of unencrypted satellite communications from the Mexican government and Mexican organizations to CERT-MX, the country's incident response team, which is part of the government's National Guard, in April this year, before separately contacting companies. CERT-MX did not respond to WIRED's repeated requests for comment.

A spokesperson for Santander Mexico says that no customer information or transactions were compromised, but confirmed that the exposed traffic was linked to a “small group” of ATMs used in remote areas of Mexico where using satellite connections is the only option available. “Although this traffic does not pose a risk to our customers, we took the report as an opportunity for improvement, implementing measures that reinforce the confidentiality of technical traffic circulating through these links,” the spokesperson says.

“While we cannot share specifics, we can confirm that our communications lines have been evaluated and confirmed secure,” a spokesperson for Walmart says. (The researchers confirm that they observed Walmart had encrypted its satellite communications in response to their warning.)

“The information of our customers and infrastructure is not exposed to any vulnerability,” a spokesperson for Grupo Financiero Banorte says. Banjercito could not be reached for comment.

“SIA and its members remain diligent in monitoring the threat landscape and continue to participate in various security efforts with government agencies, industry working groups, and international standards bodies,” says Tom Stroup, the president of the Satellite Industry Association, adding that it does not comment on specific company issues.

The amount of Mexico-related data in the researchers' findings is, of course, no coincidence. Although their satellite dish was technically able to pick up transmissions from around a quarter of the sky, much of that swath included the Pacific Ocean, which has relatively few satellites above it, and only a small fraction of the transponders on the satellites it did see were transmitting data in the direction of its dish. The result, the researchers estimate, was that they examined only 15 percent of global satellite transponder communications, mostly in the western US and Mexico.

Geostationary satellites ring the Earth's equator. The researchers' satellite dish on the roof of their UC San Diego building was in a position to pick at least some signals from about a quarter of that ring. But because many of the satellites' signals weren't transmitted towards San Diego—and a large part of their coverage was over the Pacific Ocean, with relatively few satellites—they only received an estimated 15 percent of all geostationary satellite signals. That also means that other dishes placed elsewhere in the world would likely find entirely different signals transmitting different sensitive data.

That suggests anyone could set up similar hardware somewhere else in the world and likely obtain their own collection of sensitive information. After all, the researchers restricted their experiment to only off-the-shelf satellite hardware: a $185 satellite dish, a $140 roof mount with a $195 motor, and a $230 tuner card, totaling less than $800.

“This was not NSA-level resources. This was DirecTV-user-level resources. The barrier to entry for this sort of attack is extremely low,” says Matt Blaze, a computer scientist and cryptographer at Georgetown University and law professor at Georgetown Law. “By the week after next, we will have hundreds or perhaps thousands of people, many of whom won't tell us what they're doing, replicating this work and seeing what they can find up there in the sky.”

One of the only barriers to replicating their work, the researchers say, would likely be the hundreds of hours they spent on the roof adjusting their satellite. As for the in-depth, highly technical analysis of obscure data protocols they obtained, that may now be easier to replicate, too: The researchers are releasing their own open-source software tool for interpreting satellite data, also titled “Don't Look Up,” on Github.

The researchers' work may, they acknowledge, enable others with less benevolent intentions to pull the same highly sensitive data from space. But they argue it will also push more of the owners of that satellite communications data to encrypt that data, to protect themselves and their customers. “As long as we're on the side of finding things that are insecure and securing them, we feel very good about it,” says Schulman.

There's little doubt, they say, that intelligence agencies with vastly superior satellite receiver hardware have been analyzing the same unencrypted data for years. In fact, they point out that the US National Security Agency warned in a 2022 security advisory about the lack of encryption for satellite communications. At the same time, they assume that the NSA—and every other intelligence agency from Russia to China—has set up satellite dishes around the world to exploit that same lack of protection. (The NSA did not respond to WIRED's request for comment).

“If they aren't already doing this,” jokes UCSD cryptography professor Nadia Heninger, who co-led the study, “then where are my tax dollars going?”

Heninger compares their study's revelation—the sheer scale of the unprotected satellite data available for the taking—to some of the revelations of Edward Snowden that showed how the NSA and Britain's GCHQ were obtaining telecom and internet data on an enormous scale, often by secretly tapping directly into communications infrastructure.

“The threat model that everybody had in mind was that we need to be encrypting everything, because there are governments that are tapping undersea fiber optic cables or coercing telecom companies into letting them have access to the data,” Heninger says. “And now what we're seeing is, this same kind of data is just being broadcast to a large fraction of the planet.”

Updated 1pm ET, October 14, 2025: Added additional information from T-Mobile about the encryption the company added to its cell network following the researchers' discoveries.

Damage to the cornea affects millions of people worldwide. Empa researchers are working on a transparent, biocompatible implant from the 3D printer. This allows defects to be repaired seamlessly and permanently. The project could now be started thanks to a generous donation from a foundation.

Like a windowpane, the transparent cornea, is the outermost layer of tissue that protects our eyes. If this 500 to 600 micrometer-thin tissue is damaged by infections, injuries or malformations, vision impairment or even blindness can occur. Millions of people worldwide are affected by corneal damage, but only around 100,000 of them each year can be treated with a corneal transplant. The reason: Demand for donated tissue is significantly higher than its availability.

A team of researchers from Empa, the University of Zurich, the Zurich Veterinary Hospital and Radboud University in the Netherlands is therefore developing a self-adhesive implant that is not dependent on tissue donations and does not cause a rejection reaction. "The basis for the implant is a biocompatible hydrogel made of collagen and hyaluronic acid," says Markus Rottmar from Empa's Biointerfaces lab in St. Gallen.

The transparent implant also contains additives to ensure optimum biomechanical stability. The artificial cornea will be produced by 3D printing. "3D extrusion bioprinting makes it possible to tailor the implant to the patient's individual corneal curvature," says Rottmar.In a later step, the researchers will load the hydrogel with human stem cells from the eye so that the artificial cornea can support tissue regeneration. And because the self-adhesive transplant does not require surgical sutures, longer operating times and post-operative complications such as infection, scarring or inflammation can also be avoided.

The project was fully financed thanks to a generous donation from a foundation. Empa's Zukunftsfonds raises private third-party funds for such pioneering research projects that are not yet supported otherwise. Would you also like to give our research an additional boost?

An AI system that can predict what a patient's knee X-ray will look like a year in the future could transform how millions of people with osteoarthritis understand and manage their condition, according to research by the University of Surrey.

A new study, published at the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2025), details how the Surrey-developed technology uses advanced machine learning to generate a realistic "future" X-ray alongside a risk score for disease progression in the knee. These two outputs combined can give doctors and patients a clear, visual forecast of how the condition may develop over time.

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that affects more than 500 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of disability in older adults. Trained on nearly 50,000 knee X-rays from almost 5,000 patients - one of the largest osteoarthritis datasets in the world - the system outperforms comparable AI tools for predicting osteoarthritis progression, doing so around nine times faster and in a much more compact form. Researchers say this blend of speed, scale and accuracy could accelerate adoption in real clinical settings.

We're used to medical AI tools that give a number or a prediction, but not much explanation. Our system not only predicts the likelihood of your knee getting worse - it actually shows you a realistic image of what that future knee could look like. Seeing the two X-rays side by side - one from today and one for next year - is a powerful motivator. It helps doctors act sooner and gives patients a clearer picture of why sticking to their treatment plan or making lifestyle changes really matters. We think this can be a turning point in how we communicate risk and improve osteoarthritic knee care and other related conditions."

David Butler, study lead from the University of Surrey's Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP), and Institute for People-Centred AI

Using an advanced generative model, called a diffusion model, the Surrey system generates a "future" version of a patient's knee X-ray and highlights 16 key points in the joint. These points add transparency by showing which areas the AI is monitoring for changes, making the system easier for clinicians to understand and trust.

In the future, this research could pave the way for similar tools in other chronic conditions for example, predicting lung damage in smokers or tracking heart disease progression, giving doctors and patients the same kind of visual insight and opportunity to act early. The team is also seeking partnerships to bring the technology into real-world clinical settings.

Gustavo Carneiro, Professor of AI and Machine Learning at Surrey's Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP), said:

"Earlier AI systems could estimate the risk of osteoarthritis progression, but they were often slow, opaque and limited to numbers rather than clear images. Our approach takes a big step forward by generating realistic future X-rays quickly and by pinpointing the areas of the joint most likely to change. That extra visibility helps clinicians identify high-risk patients sooner and personalise their care in ways that were not previously practical."

A peer-reviewed viewpoint article published today in Psychedelics by Prof. Xiaohui Wang and colleagues examines the therapeutic potential of psychedelic substances for treating stress-related psychiatric disorders through novel neurobiological mechanisms. The analysis synthesizes current evidence on how compounds like psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and MDMA could fundamentally alter treatment paradigms for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The authors emphasize that chronic stress represents a major contributor to psychiatric illness worldwide, with persistent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis leading to structural brain changes. Traditional treatments including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive behavioral therapy, while helpful for some patients, leave many with residual symptoms or significant side effects. This treatment gap has renewed scientific interest in psychedelics, substances that were extensively studied before regulatory restrictions in the 1970s halted most research.

Prof. Wang and colleagues outline how psychedelics primarily act through serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors, highly expressed in brain regions controlling mood, emotion, and cognition. This receptor activation promotes neuroplasticity and functional connectivity that could counteract structural damage from chronic stress exposure. The authors note that preclinical studies demonstrate psilocybin can upregulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor and enhance dendritic arborization in the prefrontal cortex, processes critical for mood regulation.

The viewpoint highlights mounting clinical evidence across multiple conditions. For depression, the authors cite studies where single psilocybin doses produced significant symptom reductions lasting weeks to months in treatment-resistant patients. One pivotal study showed approximately 67% of PTSD patients no longer met diagnostic criteria after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, though recent FDA advisory committee concerns about methodological limitations underscore the need for refined trial designs.

"Psychedelics offer a potential in counteracting the damaging effects from prolonged exposure to stress," the authors write, noting these substances foster neuroplasticity that may allow recovery of brain regions impacted by cortisol. Unlike conventional treatments targeting symptoms, psychedelic therapy addresses underlying causes, potentially enabling sustained relief through confronting and integrating unresolved stressors.

The analysis extends beyond serotonergic effects to examine anti-inflammatory properties that may provide additional therapeutic benefit. Preliminary evidence suggests psilocybin decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines, offering potential protection against stress-related brain changes. The authors propose that concurrent monitoring of immune markers and cortisol could clarify whether these mechanisms work synergistically.

MDMA presents a distinct profile as an entactogenic agent, functioning as a monoamine-releasing compound that promotes emotional openness and reduces fear responses. The authors emphasize its therapeutic signal derives from acute prosociality and enhanced memory reconsolidation during psychotherapy sessions, rather than classical psychedelic phenomenology. This pharmacological state enables patients to access traumatic memories without overwhelming fear responses.

The viewpoint acknowledges substantial hurdles before mainstream integration becomes feasible. Current Schedule I classification severely restricts research and therapeutic implementation, though evolving policy experiments in Oregon and Colorado suggest regulatory frameworks may emerge. The authors stress the need for specialized therapist training, noting psychedelic therapy differs qualitatively from traditional verbal psychotherapy approaches.

Safety considerations include predictable adverse effects like nausea, headache, and cardiovascular changes requiring careful medical screening and monitoring. The authors advocate for standardized protocols, enhanced safety reporting, and strategies to manage expectancy effects that complicate efficacy interpretations. Longitudinal studies comparing psychedelic-assisted therapy with conventional treatments across psychiatric diagnoses remain essential.

Prof. Wang and colleagues identify critical research needs including biomarker development for personalizing treatment, optimization of dosing regimens, and investigation of genetic factors influencing response. They emphasize interdisciplinary collaboration across neuroscience, psychology, engineering, and pharmacology will advance understanding of stress-activated neural circuits and plasticity mechanisms.

This viewpoint article represents a critical synthesis of the current state of knowledge in psychedelic therapeutics, providing researchers, clinicians, and policymakers with a comprehensive framework for understanding these substances' therapeutic potential. By systematically analyzing and integrating findings from across the literature, the authors offer both a historical perspective on how the field has evolved and a roadmap for future investigations. Such comprehensive reviews are essential for identifying patterns that may not be apparent in individual studies, resolving apparent contradictions in the literature, and highlighting the most promising avenues for advancing the field. The synthesis presented here serves as a valuable resource for both newcomers seeking to understand the field and experienced researchers looking to contextualize their work within the broader scientific landscape.

In this interview, News-Medical Life Sciences speaks with Bill Kotowski, Sales Manager for North America State & Local Chemical Identification at Thermo Fisher Scientific, and Dr. Suja Sukumaran, Product Manager at Thermo Fisher Scientific, about the latest advances in controlled substance testing. 

They discuss how handheld Raman spectrometers, benchtop Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) instruments, and updated spectral libraries are transforming workflows from the field to the lab, enhancing both safety and accuracy in the fight against narcotics and emerging drug threats.

This interview is a summary of an hour-long webinar - watch the webinar now. 

Bill Kotowski: I manage the state and local sales teams for North America, focusing on handheld chemical identification solutions. I've been with Thermo Fisher for about 15 years, and I've overseen the launch of several handhelds, including our newest TruNarc Delta narcotics analyzer.

Suja Sukumaran: I'm a product manager at Thermo Fisher, specializing in molecular spectroscopy solutions. My background is in biophysics, and I focus on FTIR and Raman technologies, particularly how they support confirmatory analysis in forensic and controlled substance testing.

Bill Kotowski: We provide solutions that cover the entire workflow, from presumptive testing in the field with our handheld Raman devices to confirmatory analysis in the lab using FTIR and benchtop Raman. Our teams merged Research and Development (R&D) efforts so that the same spectral libraries support both handheld and lab instruments, ensuring consistency from street to lab.

Bill Kotowski: TruNarc Delta is our flagship handheld Raman analyzer for presumptive testing.

TruNarc Delta delivers results in seconds and can scan right through bags or containers, keeping officers safer in the field.

It now has over 1200 compounds in its library and features like Wi-Fi transfer, a touchscreen, and user-replaceable batteries.

Our libraries now include 165 fentanyl analogs, and updates are free for the life of the instrument.

Bill Kotowski: Absolutely. Many agencies report that when TruNarc indicates cocaine, for example, defense attorneys often advise clients to enter plea agreements rather than push to trial. We also had a recent Kelly hearing in California, where TruNarc results were deemed admissible, creating legal precedent for presumptive evidence in the United States (US).

Fentanyl and its analogs are extremely potent—sometimes even lethal at microgram levels. That's why both field and lab testing methods must prioritize safety. 

Suja Sukumaran: Our handheld Raman allows non-contact scanning, while in the lab, glove boxes, chemical hoods, and fiber optic ATR probes help analysts avoid direct exposure during confirmatory FTIR or Raman testing.

Suja Sukumaran: FTIR is strong for asymmetric bonds, while Raman is more sensitive to symmetric bonds. By combining them, analysts get a more complete structural picture. Using both, compared to a library, provides robust confirmation of controlled substances, whether powders, pills, or mixed samples.

By combining FTIR and Raman, analysts get the most complete structural picture, ensuring accurate confirmation of controlled substances.

Bill Kotowski: Counterfeit oxycodone pills are a serious concern.

With TruNarc, if a tablet doesn't register as oxycodone, it's highly likely to be counterfeit—and often laced with fentanyl.

For cases where the concentration is very low, we use our Type H2 kit with surface-enhanced Raman (SERS) technology, which can detect fentanyl and other drugs at levels below 5 %.

Bill Kotowski: One of the big challenges we see is drugs sprayed onto paper or even greeting cards. TruNarc can often pick up concentrated hot spots directly, and when levels are lower, the Type H kit helps us detect them. States like California and Arkansas have now standardized on TruNarc across their correctional systems, which really shows how important this tool has become for protecting both inmates and officers.

Suja Sukumaran: Our libraries are continuously updated and include dedicated sets for narcotics and fentanyl analogs. These updates are provided free for the lifetime of the instrument. Importantly, the libraries can differentiate between different fentanyl isomers. For example, cis vs. trans, which have very different potencies.

Bill Kotowski: Yes, many agencies use grants to fund purchases. We partner with policegrantshelp.com to provide guidance, and agencies can qualify for programs like COPS Anti-Heroin or Byrne JAG grants. We also assist directly in the grant-writing process if needed.

Suja Sukumaran: I see continued integration of handheld and lab workflows, ensuring rapid, safe, and confirmatory results. As new synthetic drugs emerge, maintaining updated libraries and leveraging techniques like Raman microscopy and SERS will be essential.

Bill Kotowski: And in the field, it's about speed and safety. Handheld Raman will continue to be critical for first responders, correctional officers, and border agents who need to make quick decisions while minimizing risk.

The World Health Organization (WHO) today warns that less than one in three countries around the world has a national policy to address the growing burden of neurological disorders, responsible for over 11 million deaths globally each year. The WHO's new Global status report on neurology released today shows that neurological conditions now affect more than 40% of the global population – over 3 billion people.

The top 10 neurological conditions contributing to death and disability as of 2021 were stroke, neonatal encephalopathy, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, diabetic neuropathy, meningitis, idiopathic epilepsy, neurological complications linked to preterm birth, autism spectrum disorders, and cancers of the nervous systems.

Low-income countries have more than 80 times fewer neurologists compared to high-income nations despite the high burden of these diseases. Many low- and middle-income countries lack national plans, budgets and workforce. WHO is calling for urgent, evidence-based and coordinated global action to prioritize brain health and expand neurological care.

With more than 1 in 3 people in the world living with conditions affecting their brain we must do all we can to improve the health care they need. Many of these neurological conditions can be prevented or effectively treated, yet services remain out of reach for most – especially in rural and underserved areas – where people too often face stigma, social exclusion and financial hardship. We must work together to ensure we put patients and their families first and that brain health is prioritized and properly invested in."

Dr. Jeremy Farrar, WHO Assistant Director-General, Division of Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Control

The first-of-its-kind report highlights that only 53% of WHO Member States (102 countries out of 194) contributed to this report – an indicator of the limited attention given to neurology. Just 32% of Member States (63 countries) have a national policy addressing neurological disorders, and only 18% (34 countries) report having dedicated funding to address them.

Without strong policy frameworks, health systems remain fragmented, under-resourced and ill-equipped to meet the needs of patients and families. While public awareness-raising campaigns and advocacy efforts are making progress, there is still significant room to strengthen them – reducing stigma, accelerating reform, and ensuring millions receive the care, and recognition they deserve.

Essential services are out of reach for most people. Only 25% of Member States (49 countries) include neurological disorders in their universal health coverage benefit packages. Critical services such as stroke units, pediatric neurology, rehabilitation, and palliative care are frequently lacking or concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural and underserved populations without access to lifesaving and life-sustaining care.

The report reveals a severe lack of qualified health professionals, with low-income countries facing up to 82 times fewer neurologists per 100 000 people compared to high-income nations. This shortage means that for many patients, timely diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing care are simply out of reach.

Neurological conditions often require lifelong care. Yet only 46 Member States offer carer services and just 44 Member States have legal protections in place for carers. As a result, informal carers – most often women – are left without recognition or support, reinforcing social inequities and placing a significant financial strain on families.

Weak health information systems and chronic underfunding of research – particularly in low- and middle-income countries – limit evidence-based decision-making and prevent the design of effective policies on neurological disorders.

In response to these growing public health challenges, Member States adopted the Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders in 2022 to reduce the burden and impact of neurological conditions.

The action plan provides countries with a roadmap to strengthen policy prioritization, ensure timely and effective care including health promotion and disease prevention, improve data systems, and engage people with lived experience in shaping more inclusive policies and services.

Without action, the burden of neurological disorders will continue to rise, deepening global health inequalities. WHO urges governments to:

In a landmark public health achievement, the World Health Organization (WHO) has validated the Maldives for eliminating mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of hepatitis B, while maintaining its earlier validation (in 2019) for EMTCT of HIV and syphilis. This makes the Maldives the first country in the world to achieve 'triple elimination'.

Maldives has shown that with strong political will and sustained investment in maternal and child health, elimination of mother-to-child transmission of these deadly diseases, and the suffering they bring, is possible. This historic milestone provides hope and inspiration for countries everywhere working towards the same goal."

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General

Mother-to-child transmission leads to infections that affect millions worldwide. In the WHO South-East Asia Region alone, provisional estimates indicate that in 2024, more than 23 000 pregnant women had syphilis and over 8000 infants were born with congenital syphilis. About 25 000 HIV-positive pregnant women required treatment to prevent transmission to their babies, while hepatitis B continues to affect more than 42 million people in the Region.

"Maldives' achievement is a testament to its unwavering commitment towards universal health coverage, to provide quality and equitable care across its dispersed islands to all, including migrants." said Dr Catharina Boehme, Officer-in-Charge, WHO South-East Asia Regional Office. "This landmark feat is an important step towards 'Healthy Beginnings, Hopeful Futures,' for improving maternal and newborn health by ending preventable deaths and prioritizing long-term well-being. I congratulate Maldives and look forward to the country pioneering progress in many other areas, while sustaining these gains."

Over years, Maldives has built an integrated and comprehensive approach to maternal and child health. More than 95% of pregnant women receive antenatal care, with nearly universal testing for HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B. The country also has a strong immunization system, with over 95% of newborns consistently receiving a timely dose of hepatitis B birth dose and full vaccine coverage, protecting infants from lifelong infection. As a result, no babies were born with HIV or syphilis in 2022 and 2023, while a 2023 national survey confirmed zero hepatitis B among young children (first grade of school), surpassing elimination targets. These achievements are backed by universal health coverage, which guarantees free antenatal care, vaccines and diagnostic services for all residents, including migrants, supported by strong policies and investment of over 10% of GDP in health.

"This historic validation is a moment of immense pride for the Maldives and a reflection of our nation's steadfast commitment to protecting mothers, children and future generations," said H.E Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim, Minister of Health, Maldives. "Achieving triple elimination is not only a milestone for our health sector, but also a pledge by the Government to our people that we will continue to invest in resilient, equitable and high-quality health services that leave no one behind."

This milestone reflects strong partnerships between government, private health providers, civil society, and international partners, working together on screening, services, outreach, and technical support.

"The Maldives' triple elimination stands as a powerful example of how sustained investment in health systems, innovation, and community-based care can change the trajectory of public health, said Ms Payden, WHO Representative to Maldives. "WHO is proud to have partnered with the Government of Maldives and will continue to provide technical support to sustain this achievement and ensure that every child across all the islands have a healthy future."

Maldives will continue to strengthen its health system by integrating digital health information, expanding targeted interventions for key populations and migrants, enhancing private sector engagement and reporting and improving laboratory quality management. WHO will support Maldives to ensure sustained elimination efforts to advance progress for broader maternal, child and adolescent health goals.

California this week plans to notify Affordable Care Act marketplace enrollees that their costs could rise sharply next year unless Congress extends subsidies to help people buy health insurance.

Health care analysts say the nation's uninsured population will rise significantly if federal lawmakers do not agree to renew covid-era tax credits, which Congress authorized in 2021 to supplement ACA subsidies.

They're popular too. According to a KFF poll, more than three-quarters of adults, including 59% of Republicans, say they want Congress to extend the enhanced tax credits for people with low and moderate incomes. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, the publisher of California Healthline.

The additional credits have lowered premiums, helped millions of Americans afford the cost of ACA insurance, and lowered the nation's uninsured rate.

Last week, President Donald Trump suggested a health care deal might be in the works. And Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, long aligned with the "Make America Great Again" movement, appeared to endorse an extension of the tax credits, saying in a social media post that she was "absolutely disgusted that health insurance premiums will DOUBLE if the tax credits expire this year."

However, Republican leaders want to reopen the government first, while Democrats want a deal in a bill that ends the shutdown.

If the supplemental subsidies are not extended beyond this year, the amount subsidized consumers pay for their ACA health plans is expected to more than double on average. That would be a painful cost-of-living increase for most of the country's more than 24 million marketplace enrollees, including almost 90% of the nearly 2 million people in Covered California, the largest state-run health insurance marketplace. Analysts say the loss of enhanced credits would lead millions to drop their coverage nationally, including hundreds of thousands in California.

The federal government shutdown stems primarily from a disagreement between Democratic lawmakers, who want to extend the tax credits, and Republicans opposed to the cost and, in many cases, to the landmark health care law itself. One estimate puts the price tag at $350 billion over 10 years. The Democrats hope their stance can help them win back the House in next year's midterm elections, as they did in 2018 following a failed GOP effort to repeal the ACA.

Open enrollment season for 2026 ACA health plans starts Nov. 1 in most states, including California, and enrollees still have no clue whether their premiums will rise exorbitantly next year.

"People need to be able to shop for health plans," says Jessica Altman, executive director of Covered California. "We are at a pivotal moment."

In July, Covered California sent notices to enrollees breaking out the enhanced portion of their federal subsidy that is set to expire. The idea was to give them a warning of how much their costs might rise if they chose to keep the same health plan next year.

In one case, a common scenario for middle-income enrollees, the entire subsidy of $200 a month would go away. Another enrollee stood to lose one-third of a total $600 per month in aid, according to sample notices provided by Covered California.

The additional tax credits have provided financial assistance to many middle-income health plan shoppers who didn't qualify for the original subsidies and increased the amount of aid for many others.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune in late September left the door open to extending the otherwise-expiring tax credits but said "it would have to come with some reforms."

Those might include changes that would reduce the number of enrollees eligible for the extra financial aid, based on income, and reduce or eliminate zero-premium plans, which have become widely available with the advent of the additional tax credits.

If the enhanced subsidies end, Covered California projects its enrollees receiving enhanced subsidies will see their premium costs rise an average of 97%. But the increases will not be borne equally. Depending on age, income, and location, some people will see smaller jumps while others could see their out-of-pocket costs triple, Altman says.

Rural residents, especially in the northern and eastern counties, and along the Monterey Coast, will see disproportionately large cost increases, according to projections from Covered California. Enrollees with incomes over $62,600 will lose financial aid altogether, leaving some who are ages 55-64 with premium bills as high as 30% of their income.

Without the enhanced subsidies, "we're going to see more people experiencing medical debt, more people being either uninsured or underinsured," says Cary Sanders, senior policy director at the nonprofit California Pan-Ethnic Health Network. "And that is the quickest way for families to lose their economic security."

Covered California estimates about 400,000 people would leave the exchange and likely go without insurance. And that, health care professionals and advocates warn, will only heap stress — in the form of more crowded emergency rooms and community clinics — on an already stressed health care system.

But the proportional impact in California will be smaller than in some Republican-led states such as Florida, Texas, and Georgia. Since those states did not embrace the ACA's Medicaid expansion, millions of residents thronged to Obamacare marketplace plans, particularly after the enhanced tax credits made coverage eminently more affordable.

From 2020 to 2025, ACA marketplace enrollment grew nearly 2.5 times in Florida to 4.7 million — more than double California's marketplace enrollment. In Texas, it more than tripled to just under 4 million. Georgia's tripled, too, to 1.5 million.

California has about $190 million for 2026 in state funds to help offset the loss of the enhanced premium subsidies. But that money is currently used to help offset enrollee deductibles, coinsurance payments, and other out-of-pocket expenses. And it's a drop in the bucket compared with the $2.5 billion annually in financial aid Covered California enrollees currently receive from the expiring tax credits.

"A lot of people are going to be shocked at what they're facing," says Rachel Linn Gish, a spokesperson for the nonprofit advocacy group Health Access California. "They're going to have to make super hard choices of, 'Do I cut back on my groceries, or my rent, or do I go uninsured?'"

Very soon, Covered California and other ACA marketplaces will have to send out formal open enrollment letters, notifying enrollees precisely what to expect for 2026 coverage.

Covered California typically sends those letters out Oct. 1 but has delayed them to around Oct. 15 in the hope that Washington will provide clarity. For now, Covered California has two versions of the letter on ice, one with tax credit extensions and one without.

Altman says she is hoping for congressional action before sending the one with whopping premium increases. But she may have no choice.

"That's the default here, as in the thing that will happen if nothing changes," Altman says. "It is also the worst-case scenario, unfortunately."

She fears that if Covered California informs enrollees that their rates will likely rise sharply, it will scare many away, even if Congress later agrees to extend the credits.

Around 70% of women who suffer a sexual assault develop PTSD; now scientists have shown that many of these women show a marked reduction in the usual communication between two important brain areas involved in processing and control of emotions, the amygdala and the pre-frontal cortex. In some women, synchronisation between these areas can drop to near zero. This work is presented at the ECNP conference in Amsterdam.

Worldwide, between 17% and 25% of women undergo a sexual assault, with around 70% subsequently developing PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). Previous PTSD studies, after natural disasters, accidents or war, have revealed changes in how the brain communicates. Now a group of Spanish scientists have shown that sexual assault can lead to similar brain changes.

The researchers studied 40 women with PTSD as a result of recent sexual assault trauma (within the past year), recruited from the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, along with a matched control group. All underwent brain scans (via resting-state functional MRI) to look at brain connectivity, and how they relate to depressive and PTSD symptoms. Resting-state fMRI measures how different brain areas communicate with each other.

Lead researcher, Dr. Lydia Fortea (of the Hospital Clinic, Barcelona) said

"PTSD following sexual assault tends to be especially severe and is often accompanied by higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. Despite sexual violence being one of the most widespread forms of trauma affecting women, most research on PTSD has focused on other types of trauma, such as war. This is one of the first, and certainly the largest, connectivity study to look at PTSD in sexual assault in teenagers and adult women.

We looked at how key brain regions involved in fear and emotion regulation synchronise with the rest of the brain in women with PTSD following sexual assault. We focussed on the fronto-limbic system, which plays a crucial role in regulating emotions and responding to threats 

We found that in 22 of the 40 women with PTSD following a recent sexual assault, communication between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex was effectively lost, dropping to zero or near zero. The amygdala helps process emotions like fear, and the prefrontal cortex, helps control and regulate those emotions. When this connection weakens, the brain might struggle to manage fear responses or regulate emotions, which could explain why people with PTSD often experience intense fear and mood changes. 

However, we didn't find that this brain change was directly linked to how severe their PTSD and depressive symptoms were. This suggests that while this brain difference might be a feature of the disorder itself, it's not necessarily a sign of how bad the symptoms are; this is probably dependent on other factors.

This supports the idea that PTSD after sexual assault is linked to problems in brain circuits that regulate emotion and fear. One of the things we will do now is to see if these connectivity disruptions following a sexual assault could help to predict response to PTSD treatment. If so, we would be able to identify early which patients are at risk of worse outcomes and intensify clinical efforts to help them recover. So far, this is a study of 40 women, but the work is ongoing. We need more studies to confirm the findings".

Commenting, Dr. Marin Jukić (from the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, and the University of Belgrade, Serbia) said:

"This study demonstrates profound fronto-limbic dysconnectivity in women with PTSD following sexual assault, a population historically underrepresented in brain connectivity research. The finding that amygdala–prefrontal communication can drop to near zero underscores the severity of circuit-level disruptions in emotional regulation networks after trauma. Notably, the absence of a direct correlation with symptom severity suggests that these connectivity deficits may serve more as a biological signature of the disorder rather than a state-dependent marker. This raises the possibility that such disruptions could become predictive biomarkers for treatment response, guiding personalized interventions. However, larger longitudinal studies are needed to determine how these neural patterns evolve and whether targeted therapies can ameliorate connectivity".

When anesthesiologists lead the preoperative process, patients undergoing surgery for hip fractures - one of the leading causes of hospitalization in older adults - get to the operating room (OR) faster and have fewer complications, according to a study presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2025 annual meeting.

Due to unnecessary consultations and medical tests that can occur prior to getting patients to the OR, hip fracture patients often experience surgical delays of 24 hours or more. These delays can sharply raise the risk of complications, such as blood clots, infections and death. Additionally, because hip fracture patients are usually older, frail and have multiple health conditions, the traumatic nature of the injury and immobilization can cause a rapid deterioration in physical and mental well-being. The faster patients get to the OR to reverse the trauma and start recovery, the better their outcome, the authors note.

Anesthesiologists are uniquely trained to quickly identify any conditions that must be addressed before surgery, as well as recognize those that can wait until after the procedure. After a hip fracture, every hour counts, and by avoiding unnecessary delays and focusing on what truly matters for safe surgery, we can help patients get to surgery and back on their feet faster."

Sabatino Leffe, D.O., senior author of the study and vice chairman of Northwell Southshore University Hospital, Bay Shore, New York

At most hospitals, hip fracture patients are seen by an emergency room or orthopedic physician who works with the internal medicine physician or hospitalist to admit the patient and schedule the surgery. The physician(s) may order various tests to rule out heart, neurological or other issues, even when patients don't have active symptoms or the test results won't change the immediate management of the patient. This can delay surgery for hours and sometimes days.

In the study, researchers developed an anesthesiologist-led process early in the admission process for hip fracture patients. Anesthesiologists assessed patients to ensure they were healthy to undergo anesthesia in order to reach the OR as soon as possible. They determined if the patient's heart and lungs were stable, standard tests were normal and less urgent issues could be handled after surgery. If a serious problem was found - such as an uncontrolled heart rhythm or fluid in the lungs - the anesthesiologist consulted with the appropriate specialist and set clear treatment goals to get the patient stabilized and into surgery as quickly as possible.

To determine if the anesthesiologist-led system made a difference, researchers compared 130 patients treated with the traditional approach to 392 patients treated with the anesthesiologist-led approach. The average age of the patients in both groups was 79.

Those in the traditional process group were brought to the OR an average of 30.8 hours after admission, while those in the anesthesiologist-led group were brought to the OR an average of 25.7 hours after admission, about five hours faster. Patients in the anesthesiologist-led group had significantly fewer complications than those in the traditional group. For example, those in the anesthesiologist-led group had 59% fewer heart or lung complications and 75% fewer thromboembolic complications (such as blood clots) than those in the traditional group. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding length of stay, infection or death.

An aging population is driving a dramatic rise in the incidence of hip fractures, which are typically caused by a combination of having fragile bones (osteoporosis) and falling or other trauma, said Dr. Leffe. About 350,000 Americans fracture a hip annually, according to research. Many never regain their prior level of mobility and independence and/or suffer from long-term complications, including cognitive decline, chronic pain, pneumonia or bedsores.

"Our study demonstrates that a preoperative process primarily led by the anesthesiologist results in markedly improved time to surgery, with fewer complications and no increase in deaths or length of stay," said Surya Indukuri, B.S., lead author of the study and a medical student at Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra University, Uniondale, New York. "We are confident this expedited care will reduce unnecessary testing and shorten hospital stays, which should result in significant cost savings."

Infertility affects about one in six couples, and male factors account for roughly half of all cases-often because sperm don't swim well. Researchers from the University of Osaka uncovered a key component of the "switch" that keeps the movement signal strong, offering a promising new avenue for both diagnosis and treatment. When this switch is absent, sperm slow down, and fertilization fails. By restoring that signal in the lab, the team rescued swimming and achieved healthy births in mice.

For sperm to successfully fertilize an egg, they must be able to swim, a process driven by their tail. This movement is activated by an essential signaling molecule called cyclic AMP (cAMP). While it was known that an enzyme named soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) produces cAMP inside sperm, the precise mechanism controlling this enzyme's stability and function remained largely a mystery.

The research team focused on a protein with a previously unknown function, TMEM217, which is produced specifically in the testes. They engineered mice that could not produce TMEM217 and found that the males were completely infertile, with sperm that were almost entirely immotile. Further investigation revealed that TMEM217 partners with another protein, SLC9C1, to form a stable complex.

This complex is crucial for maintaining the presence of the sAC in mature sperm. Without TMEM217, SLC9C1 is lost and sAC is markedly reduced, causing cAMP levels to plummet and sperm motility to fail. In a significant breakthrough, the team took the immotile sperm from these mice and treated them with a cAMP analog-a molecule that mimics cAMP. This treatment successfully restored the sperm's movement and enabled them to fertilize eggs in vitro, leading to the birth of healthy pups.

This study has revealed a fundamental "switch" in sperm, providing a deeper understanding of sperm motility regulation. The discovery of the TMEM217-SLC9C1-sAC axis offers a new target for diagnosing unexplained cases of male infertility.

We pinpointed a simple way to restart immotile sperm by adding a cAMP analog. It's an encouraging step toward practical options for some forms of male infertility."

A major international study has uncovered a new vulnerability in prostate cancer cells that could help improve treatment for one of the most common cancers affecting men.

The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), was led by scientists from Flinders University in Australia and South China University of Technology.

It reveals that two enzymes - PDIA1 and PDIA5 - play a crucial role in helping prostate cancer cells grow, survive, and resist treatment.

These enzymes act as molecular bodyguards for the androgen receptor (AR), a protein that fuels prostate cancer. When PDIA1 and PDIA5 are blocked, the AR becomes unstable and breaks down, leading to cancer cell death and tumour shrinkage in both lab-grown cells and animal models.

The team also found that combining drugs that block PDIA1 and PDIA5 with enzalutamide, a widely used prostate cancer medication, significantly boosted the treatment's effectiveness.

We've discovered a previously unknown mechanism that prostate cancer cells use to protect the androgen receptor, which is a key driver of the disease.

By targeting these enzymes, we can destabilize the AR and make tumours more vulnerable to existing therapies like enzalutamide."

Luke Selth, Senior Author, Professor, Head of Prostate Cancer Research and Co-Director of Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute's Cancer Impact program

Lead author, Professor Jianling Xie, who started the research whilst at Flinders University, says that this combination therapy worked well in patient-derived tumour samples and in mice, suggesting strong potential for future clinical trials.

"This is an exciting step forward," says Dr. Xie, now at South China University of Technology.

"Our findings show that PDIA1 and PDIA5 are not just helpers of cancer growth but they're also promising targets for new treatments that could work alongside existing drugs."

Interestingly, the role of these enzymes goes beyond protecting the AR. The study found that PDIA1 and PDIA5 also help cancer cells manage stress and maintain energy production.

Blocking them causes damage to the cells' mitochondria - the parts of the cell that generate energy - and leads to oxidative stress, which further weakens the cancer.

"This dual impact of hitting both the AR and the cancer's energy supply makes these enzymes especially attractive targets," adds Dr Xie.

"It's like cutting off both the fuel and the engine at the same time."

Professor Selth adds that while current drugs that block PDIA1 and PDIA5 show promise, more work is needed to make them safe and effective for use in patients. Some of the existing compounds may affect healthy cells, so future studies will focus on developing safer inhibitors.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. Although treatments like hormone therapy and AR-targeting drugs have helped many patients, resistance to these therapies is a major challenge. This new discovery could help overcome that hurdle and improve outcomes for men with advanced prostate cancer.

The study was supported by Cancer Council SA, Cancer Council NSW, the Flinders Foundation, the Movember Foundation, Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia, The Hospital Research Foundation, Cancer Australia, Masonic Charities Trust, Australian Research Council, and several international funding bodies.

How do people keep the beat to music? When people listen to songs, slow waves of activity in the brain correspond to the perceived beat so that they can tap their feet, nod their heads, or dance along. In a new JNeurosci paper, researchers led by Cédric Lenoir, from Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), explored whether this ability is unique to hearing or whether it also happens when rhythm is delivered by touch. 

The researchers recorded brain activity as study volunteers finger tapped to the beat of music delivered via sound or rhythmic vibration. With sound, the brain generated slow rhythmic fluctuations that matched the perceived beat, and people tapped along to the rhythm more steadily. However, with touch, the brain mainly tracked each burst of vibrations one by one, without creating the same beat-like fluctuations, and people were less precise in the way they synchronized with the rhythm. 

The ability to move in time with a beat is essential for human social interactions through music. Future research will help clarify whether long-term music practice can strengthen the brain's ability to process rhythm through other senses, or whether sensory loss, such as hearing impairment, might allow the sense of touch to take over part of this function."

A major UK cohort study uncovers widespread eating disorder symptoms among diverse adolescents, exposing urgent gaps in recognition, cultural care, and long-held assumptions about who is truly at risk.

*Important notice:  Preprints with The Lancet / SSRN publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

In a recent study posted to the SSRN Preprints with The Lancet server*, researchers investigated associations between sociodemographic characteristics and eating disorder (ED) symptoms in adolescents.

EDs are psychiatric disorders linked to extensive psychiatric and physical comorbidity and high mortality. ED incidence in primary care in the UK has increased over the past two decades, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, and in young adolescents aged 11–16, a period of peak ED incidence.

A UK survey found that 13% of people aged 11–16 met the probable ED threshold in 2022. However, these estimates were from the Development and Well-being Assessment's ED module, which is susceptible to false positives and shows moderate agreement with clinical diagnoses. Other UK estimates have focused on clinical samples, limiting generalizability.

In the present cross-sectional study, researchers examined the prevalence of ED symptoms and their associations with sociodemographic characteristics in UK adolescents. Data from the “Born in Bradford Age of Wonder” cohort of school pupils aged 12–15 were used, which has a high proportion of South Asian participants. Data were collected from September 2023 to July 2024 using two sequential questionnaires, with all ED measures drawn from the first survey. The EDE-QS collected data on ED symptoms.

EDE-QS captured the frequency of key symptoms, including binge eating, restrictive eating, and weight/shape concerns. Probable ED was defined as an EDE-QS score ≥ 15, a screening cut-off validated in adult community samples, and sensitivity analyses were performed using a slightly lower cut-off to define probable ED (≥ 13). Because item 10 depends on reporting loss of control at item 9, missing responses on item 10 were set to zero when item 9 indicated no loss of control. The authors noted that the psychometric performance of EDE-QS in ethnically diverse early adolescents has not been fully validated.

Probable ED was defined using an EDE-QS score ≥ 15. ED symptom distribution was described by sociodemographic characteristics: sex, school year group, ethnicity, area-level deprivation, and gender identity. Area-level deprivation was analyzed using the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2019.

Participants self-reported sex as male or female as assigned at birth and gender identity as female, male, or non-binary; there was also a free-text option to further describe gender identity. The researchers created a gender identity variable based on these free-text descriptions and responses: gender diverse (gender identity differed from sex assigned at birth) or cisgender (gender identity aligned with sex assigned at birth). Probable ED prevalence by gender identity was not stratified by sex due to small numbers.

The team estimated the proportion of participants meeting the probable ED threshold by sociodemographic variables. Sex-stratified probable ED prevalence was reported by area deprivation and ethnicity. Linear regression was performed to explore associations between sociodemographic characteristics and EDE-QS scores.

Overall, 9,498 individuals completed at least one survey. Among these, 7,434 had complete data and were included in analyses. Most participants were female (51.9%), Asian (45.9%), and lived in the most deprived areas (60.9%). The median EDE-QS score was four, and more than 17% of participants had an EDE-QS score ≥ 15. Probable ED prevalence was higher in females (23.5%) than in males (10.7%) and among gender diverse participants (37.9%) than in cisgender individuals (17.1%).

Moreover, gender diverse individuals and females had higher EDE-QS scores than cisgender participants and males, respectively. Asian participants had lower EDE-QS scores than White individuals. Among females, probable ED prevalence was the highest among White subjects, while among males, it was the highest in those of other ethnicities. Probable ED prevalence was lower in the least deprived areas.

Participants from the most deprived areas had higher EDE-QS scores than those in the least deprived areas. Probable ED prevalence was higher among females and males in the most deprived areas than in the least deprived areas. Moreover, males and females from the most deprived areas had higher EDE-QS scores compared to those from the least deprived areas. The most frequently reported symptoms were dissatisfaction with shape or weight and a strong desire to lose weight.

Compulsive exercise was the most frequently reported ED symptom among males, whereas dissatisfaction with shape or weight was the most common in females. Laxative use or self-induced vomiting were the least common symptoms in males and females. Gender diverse participants had higher endorsement of all symptoms than their cisgender peers. All ED symptoms were less prevalent in Asian females compared to White females.

Asian, Black, or other ethnic males had a higher prevalence of fasting and dietary restriction than White males. Females from the most deprived areas showed a higher prevalence of binge eating, fasting, purging, and dietary restriction than those from the least deprived areas. Males from the most deprived areas had a higher prevalence of nearly all symptoms. In sensitivity analyses, associations were consistent with those in the primary analysis.

Together, there was a high prevalence of ED symptoms in UK adolescents. Shape and weight dissatisfaction were common across sociodemographic groups. Ethnic minority males had more ED symptoms than White males, whereas White females had more symptoms than their Black and Asian peers. The findings challenge the misconception that EDs predominantly affect affluent White populations, highlighting a need to address inequalities in recognition and care. Overall, the results suggest the need for culturally sensitive strategies to prevent and treat EDs, accounting for the interplay between ethnicity and sex. The authors also note that EDE-QS psychometrics are not fully established in ethnically diverse young adolescents and that the cohort's composition may affect generalizability.

Sepsis, or infection causing life-threatening organ dysfunction, is a leading cause of death in children worldwide. In efforts to prevent this rare but critical condition, researchers developed and validated AI models that accurately identify children at high risk for sepsis within 48 hours, so that early preemptive care can be provided. These predictive models used routine electronic health record (EHR) data from the first four hours the child spent in the Emergency Department (ED), before organ dysfunction was present.

The multi-center study, led by Elizabeth Alpern, MD, MSCE, from Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, is the first to use AI models to predict sepsis in children based on the new Phoenix Sepsis Criteria. Findings were published in JAMA Pediatrics.

The predictive models we developed are a huge step toward precision medicine for sepsis in children. These models showed robust balance in identifying children in the ED who will later develop sepsis, without overidentifying those who are not at risk. This is very important because we want to avoid aggressive treatment for children who don't need it."

Dr. Elizabeth Alpern, lead author and Division Head of Emergency Medicine at Lurie Children's, Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine

The study included five health systems contributing to the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), which provided Dr. Alpern and colleagues access to a large dataset and diverse population. Children with sepsis already at arrival or within the first hours of ED care were excluded, focusing the goal of the study on predicting sepsis, to allow for early initiation of therapies that have been proven as lifesaving.

"We evaluated our models to ensure that there were no biases," said Dr. Alpern. "Future research will need to combine EHR-based AI models with clinician judgment to make even better predictions."

This project work was supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) grant R01HD087363.

Dr. Alpern holds the George M. Eisenberg Professorship in Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

COMMERCE CITY, Colorado — The U.S. Soccer Federation is finalizing plans to stage two high-profile U.S. World Cup tuneups within days of each other at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium in the spring, multiple sources told Yahoo Sports.

In a highly unusual arrangement, the national team would face Portugal and Belgium at the same location in late March — the final international window before Mauricio Pochettino selects his 26-man World Cup squad.

The Athletic was first to report Portugal and Belgium as the probable opponents. Last month Fox Sports reported the U.S.-Portugal match, featuring superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, would take place at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and that Atlanta was among the candidates for the second game.

However, the USSF now seems intent on playing both games at the retractable-roof facility, which is home to the NFL's Atlanta Falcons and MLS' Atlanta United, three sources said.

Mercedes-Benz Stadium officials said they did not want to comment and referred questions to the USSF, which also declined to speak on the matter.

Hosting two matches in one city would allow the USSF to stage multiple non-game events around the team's extended stay and strengthen ties with the Atlanta area, the future site of federation headquarters and the national training center.

The only time in recent years the U.S. team played back-to-back friendlies at the same venue was the 2016 winter camp in Carson, California, but that fell outside an official FIFA window with secondary players for games in a small stadium.

Typically, the U.S. team reports to camp in a metro area on Monday, plays there on Friday or Saturday, then moves to another city for a friendly the following Tuesday.

For instance, in the current window, Pochettino's team trained in Austin, Texas, before playing Ecuador last Friday, then traveled to the Denver area for Tuesday's friendly against Australia. Next month the Americans will report to greater Philadelphia before a match against Paraguay, then face Uruguay in Tampa.

The March window, however, allows for higher-profile matches involving European teams that have qualified for the World Cup. Atlanta was a natural choice for one match because, in preparation for hosting eight World Cup matches, Mercedes-Benz Stadium will install a grass field in early 2026. In addition, Atlanta United is MLS' best-supported team.

Appearing on a Friday night or Saturday, Ronaldo and Portugal would help sell tickets and perhaps fill the stadium, which holds more than 71,000. (Portugal is on pace to qualify for its seventh consecutive World Cup.)

A Belgium game on a Tuesday would not have the same drawing power, but for aesthetic purposes, the stadium would drape off the upper deck – a common practice for Atlanta United matches – and accommodate as many as 42,500. Belgium is expected to qualify for the World Cup, though it is in a tighter race.

The U.S. men's team has played 2015 Gold Cup and 2024 Copa América matches in Atlanta but hasn't held a friendly there since 1977.

The proposed games would further strengthen the USSF's ties to greater Atlanta. The organization is building a headquarters and training center about 20 miles south of the capital in Fayetteville, Georgia. The facility is named for Arthur M. Blank, the Falcons and Atlanta United owner who pledged $50 million to the project. His company, AMB Sports and Entertainment, operates Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

The new training center will not be completed in time for the U.S. team's proposed March visit; the delegation probably would use Atlanta United's facility in Marietta, Georgia.

October 14, 2025, 2:37 PM

NEW YORK (AP) — The owner of Spanish soccer club Mallorca says FIFA risks damage to the sport's image with its ticket prices for next year's World Cup.

Andy Kohlberg, a former professional tennis player who took control of the club two years ago, spoke following a promotional event on Tuesday and said “the message (that) has gotten out so far has been primarily negative and that's not a good thing.”

FIFA has refused to put out a ticket price grid for the tournament in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, as it has for every other World Cup since at least 1990, and has said only the most expensive regular seat is $6,730 for the final and the cheapest ticket for the 104-game tournament is $60.

FIFA's website has offered hospitality tickets at prices up to $73,200 per person for the eight matches at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, including the final on July 19.

In addition, FIFA's resale site says the governing body will take a 15% fee from a seller's revenue and charge a 15% fee to a buyer.

“They have to be careful. It's gotten a lot of bad press,” Kohlberg said. “You have to cater to the mainstream fan and at the same time provide an elevated experience for people who want to pay for that. But you can't mix them too much with ticket prices at such a high average and alienate the core fan base, which in terms of numbers is a lot higher but in terms of dollar revenues at a stadium event may not be so high.”

FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Kohlberg expressed caution about La Liga's decision to move Barcelona's Dec. 20 match against Villarreal from Spain to Miami Gardens, Florida, the first major European league game to be played in the United States.

“We have to be pretty discerning and careful 'cause it angers some of our fans,” Kohlberg said. ”It's a lot more controversial in Spain, that people get upset when a game is played out of their country and out of their stadium, whereas in the U.S., they welcome the NFL playing in London. It's not the same over there. It's a different culture and different mentality, so you have to tread pretty carefully.”

Kohlberg hasn't decided whether to attend the match at the Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium.

“I'll be paying attention,” he said, “but looking at the media and what the pushback is and has been in Spain and is that subsiding or getting worse? And what's the American market's reaction to that game in terms of attendance and fan viewership and what the experience has been?”

Kohlberg, who lives in a San Diego suburb, originally was a non-controlling owner when a group headed by then-Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver took control of Mallorca in a deal announced in January 2016. Former NBA star Steve Kerr and Steve Nash and former U.S. soccer star Stu Holden are among the club's investors, and Kohlberg said another well-known person will be announced soon.

The Spanish league, dominated by Real Madrid and Barcelona, has a more difficult task at increasing U.S. interest than England's Premier League.

“With (Kylian) Mbappé and Lamine Yamal, I think it has some momentum and can continue to grow. Our belief is they'll never be the same with the Premier League but the gap will start to narrow a little bit,” Kohlberg said. “Premier League and NBC have done an incredible job and spent an enormous amount of money and so I don't think La Liga or ESPN can match that. But they can do enough to close the gap and I think that's the hope.”

Mallorca, which has played in Spain's top division since 1997-98, had a top 10 finish in 2022-23 and 2024-25, won the Copa del Rey in 2003 and reached the 1999 European Cup Winners' Cup final but lost to Italian club Lazio. Its Estadi Mallorca Son Moix was remodeled in a project completed last year, and it has seven premium areas in an effort to attract supporters to a team based in the Balearic Islands.

“We have an element of the population that can and will afford it. But it would be very hard to do what we're doing in Levante or Elche or Alaves,” he said. ”It wouldn't work. But because we have 18 million tourists coming, there's a small segment that'll come to the game.”

Arsenal defender Cristhian Mosquera is considering switching international allegiance from Spain after being promised a spot elsewhere at the 2026 World Cup in North America. Mosquera, born in the city of Alicante, has represented the Spanish national team at various youth levels, but he has yet to break into the senior squad. With the World Cup fast approaching, the 21-year-old is considering representing another nation.

Updated 38s ago

England face Latvia in Riga knowing a win today guarantees their place at the 2026 World Cup.

Thomas Tuchel's side need three more points to book their spot in next summer's tournament in the USA, Canada and Mexico.

England play the world's 137th-ranked side after a 3-0 friendly win against Wales on Thursday.

England XI: Pickford; Spence, Konsa, Stones, Lewis-Skelly; Anderson, Rice; Saka, Rogers, Gordon; Kane.

Marcus Rashford can be ‘one of the world's best' with consistency, says Thomas Tuchel

Thomas Tuchel's team has been announced for tonight's game and it contains some interesting choices. 

Anthony Gordon is preferred to Marcus Rashford on the left. Lewis-Skelly at left-back, Djed Spence at right-back. Ezri Konsa over Marc Guehi at centre-back. 

Big chance for those players to prove themselves to the manager.

While Paolo Nicolato has named the below XI for the home side tonight.

Latvia (5-3-2): Zviedris; Veips, Jurkovskis, Cernomordijs, Balodis, Ciganiks; Varslavans, Vapne, Zelenkovs; Gutkovskis, Ikaunieks.

Substitutes: Orols (GK), Matrevics (GK); Jagodinskis, Savalnieks, Tonisevs, Melniks, Saveljevs, Grabovskis, Daskevics, Penkevics, Regza, Pulis.

With a World Cup qualification spot confirmed with victory tonight, England boss Thomas Tuchel has gone pretty much as strong as he could have.

Only two changes: Marc Guehi is rested in a defensive reshuffle, while captain Harry Kane is fit to come in up front to replace his deputy Ollie Watkins, who picked up a knock on Thursday against Wales.

Guehi dropping to the bench will see Djed Spence and Ezri Konsa return to their more natural positions at right-back and centre-half respectively, with Myles Lewis-Skelly coming in at left-back.

Kane for Watkins is a direct switch at striker.

England substitutes: D. Henderson (GK), Trafford (GK); Guehi, Burn, O'Reilly, J. Henderson, Loftus-Cheek, Gibbs-White, Eze, Bowen, Rashford.

Thomas Tuchel's men line up as follows this evening.

England (4-2-3-1): Pickford; Spence, Konsa, Stones, Lewis-Skelly; Anderson, Rice; Saka, Rogers, Gordon; Kane.

The England XI has been announced.

Let's take a look ...

The UK political right is weaponising football. This is why, and how it's cutting through.

English football, right-wing politics, and a new front in the culture wars

FIFA has changed the men's international calendar for the 2026-2030 period by merging the September and October international breaks into one.

Currently, separate windows in September and October sees nations play a maximum of two matches in each, but from next year onwards, this will be condensed into one period with a maximum of four matches.

The change means the Premier League and other top European divisions will miss around a three-week break (say, from September 21 to October 10, 2026) providing extra time for club fixtures. 

The first of the new windows will see the first four matches of the 2026-27 Nations League campaign for European countries.

England head coach Thomas Tuchel has told Marcus Rashford he can still be “one of the best in the world”, but that he needs to improve his output.

Tuchel has tried to resurrect Rashford's England career this year, but warned the 27-year-old could still fail to fulfil his huge potential. 

Rashford has one goal in five England appearances under Tuchel, and three goals so far in his loan spell at Barcelona from Manchester United.

He said:

💬 “That is the headline for him, to keep on pushing himself to the limit. The limit for him is very, very high. Maybe higher than for others. 

“He has the potential but potential is a dangerous word with high-level sports.”

Since making his England debut against Andorra in September, Anderson has started victories against Serbia and Wales.

The 22-year-old, who previously played for Scotland's junior teams, has been the preferred central midfield partner for Declan Rice.

With Tuchel opting against calling up Real Madrid playmaker Jude Bellingham and in-form Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton, it adds further credence to the belief that the Anderson and Rice partnership is here to stay.

It was a position that had a plethora of options, from Kobbie Mainoo to Curtis Jones and Angel Gomes, but their lack of consistency has enabled Anderson to leapfrog them in the pecking order.

As the World Cup approaches, Tuchel appears unlikely to tinker in midfield, allowing Anderson's importance to grow. If he starts next to Rice again tonight, it will be another indication of his importance.

The friendly win over Wales was Jordan Pickford's eighth clean sheet in a row for England, breaking the national team's record for a goalkeeper.

The previous mark of seven had been set firstly by Gordon Banks, with the last of those games being the 1966 World Cup quarter-final against Argentina at Wembley, which England won 1-0. 

Pickford then equalled Banks' record in 2021, with his final clean sheet of that run coming in the quarter-finals of Euro 2020 against Ukraine. 

But now, following the shutout against Wales, Pickford holds the record outright and will be eager to extend it further against Latvia tonight.

England started this international break with a friendly against old rivals Wales and secured a pretty easy 3-0 win. 

Three first-half goals, from Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins and Bukayo Saka, secured a pretty routine victory at Wembley.

Serbia had been in an excellent position to overhaul Albania in second place in World Cup qualifying Group K.

But Serbia lost 1-0 against Albania on Saturday. Rey Manaj's goal condemned the home side to back-to-back defeats, with head coach Dragan Stojkovic resigning from his post after the final whistle.

That means England are on the verge of securing qualification for next summer's tournament and will do so with a win against Latvia, who are second bottom of the group, tonight.

It's been the perfect start in terms of points for England in World Cup qualifying Group K.

They sit top of the pile with 15 from a possible 15 after five wins from five, having scored 13 and conceded none.

Second-placed Albania have a four-point gap to Serbia in third and will stay in the runner-up slot (at least temporarily) even if Serbia win their game in hand.

Latvia and definitely Andorra are basically out of contention.

In England's most recent World Cup qualifying match, a stunning 5-0 win against Serbia on September 9, everything finally clicked.

Harry Kane and then Noni Madueke scored inside three minutes, the latter a brilliant run and finish, before Ezri Konsa and Marc Guehi, plus Marcus Rashford from the penalty spot, made it a near-perfect outing for the visitors.

Their toughest rivals in World Cup qualifying were dispatched away from home with minimum fuss.

Goalkeepers: Rihards Matrevics, Krisjanis Zviedris, Frenks Davids Orols.

Defenders: Roberts Savalnieks, Andrejs Ciganiks, Raivis Andris Jurkovskis, Antonijs Cernomordijs, Vitalijs Jagodinskis, Daniels Balodis, Deniss Melniks, Maksim Tonisevs, Roberts Veips. 

Midfielders: Alexejs Saveljevs, Eduards Daskevics, Renars Varslavans, Dmitrijs Zelenkovs, Lukass Vapne, Kristers Penkevics, Kristaps Grabovskis, Danila Patijchuks.

Forwards: Janis Ikaunieks, Vladislavs Gutkovskis, Marco Regza, Ingars Pulis.

Maybe it's not a surprise there are a few high-profile players missing out. 

After all, the dominant themes of this England squad selection, when it was announced at Wembley at the start of this international break, were loyalty and continuity. Tuchel said:

💬 “Are there players out who deserve to be with us? Yes, for sure. Is there a way back into the team through performance? 100 per cent, for sure. 

“But at the moment, we think this is the best and most straightforward decision. Like I said last camp, the competition is on to be in the squad. That still stands.

“What are we doing if a player like Jude (Bellingham) is injured before the World Cup? Do we then cancel? Do we not travel? This is a team sport. We have to find solutions. 

“This is more about the last camp and what we started to build, than about the dependence on individual players.”

This England squad has arguably been defined by its conspicuous absences as much as its inclusions.

Jack Grealish, who joined Everton on loan after being frozen out at Manchester City, has started very well, with our very own Patrick Boyland saying he has ‘allowed Everton to dream again'.

Trevoh Chalobah has come in and out, the midfield exclusions of Curtis Jones and especially Adam Wharton appear mystifying, and Phil Foden is out despite returning to form for Manchester City.

While Morgans Rogers and Gibbs-White have been poor for Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest respectively but retain their places. And don't get Tim Spiers started on Jude Bellingham being left out...

✍️ Jude Bellingham, one of England's most gifted young footballers, has been left out of the squad and it's a completely normal situation. Is there a problem with the player? Absolutely not! Nothing to see here. 

Tuchel, famed for not falling out with any star players at the clubs he's managed, said: “We decided to keep with the straightforward decision of inviting the same group.”

It might be an idea to practice with your best players? Actually, no wait, Brazil used to leave out Pele all the time. Deserves to be there? Check. Not there? Check. You've got to hand it to the guy, it's an original notion.

Much of the criticism of Thomas Tuchel's latest England squad will be aimed at the omission of Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton, particularly when Brentford's Jordan Henderson, 35, is included.

The 85-cap Henderson does have experience but the manager must surely have one eye on blooding Wharton with qualification for the 2026 World Cup all but confirmed.

Elliot Anderson did impress on his debut outing in Belgrade but Wharton's exclusion was still startling, as was that of Jack Grealish, who has started the season well with Everton, alongside Man City's Phil Foden.

Jude Bellingham being absent is perhaps more understandable given his recovery from a shoulder injury.

England will wrap up its place at the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday, provided it beats Latvia in Riga.

With five wins from five in UEFA Group K thus far, England travels to Riga on Tuesday knowing one more win will secure its spot at the 2026 World Cup. The Three Lions met the 11 Wolves for the first time in March when they sealed a 3-0 home win in their second match of the qualifying campaign.

Thomas Tuchel's men enjoyed the same result when they faced off against Wales last Thursday and hope to cap off the international break with a World Cup berth in tow. Latvia, meanwhile, can only clinch a second-place play-off spot at best but needs to pull off a mighty upset against the English to keep that dream alive.

England was already without the injured trio of Reece James, Noni Madueke, and Trent Alexander-Arnold heading into this break. However, Bayer Leverkusen's Jarell Quansah has since joined them on the sidelines after suffering a knee injury last week.

All-time scorer Harry Kane was rested for the meeting with Wales, but should return to the XI as England looks to get its nose over the World Cup line. Latvia's squad isn't exactly flush with star talent, though 21-year-old striker Dario Sits is one name who could be worth keeping tabs on.

Israel has been eliminated from contention for an automatic World Cup qualifying spot, but host Italy is still in with a shot at topping its group as they clash on Tuesday.

There's a lot on the line as Italy hosts Israel in qualifying for the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday, with the home team still in contention to finish first in UEFA Group I. The Azzurri sit six points off leader Norway but boast a game in hand, while the best Israel can hope for is a second-place play-off spot.

That being said, even a play-off place will almost certainly be off the table for Israel if it loses at the Stadio Friuli in Udine this week. Italy sealed a dramatic 5-4 win in Debrecen when these teams collided last month, and Gennaro Gattuso's men have a healthy advantage in goal difference with only three games left in the group phase.

The Azzurri have gone on a tear of four straight wins since losing to Norway in their opening match of the qualifying campaign. However, that singular defeat could still prove to be the difference between Italy and an automatic berth in North America next year.

Israel is winless in eight meetings with Italy to date, though the only encounter in which it avoided defeat in this fixture happened to come at the 1970 World Cup, its sole appearance in the tournament finals to date.

The World Cup qualifiers are entering their final stretch, and not every powerhouse is cruising toward safety. The road to the 2026 World Cup has brought surprises, setbacks, and plenty of drama — with several historic nations now standing on the brink. As the race tightens, some big names may end up watching the world's biggest tournament from home.






Sweden: A Fading Generation


Only mathematics keep Sweden's hopes alive. With just one point from four matches, Jon Dahl Tomasson's side needs a miracle to qualify for the 2026 World Cup. They must defeat Switzerland and Slovenia, hope Kosovo loses twice, and overturn a four-goal deficit.

Despite having attacking talent, Sweden hasn't qualified for a major tournament since Euro 2020, and that drought looks set to continue.


Italy: Haunted by the Playoffs


The Azzurri are desperate to end their longest exile from the World Cup stage. After missing the 2018 and 2022 editions, Gennaro Gattuso's men have won three of their first four qualifiers — yet they still trail an unbeaten Norway side.

To top the group, Italy must win their remaining three games — including a decisive clash with Norway — and hope their rivals drop points against Estonia. If not, they'll face another dreaded playoff, where painful memories of defeats to Sweden and North Macedonia still linger.






Nigeria: Crisis for the Super Eagles


It's looking bleak for Nigeria. Despite a recent win over Lesotho, they sit third in Group C, behind South Africa and Benin, with one match left to play.

Even if they beat Benin, they could still miss out if South Africa defeats Rwanda. Failure to qualify would mark a second consecutive absence for the Super Eagles, who had previously reached six of the last seven tournaments.


Costa Rica and Cameroon: No Room for Error


In CONCACAF, Costa Rica has made life difficult despite an easier path following the automatic qualification of the North American hosts. With only one win in four matches, they trail Honduras by two points and must win both remaining fixtures to avoid the playoffs.

In Africa, Cameroon finished second in their group behind Cape Verde, despite a 4-1 victory earlier in the campaign. They now face the daunting path of the continental playoffs — and possibly the inter-confederation round — to keep their World Cup dream alive.






Saudi Arabia: Pressure Mounts


Having qualified for six of the last eight World Cups, Saudi Arabia faces a decisive moment. Hervé Renard's squad must beat Iraq to progress, after finishing third in their group.

A defeat would send them into another playoff, and potentially the inter-confederation stage. For a country investing heavily in football's global expansion, missing out on 2026 would be a major setback.

FIFA is reportedly preparing to lift its current cap on the number of clubs from a single nation allowed to compete in the Club World Cup. Currently set at two, the proposed increase to three could dramatically impact Premier League contenders, including Liverpool and Arsenal. Despite their historical pedigree and recent domestic success, both clubs missed out on the 2025 edition. If the adjustment is approved, England could send three clubs to future tournaments, offering greater representation for one of Europe's most dominant leagues. For readers who want to turn these structural shifts into personal opportunities, there's a surprise at the end of this article: a special bonus from Melbet that can be activated during registration.

The expanded Club World Cup format, set to debut in 2025, features 32 clubs and operates on a four-year cycle. Designed to showcase football's global reach, the competition is restricted to two clubs per country, regardless of overall domestic strength. While this limit promotes regional diversity, it has also sidelined high-performing teams from top leagues. Notably, Liverpool, Barcelona, and Napoli were all absent from the upcoming edition despite their strong European and domestic campaigns. Critics argue that such exclusions undermine the tournament's ambition to crown the world's best club.

One of FIFA's core objectives is to enhance the credibility of the Club World Cup as a legitimate contest between elite clubs. Leaving out major sides due to technicalities weakens the event's appeal and sparks backlash from fans and analysts alike. The proposed rule change to allow three clubs per country seeks to correct that by ensuring that high-caliber teams can participate based on merit. With fan engagement and global viewership at stake, FIFA is under pressure to elevate the tournament's prestige and competitive integrity.

Premier League clubs have consistently dominated UEFA competitions in recent years, with multiple English teams reaching the final stages of the Champions League and Europa League. Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal, and Manchester United have all made deep runs in continental football. Limiting England to only two slots no longer reflects the league's current strength. Introducing a third berth would align the Club World Cup more closely with performance metrics and enhance its competitive credibility.

According to reports from The Times, UEFA is not expected to challenge FIFA's proposal to increase club representation per nation. This rare harmony between football's global and continental governing bodies opens the door for immediate reform. With discussions scheduled at the upcoming FIFA Council meeting, the three-club rule could soon become a reality. If implemented, it would mark a pivotal shift in how European dominance is acknowledged on the world stage.

Liverpool and Arsenal, two of England's most storied clubs, find themselves at the forefront of this potential opportunity. Both have posted strong performances in domestic and European competitions but fell just short of qualification under the existing rules. The expanded eligibility could provide them with a path to the 2029 tournament, offering global exposure and a chance to compete against the world's best. For clubs that often operate just outside the shadow of Manchester City's dominance, this rule change could be transformative.

As the structure of world football evolves, strategic fans are turning their attention to informed predictions. On Melbet Ghana, users can place targeted bets on major club tournaments, including future Club World Cup winners, player goal totals, and match outcomes. By entering the promo code MELBONUS when creating an account, new users unlock an enhanced welcome bonus – a smart move for those looking to leverage football knowledge into tangible wins.

The potential expansion of Club World Cup slots represents more than just a rule change – it's a recalibration of global football hierarchy. Allowing three clubs per nation could make the competition more inclusive of true performance, not just legacy. For English football, it signals an era where depth is finally rewarded. And for fans, the rise of Liverpool and Arsenal as global contenders is no longer a dream deferred, but a possibility waiting to unfold.

Landon Donovan says that players who missed out on the USMNT's October camp are in danger of "falling behind" with Mauricio Pochettino regardless of their stature within the team.

TOPICS:

In their most recent friendly, the United States Men's National Team managed to draw with Ecuador, 1-1.  While the scoreline may not turn heads or send jaws plummeting towards the floor, the American's performance was largely impressive especially when considering that Ecuador sit 2nd in CONMEBOL's (South America's football federation) World Cup qualification standings having conceded just 5 goals across 18 matches this cycle and that the USMNT were missing a number of their key players.  Antonee Robinson, Sergiño  Dest and Alejandro Zendejas missed out due to injury while Tyler Adams was absent due to the upcoming birth of his 2nd child.  Additionally, Christian Pulisic was limited to 17 minutes off the bench as he recovers from an ankle injury.



While some of these players have long been viewed as vital first-teamers, on the most recent episode of Unfiltered Soccer, Landon Donovan warned that their places as starters aren't necessarily promised.

“Mauricio Pochettino has made it clear that if you play and you play well, you earn the chance to play again. The guys who weren't there now, they're going to fall behind a little bit, right? Like Tyler [Adams], Sergiño [Dest], Jedi [Antonee Robinson] now a little.  We think of them as like... they're a step above. [Pochettino] thinks of it as who's playing well right now and who's available. And that is the way he views it. And he's made it very clear.”

Of those notable absences, Antonee Robinson's has raised the most concern.  He has been dealing with tendinopathy in his knee since last November, a condition which caused him to miss out on the CONCACAF Nations League  semifinals in March, the Gold Cup this past summer, the September friendlies against South Korea and Japan and now this most recent friendly against Ecuador.

“I am now genuinely worried, Tim, about his health,” Donovan stated to his co-host and former U.S. Soccer teammate, Tim Howard, regarding Robinson's situation.  “From talking to people behind the scenes, it's a real issue.”

Robinson experienced a career year in 2024-2025 registering 10 assists from the fullback position across 36 appearances for Fulham in the English Premier League.  But his 2025-2026 campaign has gotten off to a slow start with the 28-year-old making just one start thus far in the 3rd round of the Carabao Cup and 3 substitute appearances from the team's first 7 Premier League matches.  So what course of action should Robinson take in managing the injury and boosting his chances for full fitness at next summer's World Cup?

“He needs to, in my opinion, pause.  Stop.  Go see a specialist do whatever it takes in the next two months, three months, four months, get this thing right,” said Donovan. "He's got his own agenda and whatever, but that's my own selfish national team outlook.”

The USMNT, with or without Robinson, are next in action Tuesday night against Australia, a nation that will be heading to its 6th consecutive World Cup next summer here in North America.

Werder Bremen forward Medina Desic has issued a public apology after celebrating her side's Frauen Bundesliga derby win against Hamburg by holding up a provocative fan sign featuring a poop emoji and their rivals' crest. The 32-year-old admitted the incident was the result of a “moment of euphoria” and insisted she did not intend to insult or provoke anyone.

U.S. men's national team manager Mauricio Pochettino struck an optimistic tone when the topic of Christian Pulisic's fitness was raised this week.

The royally in-form forward was named as a substitute for the USMNT's 1–1 draw with Ecuador on Friday night after struggling with an ankle issue. Pulisic was fit enough to feature for the final 17 minutes of a performance which was universally lauded despite the disappointing nature of the result.

Speaking the day before his side take on Australia in a marquee friendly on Tuesday night, Pochettino was positive about Pulisic's condition. “I think the reaction after the 20 minutes playing [against Ecuador], I think was good,” the Argentine boss noted.

“His ankle I think reacted very well and just hope that tomorrow he can be available. We need to wait today for the reaction too, but I think it's much better than when we he arrived.”

Fulham left back Antonee Robinson—whose return to the roster was one of the big positives from Pochettino's squad announcement—has been carrying a knee problem throughout the international break. “Antonee is, from the beginning of the camp, he's with some small issue in his knee, a little bit of pain,” the 53-year-old lamented.

“We are managing him in the best way, but he still cannot be involved in training and for sure tomorrow cannot be involved in the game. I hope that it's not an important thing, but [can] come back to his club and can be in a normal way there training.”

Pulisic is enjoying the form of his career for AC Milan. The perennially outspoken pundit Alexi Lalas is—for once—not alone in his opinion that the U.S. forward is the best player at San Siro.

Milan's rampant two-way threat boasts four goals and two assists across his opening six Serie A appearances this season—no player in Italy's top flight has directly contributed to more goals—thriving under Massimiliano Allegri's more pared-back approach.

For all of the enthusiasm about Folarin Balogun's strong showing against Ecuador, the USMNT will need Pulisic to begin replicating his club form on the international stage if they are to harbor ambitions of making a deep run in this summer's World Cup.

The national team's No. 10 hasn't scored a goal for his country since Nov. 19, 2024.

A Cycle That May Be Ending


Antonio Rüdiger's time at Real Madrid may be drawing to a close. According to German newspaper Bild, the club does not intend to extend his contract, which runs until 2026, and has already begun exploring defensive alternatives for the future. The decision reportedly follows a series of physical setbacks that have limited his influence in recent months.





The 32-year-old defender arrived on a free transfer from Chelsea in 2022 and became a key figure under Carlo Ancelotti, especially during Éder Militao's long injury absence. During his three seasons, he helped the team lift a Champions League, a LaLiga title, two UEFA Super Cups, a Copa del Rey, and a Spanish Super Cup. But under the club's new direction, his role appears increasingly uncertain.


Xabi Alonso's Defensive Reshuffle


The arrival of Xabi Alonso has reshaped Madrid's defensive hierarchy. The coach has shown faith in a center-back pairing of Militao and young prospect Dean Huijsen, leaving Rüdiger on the fringes. Despite featuring in four of six matches at the Club World Cup, Alonso was reportedly unimpressed with his performances — particularly after the heavy semifinal defeat to PSG.

Rüdiger attributed his poor form to lingering meniscus issues, and just as he seemed to recover, he suffered a muscle injury in his left thigh in September that will sideline him for around three months. That absence has only strengthened the club's resolve to plan for the long term without him.






Madrid Planning for the Future


Rüdiger isn't the only defender facing an uncertain future. David Alaba, now 33, is also set to leave when his contract expires in 2026, while Asencio's place in the squad remains in question after an inconsistent finish to last season. As a result, Real Madrid is already considering a free-agent signing for 2026.

Among the targets are Ibrahima Konaté, whose deal with Liverpool expires this summer, and Marc Guéhi from Crystal Palace, both seen as long-term options to reinforce the back line. The club's rebuilding process has quietly begun — and Rüdiger may be one of the first to go.

Mark Ogden speaks about his trip to Gibraltar to watch New Caledonia. (2:53)

GIBRALTAR -- Germain Haewegene has a mischievous, excitable grin. The New Caledonia forward has just scored the second goal in his country's 2-0 friendly win against Gibraltar, though he knows he has a long night ahead of him. A bus will collect him and his domestic teammates at 2.30 a.m. to begin a 30-hour, 12,000-mile journey home -- just 72 hours after making it in the opposite direction to play their Oct. 8 friendly.

Haewegene is standing outside the visitors locker room in Gibraltar's Europa Point Stadium, holding an apple in his hand -- no protein shakes or rehydration gels for this group of players -- but he wants to talk about his goal, the pride of playing for the South Pacific nation and why even a grueling trip back to the French-controlled archipelago is absolutely nothing to complain about.

"It is a joy to play football and a big joy to score a goal, which I dedicate to my son and my wife," Haewegene told ESPN. "I feel pride for my country and also for my teammates, who did a big job to win this game.

"Yes, we don't have a lot of time before we fly home, but we will prepare our suitcases and go to the airport early. It's no problem. It's the first time New Caledonia has played in Europe and we won, so we are really happy. We don't worry about the journey."

New Caledonia's biggest journey has only just started and the final destination, as incredulous as it seems, could be the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Nicknamed "Les Cagous" after the indigenous flightless bird that inhabits the dozens of islands that form the country, New Caledonia secured their place in next March's FIFA interconfederation playoffs by reaching the final of the Oceania qualification campaign, where they lost 3-0 to New Zealand earlier this year. However, their semifinal win against Tahiti had already sealed the prize of a ticket to the playoffs.

"It is always special to beat Tahiti," midfielder Jekob Jeno said. "They are our big rivals."

Tahiti and New Caledonia are separated by 2,900 miles of ocean, making it perhaps the longest-distance "local" rivalry in sport. But while New Zealand booked Oceania's solitary direct World Cup spot, New Caledonia will travel to Mexico for the interconfederation playoffs in Guadalajara and Monterrey knowing they're just two victories from the World Cup.

They are a team consisting of part-timers playing in New Caledonia's 10-team Super Ligue and several who play no higher than the fifth-tier of French football. Only Jeno, who joined Romania's Unirea Slobozia this summer, represents a top-level team beyond Oceania. Bolivia have also qualified for the Play-Offs and will be joined by two Concacaf nations and one each from Asia and Africa; New Caledonia, ranked 150 by FIFA, know they have a mountain to climb to become the smallest nation ever, eclipsing Iceland, to qualify for the World Cup by clinching one of the two final qualification spots.

"The step is big," coach Johann Sidaner told ESPN. "Maybe we have a 1% chance of qualifying for the World Cup. But we will play 100% to do it."

Their dream may be years in the making, but New Caledonia is a relative newcomer to international football, only becoming a member of FIFA in 2004 after being given permission by the French Football Federation four years earlier to apply for membership. As one of France's Overseas Territories, its citizens have French nationality and are eligible to vote in French presidential elections. Despite being over 10,000 miles apart, the close ties to France explain why almost half of Sidaner's squad play in the country and why the 48-year-old left a position at his hometown club Nantes to become New Caledonia coach in 2022.

"It was an easy decision for me," Sidaner said. "The culture of the people is welcoming, friendly and they love football. It is easy to manage this football team."

AS Magenta, the reigning champions of the New Caledonia Super Ligue, will play in this season's Coupe de France and have already been assigned a home draw in the seventh round in November -- the same stage that teams from Ligue 2 enter the competition -- so the fans of Saint-Etienne, Nancy or Montpellier could face an epic road trip.

However, the French connection can be problematic. When Gibraltar confirmed the friendly against New Caledonia last month, the announcement was done with flags from Gibraltar and New Caledonia alongside each other on the Gibraltar FA website, causing little short of a diplomatic incident.

"We were asked by UEFA within 20 minutes of the story going up to change the flag [and add France] because of a complaint by New Caledonia," a Gibraltar source told ESPN. "The New Caledonia flag can only be flown alongside the French tricolour, which led to a hasty update!"

The flag sensitivity also led to Gibraltar having to buy a new flagpole for the game due to both French and New Caledonian flags needing to be flown, with strict instructions that the French flag took prominence over the island nation's. It was only in 2008 that France granted the football team permission to have its own anthem rather than La Marseillaise, which remains New Caledonia's official national anthem, so it is against this backdrop of French control that New Caledonia's footballers are literally putting their country on the map.

"Maybe we can show ourselves as New Caledonia through our football," midfielder Jeno said. "Our football is not professional, but it's football and each year, we are developing.

"We know how important the team is to people in New Caledonia. We are their passion and our progress is good for everybody. I am fortunate: I have a career in Europe and a good contract in Romania, but the guys back home, they work in their jobs, they go to work in the morning and they train at night.

"They have had to take time away from their families, their jobs -- normal jobs, like working in a supermarket -- to come to Gibraltar, but we all do it for New Caledonia."

Haewegene, the charismatic goal scorer, laughs when asked whether he could be a full-time professional in New Caledonia with AS Magenta, before revealing his incredible "real" job.

"Professional? Ha ha, no!" Haewegene said. "I play for the biggest team in New Caledonia, but we are not professional. My job is a Paralympic coach -- I am a guide for blind or visually impaired sprinters. I went to the Paralympics last year to help the French athletes. I can run 100 meters in 11.3 seconds: I'm fast. Very fast!"

So how does a national team from the South Pacific, a country 1,200 miles east of Sydney, Australia, end up playing one of Europe's smallest nations in a friendly game anyway? It's a game that pitches the 200th best team in the world (Gibraltar) against one ranked just 50 places higher.

Gibraltar's stadium is half-football ground and half-cricket pitch, tightly framed by the imposing Rock of Gibraltar, a substantial red-and-white lighthouse and the Straits of Gibraltar, the 9-mile-wide stretch of water that separates Europe from Africa. But having not played a game since the defeat against New Zealand in Auckland in March, New Caledonia simply needed to play.

"My job is to arrange games for national teams and the New Caledonia coach asked me to find an opponent in Europe in October," Gaël Mahé, a FIFA match agent told ESPN. "But it's not easy. There aren't many possibilities, especially because there are World Cup qualifiers right now and the big national teams can find opponents much easier.

"For the New Caledonia players, half of whom play in their own country, they are travelling halfway around the world for 30 hours, but Gibraltar were happy to play the game, so it was a good solution."

It's 4 a.m. in Noumea, the capital of New Caledonia, when Sidaner's team kick off against Gibraltar at 7 p.m. local time. Having only arrived on Sunday evening, the jet lag is likely to be at its most punishing for the home-based players. A team room with table tennis and video games has been set up at the squad's hotel; some players spend their time shopping, while coach Sidaner relaxes on the terrace outside the hotel with a beer.

There is a relaxed atmosphere around the team, but once the game starts, there is also a tenacity and energy that takes Gibraltar by surprise. New Caledonia are quick and lively and they deserve their victory with second-half goals from Jean-Jacques Katrawa and Haewegene.

"It was an important victory for us because we have beaten a European team for the first time," coach Sidaner said. "We haven't played together for a long time, so this will be a very big step for our plans for the Play-Offs.

"We are raising the level of demand with these World Cup 2026 qualifying play-offs and we are only 150 days away from a historic date for New Caledonian football. But for this kind of result, this kind of performance, this is why I chose to coach New Caledonia. For these special moments."

A training camp in France is planned for January, with hopes of at least one competitive game before the trip to Mexico in March, but after beating Gibraltar, the players just want to celebrate the moment. Sidaner's squad sit on the steps outside the stadium post-game; some are on their phones, a couple of them sneak a vape and others pose for selfies and photographs. Then they get on the bus, pack their bags and prepare for that arduous journey home.

The itinerary takes them from Malaga, Spain, to Paris, a connecting flight to Singapore and then finally to Noumea -- all in coach class -- but there is only joy among the players as they danced on the bus.

"Every young boy wants to play in a World Cup -- it is a dream," Haewegene said. "That is our dream, and we know we have a chance."

Gennaro Gattuso's Italy can at least secure a spot for the playoffs to qualify for the FIFA World Cup if they win on Tuesday against Israel. The Azzurri started off the group qualifiers with a disappointing defeat against Norway, which led to the sacking of former manager Luciano Spalletti. Under Gattuso, Italy have won all three of their matches so far including a thrilling 5–4 away victory over Israel last month and are now likely to finish second behind Norway. That would mean facing the playoffs for the third consecutive time, after missing out in 2018 against Sweden and again in 2022 against North Macedonia, marking the first time in history the Azzurri have failed to qualify for two straight World Cups. Here's what you need to know about Tuesday's match.

Italy XI: Gianluigi Donnarumma; Giovanni Di Lorenzo, Gianluca Mancini, Riccardo Calafiori; Andrea Cambiaso, Nicolo Barella, Manuel Locatelli, Sandro Tonali, Federico Dimarco; Mateo Retegui, Giacomo Raspadori.

Israel XI: Daniel Peretz; Eliazer Dasa, Or Blorian, Matan Baltaxa; Guy Mizrahi, Roy Revivo, Oscar Gloukh, Mohammad Abu Fani; Eliel Peretz, Manor Solomon; Tai Baribo.

After a convincing performance against Estonia over the weekend, Italy are likely to win against against Israel on Tuesday. Pick: Italy 3, Israel 1.

An ode to Mauro Shampoo during carnival Embaixada dos Bonecos Gigantes

The Athletic FC ⚽ is The Athletic's daily football (or soccer, if you prefer) newsletter. Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox.

In my younger years, I developed a soft spot for East Stirlingshire, a perennially dreadful Scottish club. They were so bad that somebody wrote a book about them called “Pointless”. To give you a little taste: one of their defenders ranked as leading goalscorer for a while by virtue of scoring own goals.

Advertisement

I was, then, 100 per cent the target audience for a glorious feature by Jack Lang, chronicling the life and times of “the world's worst team”. They're called Ibis Sports Club, they're from Brazil, and any suspicion that Jack might be hyping their ineptitude to excess (let's not pretend there aren't shambolic sides strewn across the planet) evaporated once the numbers came flying at me.

Poor old Ibis began phoning in 10-0 defeats and worse in the 1970s. They went through a streak of 55 straight matches without a victory in the 1980s. They have tried, without success, to lay claim to a Guinness World Record for the longest winless streak ever — to be clear, they want their name in the book — and they haven't played competitively this year because the dissolution of their league has rendered them inactive.

You'd call the whole thing off, wouldn't you? Certainly, unless you happened to be Ozir Ramos Junior, their president, handyman and happy-go-lucky guardian angel. He explained to Jack how Ibis were a family affair, founded by his grandfather and run by both his father and brother in the past. “It's an addiction,” he said. “Once you get involved, you fall in love.”

I'm with him on that. Terrible football clubs are the salt of the earth and a hell of a lot of fun. And if you're liking the sound of Ibis, that's before I even mention Mauro Shampoo.

Shampoo — this, genuinely, is the surname he goes by — is a local barber and Ibis's most well-known star. There's probably no better statistic in world sport than the fact that he has one goal to his name which nobody can say if he actually scored. Some accounts have it down as an own goal.

He spent the whole time calling Jack “show” (Jack, to be fair, has a moustache worthy of a hipster nickname) and what's refreshing about him is that he's deeply proud of his Ibis roots and their story. Ibis are so proud of their reputation collectively that they have “the world's world team” stitched on their shirt collars.

They're unashamedly cultivating the brand which they should because total ineptitude has an endearing quality. I found that with East Stirlingshire. Mediocrity is boring. There's anonymity and safety in numbers among the endless stock of mediocre teams. But no-hopers like Ibis? If anyone ever mentions them or Shampoo, you'll have read Jack's odyssey and you'll spread the word about their status. Better that than irrelevance.

Cape Verde — the tiny collection of islands off the west coast of Africa — has a population roughly the size of Atlanta or Sacramento. Like any country, it has a diaspora but it doesn't take Einstein to work out why its national team boasts no World Cup pedigree.

Or rather, why it boasted no World Cup pedigree until yesterday. Because on Monday, Cape Verde booked their place at the 2026 finals, holding their nerve and beating Eswatini (another modest state, down in southern Africa). At a stroke, they became the second-smallest nation to qualify after Iceland in 2018. The islands are inhabited by just 525,000 people.

With a great deal of savvy, Cape Verde maximised their footballing potential by taking advantage of players in foreign climes. One defender, Steve Moreira, is contracted to Columbus Crew in Major League Soccer. Another, Pico, represents Shamrock Rovers in Ireland. They have internationals based in Portugal, the Netherlands and Turkey, and the melting pot produced a squad good enough to pip Cameroon in their qualifying group.

The Athletic's Nick Miller was in Cape Verde to watch them cross the line and in his words, their progress is no accident. They're on the plane while Sweden — population 10 million, with Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyokeres to draw on up front — stare elimination in the face after losing to Kosovo last night. Funny old world.

Being a clueless Brit, I found myself on Google this morning, searching up Chick-fil-A. Why? Because the chicken sandwich joint I'd never heard of before provided the hook for an interview between Henry Bushnell and USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino.

Pochettino, it turns out, met Chick-fil-A chairman Dan Cathy in April and fell in love with one of Cathy's favourite quotes: “Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast” (the two men were having breakfast at the time). It chimed with Poch's philosophy and his on-going attempt to reset the inner workings of the USMNT. He's since shared it with his players.

It's been apparent for a while that the 53-year-old felt the environment he inherited in 2024 was, if not toxic, then counterproductive in helping the U.S. do a Cape Verde and maximise their performance levels in time for the World Cup. As Henry found out when they spoke, culture is almost more crucial for Pochettino than tactics, hence why it “eats strategy for breakfast”.

Slogans on a whiteboard are all well and good, of course. Good culture without enlightened tactics isn't going to be worth a Happy Meal either. But this, evidently, is more than just a coaching job for Poch. It's a mental revolution playing out to the sound of a ticking clock.

U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino believes team culture comes before strategy or success. Aric Becker / ISI Photos / USSF / Getty Images

DENVER — When U.S. men's national team players strolled into their meeting room at a hotel in downtown Austin, Texas, last week, they saw a quote scrawled in red marker on a poster — one that had nothing to do with soccer.

“Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast.”

Mauricio Pochettino, the team's head coach, had written those words by hand and placed them next to a giant projector screen at the head of the room to reinforce a message.

He would talk to his players about tactics, of course — about shapes, systems, movements and soccer. But “culture” has been at the heart of his USMNT rebuild.

“Both are important,” Pochettino told The Athletic in a sit-down interview Monday in Denver. But culture, he explained, is the prerequisite.

That is what the 53-year-old Argentine believes. But he'd never heard the quote until he sat down for breakfast in April with Chick-fil-A chairman Dan Cathy. They met in Trillith, near U.S. Soccer's new headquarters south of Atlanta. Cathy, who has spent five decades working at the fast food chain his father founded, shared the quote, and it instantly resonated with Pochettino.

“We couldn't agree more,” he told The Athletic. “It's the reality — you can translate this in every single company, and in every single group of people. It's an amazing quote.”

So he tucked it away in his mind. He brought it out last week for the USMNT's third-to-last camp before the 2026 World Cup.

In one meeting, he asked players what it meant. But he also wrote his own definition, this time in smaller black letters, beneath the red: “No matter how brilliant your business strategy is, if your team culture isn't aligned or if it's toxic, your strategy will fail. Culture is the collective behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and values that drive a team.”

Pochettino has spoken repeatedly about culture, and even about changing the USMNT's culture, ever since taking charge last year, but especially since March.

In his first news conference after two Concacaf Nations League losses to Panama and Canada, he indirectly told players that, “If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend a nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend — that is the culture that we want to create? No, no, no, no, no. What we want to do is to go to the national team, arrive and be focused, and spend all my focus and energy on the national team. Because we need to create this culture about (winning).”

More recently, Pochettino said: “The moment that we identified the problems, we started to destroy the things that we need to destroy and started to build the house from the ground up.”

While building, he has tried to instill attitudes, mentalities and other intangible qualities. At the start of a September camp, when players gathered for a presentation entitled “IN & OUT OF POSSESSION REVIEW, GOLD CUP 2025,” Pochettino's speech diverged from tactics.

“We've talked a lot about many, many, many things. But the most important thing that you need to feel is that you are a strong team,” he told the players, as he showed them clips of on-field scuffles, of teammates standing up for one another this summer. “If something happens like this, we need to show that we are strong. That shows when the team is a team. That shows when the team is ready to fight for each other.”

The fracas that followed Malik Tillman's penalty miss against Costa Rica, after a Costa Rican player taunted Tillman, “changed the game,” Pochettino preached. “Because if we don't react in this way, [the opponents] say, ‘Ah, that is not like a team.' They are laughing in your face, and [if] you don't react, you don't have blood in your veins.”

A month later, Pochettino's messaging was similar.

“He emphasizes to us, no matter what tactics we put out, the opposition puts out, if we're not connected, aligned together, and all thinking on the same page, it's not gonna work,” striker Folarin Balogun told The Athletic on Monday.

When asked about the “culture eats strategy for breakfast” quote, midfielder Brenden Aaronson told The Athletic: “This is one of his biggest things — the team culture, the team togetherness, is stronger than any individual.”

Strategy matters too. But Monday's meeting, ahead of a Tuesday friendly against Australia, was “10 minutes talking about Australia, and then always, I like some different subject,” Pochettino told The Athletic. Today's “different subject” was a 1999 Copa América game between Argentina and Colombia, in which his Argentine teammate, Martín Palermo, missed three penalties.

Ahead of the second, Pochettino recalled, their coach, Marcelo Bielsa, was shouting, “No, no, no!” and calling out to captain Roberto Ayala, trying to get someone else to take the penalty. But Palermo, twice, grabbed the ball again.

Pochettino's point was one about arrogance and bravery. “The culture of soccer,” he explained, “is, ‘Ah, come on, shoot again.'” Palermo likely wanted to “be brave.” But the classic idea of bravery, in this case, was actually stupidity. Instead, Pochettino argued, “being brave” is handing the ball to a teammate and trusting him.

“We need to put the interests of the team before your ego,” Pochettino said.

When he first introduced the subject Monday morning, by saying he wanted to talk about egotism and arrogance, some U.S. players, he said, got worried. Speaking to The Athletic hours later, Pochettino smiled recalling their reactions. “Eh, change your face, there's nothing,” he said, and they relaxed.

“It was a good conversation,” Pochettino recalled.

And it epitomizes who he is as a coach.

Although the vast majority of questions at recent news conferences have been about formations, about individual players and their positions, about strategy, culture is what he always comes back to.

“The challenge is to keep feeding the culture,” he said. “Because I think we have the capacity, after, to design the best strategy to be better than the opponent. … But without culture, it's impossible.”

AUSTIN, Texas – In the throes of an uphill climb against a quality opponent, the chants boomed.

The United States trailed by a goal against a stingy Ecuador side that entered Friday night's friendly at Q2 Stadium on an unprecedented unbeaten streak. Ecuador's excellent form and aggressive style of play made the matchup one of the toughest the United States has faced this year.

Ecuador led early thanks to a well-executed strike from their star finisher Enner Valencia in the 24th minute on a transition play.

Yet, even down a goal, the climb for the United States out of the one-nil hole didn't feel insurmountable. In fact, an equalizer felt almost inevitable. The U.S. created chance after chance – first from Chris Richards, then from Aidan Morris – looking fluid in their formation and unflinchingly resolved to level the match. The USMNT recorded 11 shots, five on goal. 

And the chants from the home crowd strengthened the support.

“The crowd helped us to really motivate us and push us on,” striker Folarin Balogun said. “I think they don't realize how much we as players rely on their support. It really gives us a boost. It's always nice when we can play at an amazing stadium like today with the home crowd supporting us and cheering us on.”

As the second half progressed, and time ticked down for the United States to find an answer, the sold-out crowd of 20,738 at Q2 Stadium thundered together, “U-S-A! U-S-A!” The full-throated cheers mirrored the promising play on the pitch – and filled everyone in the stadium with hope.

“In the second half, the stadium started really going crazy, and we started to step it up a bit,” winger Tim Weah said. “That was nice, and we ended up getting the goal thanks to them. It's always great having that turn up.”

“We felt it on the field,” Ream said. “I made the comment on the bench that for a friendly, it was a really impressive atmosphere… to feel that togetherness from a sellout crowd and hearing the ‘U-S-A!' chants, it was special.”

The support reached a resounding level when the U.S. pulled the match even in the 71st minute. Balogun finished a Malik Tillman cross to tie the match 1-1.

The United States closed out the match with a draw, tying a team that finished second behind only Argentina in World Cup Qualifying in CONMEBOL.

The response, the support, added up to a strong performance — one that seems to define this group that is growing under head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

“The main motto of the U.S. in general and then U.S. Soccer is belief,” midfielder Weston McKennie said. “With the guys, we've been around each other a long time, and we have the confidence to know that the game's not over until the final whistle blows.”

COMMERCE CITY, Colo.— By some estimates, last week's 1-1 tie with Ecuador was the best performance, if not result, that the U.S. men's national team has had since Mauricio Pochettino took over as coach just over a year ago.

Whether that's true or not doesn't matter. Because when it comes to these two-match tuneups for next year's FIFA World Cup on home soil — there are only five friendly matches remaining for the USMNT before Pochettino names his 26-player roster, and just seven before the Americans open the tournament June 12 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles against an opponent to be determined at December's draw — the second match is the one that counts.

Take last month. A dispiriting 2-0 defeat to South Korea that wasn't as close as that score would suggest. The USMNT beat Japan convincingly just three days later, allowing the Americans to finish the September international window on a high.

Now they have another chance to return to their club teams feeling good. That means quickly forgetting all about Friday's draw in Austin, Texas, and focusing completely on Australia, the nails-tough World Cup-bound foe they'll meet here on Tuesday outside of Denver.

"Tomorrow is going to be a different game," Pochettino said on Monday during his pregame press conference at Dick's Sporting Goods Park. "Australia is a team [that's] very aggressive."

The Socceroos have quality, too. While Australia is ranked 25th to the U.S.'s 16, the Aussies toppled a Canada squad that the U.S. hasn't beaten in three consecutive home games in Montreal last Friday. No, their players don't play at Paris Saint-Germain or AC Milan like the Ecuadorians' top stars, but they play hard and together.   

"We need to respect them," Pochettino said. "They're going to be another good test, like Ecuador, for us."

The conditions will pose another challenge for the hosts. DSG Park sits a mile above sea level. The temperature is significantly colder than it was last week in Austin. And Pochettino also has to keep the big picture in mind; star left back Antonee "Jedi" Robinson, U.S. Soccer's Male Athlete of 2024 Award winner who hasn't represented his country at all this calendar year because of injury, will sit out a second straight October game.

Other USMNT players might simply be rested as Pochettino doles out opportunities to other World Cup roster hopefuls. Christian Pulisic, who was limited to a late cameo off the bench versus Ecuador because of a swollen ankle, could also feature from the start.

Whoever plays surely won't take the chance for granted. Not now, at least. Not anymore. 

"The most important thing in the national team is to have competition," said Cristian Roldan, a 2022 World Cup veteran who Pochettino summoned for the first time last month. "That's what we all want to strive for, because now you have a bigger player pool to choose from."

"He's he's created an environment so quickly that doesn't create certainty for anyone," striker Folarin Balogun, who's been the best U.S. player for three games running, said of Pochettino. 

"Nobody's place is guaranteed — he's created that feeling throughout the team," Balogun added.  "That's what you get when you have a top European coach. He's ruthless in how he goes about things. And he wants to win."

Starting on Tuesday, ideally. The U.S. has emerged victorious in just one of its last four games dating to July's Gold Cup final. Another win could do wonders for the USMNT's collective belief. 

If there's uncertainty all over the field, though, there's now a bit less up front. Balogun, given his from, seems sure to start again in greater Denver.

"Flo has everything," Roldan said. "He can run in behind, he can play back-to-goal. He has the ability to take guys on one 1v1, with link of play, with his movement, with his individuality. He can be the difference. And when we have guys like Christian ballistic, like Malik Tillman, they make each other better."

For others, Tuesday's contest could be the final audition for the World Cup.

"When you come into the national team, you've got to do what you can for the nation," reserve winger Brenden Aaronson said, "It's about rolling up the sleeves and doing the best you can in any situation. And then when you get your chance, you know you have to take it."

How the Americans will line up is another open question. Pochettino has started a three-man back line in each of the USMNT's last two outings. Yet he suggested that things could change again, especially with the Aussies playing style more entrenched. 

"We need to build something, but they are more solid in their ideas," Pochettino said of Australia. "I don't believe that they are going to change the way that they are going to play. They seem to keep the same shape and the way they are playing [over] the last year.

"We want to progress," he added. "We want to have this flexibility, with different players and sometimes different shape or dynamics on the field, to provide the team better quality [opposition].

"I'm happy to face a team like that."

COMMERCE CITY, Colo. – The scene at U.S. Men's National Team training on Monday morning looked a little bit different than it did in Austin just a few days ago.

Not in terms of the preparation and regimen – that part looked mostly the same with competitive rondos and tactical exercises. The clearest difference from Thursday to Monday was the gear. With the temperature feeling like 45 degrees in the Mile High City, and sharp wind and grey clouds in the forecast, players and staff dressed accordingly. Gone were the free-flowing short sleeves from three days ago in sunny, hot Texas. The training pitch at DICK's Sporting Goods Park featured hats, pants and large puffer jackets for the staff, including head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

While the barometers for the two cities might contrast, the challenge each city presents for the U.S. Men's National Team during the current October window are not all that different.

In the opening match in Austin, the United States hosted an Ecuador side that was red-hot entering the contest. Ecuador, ranked No. 24 in FIFA, finished second in CONMEBOL World Cup Qualifying behind only Argentina and currently rides a streak of going unbeaten in 12 straight matches. The United States was up for the task, battling back after conceding an early goal to draw La Tri 1-1 at Q2 Stadium.

The next opponent for the United States has a remarkably similar pedigree. Australia, the team the United States faces Tuesday night in Commerce City, Colorado, ranks 25th in FIFA, secured World Cup qualification earlier this year, and enters the matchup also on a 12-match unbeaten run.

“Australia is a strong side,” striker Folarin Balogun said. “Poch just told us to not take this game lightly. It's going to be really difficult for us. Any team that's unbeaten in 12 [matches] is not just going to come here and be easy to break down. We're going to need to be on our ‘A' game. That's going to be another challenge for us, and it's the sort of challenge we need to continue building the momentum.” 





While Ecuador and Australia have similar resumes, the two nations also present some similarities in their playing styles. Ecuador is a stingy side. Their strong defense allows La Tri to keep clean sheets – 10 in their last 12 matches – and turn the ball over quickly to capitalize on transition moments. 

Australia is equally stingy – the Socceroos have given up just two goals in their last five matches. They also have an ability to absorb pressure and punish opponents with their efficiency. In their latest performance against Canada in Montréal on Oct. 10, the hosts largely outplayed Australia on the stat sheet. Canada held 61 percent of the possession and took a whopping 17 shots. Yet, the one shot on goal from Nestory Irankunda of Australia was enough to win the game.

“Australia is similar to Ecuador in the way that they compete. They're very aggressive,” Pochettino said on Monday. “They're a team that manages very well… they're going to force us to give our best.” 

The quality of these two October opponents allows the United States to face fierce competition heading into next summer. Even though they are tabbed international friendlies, the environment creates pressure moments for the U.S., like trailing a goal, and gives the team a chance to see how they respond.

“The best thing that the coaching staff has done is telling us these games are not really friendlies because these are the closest thing we have to competitive games,” midfielder Brenden Aaronson said. “For us, it's taking every single second in the game and every minute seriously. Playing these teams from different continents and getting a look at different styles, which they're going to play tomorrow, is really good. It helps grow the group and get us ready for any kind of situation that happens in the World Cup.”

“The most important thing for us is not to take our foot off the gas,” Balogun echoed. “We need to keep building momentum, keep gaining confidence because that's what we're going to call upon when the going gets tough and we're at a big tournament like the World Cup. 

Preparing, building and growing have never been more important. After Tuesday night, the United States has one more window this calendar year – in November when the U.S. will face two World Cup-qualified South American nations in Uruguay and Paraguay. After that, just two more international windows remain until June 12 when the United States plays its first match of the group stage of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

“The most important thing now is to prepare just as we would prepare for the World Cup, and that's getting everybody in the right mindset to compete, win games, and be ruthless,” Balogun said.

Zhu Lin won 16 of the last 19 points against an ailing Emma Raducanu in the AUX Ningbo Open first round, while Dayana Yastremska pulled off a second-set comeback to defeat Victoria Mboko and Karolina Muchova won an all-Czech derby over Marketa Vondrousova.

Three champions at Grand Slam or WTA 1000 level took to the court on Tuesday at the AUX Ningbo Open, but none survived their first-round contests.

Ningbo: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Marketa Vondrousova returned to action for the first time since a knee injury forced her to withdraw ahead of her US Open quarterfinal against Aryna Sabalenka, and was knocked out by fellow Czech Karolina Muchova 6-4, 6-3.

Victoria Mboko will have to wait another week to get back to winning ways after being overpowered by Dayana Yastremska 6-3, 7-6(3). The Ukrainian came from 5-2 down in the second set, meaning Mboko has now gone 0-4 since her shock title run in Montreal in August.

Finally, a physically ailing Emma Raducanu was defeated 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 by home favorite Zhu Lin. The former US Open champion required two medical time-outs during the match and was in visible discomfort throughout the third set.

Zhu hits stride as Raducanu fades

This time last year, former No. 31 Zhu was forced to miss the entire Chinese swing after an elbow injury sidelined her for six months.

"This year, I'm trying my best to perform," she told the crowd in her on-court interview.

Currently ranked No. 219 and competing in Ningbo as a wild card, Zhu's determination paid off as she scored her second Top 30 win since returning to action in January. The 31-year-old got off to an error-strewn start, but towards the end of the first set began to demonstrate how she could turn the contest around.

Zhu began extending both the rallies and the games, turning the match into a mentally and physically gruelling battle. The last four games of the first set all went to deuce, culminating in a riveting final game in which Raducanu saved three break points before converting her fifth set point with a forehand winner.

The Briton had won the battle, but Zhu laid the foundations for winning the war. She picked up where she left off in the second set, smothering Raducanu from the baseline with a series of cleanly-struck winners. Though Raducanu showed grit of her own to break Zhu back twice, the Chinese player never took her foot off the pedal and sealed the set with a third break of serve.

Raducanu had required a medical time-out trailing 4-3 in the second set, and her movement was visibly hampered as she took to the court for the decider. A second medical time-out down 2-1 did not help matters. On resumption, Zhu rattled through 16 of the last 19 points of the match as Raducanu's resistance fell away.

Last week in Wuhan, Raducanu retired due to dizziness trailing Ann Li 6-1, 4-1 in the first round.

Zhu will next face No. 1 seed Mirra Andreeva -- one of three players in the Ningbo draw still in contention for WTA Finals qualification. The pair met at the same stage of Beijing three weeks ago, with Andreeva winning 6-2, 6-2.

Yastremska snaps losing streak, Mboko's goes on

Yastremska and Mboko came into Ningbo in similar positions. Both were on three-match losing streaks affected by health issues: Mboko sustained a wrist injury during her winning Montreal run, pulled out of Cincinnati, and on returning to action fell to Barbora Krejcikova at the US Open, Anastasia Potapova in Beijing and Ekaterina Alexandrova in Wuhan. Yastremska was also forced to withdraw from Cincinnati due to illness, then lost to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova at the US Open and Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in Beijing before a neck injury caused her to retire against Laura Siegemund in Wuhan.

A patchy contest saw the pair combine for 16 double faults -- nine for Yastremska and seven for Mboko -- and 11 breaks of serve. Throughout, though, Yastremska displayed the greater firepower, and the Ukrainian largely dictated the tempo of proceedings. Both sets followed a similar pattern: a bright start and a break lead for Yastremska, who then lapsed into error to lose her advantage before regaining her accuracy.

In the second set, No. 30-ranked Yastremska was two points from being taken to a decider four times trailing 5-2, but she began hitting her spots just enough to avoid facing a set point. Upon coming through that game, Yastremska suddenly rediscovered her best level, racing through nine of the next 10 points, three games in a row and ultimately the match after a dominant tiebreak.

Yastremska will face another WTA Finals contender next, No. 3 seed Elena Rybakina. A win for Yastremska would seal Andreeva's qualification for Riyadh.

Muchova pays tribute to Vondrousova after win

Muchova and Vondrousova aren't just compatriots but friends and members of the same club back at home in Prague. When they landed in Ningbo, they paired up for their first practise -- only to discover that the draw had pitted them against each other.

"I'll talk for both of us that we didn't like to see it," Muchova said in her on-court interview.

Two players who have suffered more than their fair share of injuries, both Muchova and Vondrousova have been sidelined for several months of this season alone. Vondrousova, playing her first match in over a month, had fewer recent matches under her belt. Though she came up with some delightful passing shots early on, Muchova repeatedly caught her out with a barrage of inside-out forehand winners.

"I wish her the best," Muchova said afterwards. "She's been injured, so I had some advantage in matches and I used it. She's such a greeat player and great competitor and so talented, so I'm happy I was able to finish in two sets."

Muchova will next face No. 7 seed Diana Shnaider in an intriguing first-time encounter.

Zhu Lin won 16 of the last 19 points against an ailing Emma Raducanu in the AUX Ningbo Open first round, while Dayana Yastremska pulled off a second-set comeback to defeat Victoria Mboko and Karolina Muchova won an all-Czech derby over Marketa Vondrousova.

Frenchman Arthur Cazaux captured his fourth ATP Challenger Tour title on Sunday to secure a new career-high in the PIF ATP Rankings.


The top seed at the 2025 Jinan Open, Cazaux dropped just one set all week. He raced past Mackenzie McDonald 6-3, 6-2 in the final, earning revenge on the American who beat him in the Shenzhen Challenger final 12 months ago.


Following his triumph, the 23-year-old is now No. 58 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Jinan marks Cazaux's first Challenger trophy of this season, during which he has competed in five events at that level. The Montpellier native reached his first tour-level final this year in Kitzbühel. 


“First title of the year!” Cazaux wrote on Instagram, adding a hashtag ‘#loveindoors'.

Virtanen remains perfect in Challenger finals
Finland's Otto Virtanen returned to the winner's circle, claiming his second Challenger title of the year and eighth overall. The 24-year-old won the l'Open Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes de Roanne, where he outlasted home hope Hugo Gaston 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 in the final.


Virtanen, No. 116 in the PIF ATP Rankings, extended his perfect record in Challenger finals to 8-0. Seven of those eight matches have been played at indoor events, including Roanne. Virtanen's first Challenger trophy this year came on grass in Birmingham.

University of Arizona standout Friend claims maiden title in surprise run
Jay Dylan Friend earned a milestone victory at the Solano Challenger in Fairfield, California. A senior at the University of Arizona, the 21-year-old Friend captured his maiden Challenger title in just his fourth outing at that level. Friend advanced through qualifying en route to the title, ousting a fellow qualifier, Edward Winter, 6-7(3), 6-3, 6-2 in the championship match.


Friend, who hails from Tokyo, Japan, qualified for the ATP Next Gen Accelerator programme this year, thanks to his collegiate success at Arizona.

Entering the week as World No. 743, Friend is the second lowest-ranked champion on the Challenger circuit this season (No. 847 Stefano Napolitano won in Biella). Friend has soared 263 spots to a career-high No. 480. He entered Fairfield with two victories at the Challenger level, including an August win against Valentin Vacherot, who won the ATP Masters 1000 event in Shanghai.

Briton Choinski earns fourth title of 2025, countryman Peniston also wins
Jan Choinski and Ryan Peniston took contrasting paths to add hardware to their trophy cabinets. Choinski needed a deciding set in four of his five matches at the Copa Faulcombridge by Marcos Automocion in Valencia. In the final, he ended Croatian Luka Mikrut's nine-match winning streak with a 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory. Mikrut won the previous week's Braga Challenger.


Following Choinski's fourth Challenger trophy of the season, the 29-year-old is now tied atop the 2025 title leaderboard, joining Borna Coric, Emilio Nava and #NextGenATP Nicolai Budkov Kjaer.

The star, director and executive producer of Prime Video's binge-worthy psychological thriller weighs in on surprising feedback about her character's fate and if the finale could lead to a second season.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


[This story contains major spoilers from the season finale of The Girlfriend.]


Robin Wright was lured back to TV by the dual narrative at the center of The Girlfriend, Prime Video's deliciously naughty limited series that pits the House of Cards alum against Olivia Cooke, who plays the unwelcome girlfriend to Wright's only son (Laurie Davidson).




	The psychological thriller, which has become a Top 10 global show for Amazon since its Sept. 10 release, centers around the twisted triangle of son Daniel (Davidson), his fiery new girlfriend Cherry (House of the Dragon‘s Cooke) and his obsessive mother Laura (Wright). Throughout the six episodes, viewers are intentionally misled about which woman is more sympathetic, as the series flips back and forth between Cherry and Laura's conflicting perspectives on the first months of a whirlwind romance between Daniel and Cherry.

	Though adapted from the 2017 novel of the same name by Michelle Frances, the series changed the ending entirely. Instead of Cherry falling to her death and Laura emerging victorious like in the book, it's Laura who dies in the series. In the season finale, Laura drugs Daniel in hopes he will finally hear her evidence that Cherry is dangerous, but he emerges in a drug-induced haze, breaks up the two women fighting in the family's pool and accidentally drowns his mother.

	











	Delivering a Greek tragedy-style ending for the Oedipal tale was Wright's idea, as the star, executive producer and director pushed to surprise viewers with Daniel killing Laura, instead of the more obvious Cherry. What Wright didn't anticipate was that people still wouldn't believe Laura is dead by the end of the finale, which concluded with a one year flash-forward of Daniel finally hearing the evidence and fearing now-wife Cherry, who is pregnant with their child.


	“People were like, ‘Laura could have been resuscitated. Daniel is a doctor,' and also, ‘He could have let her die,'” says Wright about viewers being split on if Laura could have survived the accidental drowning. “It's kind of fun that people are wondering about what happened in the end [that we don't show].”


	With The Girlfriend now in awards contention for limited series, The Hollywood Reporter spoke with Wright about the buzz around the show and, even though she says there aren't talks at the moment about a second season, she weighs in on how the changes to the ending could pave the way for more. Still, “if it didn't get a second season, I would be completely satisfied,” she says.


	***


The Girlfriend has become the No. 1 most-watched new scripted series in the U.K. for Amazon, and a Top 10 show for the streamer globally. Were you expecting this show to pop like it has?


	No (laughs), you never do. I don't like to put myself in that position. This could be a total flop or people could love it — don't pick a lane. So when it launched and it was so immediate that it was watercooler with people saying they already binged it, I was like — great, amazing, fantastic. Thank you. Because it really was challenging wearing three hats and making it. It was a lot of work, so I feel very relieved.

	











By directing the first three episodes, you set the tone for navigating the competing narratives with your character, Laura, and Olivia Cooke's Cherry. What was the trickiest part about directing and acting in those beginning episodes, when we don't yet know which one of you is the psychotic one?


	Right, exactly. (Laughs.) It was like doing algebra. That's what it felt like, where you go, “OK, this is the protocol we have to achieve for this perspective. So we want to make sure we get this beat and this beat.” So you have a great script supervisor who keeps notes of when we flipped from one perspective to the other, because then on another episode, Laura would start the episode and Cherry would finish. So we were just trying to do the math. Did we get enough scenes? Did we get enough beats that are different? You're in the same scene, so it's this subtle thing of showing if it's the way Cherry or Laura perceived it. And then [in the end], you realize that Laura was right along!


You had a long and respected TV run on House of Cards. The Girlfriend is a limited series, but as is common with buzzy limited series, there's clamor for a second season. The ending also begs the question, since you changed it and kept Cherry alive. When you signed on, was doing a one-season series part of the appeal? 


	Actually, it was sort of a collective. Amazon greenlit a limited series of six episodes adapted from the book. When you're moving forward with one season in your head, that's all you've got to complete — it has to come full circle and has to shock at the end. So it could go both ways, right? You could close the show out. I don't know what their [Amazon] plan is, to tell you the truth. I don't know. I think they're all so excited that they have a hit show on their platform. I know they have others, but I think this one gave them another escalation. Because Amazon has a lot of content, as we know, but they didn't have anything like this.

	











I know that Daniel being the one to kill Laura was your idea. Why did you feel like it should end that way, and did you have to do some convincing to get everyone on board?


	There were a lot of discussions around how many iterations [of the ending] were available, as there is for any ending of a show. I loved the Greek tragedy aspect of it because it's so unexpected. Because you would definitely think that Cherry would have killed Laura, or Laura would have killed Cherry. You're going through what you know as a reader of novels, and I was like, “Let's just flip it on its head.” But it's also left open. People say that to me.


Yes…


	You don't know after cut, when Daniel is holding Laura in the pool, could he have resuscitated her? He's a doctor.


Right.


	So, they've got options.


Did you think the ending was that open ended when you were making the show? Did you intentionally leave the door open for Laura to be alive, or were you thinking everyone would assume she's dead?


	The latter. Then when we were getting feedback from the spectators, it was half and half. People were like, “Oh, she could have been resuscitated.” And also, “He could have let her die.” So it's kind of fun that people are wondering about what happened in the end [that we don't show].


Cherry did try to stop Daniel while he was drowning Laura, which was a surprising turn of empathy for her. Was that a moment you talked about and debated?












	Yes. When we were rehearsing in the pool — we were all freezing cold! — I think it just happened. I said to Andrea Harkin, who directed the latter three episodes [including the finale], “Wouldn't it be interesting to do one take, just so you have it in the editing room, of Cherry trying to stop her drug-filled fiancé, who is drug-filled by his own mother?” Cherry is saying to Daniel, “Don't do that; you and I will just escape.” 


	A lot of these things were added at the last minute, because we were in the scene and able to rehearse: “How do you get to that emotion? How do you get that beat? Let's talk about it. What would come out of Cherry's mouth based on this conversation we've just had?” And that was so invigorating, to work with such pros. All the actors are really good and they loved the chat. When you're acting and you get to hang out with all of your costars it's like a beautiful therapy, because you discover things together and everybody throws their idea on the table based on coming from their character personally.


Was there another version of the ending you came close to doing?


	I'm sure there were a couple of other ideas. Think about that triangle. We probably talked about, “Should Daniel kill Cherry, and then he wakes up and realizes what he did?” That could have been one idea. There were many, many discussions about all of these things, and how did we want to drop crumbs? And not go into the melodrama, but base it in reality that this shit can happen.

	











Do you feel satisfied by the ending or are you itching to continue?


	If it didn't get a second season, I would be completely satisfied. We had such an incredible team building this architectural game. You're as good as your team around you. I couldn't have done it without them.


	I don't know [about a second season]. They're [Amazon] going to decide what they want to do, and then we'll have a conversation. You know Scenes From A Marriage, the five-part series with Jessica Chastain? I loved that so much. That's what inspired me to do a limited series and wear three hats. Because it's a lot of work. I'm so glad I had the [one season] to think about, and our team rocked it. We're so pleased and thrilled beyond. Can you imagine doing all of that work and then you have a flop on your hands?


How closely have you been following the response to the show? Has it surprised you that there is Cherry fandom; did you think viewers would tilt more to Laura's side?


	It doesn't surprise me because that was the intention — to have the viewer ping-pong for six episodes and go, “I'm Team Laura today. Oh shit, now I'm Team Cherry. And now I'm Team Laura again.” Think about if that limited series was 13 episodes. With House of Cards, we did 13 episodes every season [except the final season]. [If The Girlfriend had that many episodes], the show would be regurgitating the same vein, just a little bit different in the white lie or fabrication of truth, and stretch it out more. I think this worked in a truncated fashion.

	











How do you feel about Laura by the end, in terms of what she deserves. Is she the psychopath or is Cherry, or are both of them?


	They're both in the same position, in separate boats, which is two alpha females in a room — that's tough already. They're both very strong-willed and determined to get everyone to believe their story and get what they want out of it. So their trajectory is the same, and they both think they're in the right, and the other thinks they're in the wrong. And that is what we experience in life a lot.


Do you think Laura would have chewed up and spit out anyone her son brought home?


	No, we collectively decided that shouldn't be who Laura is at her core. Yes, she'll be aching in her heart because she's going to lose her son to a woman he falls in love with, and he's going to move out of the house — even though he's still living at home at 29. But no, I don't think she would have. From the get-go, she just suspected, “This girl is not to be trusted.” You feel it; you feel that as a woman, “Something rubbed me the wrong way about that person. I don't know what it is, but…”


Had you and Olivia Cooke met before making this show?


	No. And she was always my first choice.


Was there a piece of her prior acting that caught your attention?


	I've followed her since the beginning. She was great in Sound of Metal. Her performance in that really got my attention. And then in the movie she did with Anya-Taylor Joy, Thoroughbreds, she was fantastic. I liked that there was a cool confidence about her. And when she smiles, what a sweetie pie. You just want to hug her. Look at her in Slow Horses, she's great.

	











How did you two find your chemistry?


	In the rehearsals that were very short, I said, “I think it's beneficial if we can get the characters of the Sanderson family — Daniel, Mom, Dad [played by Waleed Zuaiter] and Cherry — in a room.” We started talking about the scene, “What do you think for your character?” They pitched it, and then I could respond based on what they were going to do. The most important thing with what little time we had was that I said, “Give me something different every take, because we may only get two takes.” They did, and I had so much material in the editing room to play with to morph and mold. We would take things we shot from our algebra list of what we were going to achieve in Laura's versus Cherry's perspectives, and I would steal some of Laura's reactions or lines and throw them into Cherry's perspective. And you're like, “Oh, it's much better over there.” We'd do that Rubik's Cube a lot.


I saw shades of [House of Cards‘] Claire Underwood in how Laura carried herself. Did Laura remind you of Claire; who was your inspiration?


	I think Laura is just an overly protective mother who really believes her son is potentially going to be in peril with this woman in his life. And her belief is that it's evident Cherry is a gold digger. From Cherry's perspective, that's not something she believes in. She's like, “I just happened to fall in love with a young man who's from a very wealthy family, and I get the perks on top of it. Amazing.” She just wants for a better life. What's wrong with that? So we're back to the dual perspectives. Olivia and I talked about that a lot, how you have to like your character, no matter how venal they are.

	











You were on one of the first streaming shows with House of Cards, when viewership data was unknown. How do you compare the beginning of the streaming era to now, and the feedback you get from Amazon about The Girlfriend? 


	Just to preface being at the helm of an unestablished show — because The Girlfriend was from the ground up — my prep was very full with Amazon. A lot of meetings, a lot of discussions. You send scripts; they give notes; you do those notes; then you deliberate and try to fight for what you believe is better or should be omitted or modified. There were a lot of weeks doing that, and that's very different from [director/executive producer] David Fincher establishing the style of House of Cards and deciding to get onto the streaming train.


	He said to me, “This [streaming] is going to be our future. There's no doubt about it. And cinema is going to die-ish. Because it's half the cost.” He established the tone, the look, he oversaw the writing. I came in as a director [on House of Cards] having to follow a style, which was such a great way to start directing. You had restrictions and you had to find a way to bring your style within those restrictions. 


The Girlfriend was a very different beast. We didn't even have the scripts written; they were writing as we were starting to shoot. There were always discussions about script with the writers, and we had some great writers. So it was about finding together what's going to be the most gripping, cinematic, on-the-edge-of-your-seat, can't-wait-to-get-to-the-next-episode story. That's your main goal: How do we get people to watch the next episode?

	











So to wrap it up, what would say to viewers who want The Girlfriend season two?


	I truly don't know. There are a lot of people involved and if you're working for a platform, you have to wait until the execs figure out the what, why, when and how. We're not even there yet.


I'm just really wondering if you're dead or alive.


	Keep wondering!

Ezra Sosa shared an update on his relationship with Anna Delvey one year after they were paired together on “Dancing with the Stars.”

During an October 2025 appearance on Danielle Fishel's “Danielle With the Stars” podcast, Sosa was asked if he was still “friendly” with Delvey.

 “We're not talking right now,” the ballroom pro admitted.

Fishel added that she “heard that maybe there was an unfollow there.”

“Yeah, there was definitely an unfollow,” Sosa confirmed. “And you know what? It's okay.”

After Fishel noted that “we're all on our different journeys,” Sosa agreed. “Yeah. You be you, boo boo, and I'll be me, you know? Respectfully,” he said.

One year ago, Sosa, 24, appeared thrilled by his partnership with Delvey. In a post on his Instagram page last fall, the newly crowned pro dancer wrote, “Excited to announce my very first partner for DWTS is none other than the iconic @theannadelvey!”

At the time, Sosa told TV Insider he loved Delvey because she “keeps it real.” “She's got nothing to hide,” he said. “When I found out she's my partner, [my heart] skipped a beat and I fell off the treadmill. For real. …I'm very excited she's my partner.”

Delvey, who served two years in prison after being convicted of defrauding businesses, per CNN, was on house arrest during her time on DWTS. She was required to wear a GPS ankle monitor during her time in the ballroom.  Sosa and Delvey were the first couple eliminated on DWTS Season 33.

A post shared by ezra sosa (@ezra.sosa)

For his second season on DWTS, Sosa was partnered with Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles. In September, he posted an Instagram Reel that showed him lifting up the athlete with the caption, “Pov: I actually have a shot this year.”

It's possible that didn't go over well with Delvey.

Chiles told People magazine that she was “so ecstatic” to be partnered with Sosa. “I'm so happy he gets this opportunity and a better experience in a better way, and that he just gets to really showcase who he is,” she added, in a clear reference to the dancer's controversial turn with Delvey.

“I was happy that I was gonna be his partner where our energy just matched right away,” Chiles added.

A post shared by ezra sosa (@ezra.sosa)

While they're not on speaking terms at the moment, Sosa shared some funny memories of working with Delvey on Fishel's podcast.

“With Anna, I was like, ‘Do you want to win?' And she goes, ‘Eh,'” he recalled. “ I was like, ‘Okay, we're going to have a gag. You know what? We're going to have a gag and we're going to have fun doing it.”

He detailed his idea of bedazzling Delvey's ankle monitor, but he made a major faux pas.

“Honestly, I [bedazzled] it in a way where she couldn't charge it,” he revealed. “I did it for rehearsal. …But like we would be rehearsing, and then it would beep. I'm like, ‘What the heck is that?' It's a low battery. Like, I'm dead.”

“Oh my God. She almost got arrested because of me!” the DWTS  pro laughed.

	At more than 20 years D'Angelo's senior, Nile Rodgers detailed an early encounter in which the younger singer, who died on Oct. 14, came to him in a moment of uncertainty about his music. Rodgers shared the memory in an Instagram caption shortly after news broke of D'Angelo's death. The post included an image of the singer with the words “D'Angelo Dead at 51 RIP My Brother” and the song “Brown Sugar” playing in the background.

A post shared by Nile Rodgers (@nilerodgers)


	“My friend Gary Harris brought this musician named D'Angelo over to my NYC apt,” Rodgers began. “He was trying to figure out what to do with the music he'd brought with him. I listened to every cut … not just out of respect but because it was smoking. At the end of the encounter he asked me, ‘What should I do with it?' I remember this as if it were yesterday. I said, ‘Put it out. It's perfect!' Being the #artist he is, I guess he had to explore some ways to make it better.”

	











	Rodgers went on to reveal the fate of some of that music: “About a year later I heard one of those songs on the radio. It was #genius and it was exactly what he had played for me. I know…I still have the original cassette.”

	The pair would go on to cover Fela Kuti's “Water No Get Enemy” together for AIDS-awareness nonprofit Red Hot's Red Hot + Riot: The Music and Spirit of Fela Kuti, a 2022 tribute record featuring more than three dozen artists. According to OkayAfrica, the song came from a studio session led by Questlove, Fela's son Femi Kuti, and D'Angelo himself.

	











	In their statement on his death, D'Angelo's family noted that the singer had been battling cancer. “We are saddened that he can only leave dear memories with his family, but we are eternally grateful for the legacy of extraordinarily moving music he leaves behind,” they wrote. “We ask that you respect our privacy during this difficult time but invite you all join us in mourning his passing while also celebrating the gift of song that he has left for the world.”

The funniest thing about Todd Rohal's “Fuck My Son!” — alas, one of the only funny things about this impressively sick but tiresomely self-amused celebration of bad taste — is that the most controversial aspect of the movie isn't its title, or its demented story about a gun-packing mother who forces a random woman to have sex with her monstrous son (imagine if the Sarlaac from “Star Wars” had a baby with the alien from “Mac and Me,” nipples and boils everywhere, diaper oozing wet shit, just a gaping hole full of hotdogs where his dick should be), or even how brutally it treats the sex slave's elementary school-age daughter, Belinda, who will be cooked in an oven if her mom doesn't comply with their captor's demands). 

 








Related Stories ‘Send Help' Trailer: Rachel McAdams and Dylan O'Brien Are Deserted on an Island Together in Sam Raimi's Latest Thriller ‘The Mastermind' Review: Josh O'Connor Is an Art Thief Hijacked by His Own Heist in Kelly Reichardt's Jazzy 1970s Throwback 

No, the most controversial aspect of “Fuck My Son!” is that it uses some very crude and obvious AI for what amounts to roughly 90 seconds of screen time. A number of festival viewers were outraged. I guess some things are just too obscene for audiences to stomach.

 










Like everything else in Rohal's film, the AI-afflicted scenes are designed to triple-underline their own grotesqueness. A prologue modeled after an AMC theater pre-show (“No jacking off in the theater,” “Do not pee or crap in your seat,” “Our restrooms are now closed”) is filled out with inhuman crowds, while the characters from Bernice's favorite show — a “Veggietales”-esque abomination called “The Meatie Mates” — pop up throughout the movie in increasingly artificial form, their every appearance better reflecting the ghoulish slop that today's children eagerly consume on YouTube. 

As in Radu Jude's recent “Dracula,” the technology isn't used as a shortcut (if anything, incorporating AI made Rohal's work considerably more difficult), but rather as a commentary on the soullessness of modern “art.” Reactive to a world in which people have become more offended by form than content, “Fuck My Son!” exists to explore the efficacy of shock value at a time when image-making itself has become so repulsive and society has ingested its own memetic sickliness as a sign of the future. 

Rohal wants to push back against the numbing dystopia of Project 2025, so he's cooked up a collective experience — one that will tour across the country, advertising its lack of streaming availability as its greatest hook — designed to startle us back to our senses and restore the sheer joy of transgression. Little other joy is on offer (either within this movie, or outside of it), but “Fuck My Son!” feels like it was only made to indulge in the fact that it still could be. 

 










So while I may not have particularly enjoyed the experience of watching it, I have no choice but to admit that it does, indeed, exist. Critics are raving “This is a real thing that people made.” Put it on the poster. 

Of course, this material didn't originate with Rohal; an idea as pure and profound as “Fuck My Son!” has to come from somewhere. Usually it's from a divine vision or the liquid meth they sell at the front of America's finest gas stations. In this case, it came from a graphic novel: Johnny Ryan's “Fuck My Son: A Tale of Terror, Issue One,” which Rohal has faithfully adapted like a sacred text. And that's just as well, because the movie has no interest in making such intellectual property more palatable to a wider audience. 

Either you want to see a movie called “Fuck My Son!” or you don't (“It's just garbage,” the director has said. “It's made by trashmen for trashmen”), and Rohal's film is squarely targeted at the people who might conceivably pay for a ticket; the aforementioned pre-show offers viewers the choice of “Perv-o-Vision” glasses that make all of the characters naked, or a “Nude Blok” edition for those who pray to “fill their lives with blissful ignorance and intolerance” (the film's spirit all but requires comparisons to John Waters, even if its execution cleaves a lot closer to early James Gunn). 

 










The world of “Fuck My Son!” is a small and seedy place where every mote of innocence only exists as an invitation for perversion, or worse. We first meet Sandi (Tipper Newton, recalling Sarah Silverman in her ability to conflate innocence with repulsion) as she takes little Bernice (Kynzie Colmery) dress shopping, where — of course — a peeper is spying on all of the dressing rooms. Shot like an '80s Z-picture but always self-indulgent enough to make clear that it's in on the joke, the movie soon introduces its leading ladies to an overbearing mother (a Chris Farley-esque Robert Longstreet, growling in drag) who's fallen and can't get up. 

But it's a trap! The mother lures Sandi and Bernice to her van, knocks them out, and takes them to the remote farmhouse where she lives with her mutant son Fabian (Steve Little). There's so much sex in the world, and she can't stand the thought that her sweet child will never get to have any of it. The mother wheels Fabian in, places Bernice nearby with a front-row view, and — wait for it — demands that Sandi fuck her son. Bareback. “Person to Person” star George Sample III eventually shows up to round out the cast, but that's really about all there is to it. As positioned to Sandi, the terms couldn't be simpler: “The sooner you fuck my son, the sooner I'll let your daughter out of the oven.” What's a mother to do? 

 










Rohal pays lip-service to the idea that parents will do anything for their children, but this movie is much less interested in developing its themes than it is in watching Sandi fish around Fabian's innards for his Lovecraftian penis (spoiler alert: she finds it, and the massive appendage becomes a veritable character in its own right). Is it gross? Very. 

But the grossness doesn't scale at a particularly engaging rate, and while Rohal's agenda required a certain amount of cheekiness to validate the fun of its own shock value, it's hard to overlook the reality that “Fuck My Son!” is far less disturbing than the movie promised by its title. For all of its eldritch horrors (Fabian's penis eventually penetrates almost everything you can imagine, with child rape being the most obvious red line that Rohal won't cross), this heightened story is too “fun” to be even half as fucked up as the things we read in the headlines every day, and not funny enough for its increasingly whacked out “WTF”-ness to be enjoyable on its own terms. Things get wild because they can, and then slaphappy because they can't be anything else. 

When a title card pops up that reads: “The Ending: Part I,” the joke is that a movie with so little substance would require something as pompous as a multi-tiered epilogue. 

 










What meaning there is behind “Fuck My Son!” is easy enough to understand: Enjoy this kind of garbage while you can, because it won't be long before late night TV hosts are locked in jail, Donald Trump starts talking about Eddington as if it were a real town he saw on Fox News, and everyone who saw “One Battle After Another” is labeled as a card-carrying member of Antifa (the “A” in “AMC A-List” stands for “Anarchy”). Appreciate when slop could still be a display of defiance instead, and not just the visual language of cultural defeat. See “Fuck My Son!” not because it's good, but rather because it refuses to pretend that it isn't bad. If only that argument were enough to convince me that it shouldn't have been better.

“Fuck My Son!” opens at the IFC Center in New York City on Thursday, October 16, before traveling to other theaters around the country. Its full touring schedule can be found here.

Alec Baldwin and his brother Stephen Baldwin were involved in a vehicle crash in The Hamptons on Monday, Oct. 13, TMZ reports. The two got in the accident when “they barreled head-first into a tree as they drove in their Range Rover.”

A post shared by Muzikali Récords (@muzikalirecords)

Photos obtained by TMZ show the results of the accident regarding the car. In them, Baldwin and his brother are seen talking with police, as well as in another photo showing Baldwin appearing very stressed while speaking on the phone. And then a garbage truck can be seen in another shot; however, the owner told TMZ that the truck's driver was not at fault.

“It's clear from the footage — the entire front end of the SUV is totaled. What's not clear is who was driving and who owns the Range Rover,” the outlet writes, adding that they reached out to the Hampton Police Department for ore information but have yet to hear back. TMZ also reached out to representatives for Alec and Stephen Baldwin, but there has been no response. 

A post shared by Alec Baldwin (@alecbaldwininsta)

Following the crash, Baldwin posted a video on his Instagram, updating fans.

“I just want to post a quick message. I got all these inquiries about my car thing this morning. I was in a car accident this morning. I'm fine. My brother Stephen was out visiting me on Long Island, and we spent the weekend out there for the film festival,” he said. 

 It has been a rough couple of years for Baldwin, who has been dealing with the fallout from the tragic accident that occurred on the set of the Western movie “Rust,” where Baldwin was holding a prop revolver that went off and killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

Baldwin faced involuntary manslaughter charges, which were filed in January 2024 due to negligent use of a firearm without due caution or circumspection. But, in 2024, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer, threw out the charge after finding that prosecutors withheld key evidence from the defense. 

When the charges were thrown out by the judge, Baldwin was overcome with emotion, seen breaking down in tears. 

A post shared by Alec Baldwin (@alecbaldwininsta)

In Week 4 on this season of “Dancing with the Stars,” Baldwin's wife, Hilaria was eliminated. And afterwards, he shared a heartfelt message, showing how proud he was of all she did. 

“It was wonderful to be able to support you as you support us every day,” he wrote. “Never stop dancing.”

Baldwin was in the crowd each and every week to support his wife, and was even seen with the Kardashian family matriarch.

“Never stop dancing!!!!!! 💃🏻❤️😍,” Kris Jenner commented on the post.

Baldwin and his wife got married in June 2021, and the couple has seven children together.



Married in 2021 and seven kids?

Married in 2021 and 7 kids?

well kids before marriage and twins?

Don't tell me, it wasn't his fault.

He never takes accountability for anything. Narcissists never do.

How do you know this, are you a psychiatric field professional? Or just a nut posting trash?

The castaways in Lost, Lord Of The Flies, Yellowjackets, and the rest had it easy: At least they didn't have to build their new island societies with the pompous boss who called them out on their “noxious odors” just a few days earlier. The same can't be said of Linda Liddle (Rachel McAdams), one of only two plane crash survivors in Sam Raimi‘s latest thriller, Send Help. The other, as you probably already guessed, is her employer Bradley Preston, played with appropriately off-putting swagger by Dylan O'Brien. But while most of us in Linda's position would likely be the ones calling for help out of this literal nightmare scenario, Linda sees only opportunity. 

As it turns out, Linda is actually quite good at the game of tropical survival. She builds a shelter Survivor players would give their left arm for in a matter of days and finds out she really enjoys hunting, which she tells a horrified Bradley as she throws a bloody boar's head at his feet. Better yet, they're “not in the office anymore” and, at least in Linda's estimation, “No help is coming.” It's a perfect chance for her to give herself a little promotion. “You are stuck with an asshole boss, just like I was,” she tells her new subordinate. “Although I'm betting I'm a much nicer boss than you ever would have been.”



Sam Raimi fans also needed to be sent a little help to deal with the excitement when this film was announced. It's not just the genre legend's first non-Marvel feature in over a decade (since 2013's Oz The Great And Powerful), but an entirely original film based on no existing IP. “I found the two lead characters, Linda and Bradley, to be complex, human, and constantly at odds with each other in often conflicting situations,” Raimi recently told Entertainment Weekly of the Damian Shannon and Mark Swift-penned script. “The pitch was outrageous and original, all the while tracking these two in their conflict as their power dynamic changed dramatically. I knew right away that I wanted to direct this picture.” Send Help sends out its first S.O.S. call January 30 in theaters.

Sony Pictures is opening Mandalay Pictures' new action movie Archangel starring Jim Caviezel, Olivia Thirlby, Garret Dillahunt and Shea Whigham on Nov. 6, 2026. This is the first we're hearing about the project, particularly with Sony's attachment. Plot details are under wraps. 


Will Eubank directs (Land of Bad, Underwater) from a script by Chris Papasadero and Oscar nominee Randall Wallace (Braveheart, We Were Soldiers). Pic is produced by David Zelon and William Sherak. Peter Guber is executive producing.


	Eubank recently directed Land Of Bad starring Liam Hemsworth and Russell Crowe and Underwater starring Kristen Stewart. His first feature, Love, was a breakout success, playing at numerous film festivals and won the Santa Barbara International Film Festival's “Best of the Fest” award. The filmmaker is repped by CAA, Anonymous Content, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole LLP (JSSK).

	Thirlby broke out in the Oscar-winning movie Juno and her most recent credits include the Academy Award winning film Oppenheimer and TV series Y: The Last Man. The actress is represented by Verve, 3 Arts Entertainment, and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren & Richman. 


	Dillahunt is best known for his performances in the Coen Brothers Oscar-winning drama No Country for Old Men, the critically acclaimed film Winter's Bone, and the HBO series Deadwood. He recently appeared in Zack Snyder's Army of the Dead. The actor is repped by Independent Artist Group and D2 Management.


	Whigham's credits include Boardwalk Empire, True Detective, Joker, American Hustle, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, and multiple entries in the Fast & Furious franchise. He is repped by WME and Range. 

	











Archangel will open against Warner Bros Animation's The Cat in the Hat and an untitled Disney feature movie on Nov. 6 next year. The movie's release date benefits from the Veteran's Day holiday falling during the title's opening week. There's also great spacing between adult male-skewing titles, Archangel arriving three weeks after Street Fighter and four weeks before Violent Night 2.

Sam Raimi has spent much of the 21st century playing with some of the biggest I.P. that Hollywood has to offer. His trilogy of “Spider-Man” films helped establish the superhero movie as we know it (and are still considered some of the best efforts that the genre has ever seen), “Oz the Great and Powerful” saw him put his own stamp on arguably the most iconic movie in Hollywood history, and “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” saw him return to the Marvel sandbox. 

But to many horror fans, his sole original directorial outing of the 2000s remains his best work of the century: “Drag Me to Hell.” Anyone who prefers their Raimi films bloody, darkly funny, and reminiscent of his '80s and '90s output has likely been longing for another film in that vein for years — and now they might be getting their wish with “Send Help.”

Raimi's new film, which hits theaters in January and released its first trailer today, is a psychological thriller set on a deserted island in which two co-workers (Rachel McAdams and Dylan O'Brien) are stranded together after a plane crash. They'll be forced to work through their past grievances if they want any chance of surviving.

“I've always loved stories where interesting, dynamic characters are pushed to extremes,” Raimi said in a press release.  “In our story, the power shifts create an escalating situation that's brimming with unexpected turns and suspense.”

“Send Help” is written by Damian Shannon & Mark Swift, with frequent Raimi collaborator Danny Elfman composing the original score. Raimi produces alongside Zainab Azizi and JJ Hook. 

While a new film directed by Raimi has become a depressingly rare occasion, the filmmaker maintains a packed slate of producing projects. In addition to recent films like “Locked” and “Don't Move,” he continues to oversee a steady flow of new “Evil Dead” movies (next up: “Evil Dead Burn” in 2026) and has teased a desire to return to the “Spider-Man” franchise with Tobey Maguire. 

A 20th Century Studios release, “Send Help” opens in theaters on Friday, January 30. Watch the trailer below.

EXCLUSIVE: James Norton has been tapped to play The Beatles longtime manager Brian Epstein in Sam Mendes' The Beatles — A Four-Film Cinematic Event, sources tell Deadline.


	Reps for Sony declined to comment. Ronan joins a cast that includes Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr, Joseph Quinn as George Harrison, and Harris Dickinson as John Lennon. With each of the Mendes-directed Beatles films telling the story of a different member of the band, unknown how significant a role he'd have in each film but given Epstein's influence on group, he is expected to be featured in each film.

	











	Epstein first met the Beatles in 1961 at a lunchtime concert at Liverpool's Cavern Club and even though he had no experience managing musicians, Epstein put them under contract. He also attempted to get the Beatles a recording contract, eventually securing a deal with EMI's Parlophone label.

	We were first to report on the Beatles films from Mendes, all of which will be released in theaters in April 2028, in a bold experiment in eventizing. Mendes will direct from scripts written by Jez Butterworth, Peter Straughan and Jack Thorne, as we told you first, though it's unclear which projects each is tackling. A collaboration between Sony Pictures Entertainment and Mendes' Neal Street Productions, the films will be produced by Mendes, Pippa Harris and Julie Pastor of Neal Street, as well as Alexandra Derbyshire, in association with Apple Corps for Sony Pictures.


	This marks the first time that The Beatles and Apple Corps Ltd. have authorized the use of the band members' life stories and music in scripted films. In addition to distributing, Sony Pictures is the financier of the projects.


	Norton is no stranger to biopics about legendary musicians recently appearing in Paramount's Bob Marley pic Bob Marley: One Love.


	Norton can be seen in the highly anticipated Netflix limited series House Of Guinness which recently premiered on the streamer last month. He also recently wrapped production on the third season of HBO's House of the Dragon.












	He is repped by WME and The Artists Partnership.

The New York Film Festival was a family affair for the Daniel Day-Lewis and Rebecca Miller family. Day-Lewis returned from retirement to co-write and star in “Anemone,” directed by his 27-year-old son Ronan, who sent in his film after his mother submitted her five-hour Martin Scorsese documentary, “Mr. Scorsese.” New York Film Festival artistic Director Dennis Lim invited them both.

When we met for coffee the day after the October 4 premiere, Miller couldn't believe that 1,000 people sat still in Alice Tully Hall for five hours without leaving. That may be due to what her husband told her afterwards: “It reminded people of how much they love him.”

That's what the series does. I'm of an age. I grew up with all these movies. I watched them when they came out, from “Mean Streets,” “Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,” and “Taxi Driver” through “Raging Bull,” “The Aviator,” “The Wolf of Wall Street,” and “Killers of the Flower Moon.” (And that's not all!) My first job out of NYU Cinema Studies was in the United Artists publicity bullpen; I worked on both “New York, New York” (1977) and “The Last Waltz” (1978). While Miller doesn't tell the story of how much it cost UA, in the pre-digital era, to erase the coke hanging out of Neil Young's nose, frame by frame, she does capture that coke-fueled era in all its frenzied glory. 

 










Scorsese is part of the fabric of any cinephile's life. And soon, any Apple TV subscriber can enjoy Miller's fast-moving five-year dive into his life and films. (Miller showed the streamer four hours of interviews with Scorsese and got substantial backing, first for a two-hour feature, then a five-hour series.) She gets loads of help from Scorsese's ample archives and his longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker (who scored applause at Alice Tully Hall), as well as his surviving childhood friends from Little Italy and work cohorts Day-Lewis, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jay Cocks, Nicholas Pileggi, Paul Schrader, and more. The good news for the always busy Scorsese: After some 10 interviews (20 hours) running from the start of the pandemic through the present, he's not talking about himself for a bit.

Miller, a narrative filmmaker (“Maggie's Plan”) who directed a 2017 documentary about her father (“Arthur Miller: Writer”), isn't afraid to ask for help. She first met Scorsese during the filming of “Gangs of New York,” which starred Day-Lewis. She asked the director for recommendations of movies with good voiceovers. He gave her a list. She then asked him to give her notes on a rough cut of her first film, “Personal Velocity” (2002). He watched it and told her where it slowed down, and she made a fix. She turned to him again for input on her films “The Ballad of Jack and Rose” (2005) and “The Private Lives of Pippa Lee” (2009).

 










Her interest in Scorsese was rooted “in the apparent anomaly of his spiritual life as a Catholic and his fascination with violence,” she said. “How do those two things go together?” So she reached out to Margaret Bodde, his documentary producer. “Well, why not ask?” said Miller. “That's always my motto for everything: It never hurts to ask. It's one of the privileges of having been around people that intimidate other people, and realizing they're just people. They often don't get asked things that actually they would love to be asked.”

That's how she felt the confidence to ask Bodde if anyone was making a documentary about Scorsese. “No,” Bodde said. “Nobody is. People are definitely asking a lot. But he just keeps saying ‘no.'” First, Scorsese asked for an email pitch. (Miller suggested a periscope approach, illuminating him from multiple perspectives.) Then, he asked for a meeting. “During this meeting, he began to talk about it as something that was going to happen,” said Miller. “He started saying, ‘Well, and then we could do this, and then we could do that. We could shoot in the office.' I was [thinking], ‘Are we making this movie? What's going on?' So we hugged. I left.”

Miller called her producer Damon Cardasis and said, “I think we're making this movie.” She and the producers put up a little money. “By this time, the pandemic is in full swing; nobody can move,” she said. “Marty is stuck in his study. And it was just a tiny handful of people on my porch. So it was not an expensive thing. And he came upstate and sat down for two and a half hours.”

 










After a Zoom interview with Scorsese, she used the audio where he says, “What are we? Are we essentially good or evil?” — she said, “he's different when no one's in the room. So frank and so naked. So after that, I had everyone set up the cameras and leave the room so we were alone. Then, we got into his study, which was what I was angling for the whole time. I really wanted to get into his sanctum. And it felt very intimate.”

Miller gets good stuff out of De Niro, Scorsese's collaborator on 10 films, who is not an easy interview. “If you just count the words, it was a sparse interview,” she said. “But if you look at what he gave me in terms of his expressions, it was rich, and it was all inside of him. It's the way he is on screen, too. It's a lesson in screen acting. At the end of it, the crew is like, ‘Oh my God, he didn't say anything!' And I was like, ‘No, I think we're OK.'”

Images can be stronger than words. When Miller confronted the time when Scorsese is fighting for his life in a New York hospital, there's a dramatic moment when De Niro urges Scorsese to commit to making “Raging Bull.” Scorsese said, “OK, finally, OK.” Scorsese needed a movie to make. Otherwise, he couldn't live. So he recovered in order to make “Raging Bull.” “It was the meaning of his life,” said Miller. “You have a gift, and you have to do your best with the gift.”

 










Every time Scorsese headed into bleak days in his career, someone rescued him. “I called them his angels,” said Miller. “In other words, he encounters people at the bottom of his life that help him to the next level. Part of it is the strength of his personality: He has something that makes people want to help him, that is his personal charm. There's something inside of him.”

Editor Thelma Schoonmaker was one angel. Scorsese pulled Schoonmaker out of the documentary world. He had loved working with her on “Woodstock” (1969). “He meets Thelma, then he loses her,” said Miller. “But he gets her back because he remembers ‘she's the only person I can trust.' Can you imagine learning how to cut feature film on ‘Raging Bull?'” On their first collaboration after nine years, “Raging Bull” (1980), they broke all the rules. Schoonmaker shows what they did on “Raging Bull” on the Avid, frame by frame.

Miller was prepared on the films, “but with his own life, I knew very little,” she said. “Most of the questions about his life are me just saying, ‘I didn't know a lot of these things.' I wasn't a Scorsese expert in a biographical sense. And that was actually helpful, because had I been manipulating the situation in any way, it would have been maybe palpable to him, versus genuinely asking questions. Whereas with the films, of course, I had studied the films, that's what I had in front of me.”

 










Admirably, Scorsese never backed down or compromised when the studios or someone like Harvey Weinstein tried to make him change his films. In that sense, he stayed pure. “The Color of Money” (1986), starring Tom Cruise and Paul Newman, may have been a mainstream studio picture with stars that made money, but Scorsese not only delivered a hit, but a good movie. ($52 million worldwide in 1986.)

“Listen, it was literally a survival situation at that point,” said Miller. When he was asked to change his films, “his attitude was like, ‘then I'll just go. I'll steal the film. Or I'll take my name off.' There was a deep, ethical thing. It wasn't standing up for yourself to do it. It's a sense, like you're betraying something deep, if you compromise.”

Another angel, DiCaprio, rescued Scorsese by wanting to work with him. Suddenly, Scorsese's more expensive projects were bankable. Scorsese could make “Gangs of New York,” also starring Daniel Day-Lewis, “The Aviator,” also starring Cate Blanchett, “The Wolf of Wall Street,” which launched Margot Robbie's career, and “Killers of the Flower Moon,” with De Niro, which pushed newcomer Lily Gladstone to an Oscar nomination.

Scorsese is candid about his turbulent internal landscape, forged in the hardscrabble Italian upbringing that fueled his movies, from “Mean Streets” to “Goodfellas.” But moving through the ups and downs of his career — and he had many dips — you see how he got to that breakdown in 1978, from the never-ending production of the musical “New York, New York” (1977) to his insistence on making The Band concert movie “The Last Waltz” (1978) with his roommate and coke buddy Robbie Robertson at the same time. Leonardo DiCaprio points out that Scorsese made no money on that film. His agent was furious. “I got to make the film,” said Scorsese.

 










“It struck me. He's so honest to himself,” said Miller. “It's a real lesson, because everybody wants to lie to themselves a little bit about who they are, what's going on. He doesn't lie to himself that much. He's brutally honest with himself…It's also so rare that such a personal artist connects with the culture in such a deep way. Time after time, he inflames the culture. Look at what happened with ‘Last Temptation of Christ,' my God.”

In Miller's portrait, the filmmaker goes through isolation, loneliness, and pain. He always felt like an outsider in Los Angeles. He drove himself hard. And he was not so easy to live with for the women in his life, five wives and three daughters: Cathy (first wife Laraine Marie Brennan), Domenica Cameron-Scorsese (second wife Julia Cameron), and Francesca (current wife Helen Morris). Cathy reveals how wonderful it was to be directed by him in a supporting role in “Casino” (1995). (In contrast, we infer, to the rest of her more distant interactions with him.) And third wife Isabella Rossellini, while affectionate toward him, is candid about how angry and destructive Scorsese could be. (He never hit her, she said.)

“What's fascinating is the journey and the hope,” said Miller. “You see a person who maybe, essentially, hasn't changed, in the sense that the little boy who is making those drawings is still that person now. But he's changed. There's been so much evolution in him. It's interesting from the point of view of character.”

 










Clearly, Scorsese has used therapy, meditation, and other tools to keep his frenetic life on a calmer track. He spends time with his youngest daughter, Francesca, and his wife, Helen Morris, who has been battling Parkinson's for 30 years. 

“She wanted to be present in the film,” said Miller. “So we came in and we did it, and it was right, because she's his wife, and she should be in the movie. Also, it's important to see him in that home space, as he is now. You never want to be exploitative, but at the same time, clear-eyed, keep your eyes open. If anything, [Marty] teaches you to not look away. As Spike Lee says, at some point, ‘people want to look away, and he doesn't look away.'”

In the end, Miller had to make some tough choices about what to leave out, including “Hugo” and the filmmaker's television and documentary work. Finally, “Hugo” didn't relate to the themes she was pursuing.

“‘Hugo' is the only one we don't have,” she said. “Essentially, the art and the life are in a tango, right? You can't separate them with this man, because they were sewn together when he was a very small child. So the film only makes sense when those two things are clasped together. The minute we stopped doing that, it would turn into a list movie, which is my idea of hell. The big challenge with this movie was transitions of thought and making them feel like nothing. You need to hold the audience. You need to keep the reins of the film tight.”

 










The final editorial debate was one of length. This was an Apple TV conversation. “They gave us a decent budget, not immense, but definitely decent,” said Miller. “It had to increase slightly, because originally it was a feature film.”

After about eight months of cutting, she realized it was a series. “‘I can't do this,'” she said. “There was a version, of course, of a 15-minute childhood and [snaps fingers] get to ‘Mean Streets.' ‘This is terrible. It's boring. We know everything.' I started realizing we have to go deep into the original friends. It's like the kryptonite, the stuff that he molded everything out of.”

The series links De Niro's character in their first collaboration, “Mean Streets,” Johnny Boy, to other roles in the Scorsese oeuvre. He was based on a real guy [Salvatore “Sally” Uricola] in his neighborhood. “At first, Marty didn't say his name, like he was not somebody that we were never going to talk to,” Miller said. “He was almost a mythic figure, and for whatever reason, it was just not even in the cards at all that I was going to talk to him. There was “a fascination with this young man who was this outlaw, really, who even within the mob scene of the ‘serious guys' was a cowboy, he was unpredictable. That's why De Niro said, ‘Is he still alive?' Because nobody could believe that he survived, that they didn't kill him.”

 










Scorsese's old neighborhood pal Robert Uricola helped her out when she said, “Gee, I'm really sorry we couldn't meet your brother.” Robert instantly phoned Salvatore and invited him to join them, and he showed up 15 minutes later, his shirt open to the waist, his face ravaged by hard living. Miller was shocked to find herself in the room with Salvatore and reached blindly for a question. “He's worried because he doesn't know what's going on,” she said. “He said, ‘My brother can tell you most of it, and the rest of it is off the record.'”

She asked him if he ever blew up a mailbox. Cut to Johnny Boy blowing up a mailbox in “Mean Streets.” “Yes,” he said.

“Mr. Scorsese” premieres on Apple TV on Friday, October 17.

The neo-soul icon was 51.

	Michael Saponara



	R&B legend D'Angelo has died at 51 years old following a battle with cancer, the singer's family confirmed in a statement on Tuesday (Oct. 14).


	“The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,” the statement, which was shared with Billboard, began. “After a prolonged and courageous battle with cancer, we are heartbroken to announce that Michael D'Angelo Archer, known to his fans around the world as D'Angelo, has been called home, departing this life today, Oct. 14, 2025.”


	“We are saddened that he can only leave dear memories with his family, but we are eternally grateful for the legacy of extraordinarily moving music he leaves behind,” the statement continued. “We ask that you respect our privacy during this difficult time but invite you all join us in mourning his passing while also celebrating the gift of song that he has left for the world.” 

	











	Born Michael Archer in Richmond, Va., D'Angelo became a pioneer of the neo-soul movement in the mid-'90s while pulling on elements of hip-hop, jazz, gospel, R&B and funk.


	He broke through co-producing the top 40 Billboard Hot 100 hit “U Will Know” for Black Men United in 1994. D'Angelo released his Brown Sugar debut album in 1995 on EMI to critical acclaim. The LP was powered by lead single “Brown Sugar” (No. 27), “Cruisin'” (No. 53) and “Lady,” which reached the Hot 100's top 10.


	After peaking at No. 22 on the Billboard 200 in March 1996, the influential Brown Sugar spent 65 weeks on the chart and collected four Grammy nominations.

	











	D'Angelo made an appearance on Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in 1998 and the iconic singer's much-delayed Brown Sugar follow-up, Voodoo, arrived in January 2000 via Virgin Records. 


Voodoo was preceded by a triumvirate of singles with “Devil's Pie,” “Left & Right” (No. 70) and “Untitled (How Does It Feel),” which reached No. 25 on the Hot 100. The groovy Raphael Saadiq co-produced hit peaked at No. 2 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.


	D'Angelo's sophomore album was a commercial success, debuting atop the Billboard 200 in February 2000 with 320,000 total album units earned in its opening set. His third and final album finally arrived in December 2014, as Black Messiah topped the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.


	D'Angelo won four Grammys, including awards for best R&B album for Voodoo in 2001 and Black Messiah in 2016. He also won best male R&B vocal performance in 2001 for “Untitled (How Does It Feel”) and  best R&B song in 2016 for “Really Love.” The latter hit was also nominated for record of the year, his only nomination in a “Big Four” category.


DJ Premier was one of the first to break the news of D'Angelo's death publicly on Tuesday morning. “Such a sad loss to the passing of D'angelo,” Preemo wrote to X about his “Devil's Pie” collaborator. “We have so many great times. Gonna miss you so much. Sleep Peacefully D' Love You KING.”


	Tributes have continued to pour in on social media from peers around music, including comments from Tyler, the Creator, Jill Scott, E-40, Royce Da 5'9 and Timbaland. D'Angelo is survived by his three children.

R&B singer D'Angelo has tragically passed away at the age of 51 from pancreatic cancer, TMZ reports. He passed away on the morning of Tuesday, Oct. 14 in New York City, family sources as well as his former manager Kedar Massenberg told the outlet.

Throughout his career, D'Angelo won four Grammy awards, including Best R&B Album for “Voodoo” in 2001 and “Black Messiah” in 2016. In 2016 he also won Best R&B Song for “Really Love” and Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for “Untitled (How Does It Feel).”

D'Angelo is survived by his two sons and his daughter.

D'Angelo's family confirmed news of his passing, releasing a statement to Variety. 

“The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life…After a prolonged and courageous battle with cancer, we are heartbroken to announce that Michael D'Angelo Archer, known to his fans around the world as D'Angelo, has been called home, departing this life today, October 14th, 2025. We are saddened that he can only leave dear memories with his family, but we are eternally grateful for the legacy of extraordinarily moving music he leaves behind.  We ask that you respect our privacy during this difficult time but invite you all join us in mourning his passing while also celebrating the gift of song that he has left for the world.”

DJ Premier collaborated on D'Angelo's 1998 track “Devil's Pie,” and he posted a sweet message, celebrating the soul singer's legacy.

“Such a sad loss to the passing of D'angelo. We have so many great times. Gonna miss you so much. Sleep Peacefully D' Love You KING,” he wrote on X.

A post shared by TMZ (@tmz_tv)

Following news of D'Angelo's passing, many people took to social media, posting heartfelt tributes for the singer. 

“he was so incredibly talented. Such a sad loss in music. RIP,” one person commented. 

“This is devastating, I still listen to the brown sugar album front to back at least once a week,” another person wrote. 

“His music will live with us forever,” one fan said. 

Angie Stone and D'Angelo began dating in 1994, having met while working on his first album, “Brown Sugar.” The two welcomed their son, Michael Archer Jr, in 1997, but the two ended their relationship in 1999. 

Earlier this year, Stone tragically passed away at the age of 63 in a car crash, and the son she and D'Angelo share posted a sweet tribute to his mother. 

“Hey mama, I ain't want nothing, just wanted to say I love you ……. I know you up there enjoying your god body 😂 I hope you got to see grandma and granddaddy …….i want you know how proud I am at the person you are…. I want you to know how much you inspired me every single day …… you never failed me ever ever….you never were a burden to me EVER … if I had to do it all again I wouldn't change nothing….im so grateful for the lessons that I learned from you, I hope to one day be as good to my kids as you were to me…..I just wanted to you to know that I got it from here , imma be okay… and imma LONG LIVE YOU 4Ever🕊️ love you mama,” he posted on Instagram.

How beautiful is it that he loved his Mother so very much,his music moved so many of us….but this post moves me even deeper into seeing the man he was and that he loved his mother deeply…that is the a true son and man!

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: New Regency has preemptively acquired a new thriller pitch from filmmaker Daniel Goldhaber (How to Blow Up a Pipeline), Deadline has learned.


	While unconfirmed, sources said Goldhaber will write and direct the project himself. Specific details around the story are under wraps but sources describe it as a propulsive, character-driven thriller with a socially combustible premise that explores the theme of the 99% against the 1%. Goldhaber conceived the story with Jordan Sjol.


	Goldhaber comes to the sale after co-writing and directing an adaptation of the cult classic horror film Faces of Death, which is currently fielding distribution offers. Legendary financed and produced the pic with Angry Films, Divide/Conquer, and Isa Mazzei, as well as stars Barbie Ferreira and Dacre Montgomery. The filmmaker previously helmed the politically controversial How to Blow Up a Pipleline, which had a buzzy premiere at TIFF, where it was acquired by Neon in a bidding war, and won Best Editing at the 2024 Indie Spirit Awards. He also directed the Blumhouse-produced techno horror Cam, which won Best First Feature at Fantasia Film Festival, where it was acquired by Netflix.

	











	For New Regency, the Goldhaber pact follows deals for Stephen Herman's thriller short story “They're Still Here” — which they'll produce for the big screen alongside Phantom Four (Antlers) and Good Fear (Mulan) — as well as the erotic thriller spec Fixation to be produced with Bruna Papandrea's Made Up Stories. We were first to report on both.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Upcoming on the feature side, New Regency has Psycho Killer, a horror thriller penned by Se7en‘s Andrew Kevin Walker which releases through 20th Century Studios on February 20, 2026. Their slate also includes Blood Meridian, an adaptation of the novel from Pulitzer Prize-winner Cormac McCarthy, to be directed by John Hillcoat from a script by Oscar winner John Logan, and an adaptation of the Ubisoft game Watch Dogs starring Tom Blyth and Sophie Wilde.


	Goldhaber is represented by CAA, Anonymous Content, and attorney Danny Passman of Gang, Tyre, Ramer.

Has anyone been more employed on the festival circuit this year than Josh O'Connor? The Challengers actor stars in Oliver Hermanus' History Of Sound, Kelly Reichardt's The Mastermind, and Rian Johnson's Wake Up Dead Man, all of which already have teasers or trailers for those of us who couldn't make it to Cannes or Toronto. Now, we also have a trailer for Rebuilding, O'Connor's fourth festival film of the year. Max Walker-Silverman's sophomore feature bowed this past January at Sundance, and if the trailer is any indication, it'll be another great addition to the growing canon of melancholy but beautiful O'Connor-led films.

In the “gently humanist” story, O'Connor plays Dusty, a Colorado rancher and “reserved, divorced father whose ranch has burned down in a devastating wildfire,” per the film's synopsis. Dusty moves into a trailer on a government-run campsite where he meets a community of neighbors who've also lost everything. With their support, as well as the young daughter (Lila LaTorre) and ex-wife (Meghann Fahy) with whom he recently reconnected, Dusty finally starts to rebuild. 



In a director's statement, Walker-Silverman shared that he was inspired to make the film after losing his grandmother's land to a similarly devastating wildfire. While he said the experience of returning to the formerly “green and magnificent” expanse was “sad in countless ways,” it also provided a sliver of hope: “There was green too. Seedlings pushing through the ash. Purple flower buds. And seeing the small stubborn ways that nature returns was so fascinating it left hardly any space for sadness at all.”

“This paradox began to birth this story,” he went on. “How could a place be so impermanent—it has burned and will burn again, it's changing as all places change, growing and struggling as all places grow and struggle—and yet so clearly be home?” Rebuilding premieres November 14 in theaters.

	Garcia's latest follows Joe Diamond, a man out of time with a traumatic past and an uncanny ability to solve crimes, using wit and observation to peel back hidden truths. This is the third directorial for Garcia after the 1993 documentary, Cachao… Como Su Ritmo No Hay Dos, and 2005's The Lost City. 


			Watch on Deadline		







	The CineSon Entertainment production is currently shooting in Los Angeles.


	“I've been working on this story for close to 15 years. This is not unusual for films in the independent world. Stories take time to unfold. They haunt you as you continue to work on them. When they are ready, in their own time, the movie gods open the window of opportunity. Perhaps we exhaust them with our persistence. So, they give up and bless you with this extraordinary cast of actors to tell your story. Dreams sometimes come true. As Joe Diamond, the protagonist in our story, states: ‘Dreams are a way of escaping your reality, unless those dreams are your reality,'” Gracia tells Deadline about the feature which he also wrote and produced.

The 'Euphoria' and 'White Lotus' actor and memoirist — 'I Wrote This for Attention' is out now — opens up about Googling himself, divorcing in public and the diagnosis that reframed everything.


							By 

	Seija Rankin


Senior Editor


Lukas Gage knows he's an easy target. “I have an energy that people don't totally get on board with at the beginning or don't believe is real,” he says. As an actor — he first broke out on Euphoria and the first season of The White Lotus — he's often played the punchable-face archetype. “People see me on talk shows or on that reality show [Keeping Up With the Kardashians, more on that later], and it can feel very ‘pick me.'”


	So when he decided to name his memoir I Wrote This for Attention, he knew exactly what he was doing. The book, which started out of a strike-induced desire to channel energy into a creative project, covers all the topics he knows people want to hear about. Mainly: his very public whirlwind romance (and equally whirlwind divorce) with celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton and the time that a video of an accidentally un-muted director criticizing his apartment during an audition (“These poor people live in these tiny apartments”) went viral. Gage also spends significant time reflecting on his childhood in San Diego and opens up about his recent borderline personality diagnosis.

	“I wanted to be honest, and I also want to be understood and to take accountability for my behavior, because victimhood can prevent you from true freedom,” he says. “Being accountable is very sexy. And also, I do want attention!”


How does releasing a book feel, especially compared to promoting your acting work?With acting, if you get a bad review, you can kind of blame it on the writing or the director or the editing. There's so many things that are not in your control. This book is just me, so there's no one to blame. But I'm inviting criticism just by writing it, and by giving it this title. I'm inviting people to have conversations and not necessarily agree with me, and that's okay.

	











How comfortable are you with that? Does inviting criticism come easily?


	No, I do give a shit what people think. But I also know that it comes with the territory when you're a public figure and you have to just expect it and accept it.


Was there a defining moment for you when you realized you were, in fact, a public figure?


	We live in such a weird time right now where anyone can get famous overnight. I'm a unique case. Most people start as a working actor and then become a public figure and then a celebrity. That's the normal pipeline. Mine was: working actor for a second, then public figure because of my viral video [in which a director is caught on a hot mic criticizing my apartment during an audition] and then back to a working actor. It was chaotic, and I'm still kind of juggling that.


A lot of people write memoirs and either don't think about, or forget, that people are going to read it. But you speak directly to your reader.


	Oh yeah, I was very much aware that everything I was writing would be out in the world. The title is a double entendre, it's me seeking attention and validation and understanding from the world and reaching out, but it was also me seeking that for myself. I'm being self-deprecating and self-aware, but I also have the understanding that there's something I need from myself.


What is your current relationship to reading about yourself online?


	I would be lying if I said I don't look myself up. I'm not as obsessive as I once was. There was this really weird side of myself that fed off this dark, negative criticism — and I was fueling it by only searching for the bad things. Like, yep, I thought this about myself and now I know it for sure. I'm always going to be a curious little freak, but I don't need to let it consume me anymore. I don't need to be so involved with what Sally from Ohio hates about me and my book and my face. But anyone who says they don't read reviews and stuff at all is full of shit.

	











When you read through your old journals to write about your childhood years, what stuck out to you must?


	How much of a liar I was. I lied so much to my own journal. Lying was a tool to help me get out of certain situations, but I didn't realize how much it was also a tool to change my own narrative about myself. I was a bit of a provocateur, an exhibitionist and a brat as a kid and seeing that helped me make sense of why I was like that.


Did you give any of your exes a heads up that you'd be writing about your relationships with them?


	No. I'm not huge on staying in touch. Being cordial is fine, but I don't try to keep up conversations with them. And besides the obvious public one, I try to make an effort to protect their identities and make it hard to figure out who is who. And there are two sides to every story, so if their perception of what happened is different than mine, involving them gets messy.


Some people are more obscured; you have a character called The Ex that I thought was Chris Appleton at first. It quickly becomes clear it's a different guy, but then you also don't name him even though it's obvious it's him. Can you talk about your strategy there?


	It's funny you say that because you're not the first person who was confused by The Ex. I clearly have a type. There was no way to obscure my ex-husband's identity because that relationship played out so publicly. But I did decide not to get into the more personal nitty-gritty of it all; it didn't feel fair because of how obvious it was that it was him. It's funny that my big public marriage is one of the shortest relationships of the whole book. There's also just less to say about it.

	











Do you expect to hear from people who are in the book?


	I don't think so. I sent early copies to the people who I still know, or whose approval of it I wanted. Even the people where it's like, I know you hate me and our relationship's fractured, but here's the book.


I was a little surprised that you wrote about the experience of your video with the director critiquing your apartment, mostly because I figured you'd be sick of talking about it by now. Did you wrestle with wanting to just move on?


	I've been asked about it so much, but also in short interviews you can only sort of deliver sound bites on it. I wanted to explore the parts I haven't been able to talk about, which is that even though I chose to post the video, it didn't come without its repercussions. I wasn't, like, loving life and being like, I'm viral, I'm cool. I was freaking out. I didn't want to get anyone canceled. I wanted attention, but I was realizing I didn't want it like that. Getting recognition for the first time, as the kid who got made fun of for his apartment, wasn't on my vision board. But now it's like, here you go, here's the whole scoop, now I'm over it.


Do you still feel like a working actor?


	Yes, my career isn't much different than it was five years ago. I'm not getting offers, I'm auditioning for what I book. But I think being competitive fires me up. I am really excited for Rosebush Pruning, this film I'm in with people like Riley Keough, Callum Turner, Elle Fanning. I've never played a role in a film that is this substantial; I'm mostly just like doing jump scares into TV shows and then leaving, so I think this is going to show people a different side of me.

Julianna Barwick and Mary Lattimore have joined forces for a new tour and album. Tragic Magic is a work of “musical telepathy,” says Barwick, who has collaborated with Lattimore on a string of songs and remixes, most recently the Adult Swim single “Canyon Lights.” The album arrives January 16, 2026, via InFiné, and the duo's dates in North America and Europe kick off the following month. Find their full itinerary below, along with the album art and tracklist.

Co-produced by Trevor Spencer, Tragic Magic was recorded in the wake of the January 2025 wildfires in California, to which “Melted Moon” is a response. The song is accompanied by a live performance video, shot at Lou Lou's Jungle Room at San Diego's Lafayette Hotel and directed by Joel Kazuo Knoernschild. The album also includes a song written by Roger Eno (“Temple of the Winds”) and a Vangelis cover (“Rachel's Song”).

When Max Walker-Silverman's “Rebuilding” made its world premiere at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival this January, it hit home for so many who had flown in from Los Angeles. After the devastating Palisades and Altadena fires, here was a delicate drama about life after a wildfire that, for one rancher played by Josh O'Connor, seems to have claimed just about everything. Watch the trailer for “Rebuilding” below.”

As IndieWire's David Ehrlich wrote in this B+ review of “Rebuilding” from the festival, “Loath as I am to label anything as ‘the movie people need right now,' it's hard to think of Max Walker-Silverman's ‘Rebuilding' in any other terms at the moment.”

O'Connor's character has endured his disaster in Colorado, where he's been making a living off the land. Now, after the fire, the bank that holds the mortgage on his property won't give him a loan to rebuild: He doesn't have a house to borrow on to invest in the farm itself any longer, and no crops to borrow on to rebuild the house. The movie focuses on his tender relationship with his daughter Callie-Rose (Lily LaTorre) and ex-wife Ruby (“The White Lotus” and “Drop” star Meghann Fahy) as he tries to put the pieces back together.

 










“O'Connor can be found in virtually every frame, often staring at the dirt or squinting at the horizon,” Ehrlich noted in his review. “There are times when it feels like Dusty is little more than a cowboy hat in search of a character, but O'Connor's marble-mouthed uncertainty reflects Dusty's resistance to change. It's as if the guy is so unwilling to imagine a different future than the one he first envisioned that he can't even get through a sentence if he doesn't have the whole thing mapped out in advance.”

“O'Connor can do more with a slight shake of his head than some actors could with an entire Shakespearean monologue, and ‘Rebuilding' is never more nuanced or humane than when you can feel Dusty retreating from Mila and the other kind souls in the FEMA park, afraid that every step he took forward would take him that much further away from going back.”

Bleecker Street will release “Rebuilding” in theaters on November 14.

Power to the People is a portrait of John and Yoko as a young married couple splashing down in New York City, making friends with the local radicals and con men and boho scenesters. In October 1971, John Lennon is turning 31, coming off his first post-Beatles success with Plastic Ono Band, about to hit Number One with his brand new Imagine. But he and Yoko Ono feel bored in their lavish English country mansion Tittenhurst Park, even after building a studio and cutting most of Imagine there. As he shrugs, “We didn't like being Lord and Lady of the Manor.”


	So John and Yoko pop over to New York and get a tiny apartment in the West Village. They thrive on the city's electric energy, with neighbors like Bob Dylan and Allen Ginsberg. They start wearing berets, to show that they're now militant revolutionaries. They get their counterculture tickets punched by every two-bit hippie hustler in town. They're leaving home; they're having fun. They never go back. “Going back to England is like going to Denmark,” John complains. “And I don't want to live in Denmark!”

	











Power to the People gathers the music they made in their New York radical days, in a giant box set with their son Sean Ono Lennon as producer and creative director — nine CDs, 3 Blu-Rays, with a 204-page book. It follows two superb deluxe boxes devoted to Imagine and Mind Games, but this package has a trickier task: salvaging the dodgy 1972 album Sometime in New York City. In a clever strategic move, it downplays the album to focus on live material, outtakes, acoustic home demos, for a documentary of the busy hippie energy swirling around the couple during this brief interlude in their lives. Like the excellent 2024 doc One to One, it captures John and Yoko falling in love with their new city.

	It was an exciting time for these two. They played every progressive benefit they could. Most crucially, they played the “One to One” charity concerts in August 1972, at Madison Square Garden, to benefit special needs children. Those turned out to be the only two full-length live shows that John ever played after the Beatles, as well as the last two he ever did with Yoko — both included in this box.

	They also celebrated their new move by dashing into the studio to bang out a quickie album of protest tunes, commenting on the latest news headlines, plus one actual good song, “New York City.” The album was Some Time in New York City on the cover, but Sometime in New York City on the label, their liner notes, and their letters, a hint of how slapdash the whole project was. They hooked up with a greasy bar band called Elephant's Memory, though smartly recruiting their pal Jim Keltner on drums, crediting the whole thing to “John & Yoko/Plastic Ono Band with Elephant's Memory Plus Invisible Strings.” The cover declared “Ono News That's Fit to Print.” It also had producer Phil Spector's face and the caption “To Know Him Is To Love Him.” 


	Alas, as 1970s ex-Beatle albums go, Sometime ranks with George's Dark Horse, Wings' Wild Life, and Ringo's Bad Boy at the bottom of the barrel. John and Yoko sing about their new celebrity-radical buddies, marijuana laws, prison conditions (“Attica State, Attica State, we're all mates with Attica State”), the Troubles in Northern Ireland (“you Anglo pigs!”), with sentimental slogans and half-assed music. The most fun songs are the awesomely terrible ones, like the Monty Python-worthy “Luck of the Irish,” where Yoko concludes, “The world would be one big Blarney Stone!” 


	“New York City” is the one that always jumped out from Sometime, shining like the top of the Chrysler Building, with a trashy Chuck Berry guitar riff and a chorus hook en español, as John yells, “Que pasa, New York!” He toasts the Big Apple from the Apollo Theater to Max's Kansas City to the Statue of Liberty, with a high-speed excitement not far from those local kids in the New York Dolls. But it's also the album's most politically credible moment, celebrating the multi-cultural New York immigrant dream. John keeps cheering “What a bad-ass city,” flipping off the Feds trying to deport him. Was this the NYC song Mick Jagger was aiming to top with the Stones' “Shattered”? If so, well played, since these are two of the kickiest songs either John or Mick came up with in the Seventies.

	The box has nearly all their songs from this period, with a glaring exception — the single “Woman is the N***** of the World,” which doesn't fit into any of the nine discs. It was Ono's unfortunate title for a confrontational feminist message, though she could have gotten a better title out of the key line, “Woman is the slave to the slaves.” It's the only moment on Sometime where Lennon faces up to his complicity as part of the oppression, since everyday misogyny was part of his life in ways that “Attica State” and “John Sinclair” weren't. The song meant enough to them to lead off the album, with its lyrics front and center on the cover. But the song and its message get erased here. (The censorship might be easier to lament if the song had anything going on musically.)


Power to the People wisely focuses on the excellent “One to One” concerts — they're the heart of this box. You can hear that John is terrified, with a nervous gum-snapping edge in his voice that suits tough tales like “It's So Hard” and “Well Well Well.” You can also hear that the back-up sweathogs in Elephant's Memory sincerely believe they're qualified for this gig, with no qualms about showing off. (Hilariously diplomatic comment from Sean Ono Lennon in the liner notes: “Let's just say, if I was in a band with John Lennon, I wouldn't solo over his voice when he's singing.”)


	There's a great live “Hound Dog,” enhanced by Yoko's canine howls and John spluttering “Elvis, I love ya!” in the final verse. “This is what you call an encore,” he tells the crowd. “‘Cause we've done enough. You gotta be the encore too!” That leads into “Give Peace a Chance,” with Stevie Wonder singing along. John also wails a powerhouse version of “Mother.” “My father singing ‘Mother' is my personal highlight from the show,” Sean remarks. “Watching and hearing it may require some tissues and possibly a blanket and/or a bottle of whiskey.”


	In an early outtake of “New York City,” John rails against “that clean, clean, fuckin' recorded sound which I hate.” There's little of that cleanliness here. The new remixes include longer versions of “Sunday Bloody Sunday” and “John Sinclair.” There's a disc of raw studio jams on Fifties rock & roll oldies like “Honey Don't,” “Yakety Yak,” and “Ain't That a Shame.” They rough it up at political rallies and TV chat-shows. There's the “Live Jam” material that stretched the original Sometime into a pricey double—getting noisy at the Fillmore with Frank Zappa's Mothers, recruiting friends in 1969 (Eric Clapton, Keith Moon, good old George Harrison) for a 16-minute feedback jam on “Don't Worry Kyoko.” There's also a bizarro reggae version of “Give Peace a Chance” featuring none other than Jerry Lewis, from his Labor Day MDA Telethon. Jerry sings along, while introducing the couple as “two of the most unusual people in the whole of the world—and I don't just mean the world of entertainment!”

	











	The studio banter is full of humor that doesn't necessarily show up on the finished album, like when Yoko begins “Born in a Prison” with the words, “I'm going to be singing either in Liza Minnelli style or Yoko Ono style.” After “Sunday Bloody Sunday,” John quips, “Sorry Paul, it's all over now,” since even he realizes that he's failed to meet the not-terribly-lofty standard of Wings' “Give Ireland Back to the Irish.” (Macca's song about the infamous Bloody Sunday massacre might have been clumsy, but at least he wasn't singing, “It's those mothers' time to burn!” Let's just say the bar was pretty low for Bono.)


	The final disc is pure joy: John alone with his guitar, in previously unreleased 1971 hotel tapes. He drifts away into beautifully fragile solo reveries on Fifties rock & roll tunes from his idols like Buddy Holly, Little Richard, and Elvis Presley, with witty romps through “Hi-Heel Sneakers” and “Slippin' and Slidin'.” There's also previously unheard acoustic demos of originals like the poetically poignant ballad “When the Teacher,” cut in an Ann Arbor hotel room in December 1971. He also teams up with protest singer Phil Ochs, playing back-up guitar as Ochs sings familiar standards like “I Ain't Marching Anymore.”


	The book is fun, too, packed with memorabilia. The highlight: John's angry letter to the president of Capitol Records, complaining that the album cover has a sticker covering the (faked) photo of Richard Nixon and Chairman Mao dancing naked. He rages, “I'm really sick and tired of fighting E.M.I./Capitol—who over the years have fucked up some of my/our most radical, and effective covers—including the now rare and expensive — Beatle meat 'n' babies picture — not to mention ‘Two Virgins' (another classic!)”

	John and Yoko shied away from making any personal statements in their protest period — there's nothing like “Oh My Love” or “Oh Yoko!” here. But there's good reason for that — their marriage was already headed for the rocks. On Election Night 1972, they went to Jerry Rubin's place to watch the results as Nixon won 49 states; Lennon got drunk and went into the next room to have sex with another woman while Ono just sat there. (She turned the experience into her song “Death of Samantha.”) Their romantic and radical ideals collapsed together. Less than a year after releasing Sometime in New York City, the couple separated. John jetted off to L.A. for his Lost Weekend — guzzling his weight in Brandy Alexanders, getting thrown out of bars with Harry Nilsson, jamming with Paul and Elton, making the scene with his groovy new muse May Pang.

	











Power to the People might give you some fresh new perspective on the couple's protest songs, but it wisely doesn't try to make the case for Sometime in New York City as the under-appreciated classic it isn't. Instead, it frames these songs in the context of a short-lived but creative interlude in the tangled lives of two complex artists. Before the Lost Weekend, John and Yoko had their New York Year — turning their personal confusions into beautifully vivid moments of rage and pain.

It has now been 115 years since author E.M. Forster delivered one of fiction's most withering depictions of the haves' view of the have-nots. Dismissing the misfortunes of a lowly clerk, Howards End‘s rich, callous Paul Wilcox sternly warns his far more compassionate wife Margaret to resist the urge to have “a sentimental attitude over the poor…The poor are poor, and one's sorry for them, but there it is.” More than a century later, economic inequality is even worse, and the wealthy's attitude toward the rest of us remains contemptuous. It's so enraging, it almost makes you want to laugh. Aziz Ansari's feature directorial debut, Good Fortune, taps into that mixture of anger and humor—although the emphasis is definitely on the latter. 

With nods to It's A Wonderful Life, Wings Of Desire and Trading Places, Good Fortune tells the story of three very different characters who enter each other's orbit: a gig worker, a successful tech bro, and an angel. But despite its good intentions and myriad ideas, the comedy disappoints—perhaps because its writer-director cannot fully recognize his own blind spots when chronicling the plight of those struggling to make ends meet.

Good Fortune stars Ansari as Arj, a documentary editor in Los Angeles who hasn't had steady work in far too long, reduced to living in his car and doing Taskrabbit-like jobs. At one of these parttime gigs, he meets Elena (Keke Palmer), who's employed at a soulless big-box store and is trying to rally her coworkers to unionize. The two hit it off, but how can a penniless guy like him take her out for a good time?

The answer seems to appear in the form of Jeff (Seth Rogen), a rich venture capitalist who has a luxurious pad overlooking the city. Blissfully residing in his bubble of privilege, Jeff hires Arj to organize his garage, but since this budding mogul needs a personal assistant, Arj convinces the guy to try him out on a temporary basis. Now finally able to afford a motel, Arj is hopeful that his prospects are changing—until a minor infraction angers Jeff enough that he impulsively fires him. 

All the while, Gabriel has been watching. Played by Keanu Reeves, he's an angel whose job it is to ensure that people don't get into fatal car accidents by texting behind the wheel. (One of Good Fortune‘s bleakest jokes is that God needs someone purely dedicated to this single task since so many stupid humans do it all the time.) Envious of other angels who have more “important” responsibilities, like attending to lost souls, Gabriel takes it upon himself to intervene once Arj begins wondering if there's any point in living. In classic Frank Capra fashion, Gabriel offers to show Arj all the bright possibilities ahead for him. But Ansari subverts It's A Wonderful Life‘s message that every life has value by unexpectedly placing Arj in an enviable scenario: He finds himself able to trade places with Jeff, quickly deducing that, seriously, being rich is just the best.

Other twists and turns await, Good Fortune flipping the fates of its haves and have-nots, allowing both to truly see how the other half lives. Pointedly, Ansari sets his movie in Los Angeles, a city where the wealthy and the working-class are often awkwardly thrust into the same spaces, one constantly serving the needs of the other. It's a film in which parking tickets, automated delivery robots, rising apartment rents, and dead-end jobs are depressingly ubiquitous—Good Fortune never lets you forget how hard it is to afford living in a metropolis. Not that Ansari has any illusions about how “ennobling” poverty is—nor does he argue that the wealthy aren't as happy as they appear. Eventually, Arj, Jeff, and Gabriel learn the cold, hard truth we already know: Money can't buy everything, but it sure as hell beats being poor.

The film's anti-fairytale tone leads to some stinging jokes, although not as many as one would hope. Part of the problem is that neither Arj nor Jeff is especially well-drawn, forcing Ansari and Rogen to fall back on their reliable onscreen personas. Ansari plays Arj with his familiar combination of sweetness, swagger, and comic exasperation, while Rogen depicts Jeff as an amiable goofball. 

Good Fortune‘s most intriguing character is actually Gabriel. This hapless angel comes from a long line of fish-out-of-water cinematic figures delighted and bewildered by human customs. (He really loves tacos!) But Reeves endearingly elevates the clichés, illuminating Gabriel's heavenly essence despite becoming marooned on Earth as punishment for interfering in Arj's affairs. Ever since Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, Reeves has radiated a winsome dim-bulb innocence, and at 61, he still conveys that ethereal joy. If Good Fortune laments the widening gap between rich and poor, it also cares about the quality of one's work and how we draw self-worth from our jobs. Once he's stripped of his angel assignment, Gabriel discovers that, even more than having dough, having a reason for being makes all the difference.

Unfortunately, the sharp point of view and creative risk-taking present in Ansari's acclaimed series Master Of None (co-created with Alan Yang) are nowhere to be seen in this pedestrian comedy full of convoluted plot points. Good Fortune starts and stops, moving from one tangent to another, failing to lock into a propulsive forward momentum. But the film's main weakness is something far more fundamental: It is hard to watch Good Fortune, made by and starring well-paid Hollywood stars, and not conclude that, on some level, they don't really understand what the gig economy looks and feels like. 

This suspicion comes through most strongly in Ansari's simplistic construction of Elena, who is meant to be a saintly symbol of progressive activism at a time when greedy corporations are clamping down on unions. Good Fortune diagnoses this country's crippling economic inequality, but when it stumbles toward a possible solution—at least for the likes of Arj and Elena—the conclusions are painfully, almost insultingly naïve. Ansari is no doubt sorry for the poor, but the limply uplifting message he leaves them with hardly feels sufficient. All things being equal, we'd be better off eating cake.

The left-leaning late night hosts reacted to the president brokering the Israel-Hamas ceasefire: "Donald Trump did something good."  


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert gave their reactions to the Gaza peace deal on Monday night. Both late night hosts conceded that President Donald Trump successfully helped broker a breakthrough ceasefire that resulted in Hamas releasing the remaining Israeli hostages, while still finding plenty of other things to criticize the president about.


	“What a day for Donald Trump,” Kimmel said on Jimmy Kimmel Live! “You know what? He finally did something positive today and I want to give him credit for it — because I know he's not the type to take credit for himself … While we're only in the first phase of what will undoubtedly be a long and tricky process, but the fact is the bombing has stopped, the hostages have been released, and Trump deserves some of the praise for that. So I know it sounds crazy to say, but good work on that one, President Trump. Now maybe you can not invade Portland. Just an idea.

	“Trump's been lobbying hard to try to win the Nobel Prize for peace,” he added. “Now Trump's focused on winning the prize next year, which is fine. Let him keep trying to make peace. I'm fine with coming up with prizes and trophies to motivate. Give them the ‘Nobel Re-Open the Government and Leave Healthcare Alone' prize.”


	Colbert, who was off last week, opened with a breathless rundown of all the news he missed: “The government shutdown is headed into its third week; Trump fired more than 4,000 federal workers; the DOJ charged New York Attorney General Leticia James with fraud after Trump's pressure campaign; Trump sent troops to Chicago and Portland and is threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act; Trump announced a whopping 100 percent new tariff on China, which caused the stock market to have its worst day in six months — and Taylor Swift dropped her new album, The Life of the Showgirl, to merely mixed reviews,” Colbert said on CBS' The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. “Well, those reviewers are just jealous of her talent and of Travis Kelce's majestic redwood.”

	











	Then Colbert got to the peace deal, and he had quite a lot to say about it. 


	“There is some good news out there today: Thanks to Trump's newly brokered ceasefire in Gaza, all living Israeli hostages and almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners have been released,” Colbert said to audience cheers. “It's important. Credit where credit is due — Donald Trump did something good.”


	Colbert paused for a quick beat. The audience remained silent.


	“Are we still canceled?” Colbert asked, looking offstage. “You sure? I tried.


	“It's kind of surprising to see him do something good,” Colbert marveled. “It reminds me of in Empire Strikes Back when Darth Vader revealed this shocking secret.” 


	There was then a quick cut to the famous climax of the Star Wars film, only instead of Vader intoning, “I am your father,” he said, “I am an organ donor.”


	“Despite the deal on Friday, in a truly foreseeable turn of events, Trump did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize,” Colbert continued. “How dare you, Nobel Committee? The man is a paragon of peace. He walks in the footsteps of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King … After losing his campaign for the thing you don't campaign for, Trump said he didn't do the peace deal for the Nobel. And the White House communications director, Steven Chung, agreed, saying, ‘President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives. He has the heart of a humanitarian.' We remove that heart from one of the detainees in our ICE facilities. He keeps it in the Oval Office next to the Diet Coke button in a little bowl.”

	











	Colbert then said, “On his flight over to Israel, Trump was asked by Fox News whether the ceasefire he brokered might help him in the afterlife,” before playing a clip of Trump responding, “‘I don't think there's anything [that's] going to get me into heaven.' I agree with Donald Trump. While Trump tries to bring peace to the Middle East, he's trying just as hard to bring war to the Midwest. And personally I'm horrified to see how he's stomping on my old stomping grounds of Chicago, Illinois, where I lived for over a decade. ICE has been terrorizing communities in the Windy City, going door to door in front of elementary schools, arresting immigrants, legal or otherwise, arresting U.S. citizens without any due process and teargassing journalists who are merely reporting on what they're doing.”

					By Stewart Clarke 




EXCLUSIVE: Pennywise, the world's creepiest clown, is returning to the screen in HBO Max's IT: Welcome to Derry. Andy and Barbara Muschietti, the Argentina-born producer-director pair behind the hit movies and now the series, tell us how they are making horror jump out of the small screen.


	Season 1 of IT: Welcome to Derry is yet to launch, but the Muschiettis are already thinking about what comes next. With two It movies that have grossed north of a billion dollars under their belt, they are extending the universe into a series and already have plans for subsequent seasons.

	Born in Buenos Aires, the brother and sister run two production labels, Double Dream and Nocturna, and their work spans blockbuster to indie fare. Guillermo del Toro helped them get their hit feature Mama up and running, and the pair says it is now their turn to discover new blood. Andy, meanwhile, is still on board Batman project The Brave and the Bold. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“We are moviegoers,” Barbara says. “We see movies of every size and we grew up with movies of every size, and we want to continue telling stories that can be done on different sized budgets.”


	Their story is not just movies. Next up is IT: Welcome to Derry, a series and prequel to their films. The origin story of the series dates back to when It: Chapter 2 was being made. Bill Skarsgård — who plays the killer clown Pennywise and also Bob Gray, his human alias — was talking to Andy Muschietti, who was directing. “Bill and I were fantasizing about the character of Bob Gray and an origin story,” Andy says. “There was an enthusiasm to go back and explore the complexities of this character.”


	What started out as an idea for a movie ended up as a nine-part series that will stream on HBO Max from October 26. As with the films, the inspiration is Stephen King's 1986 novel IT, about a group of kids terrorized by IT, an evil entity that transcends generations and manifests itself in the form of Pennywise. The creepy clown is a horror staple, but King's version is surely the most iconic. Bringing terror to the fictional town of Derry (which is situated in the real-life U.S. state of Maine), there is, as with all great horror characters and monsters, a curiosity about Pennywise's backstory.

	











	“We never did TV before, but there's a bunch of TV shows that mean a lot to me and I appreciate the format, having a bigger canvas to tell a story, and the impact that has on audiences,” says Andy. “Our love for the book, and the vacuum created by all these mysteries and question marks in it, mean you end up, as a reader, not understanding everything, including the mystery of IT. What is IT? What does IT want?”


IT has been adapted for the small screen before, with Tim Curry as Pennywise in the 1990 miniseries for U.S. network ABC. The new series takes a different tack, drawing inspiration from a series of five sections of King's novel dubbed ‘The Interludes', which delve into the history of Derry and a series of catastrophes that occur every few decades when IT awakens.


	King endorsed the series when it was announced: “I'm glad Andy Muschietti is going to be overseeing the frightening festivities, along with a brain trust including his talented sister, Barbara. Red balloons all around!”


	The Muschiettis developed the series with Jason Fuchs who, along with Brad Caleb Kane, serves as showrunner. Andy directs several episodes. He and his sister exec-produce through Double Dream. Other EPs include Skarsgård Fuchs, Kane, David Coatsworth, Shelley Meals, Roy Lee and Dan Lin, while HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television produce.


	Deadline is a spoiler-free zone, but before the opening credits of the first episode of IT: Welcome to Derry, there is a scene destined to leave a lasting impression. It is both graphic and ingenious and sums up the tone and ambition of the series.


	“We wanted to raise the bar higher in terms of shock value,” Andy says of the scene. “It's about a self-imposed mandate of opening with an event that is shocking enough that you put the audience in a position where nothing is taken for granted, where nothing is safe in this world. You're immediately putting people on the edge of the seat. We needed a strong opening. One of the things I love about this scene is the build-up. Of course, it has a big, graphic and shocking conclusion, but the build-up is something that was important.”


Nuclear Families


	On screen, the titular town in IT: Welcome to Derry is a painstakingly constructed slice of American life in the early 1960s. It is also shown in the series' remarkable credits. These start with different illustrations of down-home life that gradually give way to drawings of fires, mayhem and syringes plunged into eyeballs as a saccharin-sweet song from sisterly duo Patience and Prudence plays.


	In the series, there's a nearby military base and secrets seep out of that facility, and seemingly every corner of the town. Fear of nuclear war and its effects are close to the surface.


	“It was very exciting to explore what the '60s were in America, and what fear was and what kids were afraid of,” Andy says. “It was the Cold War and kids in school were performing drills in case of a nuclear explosion. You can't imagine the state of paranoia. People were asking, ‘Is there going to be a nuclear explosion tomorrow? What are we going to do? Will there be people with birth defects?' It was very exciting to think of those ripples.”


	With Season 1 yet to drop on streaming, there is no official order or news of subsequent runs. But the Muschiettis hope to welcome people to Derry over several seasons. “There is an intentional bigger arc that will open,” Andy says. “My intention with this was to create a story that is a little bit like an iceberg under the water all through Seasons 1, 2 and 3. There will be an expansion in the mythology and more answers to the big questions.” The plan is to go further back in time, he reveals. “The second season will be in 1935. At the end of Season 1, we are hinting at the reason why we are going to tell the story in two more seasons and backwards.”

	











Horror, Heart & Humor


	Andy says he first saw 1967 horror-comedy movie The Fearless Vampire Killers at age six, and by 11 he was delving into the likes of Sam Raimi's horror classic Evil Dead. His sister is a couple of years older. Both were seasoned horror watchers from a tender age. Talking to the pair reveals a depth of knowledge and love for genre fare. Evil Dead, for example, taught Andy how to incorporate different tones and humor into stories, something evident in his movies and the new show.


	“I understood the power of humor in horror, not necessarily for comedic purposes, but to get people on board, to get them thrilled in a different way,” he recalls. “There's a very special feel when you see something that has a level of comedic sarcasm to it, and that becomes imprinted on you. It's inevitable for us to infuse some humor in our work. The other side of that equation with IT is the book. It has horror, but it had heightened emotions, and also humor.”


	There is a focus on the horrors created by humankind in the series, as well as those emanating from the supernatural. “The fog in Derry is not just a literal construction, it talks about how we often turn our backs to what's going on and try to forget, to put things under the rug,” Andy says. At this point, Barbara chimes in: “What is definitely part of human behavior, and it's absolutely horrific, is the ability we have to not see horrors as they're happening.”


Banking on Horror: Double Dream & Nocturna


	The Muschiettis have two labels. Double Dream, which has a deal with Warner Bros., and Nocturna. The latter was created last year with Skydance and is thusly connected to the studio system, more so after Skydance's high-profile merger with Paramount. Nocturna's raison d'être, however, is a focus on indie-flavored genre movies that exist outside of mega-budget studio franchises.


	“Nocturna gives us some flexibility, and it is more for things that are maybe edgier,” Barbara explains, adding that in the time it takes to get a blockbuster movie up and running they can also work on a number of smaller budget projects. “For example, it took three or four years to get The Flash out and in the meantime there are so many more stories that we need to tell, and that we want to help other people tell.”


	The Muschiettis were given a leg up by Del Toro, who liked their 2008 horror short Mama and helped get the 2013 feature-length version of the movie away. The film, starring Jessica Chastain, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, and Megan Charpentier and exec produced by del Toro, grossed a whopping $146 million off $15 million in production costs.


	The Muschiettis now find themselves in a position to find and boost talent. “Barbara did a huge deal for Mama, creating a co-production with Spain, Canada and the U.S. We were partnered with Guillermo, who was basically the godfather of the project, and he introduced us to Universal, and with all those pieces together, the movie was done,” Andy says. “We want to continue that tradition. With very big movies, it is harder to give an opportunity to new filmmakers, but with smaller budgets, you can do that, and we didn't want to let the opportunity of bringing new filmmakers to the scene go.”


Kirill Sokolov Movie


	One film about to come out of Nocturna is They Will Kill You. Russian writer-director Kirill Sokolov (Why Don't You Just Die!) is helming from a script he co-wrote with Alex Litvak. New Line is co-financing and releasing the pic, which stars Patricia Arquette, Zazie Beetz, Heather Graham, Myha'la and Tom Felton. The film follows a woman who answers a help-wanted ad for a housekeeper in a New York high-rise. There is, it transpires, a history of disappearances in the building, which houses a mysterious community.

	











	In keeping with its indie sensibilities, Barbara says Nocturna moved fast, reading the They Will Kill You screenplay in December 2023 and filming by the following September: “We shot it in South Africa last year and we are very much near the finish line. It's a lot of fun. It's horror-comedy-action, and a great mixture and balance of those three. It's something people will walk out of with a smile on their face, and it's what the world needs right now.”


Argentina: Horror-Tango


	The Muschietti siblings grew up in Buenos Aires and want to return to Argentina in a professional capacity, but not at present. The government of Javier Milei, Argentina's far-right leader, has enacted a controversial plan to defund the National Institute of Cinema and Audiovisual Arts (INCAA), which is the country's national film body.


	Barbara says: “Right now, Argentina is going through its own very difficult times with cinema because the current government has basically decimated the National Cinema Institute, which was basically the main provider of funds.”


	Andy has a movie he wants to make there, but it will have to wait. “We're very connected culturally to Argentina because we were born and raised there,” he says. “There are so many stories to tell and one in particular that I really wanted to do. But, you know, it's like, when will that happen? That's probably not now.”


	The movie in prospect has a distinctive Argentinian flavor. “It's a story of my own and set in the 1930s. It combines the culture of tango with some supernatural presences, and there is another part that's connected to the social and political background. It's an action-horror movie and it would be black and white.”

In 2012, before Paul Thomas Anderson released his “The Master” on 70mm film, the format had not been commercially presented for nearly 50 years. His enthusiasm to release the movie on that film format led others, like Quentin Tarantino, to retrofit old theaters to be equipped to project the Ultra Panavision 70 format for “The Hateful Eight,” viewing the effort as “film's saving grace.” Just like vinyl records, all the cool kids now want their movies to be on film and shown in 70mm.

So could either Anderson or Tarantino have predicted over a decade ago that there might be a half dozen ways that you can now see PTA's “One Battle After Another,” which is being shown in yet another long-lost film format, VistaVision?

Just as in 2012, Anderson's push to both shoot in and project the film in VistaVision did not happen overnight. It's a format that has not been commercially available for decades, and like Tarantino had to do for “The Hateful Eight,” he's spent a chunk of the “Battle” press tour explaining what VistaVision is and why you should care. 

 










A similar thing happened with another Warner Bros. release this year, “Sinners,” which found filmmaker Ryan Coogler evangelizing the many different film formats his movie was available in (perhaps no person alive has ever looked cooler talking about film stock than Coogler does in his video).

Right now, “One Battle After Another” is only available in VistaVision on four screens worldwide, including in Los Angeles, New York, Boston, and London. That doesn't necessarily scream “a revolution!” in how other films will be projected, but the push to allow Anderson to release “One Battle After Another” in this format is part of a years-long effort of reconditioning projectors and establishing the infrastructure necessary to get it to work.

It stands to reason that, if newly re-upped film chiefs Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy were willing to shell out big bucks (the film has a production budget of $130 million) to get people to watch Anderson's movie in this very unique format, Anderson might not be the last filmmaker who gets the privilege of doing it. 

The trouble is, VistaVision went out of fashion for a reason and was never as widely adopted in its heyday as some of its rival formats. It's always been niche, and there are some practical reasons why this particular format may not make the same comeback 70mm did.

 










You may have read that several modern filmmakers are already shooting in VistaVision, even before PTA did. Brady Corbet's “The Brutalist” was shot using VistaVision cameras, so was Yorgos Lanthimos' “Bugonia,” and Alejandro G. Iñárritu's still-untitled Tom Cruise film, which is also being released by Warner Bros., used VistaVision as well. The bigger negatives have some practical reasons for doing it, including for the use of optical effects like fades, dissolves, or credit sequences, and it was especially in vogue in the '80s and '90s, even when actually screening a movie in VistaVision had disappeared. Shooting in VistaVision is almost definitely making a comeback and will be seen again.

But that's the crucial difference: those films — and we'll see on the Iñárritu movie — were only shot on VistaVision, not also projected in it, the way “One Battle After Another” is at those four select theaters. That's in part because only a handful of VistaVision projectors were ever installed around the world to begin with, and even fewer still exist. 

The Warner Bros. Projection Engineering team partnered with a litany of organizations over the course of a year to modify existing VistaVision projectors. Warner Bros. already owned one projector, the Academy loaned WB another one, and so did England's Bell-Theater Services. So, the handful of projectors that Warner Bros. does have available for VistaVision, including one on the WB lot in Burbank at the Steven J. Ross Theater, had to be cobbled together from a variety of found sources.

 










That's problem number one. When it came to 70mm, movies even in the early 2010s were still being shown on celluloid as part of repertory screenings or classic film festivals, so while there were still projectors that existed and people who knew how to use them, there wasn't the commercial use case or reach for 70mm. Today it's an attractive selling point to get people out to the theater and away from streaming. 

But one projectionist familiar with the tech explained to IndieWire that the people who are today projecting “One Battle After Another” in VistaVision all had to learn how to do so, and they were even trained by other recent newbies. Save for a few repertory screenings, VistaVision, for the most part., has not been shown anywhere since the '60s.

Problem number two is that VistaVision projectors are unique, designed for a specific purpose. 70mm projectors are dual and can also screen 35mm film. But if a theater wanted to screen a VistaVision film, the projectionist explained he would have to move the existing projector — weighing hundreds of pounds and that have been precision tuned and placed in a specific spot — out of the way to make room for the installation of a VistaVision projector that can only screen one very specific thing. 

That means that, unless a projector booth was somehow big enough with multiple ports to accommodate a regular film projector and the VistaVision one (he says it'd be like making space in your kitchen for two refrigerators), a screen could be dark for several days as projectionists work to install the new one.

 










What's more, VistaVision originally used to operate in such a way that, because the film reels are so large, you needed two projectors, not one, to screen a film normally. Forget that a film print that is twice as long as standard 35mm is almost certainly double the price for raw film stock, the WB team also had to figure out how to take a 2 hour and 40 minute-long film and screen it horizontally through one projector on a massive “platter” system. That just takes up a lot of space, and “One Battle After Another” is the first movie to ever be shown this way.

Even how the soundtrack is presented via VistaVision was unique to “One Battle After Another.” In the '50s, before digital audio, the audio strips were on the inside of the film strip's perforations, meaning the image itself was slightly narrower. “One Battle After Another” looks so genuinely unique on VistaVision because the soundtrack is on the outside of the perforations, allowing for the image to reach its full aspect ratio. That was yet another thing WB had to invent for this very film.

Those practical challenges are just part of the reason seeing VistaVision come back into the mainstream in a big way may be unlikely. If you're a film executive or producer and the choice is between VistaVision and 70mm with the same size negative, it may be a tough sell to opt for the former. 

 










But Sean McKinnon, the director of specialty presentation and AV integration with Boston Light & Sound, said he's “making the bet” that Anderson's movie won't be the last to be seen in the format. Boston Light & Sound, which helped refurbish the VistaVision projector for “One Battle After Another's” screenings at the Coolidge Corner Theater in Boston, is currently in the prototyping phase on building its own VistaVision projectors, using its own design that would not have the same barriers to entry that refurbishing original machines did.

McKinnon said he's less concerned than the other projectionist at making VistaVision work with the existing set-up in most theaters. The light sources, motors, and automation systems used for VistaVision are still compatible with the 70mm projectors. And when it came to “The Hateful Eight” in 2015, Tarantino arranged for 100 different multiplexes across the country to add an additional port window and put in a 70mm machine that was only equipped for that format.

So if VistaVision were to do the same, McKinnon believes all it would really take is someone with the wherewithal to make it happen. While he doesn't see it becoming an everyday format, it can continue to be used for special engagements, and it's not out of the question that repertory theaters and festivals will make use of VistaVision more often for classic films down the road. He'd be thrilled if they can get the now-four systems worldwide up to 10-20, whether that's permanent installations or for road shows.

 










Those numbers may not move the needle significantly, but part of the reason it's worth Warner Bros.' while to keep someone like Anderson happy is because it makes the studio more attractive as a destination to those marquee directors. A WB insider told IndieWire he's spoken with a number of filmmakers who have all looked at the unique filming formats as something that “gives them options” and lets them tell a story in different ways.

Case in point, Warner Bros. has already won the rights to Emerald Fennell's “Wuthering Heights” despite a higher bid from Netflix because of the studio's commitment to a sizable theatrical rollout. Netflix gave in to Greta Gerwig and agreed to event screenings of her upcoming “Narnia” movies for IMAX (there's rumors that Gerwig too intends to use VistaVision to shoot some scenes for that film). It stands to reason that someone like Coogler or Anderson, upon becoming a free agent again, among other reasons, could look to Warner Bros. if it means they can play around with a format like VistaVision that another studio can't offer. 

It's just unclear when such an opportunity would arise again, if ever in the near-future. At present, Warner Bros. does not appear to have specific plans for a future film on which VistaVision can again be utilized, and McKinnon said that, though there's been a lot of conversation around VistaVision, even in tandem with 70mm, that there's currently nothing concrete.

 










But McKinnon noted that when “The Master” and “Interstellar” were tinkering with 70mm, the format still looked like it was a long ways away from making a comeback in any meaningful way. Look how that turned out. For the future VistaVision, we may just be in that same “trial run” phase.

Charli XCX discussed her upcoming movie project, The Moment, in a new Vanity Fair cover story, calling the film a “2024 period piece” and “the realest depiction of the music industry that I've ever seen.”


	Details about the mysterious project have trickled out over the past year or so, with Charli working on the project in the midst of last year's Brat explosion. Earlier this month, a synopsis and cast finally arrived, with Charli set to star alongside Alexander Skarsgård, Rachel Sennott, Kylie Jenner, Rosanna Arquette, and more.


The Moment has been described as “based on an original idea” by Charli, and the synopsis reads: “A rising pop star navigates the complexities of fame and industry pressure while preparing for her arena tour debut.” While there are obvious parallels with Charli doing her first arena tours in support of Brat, she stressed that the film is fictional, and “not a tour documentary or a concert film in any way.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But Charli did say that the idea for the project came about after she was pressured to make a documentary while on the road in support of Brat. “I feel like my problem with a lot of musician documentaries is it often shows the musician coming up against some kind of opposition and eventually overcoming it to be the hero. And that's just not been my experience, you know? Maybe it has been a lot of other people's, and that's awesome,” she explained.

	











	Instead, the film's director and co-writer, Aidan Zamiri, said the film offers a kind of alternate history of the Brat era, showing what would've happened if Charli had made “entirely different choices” around the album.

	











	Skarsgård, for instance, is set to play a documentary filmmaker in The Moment. The actor described his character as the person the record label “convinces Charli is the hottest director out there… the right person to capture Charli XCX and get the most out of this phenomenon that Brat was.”


	Because The Moment is such a hyper-meta house of mirrors, Charli suggested that making it offered her the rare opportunity to actually reflect on this pivotal moment in her career. “I always find it hard to sit down and look at things with distance, because I am always moving on to the next thing,” she said. “I think that I process myself through my work. I'm writing about myself and my thoughts all the time, and my thoughts about what people think about me.”

The Moment doesn't have a release date yet, but it is set to arrive in 2026. The stacked cast is also set to feature Jamie Demetriou, Kate Berlant, Shygirl, Isaac Powell, and Rish Shah. Charli's frequent collaborator A.G. Cook will appear in the film, too, and he's also handling the music.


	(Also, for those who are wondering: Charli declined to comment on Taylor Swift's “Actually Romantic” in the cover story.)

The International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) remains the most influential global platform for documentaries centered in Europe. 

This year's 38th edition (November 13-23) boasts 250 titles in short and feature form from 76 countries. It's also the first year for Isabel Arrate Fernandez as artistic director, taking over for Orwa Nyrabia, who stepped down officially in July after announcing his departure last year. Arrate Fernandez previously headed up multiple IDFA filmmaker support programs.

On Tuesday, IDFA finalized its International Competition section, which includes first-time and established filmmakers reflecting on contemporary issues, with most arriving to Amsterdam as world premieres.

The premiere-only Luminous section includes 27 films ranging from shorts to features, the personal to the experimental.

Meanwhile, the premiere-only section Frontlight showcases 15 films that examine urgent issues of our time; often, these are more traditional talking-head style documentaries that tackle political truths. Eleven of the selected titles are world or international premieres.

Highlights include “Gaza's Twins, Come Back to Me” by Mohammed Sawwaf, who follows a mother trying to reach her two newborn babies in urgent care, and who were evacuated amid bombings and detained via travel restrictions and checkpoints. “Steal This Story, Please!,” from Carl Deal and Tia Lessin, profiles independent journalist and Democracy Now!” host Amy Goodman.

“As filmmakers and artists from all over the world share their work, they remind us that there is a space for reflection and connection. They bring other perspectives. They open conversations about cinema — about what touches us, what feels urgent, what truly matters right now. Through them, we get to be part of the courage of filmmakers and artists who refuse to give up — who keep pursuing their creative vision, and their commitment to stories that they feel matter,” IDFA's Artistic Director Isabel Arrate Fernandez said of the IDFA 2025 program during our press conference.

The festival also announced its IDFA DocLab Competition for Digital Storytelling, IDFA DocLab Spotlight, and cross-section awards: Best First Feature, Best Dutch Film, and Beeld & Geluid IDFA ReFrame Award, all of which encompass titles across the festival's sections.

 










IDFA 2025 will open with a selection of boundary-pushing short films: “As I Lay Dying” by Mohammadreza Farzad and Pegah Ahangarani, “Intersecting Memory” by Shayma' Awawdeh, and “Happiness” by Firat Yücel. 

“We believe the selection of films set the tone for a festival that explores major issues of the present, that makes room for new voices, fresh forms, and unexpected perspectives,” Arrate Fernandez said.

	The world's biggest media franchise has been evolving. Since transitioning to 3D graphics with Pokémon X and Y (2013), the mainline series had stumbled through a period of stagnation — their eight gyms, each tackled in a specific order ending up in a showdown with the elite four, has become stale to fans. Pokémon Legends: Z-A (out Oct. 16), a sequel to X and Y, is the third of a few attempts to shake things up, following Pokémon Scarlet and Violet (2022) and Pokémon Legends: Arceus (2022). The Nintendo Switch era has been turbulent for the franchise, to put it mildly. 


	Fan frustration finds a new target with each new release, whether it was the bland and forgettable nature of Sword and Shield (2019), the poor technical performance of Legends: Arceus or the unforgivable buggy mess that Scarlet and Violet were upon release. For the developers at Game Freak, their greatest achievement would be not providing fans with a comically large stick to beat the latest entry with. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Boasting a brand new battle system and a compelling alternative to the gym challenge, Legends: Z-A succeeds at making a Pokémon game with its own flavor, but frustratingly stumbles over some familiar hurdles. The dream of a modern Pokémon experience we can call great without heavy qualification remains elusive.


	Much like its predecessor in the Legends sub-series, Z-A looks to redefine the Pokémon battle. Arceus took the route of allowing the player to manipulate the order of the turn-based combat, something that had operated on a strict “their turn, my turn” basis in the mainline games. This allowed for more dynamic clashes, aided by compelling, unique animations.

	











Z-A takes the dynamism of its battles to the extreme, discarding the turn-based nature of it entirely and opting for fast and chaotic action, a shift that longtime fans will take a bit of time to adapt to. There are no turns, it's about getting as many attacks off as possible and draining the opponent's health points (HP) before they can land a fatal blow.

	The first few battles are a disorienting experience. Before the player can figure out how to even select their attacks, the opponent has removed a chunk of their HP through a move that could burst flames, water or psychic energy across the screen. It's impossible to know where to look. Pokémon muscle memory will have experienced gamers take some time to pick a move and watch their partner execute it. 


	In Z-A, by the time that process is complete, the Pokémon's HP could be halved and attack power weakened. Keeping track of what both Pokémon are doing, each of their health bars, the animations for each attack and the battle log (which shows whether or not attacks have landed) takes a long time to get used to.


	It may take a few hours of playtime but when this action-based battle system clicks, it feels amazing to play out. Not only does the player start to understand where to look and when, but they'll start to see the depth of strategy in the game. Z-A splits moves into short range and long range attacks. To execute the move Tackle, the Pokémon will have to go right up to its opponent to deliver the blow, leaving it at risk of being countered immediately. On the other hand, Hyper Beam can deliver its might from far enough that the opponent will have to reposition themselves before attacking. Balancing things are cooldown times, meaning Tackle can be used every four seconds, but Hyper Beam will take 12 seconds before it can be used again. 


	The player is forced to make risk-reward judgments on the fly, which is especially stressful in battles with Rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon as well as Alpha Pokémon. The latter is a concept taken from Legends: Arceus describing huge Pokémon that have gone wild and aim their attacks at the trainer instead of their Pokémon. The same goes for Rogue Megas, except they take on an enhanced form, specialized to each Pokémon species, as introduced as the main gimmick in Pokémon X and Y.

	Having these giant beasts run straight past the Pokémon they should be fighting and directly at the player character (whose outfit they spent a lot of in-game money on) can be used to their advantage. Because of how much enemy Pokémon move around in Z-A, it's very common for long range attacks to miss, almost like setting up a cannon to fire at a moving target. But by drawing the enemy Pokémon to the trainer, it gives the partner Pokémon a steady target to unleash its Flamethrower or Ice Beam at. 

	











	Mastery over battles will see trainers speed up the ranks of the Z-A Royale, a tournament unique to Lumiose City (where the entire game is played). The Z-A Royale stands in for the gym challenge and offers a fun, refreshing alternative. Every night the city is bathed in neon red as a purge-like event begins. Trainers will spot the main character in the street and begin battles on the fly, desperate to achieve A Rank and shape Lumiose in whichever sick and twisted way they want.


	Players skilled at raising strong Pokémon (or farming Rare Candies) should hardly have trouble clearing every battle they come across in Lumiose, which is why the Z-A Royale includes Bonus Cards. Tasks like “Sneak up on an opponent using only Flying-type moves,” or “Only defeat opponents with a higher rank than you,” offer bonus points that can help the protagonist get to the next rank more quickly. It remains engaging and exciting almost every time dusk falls over the city, whether the player is participating in the Royale or just trying to get on with whichever side quest they're preoccupied with. 


Z-A follows the tradition set by Arceus and continued by Scarlet and Violet by being another open world game, but its approach to the genre differs from the industry standard in one significant way — traversal. In many open world games, Pokémon included, the protagonist gains different modes of traversal as they go along. In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Link can paraglide and ride a horse. In Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker and Miles Morales can run, swing, or wind-glide through New York. In Legends: Z-A, the only way to get around (other than fast travel) is to walk. 


	Being set in a single city means that the world isn't so expansive that it would be a massive chore to walk everywhere, and Game Freak's intention is for the player to get distracted on their way by a side quest or an item or a Pokémon to catch. As underwhelming Lumiose ends up being when measured against the expectation of a bustling metropolis like that of Pokémon Black and White's Castelia City, there is never a shortage of things to do in between main missions.  


	However, with the load times being as short as they are on Switch 2, it always feels more convenient to fast-travel past them, which is a failure of open world design. Fast travel is an option in Marvel's Spider-Man, but nobody wants to miss out on how good it feels to swing through New York, even if their destination is on the other side of the map. The visceral feeling of it is what puts gamers in the shoes of the main character, clicking a button and appearing in a different region can break the immersion. 

	











	The greatest asset of Z-A's open world are the Wild Zones, areas where the untamed Pokémon of Lumiose are cornered off in an attempt to craft a city where both species can co-exist. Wild Zones are time sinks, places where hours can be drained away, their greatness owed to a mechanic ripped straight from Arceus where catching Pokémon feels like landing consecutive headshots in Call of Duty. The same trigger the player would use to shoot a gun is used to throw Poké Balls at unsuspecting monsters, and there's never been a mechanic in a Pokémon game that feels as immersive. It's not unique to Z-A, but the game is stronger for including it.


	Many of Z-A's weaker moments have to do with its visuals, something the series has never gotten right since going 3D. While Arceus was a cool interpretation of an ancient world, shooting for a grainy, chalky style, Z-A has no real visual flare to speak of. It's a game that looks to present information rather than do anything truly inspiring. Z-A never drifts into the realm of unbearable bugs as Scarlet and Violet did (on Switch 2 anyway), the worst offenders being the odd jittery animation in the distance and some noticeable pop-in. The lack of voice acting is another old problem that rears its head here, cut scenes depict characters awkwardly flapping their mouths to complete silence, robbing the plot of whatever drama it has. 


	Nintendo fans have gotten used to the company's other flagship franchises like Mario, Zelda, and Donkey Kong reaching euphoric heights during the Switch era and are looking to Game Freak to deliver the same. There's an expectation that a cash magnet as large as Pokémon could invest more in making bolder and more exciting games, but that popularity is its prison. Pokémon's power comes from constantly being in the zeitgeist with a new product out regularly, conditions anathema to innovation.

	Evolution is incremental and Legends: Z-A is as significant as those increments can be within the confines of Game Freak's condensed release schedule. It builds an exciting new battle system, maintains a dynamic gameplay loop and expands the lore around a beloved part of the universe. This will be enough to top the eshop charts, sell out stores and recover some of the reputation damage from Scarlet and Violet's botched launch. However, it remains to be seen whether or not Game Freak is capable of delivering a complete package. At this point, the Pokémon franchise remains one still desperately in need of saving.

	











Pokémon Legends: Z-A is out Oct. 16 for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2

In the latest episode of Only Murders In The Building‘s fifth season, the Arconia's secret basement comes alive with a glitzy casino party thrown by billionaire Camila White (Renée Zellweger), who seeks ownership of the residential complex. Bets are placed, drinks flow freely, and the all-female crowd gets dressed to the nines. It's an ideal occasion for Mabel Mora (Selena Gomez), Detective Williams (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), and Loretta (Meryl Streep) to glam up and continue investigating the deaths of a sweet doorman and a mob boss. Beyond furthering their inquiries, though, “Cuckoo Chicks” reinstates a simple fact about OMITB: Hulu's award-winning comedy has the most fun when it focuses on the quirky, historic Upper West Side building in its title.

From the start, OMITB has turned its cool location into a character of sorts, using Mabel, Charles (Steve Martin), and Oliver's (Martin Short) connection with their place of residence, among other things, to develop the story. Each of them has been at the Arconia for several years now, which has directly influenced their personalities, relationships, and careers. It's also where their own friendship bloomed. Seasons one and two dug into the Arconia's checkered past and ongoing criminal activities—as documented in the trio's podcast—but the subsequent installments expanded OMITB‘s scope to Broadway and Hollywood. The murders of Ben Glenroy (Paul Rudd) and Sazz Pataki (Jane Lynch) just happened to be on the premises and not a result of whatever shenanigans were going on there. Thankfully, season five circles back to the beginning by putting the building front and center.

After revealing sneaky tunnels within the walls in season two, OMITB introduces yet another layer to the Arconia's history by borrowing from some real-life New York City elements, according to set decorator Patrick Howe, who helped design the opulent, retro casino. In season five, the trio learns that the basement gaming parlor has a long-standing tradition of being the place where the city's powerful people gather in secret to conduct business deals over a glass of whiskey or the roulette table. Staten Island gangster Nicky Caccimelio (Bobby Cannavale)—who also ran the building's dry-cleaning service where his body was found—was the most recent operator. He paid Lester (Teddy Coluca) handsomely to allow strangers into the building after hours, but the Arconia's lovely gatekeeper was tired of being under Nicky's thumb and bribes and wanted out. 

OMITB still has two episodes to untangle the mess of both of their deaths, but the murder mystery has stopped being the series' anchor. The fun lies in spending time with the trio and their neighbors, like Michael Cyril Creighton's cheeky Howard, Jackie Hoffman's sardonic Uma, the Westies, and this year's addition, pop singer Althea (Beanie Feldstein). OMITB joins a long line of NYC-set projects to turn city “locations” into characters, including Seinfeld, Friends, Sex And The City, and Law & Order. More recently, High Fidelity was centered on its Brooklyn record store, Daredevil: Born Again continued to probe into its version of Hell's Kitchen, and Russian Doll made the 6 train into a pivotal part of its surreal narrative. 

In Hulu's comedy, logic needs to be suspended to buy into the proverbial (and literal) skeletons buried under the Arconia, which isn't a problem considering the company is this good. And now, the building and its residents face a new challenge in real-estate queen bee Camila and rival tech entrepreneurs who want to demolish it and build Manhattan's first casino. Through this storyline, OMITB tackles some classic new-versus-old New York City animosity. (Lester is replaced with a robot named L.E.S.T.R., which makes the other human employees working there nervous for their jobs.) Gone are the days when Nicky and his associates wielded control through threats. Wealthy business leaders, seemingly the new mafia, apparently don't feel the need to conceal their plans.

Only Murders In The Building has its mojo back as it navigates these themes in season five's strongest outings, like “Cuckoo Chicks” and the doormen-focused “After You.” It's not like Hulu's series was losing steam. But the show's charm was never its ever-expanding roster of celebrities, as entertaining as they may be, or even its send-up of true crime (as the show stopped being about that as it went on). OMITB‘s strength lies in specific humor mined from the truths Mabel, Charles, and Oliver discover about the place they live in and the people they share it with. And in that sense, season five's casino trick pays off nicely.

							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Several of this year's hottest award season contenders, including Yorgos Lanthimos' Bugonia, starring Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons; Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value with Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsgard, and Elle Fanning; and international feature contenders It Was Just an Accident and The Voice of Hind Rajab, have made the shortlist for the 2026 European Film Awards. 


	The European Film Academy on Tuesday unveiled its (quite long) shortlist of contenders for the 2026 awards, naming the features, documentaries, and animated films that qualify for next year's event, which will be held in Berlin on Jan. 17.

	In addition to Jafar Panahi's Cannes Palme d'Or winner It Was Just an Accident (and Cannes prize winners Sentimental Value, Sound of Falling, Sirat and Pillion), the short list includes several of this year's festival favorites, including Dag Johan Haugerud's Berlin winner Dreams, Paolo Sorrentino's Venice festival opener La Grazia, and Tereza Nvotová's Zurich festival winner Father. Many of Europe's international Oscar contenders are in the EFA running, including from Norway (Sentimental Value), France (It Was Just an Accident), Germany (Sound of Falling), Switzerland (Late Shift), and Belgium (Young Mothers). 


	The European Film Academy moved its awards ceremony to early January, ahead of the BAFTAs and Oscars, to play a bigger role in the awards conversation and to ensure that the EFAs are the first event to honor the best European cinema of the past year.

Heartbreak feels good in a place like AMC Theaters, and there's been a lot of it this week. In honor of the late Diane Keaton, AMC is bringing back two of her most beloved films to the silver screen. Per The Hollywood Reporter, Annie Hall and Something's Gotta Give are heading to 100 AMC theaters this Friday for a short repertory run.

It's not difficult to understand why they picked those two. Ignoring Finding Dory and The Godfather, the Nancy Meyers-directed rom-com Something's Gotta Give is Keaton's highest-grossing movie, edging out the likes of The First Wives Club, two Father Of The Bride movies, and 2018's Book Club. Meanwhile, Annie Hall netted Keaton her only Oscar win—though she was nominated for Reds, Marvin's Room, and Something's Gotta Give, too. However, the movie has fallen out of favor in recent years due to the allegations against Woody Allen, whom Keaton consistently defended throughout her life. Still, Keaton appeared in eight of his movies, including the early funny ones, which helped establish her as one of America's favorite leading ladies.

Earlier today, Meyers penned a tribute to Keaton on Instagram. “As a movie lover, I'm with you all – we have lost a giant,” she wrote. “A brilliant actress who time and again laid herself bare to tell our stories. As a woman, I lost a friend of almost 40 years – at times over those years, she felt like a sister because we shared so many truly memorable experiences. As a filmmaker, I've lost a connection with an actress that one can only dream of. We all search for that someone who really gets us, right? Well, with Diane, I believe we mutually had that.”

“She was fearless, she was like nobody ever, she was born to be a movie star, her laugh could make your day and for me, knowing her and working with her – changed my life. Thank you Di. I'll miss you forever.”

Lance Bass is celebrating his twins' birthday, and did so with a special message and adorable photos.

“FOUR?! I blinked and suddenly my babies are big kids with opinions and snack demands,” Lance wrote in the caption of an Instagram post he shared on October 13. “Happy 4th birthday to our double trouble, Alexander and Violet.”

A post shared by Lance Bass (@lancebass)

He then sent individual messages to the little ones who aren't so little anymore.

“Violet, my little powerhouse — you somehow manage to sass me and steal my heart at the same time,” he wrote. “And Alexander, my curious explorer — just… maybe chill after 7pm, okay bud?”

He finished his message by writing, “Four years of having you two in our lives and my heart couldn't be more full❤️ Happy birthday!”

In the accompanying photos, you can see Lance with his husband, Michael Turchin, and their twins. The first photo includes the entire family, while the second photo shows the twins holding hands and spinning around.

Friends and followers also sent birthday messages to the twins.

“Happiest happy birthday to our 4 year old angels! They're so gorgeous and fun and sassy!!! As they should be. Play date soon!!!!! Love u all beyond. @lancebass @michaelturchinart 🎉🎂❤️❤️,” one person wrote.

Another person left a comment, saying, “Can't believe they are 4 already! 😩🥲❤️ Happy Birthday Violet! 🎂Happy Birthday Alex! 🎂”

“Adorable family with the best parents and coolest kids anywhere. Happy birthday Alex and Violet! 🥳,” someone else wrote.

A post shared by Lance Bass (@lancebass)

Lance also took to Instagram last year when his twins turned three. Along with a photo of his family, featuring a pair of birthday cakes and plenty of balloons, he wrote, “It's gonna be THRAYYY!!!”

“Thanks to @MooseToys, the birthday fun is in full swing,” he added. “Tile Town, cake, and two happy toddlers — what more could you ask for?”

A post shared by Lance Bass (@lancebass)

Lance may be amazed by the fact that his twins are already four years old, considering the fact that he was already feeling like time was going by quickly when they were still babies.

“I'm just so obsessed with them,” he said while talking about Violet and Alexander to People (the TV Show). “Every friend's like, ‘Look, enjoy every second because it'll fly by like no other and you'll miss this stage.' I'm already getting teary-eyed because they're already 5 months and I can see that it's just flying by right now.”

	At the premiere of his new film Good Fortune tonight, Keanu Reeves remembered his Something's Gotta Give co-star Diane Keaton, who died last week, as “a total pro.”


	Reeves told E! News on the red carpet, “She was very nice to me. Generous artist and a very special, unique person.”


	He continued, “It was cool to be able to see her and Jack Nicholson together. Just with the history they shared and the way the fondness and love they had for each other. It was really cool.”


	Reeves was 36 and Keaton 57 when the film came out in 2003. While she and Reeves had real chemistry onscreen, her character eventually ends up with Jack Nicholson's more age-appropriate Harry.

	Fans have long speculated about an alternate ending where Keaton's character chooses Reeves'. In fact, when the duo presented at the 2020 Oscars, the chemistry was still there. Meyers herself later posted, “Whoa. Maybe they did end up together.”


	The director remembered Keaton's performance in the film earlier today.


	“When I needed her to cry in scene after scene in Something's Gotta Give she went at it hard and then somehow made it funny,” Meyers wrote. “And I remember she would sometimes spin in a kind of goofy circle before a take to purposely get herself off balance or whatever she needed to shed so she could be in the moment. She was fearless, she was like nobody ever, she was born to be a movie star.”

Terri Irwin is celebrating her son Robert Irwin's emotional journey on “Dancing With the Stars.”

Following Robert's reveal that he'll dedicate his Week 5 “Dedication Night” dance to his mom, the wildlife conservationist took to Instagram to honor her son and reflect on their close bond.

A post shared by Terri Irwin (@terriirwincrikey)

The post featured a carousel of never-before-seen Irwin family photos, including childhood images of Robert and his older sister, Bindi Irwin, alongside their late father, Australian wildlife icon Steve Irwin.

“It's dedication night, week five @dancingwiththestars. I'm incredibly honoured that Robert thought of me,” Terri wrote. “Steve and I always talked about how much it meant to us to be parents. So much love. This will be a special night.💕”

The photos captured Robert through the years — from baby pictures to teenage snapshots — with several highlighting his lifelong connection with animals. In one image, a baby Robert lay on the floor wrapped in a large snake. In another, he and Bindi held iguanas, while a third showed toddler Robert wearing a camouflage hat beside a kangaroo.

The tribute also included heartwarming throwbacks of Steve Irwin, who died in 2006 after a stingray accident while filming in the Great Barrier Reef. One particularly touching image showed a young Robert watching in awe as his father handled a reptile.

Fans flooded Terri's post with support and admiration. One follower commented, “World's best mum 💚 no one else could have done what you did, and are still doing. Truly an inspiration for women all around.” Another wrote, “You raised some incredible children. You deserve this!” The official “Dancing With the Stars” account also chimed in, adding, “We can't wait for you to shine with Robert on Tuesday! ❤️”

A post shared by Robert Irwin (@robertirwinphotography)

The 21-year-old wildlife photographer and conservationist, who was just 3 years old when his father passed, will perform with professional partner Witney Carson during “Dedication Night.” The special episode invites contestants to honor influential people in their lives.

“It has been an emotional week in rehearsals. I've been thinking a lot about my mum and her strength,” Robert wrote on Instagram. “I've been reminiscing on the times we've spent as a family and how she has kept my dad part of my life.”

He added, “This dance is for my mum, it's for anyone who's lost someone… and it's for all the strong mothers of the world who deserve our recognition and appreciation ❤️.”

According to ABC's press release, Robert and Carson will perform a contemporary to Phil Collins' “You'll Be in My Heart” — a fitting choice given its deep emotional ties to family and loss.

The upcoming performance marks another full-circle moment for the Irwin family. Bindi Irwin, now 27, won Season 21 of “Dancing With the Stars” in 2015 alongside professional partner Derek Hough — a milestone that captivated fans around the world.

With Robert now taking the ballroom stage, this next tribute promises to be equally emotional — a heartfelt reminder of family, legacy, and love.

You truly are an inspiration to all mums! I am going through a hard time now your story helps me carry on thank you so much to all of you

Yal are such an amazing family I have always had so much respect for that u have done and continue to do !! Steve was so special and loving when it came to his family and animals !

	Celebrity brothers Alec and Stephen Baldwin were involved in a car crash on Monday, but confirmed no one was injured. Both brothers shared that they are safe after photos surfaced online of the Baldwins walking out of a smashed Range Rover in East Hampton, New York, that morning.


	On Monday evening, Alec shared a video confirming that he crashed the vehicle, which he said is registered to his wife, Hilaria.


	“This morning, I was in this car accident. The guy cut me off in a truck, big garbage truck — I mean a garbage truck the size of a whale,” Alex said. “To avoid hitting him, I hit a tree. I hit a big fat tree and crushed my car, my wife's car.”

	Alec said he felt “bad” for crashing Hilaria's car but shared that he and his brother are “fine.” He also thanked the local police department for helping them after the accident.


	“My wife's car is pretty smashed up. Big tree, big fat tree. I'm going to L.A. to see my family, can't wait — going out to California to gather my family together,” he said, before reiterating that he's fine and making a cuckoo sign in jest.

	A rep for Stephen told Rolling Stone that the pair of brothers were doing OK as well. The East Hampton Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


	“Stephen is doing fine and is grateful no one was injured,” Stephen's rep said. “He appreciates the concern and he can confirm that he and Alec are both safe and well.”

When the star-studded cast of Hallmark Channel's 2022 Christmas movie “Haul Out the Holly” first gathered to film in Utah, they had no idea they'd become such a tight-knit group and that the movie would spawn a franchise. The comedy about a cul-de-sac of quirky neighbors competing over holiday decor and annual bake-offs has since inspired two more Hallmark movies — 2024's “Haul Out the Holly: Lit Up” and “Haul Out the Halloween,” which premiered on October 11, 2025. 

But those aren't the only movies that the project has inspired. Director and screenwriter Maclain Nelson and actress Eliza Hayes Maher, who plays Lacey Chabert's best friend in the films, have been quietly developing a feature film, tentatively titled “Silver Alert,” about the adorable real-life friendship forged on-set between Hayes Maher and fellow actresses Ellen Travolta and Melissa Peterman.

A post shared by Melissa Peterman (@melissapeterman)

“Haul Out the Halloween” opens with footage of a wedding between Chabert's character, Emily, and Wes Brown's character, Jared. It's all too fitting that Emily's multigenerational wedding party consists of three bridesmaids played by Hayes Maher, 38, Peterman, 54, and Travolta, 86. Onscreen and off, the unlikely trio of friends is perfect for each other. 

In the three years since they first connected on set in real life, Hayes Maher, Peterman, and Travolta have taken road trips — including an epic adventure to Vegas to see Barry Manilow in concert — and they convene multiple times a year in Los Angeles, whenever Travolta is in town, Hayes Maher told EntertainmentNow. 

The dear friends have been there for each other in good times and hard times, while navigating their different stages of life. Peterman and Travolta doted on Hayes Maher as she became a first-time mom this spring to her son Sully, for instance. Peterman, who also stars in Hallmark's “Finding Mr. Christmas” and NBC's “Happy's Place,” posted their first visit on Instagram. 

Travolta, who lives in Washington state and is actor John Travolta's older sister, has delighted in her newfound friendships after losing her husband of 34 years in 2017. The lifelong actress told the Spokesman-Review that while navigating her grief and loneliness, she and a stray cat who showed up at her door would watch Hallmark movies — and she eventually decided she wanted to be in one. 

Her famous brother called in a favor and Nelson, who'd been a fan of her sitcom work, offered her a part in “Haul Out the Holly.” 

“For me to be doing these is a great treat,” she told the outlet in an interview published on October 10. “There are beautiful young actors and actresses, and I get to play with them, and then we do other things outside of Hallmark. We meet in L.A., we'll have dinner. We'll have a weekend in Vegas, so we have a lot of fun together.” 

Hayes Maher is eager to find a home for the “Silver Alert” script she and Nelson have completed, which she dubbed a “generational friendship comedy” meant to be a feature film. 

“It's based on our real-life friendship, and it's based on our own individual journeys through grief,” she told EntertainmentNow, noting Travolta's loss of her husband, Peterman's “beautiful journey with her best friend,” and her own grief over losing her dad. 

“But it's an ode to Ellen first and foremost,” Hayes Maher said. “Maclain and I had such an easy time writing it together because it's based on real events. It's based on Ellen, Melissa and I taking Ellen to a Barry Manilow concert, and the absolute shenanigans that we got into along the way.” 

“It's done, we're shopping it around, and I have great faith that it will fall into the right hands,” she said.  “My greatest hope for this year is that we get that off the ground.” 

Hayes Maher, who will appear next in Hallmark's “Grand Ole Opry Christmas,” said Travolta and Peterman have already agreed to co-star in the film, but she humbly envisions a “bigger name than mine” playing her role to add star power to the movie.

“I am so satisfied like having written this movie and having written it for my friends, and I would be part of the creative process in some way,” Hayes Maher said. “I just want to get it made and if we get somebody bigger and sparklier, then that is so okay with me. I just want the story to be told. That's the important thing.”

Alex Jones, host of Infowars, at a November 2020 rally in Atlanta, Georgia

The US Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal by far right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of the $1.4 billion in damages he has been ordered to pay for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax.

The top court turned down Jones's appeal of the defamation judgment without comment.

Jones, founder of the website InfoWars and host of a popular radio show, has been found liable in multiple lawsuits brought by relatives of the victims of the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, which left 20 children and six teachers dead.

Jones claimed for years on his show that the Sandy Hook shooting was "staged" by gun control activists and that the parents were "crisis actors," but has since acknowledged it was "100 percent real."

Sandy Hook families maintained that Jones's lies and denialism, coupled with his ability to influence the beliefs of thousands of followers, caused real emotional trauma.

Jones filed for personal bankruptcy in his home state of Texas after losing the defamation case.

Free Speech Systems, the Texas-based parent company of InfoWars, also declared bankruptcy.

The house was the site of six murders in 1974

 The Amityville house at 108 Ocean Ave. in Amityville, N.Y., is one of the most famous haunted houses in history, but both its backstory and its current paranormal status have been hotly contested.


 The five-bedroom Dutch Colonial home, which was built in the 1920s, per House Beautiful, first gained notoriety as the subject of Jay Anson's 1977 novel The Amityville Horror.


 Its legend grew with the release of a 1979 movie based on the book starring James Brolin and Margot Kidder that later spawned an extensive film franchise.


 Though the home was the site of a gruesome mass murder in 1974, Anson's book is centered on a series of strange occurrences that reportedly took place in 1975 that caused its inhabitants, George and Kathleen Lutz, to flee their new residence just 28 days after moving in.


 “[People] ask if I think what the Lutzes told me is true," Anson told Writer's Digest in 1979. "I tell them that I have no idea whether the book is true or not. But I'm sure that the Lutzes believe what they told me to be true.”


 Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, of The Conjuring fame, investigated the house in 1976 and confirmed its haunting in the 2000 documentary, Amityville: Horror Or Hoax. "This was no ordinary haunted house. On a scale of one to 10, this was a 10," Ed said.


 Here's everything to know about the events that took place in the Amityville house, what happened to it after the alleged hauntings and who owns it today.


 The Amityville House was a normal family home until 1965, when Ron and Louise DeFeo moved in with their four children, with another on the way. On Nov. 13, 1974, the couple's 23-year-old son Ronald Jr. “Butch” DeFeo shot his parents and his four siblings — Dawn, Allison, Marc and John Matthew — to death at what he claimed was the command of “voices.”


 “Once I started, I just couldn't stop,” he reportedly said of the incident. Ronald Jr. was later convicted of all the murders and sentenced to six consecutive sentences of 25 years to life in prison, per A&E.


 The house became even more famous for the events that occurred following the family's murder than the gruesome crime that took place there, however.


 As seen in the movie, George and Kathleen Lutz, who moved in with their three children one year after the DeFeo killings, claimed they experienced a host of paranormal activity during their time in the house, including levitation and temporary paralysis.


 The Lutzes also claimed they saw green slime oozing from the walls, a door being ripped off its hinge and demonic presences in the home — most notably, a pig-like creature with red eyes that glowed from the “eye-shaped” windows.


 George told ABC in 2016 that the scene in which a priest visits the home and is told to “get out” by an unknown voice was real. He claimed that Father Ray Pecoraro, who blessed the house on the day the family moved in, felt an unseen hand slap him.


 According to George, the priest later became ill with flu-like symptoms, and his hands began to bleed.


 The validity of the events showcased in both the book and its subsequent film have been debated over the years.


 George addressed the doubt surrounding his family's story in a 1977 interview with PEOPLE, saying, “If we had tried to perpetrate some kind of hoax, I think we would have been much surer of when and how things happened, because we would have been inventing them."


 In 1979, he suggested that those who didn't believe him weren't close enough to the case, telling The Washington Post, “Our critics are people who've never been in the house, just people who read a book. No one who was ever in the house, who investigated it, ever called it a hoax. No one with any credentials who was personally involved ever called it a hoax.”


 Ronald Jr.'s defense lawyer, William E. Weber, claimed to PEOPLE in 1979 that he and Lutz planned the book's plot together. "I know this book's a hoax," he said. "We created this horror story over many bottles of wine.”


 According to Weber, he also gave Lutz the idea for the demon pig that was featured in the book. “I told George Lutz that Ronnie DeFeo used to call the neighbor's cat a pig," he said.


 Kidder, who played Kathleen in the 1979 film, also denied the hype. “I suppose I believe in the possibility of many things, but I think pigs snorting in windows is taking it a bit far,” she said.


 George doubled down on his claims in a 2002 interview with ABC.


 "There were ... odors in the house that came and went," he told the outlet. "There were sounds. The front door would slam shut in the middle of the night.... I couldn't get warm in the house for many days."


 The former Amityville house owner claimed that he was awoken every night at 3:15 a.m., the approximate time Ronald Jr. is said to have killed his family.


 George also told ABC that he saw his wife levitate and move across the bed. The couple's children, however, had mixed beliefs about their parents' claims.


 Daniel, one of the sons, told the New York Post in 2012, “My brother and myself shared a levitation experience in our beds. We both woke up, and our headboards and footboards were smashing each other and banging off the ceiling.”


 His brother, however, George's stepson Christopher, admitted in a 2005 interview with The Seattle Times that the events were stretched to the point of fiction.


 Kathleen died in 2004, while George died in 2006, according to the New York Post.

 The Conjuring movie series is based on some of the most famous investigations done by paranormal experts Ed and Lorraine throughout their careers.


 While the Amityville house is not a focus of the films, it spawned its own franchise of more than 15 movies that can be considered Conjuring-adjacent.


 The Warrens investigated the Amityville home in 1976, five years after visiting the Perron family house, which was the subject of the first Conjuring film.


 “If you gave me one billion dollars, I wouldn't go in that house again,” Lorraine has said of the Amityville house, claiming that she levitated inside the residence. “Terrible. Horrible. Horrible place.”

 According to House Beautiful, the Amityville house was built for John and Catherine Moynahan in the 1920s.


 In 1960, the couple's daughter sold their home to John and Mary Riley, who lived there for five years without incident before selling the property to Ron and Louise. The couple ultimately met their demise at the residence at the hands of their son.


 One year after they were killed in 1974, the house was purchased by George and Kathleen, who fled just 28 days after moving in. The Lutzes then sold the residence to Jim and Barbara Cromarty in 1977 for $55,000.


 Though Jim and Barbara left the house for a time due to unwanted visitors who came calling after the release of the 1979 film, they were unable to sell the property early on, remaining there until 1987, per House Beautiful.


 The home's next buyers, Peter and Jeanne O'Neill, paid a reported $325,000 for the place. Over the next 10 years, they remodeled, swapping the houses' infamous eye windows for a square shape and filling in the in-ground pool.


 In 1997, Brian Wilson purchased the house for $310,000. According to the outlet, he made further changes to the property, adding a second sunroom to the back of the home and upgrading the boathouse.


 The Telegraph reported that the house was listed for $1.15 million in 2010. Wilson ultimately sold it to Caroline and David D'Antonio for $950,000.


 The house went up for sale again for $850,000 in 2016. It remained on the market until March 2017, when it sold to a couple for $605,000, per the New York Post.

 While Fran Walters, a long-time neighbor of the Amityville house, told the New York Post that she doesn't “discount the possibility” that the home is still haunted, its former owners have denied experiencing any unusual activity.


 Barbara, who moved into the house with her husband James in 1977, told PEOPLE that “everything was a hoax.”


 James expressed a similar sentiment to Newsday. "Nothing weird ever happened, except for people coming by because of the book and the movie," he said.


 The outlet also spoke to Jeanne, who lived in the house from 1987 to 1997. She said, "I loved it. It was a beautiful home.”


 Its current owners have not publicly commented on the space.

 As the Amityville house is a private residence, public visitors are not welcome at the property, which was changed from its original address to deter fans from seeking it out.


 Hundreds of horror buffs were able to get a glimpse of the property in 2010, however, when the home was opened up for a moving sale.


 According to Newsday, the upper floors of the home, where the DeFeo family was killed, were open during the sale, though the basement and other areas were blocked off.

With Stranger Things nearing its end, Millie Bobby Brown is preparing to take on a new role in a supernatural TV show. The actress is set to lead and executive-produce Prism, an upcoming Netflix series. It centers on a woman who can communicate with spirits amid a mysterious global phenomenon.

Netflix is developing a new supernatural drama series titled Prism, with Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown set to take on the lead role. Bobby Brown also serves as an executive producer alongside Rachel Brosnahan and the Russo brothers' AGBO banner (via Deadline).

Brown will portray Cassie, a woman gifted with the ability to communicate with spirits. She becomes entangled in a global crisis when a strange phenomenon begins causing ghostly “visitors” to appear across the world. To prevent chaos, Cassie must uncover the origin of this strange phenomenon. As of now, Brosnahan's role in the series remain unknown.

Prism will be overseen by Etan Frankel, who has been appointed showrunner. The show is based on Prism, a short story originally featured in Assemble Artifacts magazine and developed in-house by Assemble Media. The story's author, Nick Shafir, is also on board as co-producer.

Behind the scenes, the production will be handled by Assemble Media. In addition to Brown through her PCMA banner, the executive producers also include Brosnahan and Russell Kahn via Scrap Paper Pictures.

Meanwhile, Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, Angela Russo-Otstot, Scott Nemes, and Alessandra Maman represent AGBO. Assemble Media's Jack Heller and Caitlin de Lisser-Ellen are also part of the producing team.

Prism continues Brown's growing creative partnership with Netflix, following her recent work with AGBO on The Electric State. Her upcoming slate includes Enola Holmes 3, scheduled for a 2026 release. She is also producing and leading the romantic comedy Just Picture It, which is currently in development.

Meanwhile, Brown's long-running hit Stranger Things will conclude later this year, releasing its fifth and final season in three parts from November 26 to December 31.

Netflix has not yet announced a premiere date for Prism.

The 'la Caixa' Foundation presents the lecture series ‘The Frontiers of Astrobiology' at the CosmoCaixa Science Museum, in which world-renowned experts will share the latest advances in the search for extraterrestrial life. This series, coordinated and moderated by Ignasi Ribas, a researcher at the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia and the Institute of Space Sciences of the CSIC, will explore innovative research and cutting-edge projects in astrobiology with figures such as Charles Cockell, David Kipping, Frances Westall and Laura Kreidberg. 

On Tuesdays from 21 October to 11 November, the CosmoCaixa Science Museum will host the series of lectures ‘The Frontiers of Astrobiology', which offers a journey to the limits of astrobiology to explore how and where life could exist outside Earth. In four lectures, different specialists will address the study of extremophile microorganisms as a model for assessing the habitability of other worlds, the origin of life on Earth to recognise biological signals on distant planets, the comparison between our solar system and other planetary systems to understand whether Earth is unique or shares features with other habitable worlds, and the latest advances in answering the big question: Are we alone in the universe? 

The series of lectures is part of the exhibition ‘Extraterrestrials. Is there life beyond Earth?', which explores our fascination with the idea of extraterrestrial life and how we have imagined worlds beyond our own, and projects some possible futures through science and technology. Those interested in this topic can take a guided tour of the exhibition before attending the lectures in the series (6 p.m.).

The series kicks off on 21 October at CosmoCaixa with the lecture ‘Extreme Life on Earth and in Space' by Dr Charles Cockell, an international authority on the study of life in extreme conditions. In this session, he will discuss how microorganisms manage to survive in inhospitable environments and what this reveals about the possible habitability of other worlds. Based on pioneering research, some of it carried out in underground laboratories or during space missions, the lecture will offer the keys to understanding this knowledge, which drives exploration and future human settlement in space, and will bring us closer to the possibility of determining whether microbial life could exist beyond Earth.

The second session will take place on 28 October and is entitled ‘Searching for extraterrestrials... through time'. In this meeting, David Kipping, PhD in Physics and Astronomy, will address the question of our place in the cosmos based on the few reliable data available. He will analyse the silence of the universe, without signals, and why these apparent absences impose limits on what could exist. With a critical eye, he will also explain how humanity's short technological history conditions the search and will present plausible scenarios for future contact and its impact on space exploration. 

The series will continue on 4 November with the lecture ‘Geological perspectives for the search for life on exoplanets' by astrobiologist Frances Westall, who will analyse the search for life beyond Earth as one of the great challenges of astrobiology. Understanding how life arose on our planet is key to identifying signals on other worlds. Dr Westall will also share with attendees her research on the oldest biological traces on Earth and how they guide the exploration of exoplanets. This scientist, whose career ranges from the discovery of fossilised bacteria in marine sediments to working at NASA, will offer a unique insight into early geobiological processes and their usefulness in recognising life on Mars and beyond. 

To close this cycle, on Tuesday 11 November, Dr Laura Kreidberg, PhD in Astrophysics, will give a lecture entitled ‘Is Earth really special?'. The expert will discuss whether Earth is an exceptional planet or just one of thousands discovered outside the solar system. From the Copernican revolution to the era of exoplanets, science has shown that neither our planet nor the Milky Way occupy a privileged place. Thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope, it is now possible to study the atmospheres of similar worlds and assess their potential habitability. Kreidberg will explore the latest advances in this search and analyse Earth-like worlds, from lava planets with constantly changing atmospheres to systems that reveal unique secrets about planetary evolution. 

Charles Cockell obtained his first degree in Biochemistry from the University of Bristol and his DPhil in Molecular Biophysics from the University of Oxford. He is Professor of Astrobiology at the University of Edinburgh and founder of the UK Centre for Astrobiology in Edinburgh, the national node of NASA's Astrobiology Institute. He has published numerous academic and popular articles and books. He is currently a member of NASA's Scientific Analysis Group for the Search for Life, which evaluates upcoming astrobiological missions to Mars. 

David Kipping is a British-American astronomer and associate professor at Columbia University. He holds a PhD in Science from the University of Cambridge and a PhD in Physics and Astronomy from University College London. In 2009, he discovered the first evidence of the transit of the exoplanet HD 80606b around its star. He is the founder of the Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler project, which focuses on the search for exomoons and natural satellites of exoplanets. He has been recognised with several awards and distinctions, including the Kavli Fellow in 2019, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship in 2018, and Popular Science magazine's annual Brilliant 10 award in 2015. In October 2017, he was included in Science News' list of 10 notable scientists. He has created the YouTube channel Cool Worlds. 

Frances Westall holds a PhD in Geology from the University of Cape Town and a postdoctorate in Marine Geology from the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany. She was director of research at the CNRS laboratory, Centre for Molecular Biophysics, in Orleans, where she led the Exobiology Group until 2021. She has received prestigious awards from institutions such as NASA, the Italian Chemical Society, the University of Edinburgh, the Belgian Geological Society, the European Society for Microbiology and the International Society for Astrobiology. Since 2022, Westall has been professor emeritus at the CNRS laboratory and is dedicated to her research and writing scientific articles. 

Laura Kreidberg is an astrophysicist and director of the APEx (Atmospheres and Processes of Exoplanets) Department at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. She is a Clay Fellow at the Harvard & Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics and a Harvard Junior Fellow. She received the Doctoral Prize from Division F of the International Astronomical Union in 2016 and the Annie Jump Cannon Prize from the Astronomical Society of the United States in 2021.

Supernatural became an enigma in the world of television, offering fans 15 seasons of scares, brotherly love, iconic lines, and some of the most emotionally charged moments in history. However, like most long-running shows, the popular horror series was criticized for fumbling its ending. After going up against countless foes and even God himself, fans felt it was justified that Supernatural's favorite character was given the happy ending he deserved all along.

Dean Winchester's unceremonious death in the final moments of the show practically broke the fandom's hearts. If there was someone who deserved a little bit of a break or a chance at a white picket fence life, it was the all-sacrificing Winchester brother. However, the million-dollar question is, did Dean want what everyone thought he wanted? Was dying on a hunt the goodbye that Supernatural had always intended for its most exciting lead?

 Dying is subjective in the world of Supernatural. Dean's resurrection in Season 4 and return from Hell set a precedent that the higher purpose associated with the Winchester bloodline wasn't going to be endangered by something as mere as death. Therefore, whether it was intentional or accidental, Sam and Dean died and came back to life at least a dozen times in the course of 15 seasons.

That's why, after a certain point, it became routine for the brothers to leverage death in favor of completing the mission, giving the impression that it was a luxury that they could manipulate. However, after ending it all and saving the world for the umpteenth time, the notion of resurrection had become so frequent that when it finally happened, it didn't quite have the same effect. In the final episode, Dean Winchester was found impaled in a barn during his hunt for a vampire.

Yes, killed on a hunt and that was that – no resurrections, healing or do-overs. Sam arrived just in time for a final goodbye and to hear his brother say the words he had been saying since the very beginning; for Sam to live a long, normal life. However, why couldn't Dean find it in his heart to have the same wish? What's more, why couldn't the show give Dean or the audience some closure, especially when his character had gone through valuable changes?

 It felt too ordinary for a legendary character like Dean to go out on a random vampire hunt after surviving angels, demons, and God's wrath. The emotional weight of it didn't quite connect with the fans, leading them to believe it was one of the most lackluster moments of Dean's storyline. It also made them question the show's choices, which made it difficult for Dean to have a happy ending.

From the moment Dean called Sam for help in the first episode to his final farewell, he had been on a continuous journey with an ever-evolving character. Throughout the series, Dean slowly learned that he was more than a soldier and his brother's keeper. He had begun to understand the value of his own life, the appeal of a peaceful life, and the possibility of breaking his family's tragic cycle.

Therefore, it seemed more frustrating than befitting to disregard all that character development in favor of such a mundane end. On the other hand, it's highly likely the show might have been going for a grounded death for Dean after having so many near-death experiences in epic battles. It might have been symbolic of how, after everything, Dean was only human.

Even if they hadn't fought angels and monsters from Purgatory, Dean might have died anyway on some random hunt, maybe even without his brother. Unfortunately, even if fans were to accept this explanation after almost five years, it still completely undermines every facet of Dean's character development. Surely, he was the sacrificial type, but the series didn't need to exploit his vulnerability.

Even if it had been for a little while, Dean deserved some downtime of his own. It couldn't have been explicitly for family, but he could have at least said goodbye to the hunting world after being consistently at war for more than a decade. At the end of the day, one might assume that after five years, the ending of one of the greatest shows of its time would finally start to make sense. Yet, much like Game of Thrones, Supernatural's finale remains a thorn in the side of an otherwise legendary series

It would be wrong to say that Dean "loved" hunting or was inherently satisfied with that role. He was practically thrown into this tumultuous life by his father and was forced to play a parental role when he himself needed one. Therefore, that insatiable need for "hunting things and family business" was only an unintended consequence of being on the road with John.

Luckily, Sam had the opportunity to get out, but Dean had been hardwired to believe, because of his circumstances, that he was the one to carry the burden, whether it was of supporting his father or protecting Sam. Regardless, even if it felt that Dean was meant to be a hunter all along, that was not the emotional input his character deserved, especially in the end. Supernatural implied that Dean died doing what he loved, but he would have loved more to have a little piece of the average life.

It's safe to say that, in contrast to the lukewarm effect of the finale, episodes like "Regarding Dean" had more depth and heart. This particular episode is more meaningful than what the series finale intended to deliver. It was an underrated storyline that highlighted Dean's sentimental value and poignancy in the narrative, in addition to being the show's constant comic relief. Seeing the helplessness in both Sam and Dean's eyes as the latter slowly loses his sense of identity is what fans truly deserved out of Dean's final goodbye.

To him, forgetting himself was far more significant than hunting or saving the world, proving Dean was more than everyone's sacrificial lamb or hero. In some corner of his heart, Dean wanted to be defined by his existence as a person rather than his actions as a hunter. Therefore, it still stings that a quiet goodbye for such a layered and complicated character was a complete disservice on all accounts. Something as emotionally rich and heartfelt as "Regarding Dean" should have tied the story together in the end.

 No matter how much the show justifies Dean's ending as bittersweet or grounded, the fact of the matter is that fans still see it as a betrayal of his hard-earned growth. The fans remain divided over whether the original ending was a way to honor the idea that hunters die on the job, or it was just sloppy writing. Dean had finally learned that his life was worth something and that he didn't need to lay it down every chance he got.

His sense of self-preservation had been dormant for so long that it took him quite a while to value his life, but in the end, it amounted to pretty much nothing with that run-of-the-mill vampire hunt. Of course, the moment was emotional, but it also stripped Dean of the redemption his arc promised. Unfortunately, while time only deepened the rift, The Winchesters' finale reopened old wounds.

The spin-off series further intensified the debate that Dean Winchester was never truly meant to have a definitive ending. After ascending to Heaven, Dean continued to explore multiple timelines, fighting the good fight and looking after his parents in a universe where they had a happy ending. Ultimately, it all boils down to the fact that Dean Winchester's legacy is too big to end, and it even transcends time. He has always been many things to his family: a silent watcher, a guardian, and a fighter, who wanted to see at least someone he loved have a happy ending, one he never got. Dean Winchester may have died, but The Winchesters proved that his spirit, impact, and story are far too powerful to stay buried.

A Peruvian bishop submitted his resignation to Pope Leo after a Vatican investigation revealed that he was secretly dating multiple women simultaneously.

51-year-old Ciro Quispe Lopez, the bishop of Juli, in Peru, stands accused of having up to 17 secret lovers. Although he denies the allegations against him as part of a defamation campaign by ‘dark hands', Lopez handed in his resignation to the Pope last month, more than two decades earlier than Catholic bishops usually retire. The Vatican investigation began after an investigation by Kevin Moncada, a journalist for the Peruvian newspaper Sin Fronteras, found that Ciro Quispe Lopez had been exchanging explicit messages, photos and videos with various women. On top of that, he accidentally sent pictures and videos intended for his mistresses to his house cleaner, who alerted the Catholic Church.



“A nun who was one of Quispe's lovers was jealous of a lawyer the bishop was also seeing and sent information about his affairs to a third lover who got into a fight with the lawyer,” Paola Ugaz, a Peruvian journalist who has seen a Vatican document on the investigation, told The Times. “It was a real soap opera, but also lifted the lid on a serious abuse of power. Many of the 17 women were too scared to come forward because they were frightened of him.”

“In April of last year, we received information that one of the bishop's alleged lovers had practically come to blows with another young woman, Kevin Moncada told Hildebrandt Magazine. “That was the trigger. The case came to light because the women found out that the bishop was dating several of them at the same time and that infuriated them.”

 ﻿﻿﻿

Quispe is believed to have accidentally sent his house cleaner pictures and videos intended for his mistresses, which only confirmed her suspicions. The woman promptly filed a complaint to the Catholic Church, claiming that she had seen women's hair in his shower and that ‘his sheets had stains' which she had to clean.

In light of all this evidence, Ciro Quispe Lopez was forced to hand in his resignation as bishop, even though he denies the charges against him.

DENVER — Every town has its secrets, and in Denver, some of those secrets seem unwilling to stay buried. Deep in the heart of the Mile High City, historic buildings still carry the echoes of their Wild West past. 

Now, a group of spiritual investigators is hoping to separate fact from folklore — and turn their findings into a television series. This week, they've set their sights, and their equipment, on one of Denver's most storied venues: Ophelia's Electric Soapbox, housed inside the Airedale building. 



For more than a century, the Airedale Building has stood at 20th and Lawrence. Since it was built in 1889, it's been home to a rotating list of tenants. According to paranormal investigators — and some current staff — not all those tenants have left.

“There are two types of people in this world,” says investigator Arthur Schmidt. “It's either you 100% believe…or you want to believe, but you're terrified of what's on the other side.”

Schmidt knows the skepticism well. 

“No one would believe me, my parents, my family, my friends, nothing,” he says of his own childhood experiences. “I felt constantly dismissed, and so I just figured, you know, this is going to be my life.”

His search for proof has fueled decades of investigation — and now, a new TV project called Awakened: Haunted Wild West. The series explores ghost stories tied to historic sites across the western U.S.

“We're cracking open the history books and shedding the light into the dark corners of our history and the Wild West,” Schmidt says.

According to Ophelia's managers, strange things have been happening inside the former saloon and hotel for years — some of it playful, some unexplainable.

“There's definitely been…there's someone here. There's probably a few people here,” says general manager Rachel Noble.

General Manager Rachel Noble recalls one encounter in the women's restroom:

“I'm in one stall, and the receptacle falls off of the wall in the stall next to me. So I'm like, oh, not a big deal…Well, that shot out of the stall. And I said, ‘Okay, I figured there was spirits here. I'm here to work, not here to bother you…we can be friends.'” The staff has even given their unseen resident a name: Ophelia. Noble describes the presence as “feminine and always very supportive of me and the other feminine leadership that we've had in this building. Men just don't do well in this building.”

From lights flickering to music volumes mysteriously shifting during live sets, they've learned to work around their ghostly guest. One thing they agree on: “We've never felt that here [the spirit] is negative. It's always been safe,” says Noble.

The Awakened crew isn't just after jump scares. They're using history, storytelling, and advanced paranormal tools to collect evidence. They've also paired up with Dark Side of Denver Ghost Tours and a psychic medium, Carol Whitebear. 

“Even as a skeptic, I feel like it's still hard to deny,” says investigator James Doyle.

For Schmidt, the mission is as much about empathy as it is about the unexplained. 

“If you have gone through this, we've got your back. We're right there with you. And for the skeptics out there, there's no fake in the funk,” he says.

The work can also be personal for those who live or work in haunted spaces. 

“Some people that work here…have even said, like, 'I don't even want to come back,'” Schmidt admits. That's why he and his team try to “calm people down” while collecting evidence.

Both the investigators and the managers of Ophelia's see the value in telling these stories — not just for entertainment, but for preserving history.

“As we look into the history of these places, these people were here before us,” Noble says. “We're here because of them,” Flynn added. 

For Schmidt, it's also about pushing viewers out of their comfort zones:

“It's to open the light a little bit, open your eyes, your minds and hearts and souls, to really, what is there?” he said. 

Awakened: Haunted Wild West aims to give audiences more than campfire ghost tales. As Schmidt puts it: “This show is not to scare you, even though my crew and I will get into some very terrifying situations… Let's give voices to people who have gone through stuff like I did… and open up skeptics' minds.”

If you want to catch the Awakened crew in action, Ophelia's Electric Soapbox will be the star of their next investigation — and maybe, whatever still resides inside, will make themselves known on camera.

The show is still in production, so keep an eye out for updates on Awakened's social media accounts.

In celebration of World Architecture Day 2025, Volkslift International Philippines, in partnership with the United Architects of the Philippines (UAP) Manila Maharlika Chapter, hosted a highly accredited seminar titled “Elevating Design: Mastering Vertical Transportation in Philippine Architecture” held last October 9 at Spencer's Fusion Restaurant, Best Western Plus Metro Clark.

The full-day event gathered architects, engineers, and design professionals for a deep dive into the theme “Design for Strength: Crafting a Sustainable Future.” The seminar, accredited with 4.5 CPD points, offered participants valuable insights into integrating modern, efficient, and sustainable vertical transportation systems into contemporary architectural practice.

Leading the discussions was Engr. Nestor Lacson Marquilencia, a respected expert in elevator design, life safety, and code compliance. He shared practical knowledge on vertical mobility and emphasized the importance of aligning safety, efficiency, and sustainability in building design.

The initiative was guided by UAP Past National President Arch. Mediliano “Boy” Roldan V., with Arch. Ma. Teresa Amabelle E. Ticsay serving as chairperson and UAP Manila Maharlika Chapter President Arch. Mon Jerkis Servino at the helm of the organizing committee. Their leadership ensured a well-executed and impactful professional gathering.

Through this collaboration, Volkslift International Philippines reaffirmed its commitment to innovation in vertical transportation and to supporting the architectural community's pursuit of safer, smarter, and more sustainable building solutions. The event also served as a platform for ongoing learning and collaboration—strengthening the shared goal of elevating Philippine architecture through knowledge, technology, and design excellence.
