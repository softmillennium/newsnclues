In a voicemail obtained by Fox News Digital, a caller told ICE agents he hopes they are doxxed and publicly shamed. EXCLUSIVE: Amid soaring assaults on federal law enforcement and following a recent shooting at a Dallas facility, a caller left a disturbing voicemail taunting immigration agents, saying he hopes "every one of those lawless c----" gets "doxxed one by one." "You know, it's always the bad guys who need masks, not the good ones," a male-sounding voice said in a voicemail recording obtained by Fox News Digital. "I hope every one of those lawless c---- you call ICE agents get doxxed one by one, and they get the public shaming they deserve," he said. This comes as assaults on ICE agents have risen by 1,000%, according to the Department of Homeland Security. On Sept. 24, a gunman named Joshua Jahn, carrying rounds with the words "anti-ICE" written on them, allegedly opened fire on a facility in Dallas, killing two and injuring another. The Dallas Observer reported that authorities found notes in Jahn's home in which he referred to ICE agents as "people showing up to collect a dirty paycheck," and that he intended to "maximize lethality" against ICE personnel. In a statement to Fox News Digital in response to the voicemail, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin blamed the rise in animosity against agents on rampant rhetoric "comparing ICE day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols," saying such rhetoric "has consequences." "The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop," said McLaughlin. Joshua Jahn allegedly shot at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas, on Wednesday and a bullet with "ANTI-ICE" on it was found at the scene. "These type of threats against our brave ICE law enforcement officers and their families are disgusting. These officers risk their lives every day to arrest murderers, pedophiles, rapists, terrorists, and gang members from our communities," she said. They get up every morning to try and make our communities safer. DHS recently called on sanctuary politicians and the media to "tone down their rhetoric" in the face of surging assaults, doxxings and threats against agents and their families. According to DHS, a Texas ICE officer's spouse received a call saying, "I don't know how you let your husband work for ICE, and you sleep at night. I hope your kids get deported by accident. Law enforcement officers stand guard outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) headquarters, after U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut on Sunday temporarily blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's administration from sending any National Guard troops to police Portland, in south Portland, Ore., Oct. 5, 2025. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, three women, Cynthia Raygoza, 37, Ashleigh Brown, 38, and Sandra Carmona Samane, 25, were indicted in September for livestreaming their pursuit of an ICE agent to his home and then posting the victim's address on Instagram. Upon arriving at the law enforcement officer's home, they began shouting "neighbor is ICE," "la migra lives here," and "ICE lives on your street and you should know." Commenting on the indictment, Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said, "The conduct of these defendants are deeply offensive to law enforcement officers and their families. If you threaten, dox, or harm in any manner one of our agents or employees, you will face prosecution and prison time." Peter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Trump-style diplomacy made the deal work, and could undo it. For one thing, the shooting hasn't stopped entirely. Hamas is also giving little indication that it plans on eliminating itself as either a political or military force: On Monday, video circulated of the group publicly executing seven men accused of collaboration with Israel. Four bodies were handed over on Monday, with 24 still remaining. President Donald Trump said on Monday that the “hardest part” of ending the war had been accomplished and that rebuilding Gaza would likely be the “easiest.” Right now, it's hard to find justification for that optimism. What's becoming increasingly clear as the deal goes into effect is that its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness: It put off the “hardest” questions — when, if ever, will Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza entirely? — until later, in order to prioritize a ceasefire and hostage release. When Hamas replied to the proposal with a qualified “yes, but” in early October, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assumed the deal was off. At the same time, Qatar and Egypt reportedly strong-armed Hamas into accepting a deal they had initially viewed as a nonstarter. All of this worked because many of the 20-point plan's provisions are vague and have no deadlines attached to them. It's fair to assume many of them are not actually plans for things that will really take place, but language inserted to make the agreement minimally acceptable to all the stakeholders. Will Hamas members who lay down their weapons really be amnestied and given asylum abroad? Will the Palestinian Authority really complete a “reform program” making it acceptable to Israel as Gaza's new ruler? Will there really be an “International Stabilization Force” to provide security? Or an “interfaith dialogue process” to change the mindsets of Israelis and Palestinians? Even Trump has some doubts about the last one. The deal is designed as something of a diplomatic Rorschach test that allows everyone involved to see what they want in it. This was in evidence on Monday night when Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi seemed to disagree about whether the plan calls for a two-state solution. (It does, but only briefly and in general terms.) In the short term, none of this is a bad thing. If the negotiators had insisted on hashing out a detailed and binding road map for Gaza's political future before the deal went into effect, the IDF would likely be fighting street-by-street through Gaza City right now and the hostages would still be in captivity, as would the nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees who were also released on Monday. The agreement stopped the carnage, and it could also be an opening for a political process that leads to a better future for Gaza and the region — or at least a less grim present. But as the events of this week are already showing, it's an opening that could close quickly. It's worth remembering that we've been here before — and quite recently. A ceasefire deal, negotiated in the waning days of the Biden administration, was still in effect when Trump took office. Frustrated with the lack of progress on hostage releases, Israel resumed airstrikes in Gaza in March, and halted food aid into the territory, with Trump's full support. (At the time, Trump has still in thrall to the idea of “cleaning out” Gaza and turning it into a holiday resort, which probably didn't help matters.) But if Hamas fighters are still armed and in control of much of Gaza, and if IDF troops are still present within the territory, it's not difficult to imagine a range of scenarios that could lead to the war resuming. Give Trump his due: Over the past few weeks, he has shown that his willingness to put real pressure on Netanyahu and to leverage his close relationships in the Gulf can produce results in the Middle East much more quickly than many experts and peace process veterans thought possible. (Whether he could have achieved it much sooner is another question.) Trump is never shy about declaring victory regardless of the facts. He now claims to have ended eight wars — several of which involved countries that were not actually at war. In Gaza, that tendency of his was an asset. A more fact-based and pragmatic approach would probably not have gotten this deal done. But keeping the peace, and preventing more bloodshed in Gaza, may now depend on Trump being able to continue working on a problem even after he's already gotten credit for fixing it. ﻿New political science research suggests democracy can survive leaders like Trump. ﻿Maybe we don't want to centralize power over elections in this particular federal government? An expert on political violence offers warnings — and some hope. We've made tremendous progress against famine — but hunger hasn't disappeared. And five other questions about the deal, answered.</p>

FIRST ON FOX: A community college professor in Kansas has advocated doxxing ICE agents as well as community interference with their operations, an audit of a social media account belonging to him shows. Steve Werkmeister is an English professor at Johnson County Community College in Overland Park, Kansas. He goes by Steve W and uses the handle swerkmeister.bsky.social on Bluesky, a predominantly left-wing spinoff of X, where he describes himself as a "slacker" and "left of the dial." On Monday, Werkmeister reposted a flyer distributed by a left-wing advocacy group teaching anti-ICE advocates to use whistles in order to disrupt ICE operations. The flyer explains that blowing whistles when ICE agents are in the area allows people to "follow ICE caravans," "alert neighbors to join in" and "catch up with the crowd." Professor Steve Werkmeister teaches at Johnson County Community College in Overland Park, Kansas. He also shared a post by John Pavlovitz, a known far-left internet activist, encouraging family members to "out" relatives who work for ICE. "They need to be made into pariahs in the places decent Americans gather." On multiple occasions, Werkmeister refers to federal immigration enforcement as "kidnapping," and appears paranoid that he and his family will be "kidnapped" by ICE because of their "brown" skin. "I've talked to our chair and the college president to see if I can just move online and teach from a safe location overseas (my family and I can be kidnapped by the government at any time since our skin is brown), and so far they're compassionately noncommittal (lots of empty phrases)," he said in an Oct. 10 post. A Rutgers University professor, Mark Bray, nicknamed "Dr. Antifa," fled to Spain last week after President Donald Trump labeled Antifa a domestic terrorist organization. After an apparent trip overseas, Werkmeister explained his protocol for re-entering the United States. A photo of the Johnson County Community College campus taken on an unknown date. "Even though our citizenship is beyond question in any normal, legal sense, we're brown, so I texted my family as soon as we landed and told them I'd text again once we got past customs. If they didn't get the second text, they'd know we were detained and needed lawyers right away," he posted in March. "Then once we were safely at the gate, I realized my anxiety over the culture of violence and predatory aggression in this country had returned," he said in a follow-up post. It's a national shame that the most dangerous part of our trip was coming home to our own country." Some of Werkmeister's ire specifically targets White people. "It's tough to live with the knowledge that whenever I go to the store, or to my office, or out for a walk, or anywhere really, packs of white ‘Americans' are out hunting and kidnapping people who look like me," he said in a June 26 post. "It's psychological terrorism for the crime of being born brown in America." In an earlier post, he claimed that White people want "brown folks back to the fields." Supporters of Sen. Ted Cruz, who was running for president, wait outside Yardley Hall at Johnson County Community College on March 2, 2016, in Overland Park, Kansas. "Mediocre white males realized they can't compete on a more level playing field, so they need to force women back into the kitchen and black and brown folks back to the fields. "JCCC is an open dialog institution, and the values of Johnson County Community College is something we hold true for all," a school spokesman told Fox News Digital in a brief statement. Werkmeister did not return a request for comment. Previously, he was a politics reporter at The Tennessee Star. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

The fiancée of a pastor who was identified as one of the victims in the Tennessee munitions plant explosion said his church became a "packed house" this week after a call for prayer. On Monday, the sheriffs of Humphreys and Hickman counties identified Stewart as one of the 16 victims killed in Friday's explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems plant near Bucksnort, about 50 miles west of Nashville. "We had a packed out house this morning at The Log Church. I know this would have absolutely thrilled Trent. We appreciate everyone who came, and we hope everyone will join us again next Sunday," Katy Stover wrote on Facebook. Christina Williams, right, hugs Tracy Cook during a candlelight vigil honoring the victims of a blast at an explosives plant, Accurate Energetic Systems, on Sunday, Oct. 12, 2025, in Waverly, Tenn.  (George Walker IV/AP) In another post, Stover said, "Trent was the most amazing man I have ever met." Regardless of anything legal, this man was my husband. I don't need a piece of paper to tell me anything," she added. I know he would've been an amazing father. On a Facebook page purportedly belonging to her, she wrote, "I live in a small town, love art (drawing and painting) and scenery." Reyna Gillahan, another victim, had dreamed of paying off her home and keeping it in the family, so her daughter, Rosalina Gillahan, began fundraising after the explosion, according to The Associated Press. It was one of several fundraisers for families who lost loved ones. "She was a beautiful soul — loving, strong, and always thinking of others before herself," Rosalina Gillahan posted on social media about her mother. The other victims were identified as Jason Adams, Billy Baker, Christopher Clark, James Cook, LaTeisha Mays, Melinda Rainey, Steven Wright, Erick Anderson, Adam Boatman, Mindy Clifton, Jeremy Moore, Melissa Stafford, Rachel Woodall and Donald Yowell. The WellSpring Christian Church in Spring Hill said Yowell, his wife and son were members long "before moving to Waverly a few years ago." Matt Reinhart wrote on Facebook that victim Mindy Clifton used to work in corrections in Florida before moving to Tennessee. Debris covers the ground and vehicles after a powerful blast ripped through an explosives manufacturing plant in Hickman County, Tenn., on Friday, Oct. 10, 2025. "During my 30-year career in Corrections, I had the privilege of working with many outstanding individuals. One of the very best was Mindy Clifton," he wrote. "After dedicating over 20 years of service to our community, Mindy retired and moved to the beautiful state of Tennessee. Sadly, one of those lost was our Mindy," Reinhart added. The explosion took place at Accurate Energetic Systems in Hickman County. Once the area is clear, authorities can start investigating what caused the blast, said Matthew Belew, acting special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Some of the relevant evidence is spread out over miles, according to Belew. "It's almost like putting a puzzle back together," Belew said. "We have worked closely with AES to know to look at pictures, look at blueprints, any of the identifying things that were in the building. And then we slowly methodically start to put some of that stuff together." Greg Norman is a reporter at Fox News Digital. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Panelists Brent Sadler and Derek Maltz weigh in on the Pentagon taking aim at narcoterrorists near Venezuela on ‘America Reports.' President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that the U.S. military carried out another strike on a suspected drug vessel off the coast of Venezuela, killing six suspected smugglers. "Under my Standing Authorities as Commander-in-Chief, this morning, the Secretary of War, ordered a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization (DTO) conducting narcotrafficking in the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility — just off the Coast of Venezuela. Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known DTO route," Trump wrote Tuesday on Truth Social. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social in September that he ordered a lethal strike on a vessel linked to a designated terrorist organization operating in the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility. The strikes come after the White House sent lawmakers a memo Sept. 30 informing them that the U.S. is now participating in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug smugglers. Additionally, it comes on the heels of four other fatal strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean since September. On Friday, the Department of War unveiled a new counter-narcotics Joint Task Force in the Southern Command area of responsibility, according to Secretary of War Pete Hegseth. "The message is clear: if you traffic drugs toward our shores, we will stop you cold." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivers his speech during 22nd Shangri-La Dialogue summit in Singapore, May 31, 2025. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., filed a war powers resolution in September to bar U.S. forces from engaging in "hostilities" against certain non-state organizations. "There has been no authorization to use force by Congress in this way," Schiff told reporters Wednesday. The fact that the administration claims to have a list and has put organizations on a list does not somehow empower the administration to usurp Congress's power of declaring war or refusing to declare war or refusing to authorize the use of force." But the measure didn't pick up steam, and failed in the Senate by a 51-48 margin Wednesday. However, Republicans Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted alongside their Democratic counterparts for the resolution. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., speaks at a press conference introducing the Assault Weapons Ban of 2025 on April 30, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Trump has suggested that the strikes will continue and told military leaders in September the "military is now the knife's edge in combating this sinister enemy." "We have to put the traffickers and cartels on notice. … If you try to poison our people, we will blow you out of existence, because that's the only language they really understand," Trump told military leaders in Quantico, Virginia, Sept. 30. "That's why you don't see any more boats in the ocean. You don't see any boats around Venezuela. Venezuela asked for the emergency session in a letter sent Thursday to Russia's ambassador to the U.N. and council president, Vassily Nebenzia. After the U.S. military's second strike, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said the episode is part of a larger effort "to intimidate and seek regime change" in Venezuela. The Trump administration has routinely claimed it does not recognize Maduro as a legitimate head of state, and rather, considers him a leader of a drug cartel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fast forward two and half years, and it's Hegseth and Bondi – both now high-ranking Cabinet secretaries under President Donald Trump – who are leading the charge to rein in the First Amendment on the new administration's terms. But Tuesday brought a major and highly symbolic rebuke. Fox News, the very same network on which Hegseth and Bondi spoke back in 2023 and which employed Hegseth at the time, rejected his attempts to control media coverage of the Defense Department he now leads. Fox signed a joint statement along with ABC News, CBS News, CNN, and NBC News that said Hegseth's rules would “restrict journalists' ability to keep the nation and the world informed of important national security issues.” To underscore: This is Hegseth's own former employer saying he's undermining freedom of the press. But this is also increasingly par for the course. Despite the Trump administration's growing efforts to target disfavored speech and media coverage, the First Amendment is showing growing signs of resilience. The administration picked up some real traction by using its leverage in lawsuits against media outlets that decided to settle rather than risk its wrath. But that dynamic could be shifting as Trump employs even blunter methods. But outlets have rightly noted that those restrictions would severely limit what they're allowed to publish. The rules state that credentialed reporters cannot obtain or solicit information that is not explicitly authorized by the Defense Department – even unclassified information. Even a Trump-appointed former Pentagon spokesman who resigned earlier this year has labeled these “Soviet-style restrictions.” And now the media has stood up en masse against it. They also include Newsmax, an even more MAGA outlet than Fox, and other conservative-leaning outlets. The only outlet so far to agree ahead of Hegseth's 5 p.m. deadline is ultra-MAGA One America News. Hegseth must now decide whether to move forward with a policy that's been declared too draconian and anti-free-press even by his former employer and Newsmax. If he does, he will be excluding virtually every media outlet from the halls of an institution that accounts for about 13% of all federal government spending. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr was briefly successful with his threats of regulatory action against ABC, with Kimmel serving a short suspension. Even Trump voters opposed the latter by double digits. The story was similar with Bondi's brief but apparently aborted pushed to target so-called “hate speech” after Kirk's assassination. There's also a growing judicial reckoning over the Trump administration's moves on free speech. Trump also suffered a strong rebuke – at least initially – in his move to bar the Associated Press from key areas of the White House over its refusal to call the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America.” A Trump-nominated judge called it “brazen” and said that “all indicators point to retaliation.” Two Trump-nominated appellate judges later provided the administration an at-least-temporary reprieve, with the full appeals court set to hear oral arguments next month. It indeed remains to be seen how most of these issues will play out. The court cases will proceed with appeals, and the administration's attempts to crack down on disfavored speech will certainly evolve. Trump has made very clear he would like to use all the tools at his disposal to expand his power, and few tools are as effective as being able to control what the media and your opposition say. Trump and his allies have increasingly sought to baselessly paint the left as full of violent and organized radicals who, logic would follow, must be contained. Most strikingly of late, they've talked about the overwhelmingly peaceful “No Kings” protests, which are due to be reprised this weekend, as if they were mass gatherings of antifa and terrorist supporters. So we shouldn't expect this effort to go away. But it's also true that the administration is monkeying with something the American people generally don't want to be monkeyed with. An NPR-PBS News-Marist College poll last month showed nearly 8 in 10 Americans said the US government has generally gone “too far” in restricting free speech. Quinnipiac University polling has also showed a significant rise in pessimism about free speech since Trump was inaugurated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Transportation Security Administration employees leave a security checkpoint during a shift change at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, Thursday, Oct. 2, 2025, in Baltimore. Travelers sit together and wait at the Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, Thursday, Oct. 2, 2025, in Baltimore. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks during a roundtable meeting with President Donald Trump on antifa in the State Dining Room at the White House, Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2025, in Washington. Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (AP) — Some airports around the country are refusing to play a video with a message from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in which she blames Democrats for the federal government shutdown and its impacts on TSA operations because of its political content. Airports in Las Vegas, Charlotte, Atlanta, Phoenix, Seattle and more say the video goes against their airport policy or regulations which prohibit political messaging in their facilities. Various government agencies, in emails to workers and on websites, have adopted language that blames Democrats for the shutdown, with some experts arguing it could be in violation of the 1939 Hatch Act, which restricts certain political activities by federal employees. The shutdown has halted routine operations and left airports scrambling with flight disruptions. Democrats say any deal to reopen the government has to address their health care demands, and Republicans say they won't negotiate until they agree to fund the government. Insurance premiums would double if Congress fails to renew the subsidy payments that expire Dec. 31. In the video, Noem says that TSA's “top priority” is to help make travel pleasant and efficient while keeping passengers safe. “However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay,” she continues. “It's unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship. The Harry Reid International Airport, in Las Vegas, said it had to “remain mindful of the Hatch Act's restrictions.” Westchester County Executive Ken Jenkins said the county north of New York City won't play the video at its local airport. In a statement, he called the video “inappropriate, unacceptable, and inconsistent with the values we expect from our nation's top public officials,” and said its tone is “unnecessarily alarmist” as it relates to operations at Westchester County Airport. “At a time when we should be focused on ensuring stability, collaboration and preparedness, this type of messaging only distracts from the real issues, and undermines public trust,” he said. Even in red states, airports weren't showing the video for various reasons. Salt Lake City International Airport wasn't playing the video because state law prohibits using city-owned property for political purposes, said airport spokesperson Nancy Volmer. The airport in Billings, Montana, “politely declined” even though it has screens that could show the video with audio, assistant aviation director Paul Khera said Tuesday. “We don't want to get in the middle of partisan politics,” Khera said.</p>

Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones takes the witness stand to testify at the Sandy Hook defamation damages trial at Connecticut Superior Court in Waterbury, Conn., Sept. 22, 2022. (Tyler Sizemore/Hearst Connecticut Media via AP, Pool, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and left in place the $1.4 billion judgment against him over his description of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting as a hoax staged by crisis actors. The Infowars host had argued that a judge was wrong to find him liable for defamation and infliction of emotional distress without holding a trial on the merits of allegations lodged by relatives of victims of the shooting, which killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut. The justices did not comment on their order, which they issued without even asking the families of the Sandy Hook victims to respond to Jones' appeal. An FBI agent who responded to the shooting also sued. A lawyer who represents Sandy Hook families said the Supreme Court had properly rejected Jones' “latest desperate attempt to avoid accountability for the harm he has caused.” “We look forward to enforcing the jury's historic verdict and making Jones and Infowars pay for what they have done,” lawyer Christopher Mattei said in a statement. A lawyer representing Jones in the case didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Jones mocked the idea that he has enough money to pay the judgement, saying his studio equipment, including five-year-old cameras, was only worth about $304,000. It's about getting me off the air,” said Jones, who urged his listeners to buy merchandise to keep show running. Jones filed for bankruptcy in late 2022, and his lawyers told the justices that the “plaintiffs have no possible hope of collecting” the entire judgment. He is separately appealing a $49 million judgment in a similar defamation lawsuit in Texas after he failed to turn over documents sought by the parents of another Sandy Hook victim. In the Connecticut case, the judge issued a rare default ruling against Jones and his company in late 2021 because of what she called Jones' repeated failure to abide by court rulings and to turn over certain evidence to the Sandy Hook families. The judge convened a jury to determine how much Jones would owe. The following year, the jury agreed on a $964 million verdict and the judge later tacked on another $473 million in punitive damages against Jones and Free Speech Systems, Infowars' parent company, which is based in Austin, Texas. The attempt to sell off Infowars' assets has moved to a Texas state court in Austin. Jones is now appealing a recent order from the court that appointed a receiver to liquidate the assets. Some of Jones' personal property is also being sold off as part of the bankruptcy case. Associated Press writer Susan Haigh in Hartford, Conn., contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This July 6, 2012 file photo D'Angelo performs at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans. D'Angelo performs during FYF Fest in Los Angeles on Aug. 23, 2015. D'Angelo performs during FYF Fest at L.A. Memorial Sports Arena & Exposition Park in Los Angeles, Aug. 23, 2015. D'Angelo, the Grammy-winning R&B singer recognized by his raspy yet smooth voice and for garnering mainstream attention with the  shirtless “Untitled (How Does It Feel)” music video, has died. The singer, whose real name was Michael Eugene Archer, died Tuesday after a long bout with cancer, his family said in a statement. It called him “a shining star of our family and has dimmed his light for us in this life,” adding that they are “eternally grateful for the legacy of extraordinarily moving music he leaves behind.” In his music, D'Angelo blended hip-hop grit, emphatic soul and gospel-rooted emotion into a sound that helped spearhead the neo-soul movement of the 1990s. D'Angelo's sultry vocal style — a mix of raspy texture and church-bred fluidity — set him apart from his peers. That voice became inseparable from the striking visuals of his 2000 single “Untitled (How Does It Feel).” The minimalist, shirtless music video became a cultural touchstone, igniting conversations around artistry, sexuality and vulnerability in Black male representation. “(Musicians) have gotten trapped into that mode of thinking marketable and commercial. That same year, D'Angelo reflected on his need for solitude amid fame: “I used to hang out a lot, but now I've become more of a recluse,” he told AP. Beyond his own catalog, D'Angelo's artistry shined in collaborations. He memorably duetted with Lauryn Hill on the soulful ballad “Nothing Even Matters,” a highlight of her landmark 1998 album “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” He also contributed to The Roots' 1996 album “Illadelph Halflife” and was part of the supergroup Black Men United, which yielded one song: “U Will Know,” which D'Angelo wrote and co-produced, for the film “Jason's Lyric” in 1994. “I remember hearing your music for the first time… I said to myself damn whoever this is they are anointed,” Jamie Foxx said on social media. “Then when I finally got a chance to see you… Like everyone when they saw the most incredible music video of our time… I was blown away… I thought to myself I have to see this person in concert… I had my chance to see you at the house of blues… You came out and got right down to business… Your voice was silky and flawless… I was graciously envious of your style and your swag…” Years before stepping back from public view, D'Angelo's life and music were closely intertwined with Grammy-nominated R&B singer Angie Stone in the '90s. Stone once described D'Angelo as her “musical soul mate,” to the AP in 1999, adding that their working relationship was “'like milk and cereal …. It's something that I have not been able to do with any other producer or musician.” They had a son together, the artist Swayvo Twain, born Michael Archer Jr. Stone died earlier this year in a car crash. After “Voodoo,” he withdrew from the spotlight for more than a decade, fueling speculation about personal struggles and creative battles. His long-awaited return came in 2014 with “Black Messiah,” credited to D'Angelo and The Vanguard. The urgent and politically charged album that arrived amid nationwide protests and helped usher in a wave of activist music responding to police killings of Black Americans and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. 5 on the Billboard 200 chart and won him a Grammy for best R&B album, reaffirming his stature as a generational voice. Its standout single, “Really Love,” earned him another Grammy for best R&B song and earned a nomination for record of the year. In May, D'Angelo withdrew from being a headliner for the 2025 Roots Picnic in Philadelphia due to “an unforeseen medical delay regarding surgery (he) had earlier this year,” the artists shared in a statement. D'Angelo said he was advised the performance “could further complicate matters.” Beyond his biggest singles, D'Angelo's catalog includes fan favorites like “Me and Those Dreamin' Eyes of Mine,” “Cruisin'” and “Devil's Pie.” His influence stretched far beyond the charts: he inspired a wave of artists including Maxwell, Alicia Keys and Frank Ocean.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd, right, talks to referee Brent Haskill (92) during the second half of a preseason NBA basketball game against the Oklahoma City Thunder in Fort Worth, Texas, Monday, Oct. 6, 2025. Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Kenny Atkinson, right, argues with a referee during the first half of an NBA basketball preseason game against the Chicago Bulls in Chicago, Thursday, Oct. 9, 2025. The NBA has a relatively new tool called “automated officiating,” and the robotic eyes that are now tracking just about everything on basketball courts showed that James was nowhere near committing offensive basket interference on that play. It wasn't needed to decide matters in that case — again, the humans got it right — but the NBA is tapping into technology more and more to ensure that plays like those get adjudicated correctly. “Turns out, computers are really good at this,” said Evan Wasch, an NBA executive vice president overseeing basketball strategy and analytics. “One, the accuracy on those calls, by definition, goes up. But we also free up the human referees to not have to focus on those calls and in turn allow them to focus more closely on the really difficult judgment plays that they're so adept at and actually increase accuracy there, too. Basketball, of course, is not alone in veering toward higher-tech officiating. Robot umpires are getting called up to Major League Baseball next season; humans will still make the calls, but teams can challenge ball or strike calls and an automated system will determine if those challenges were successful. Many major tennis tournaments, even Wimbledon, have replaced line judges with electronic line-calling. Soccer has technology to tell referees if a ball fully crossed a goal line or if someone was offsides, calls that in real time might just be guesswork. It's important to note that NBA referees are not being replaced. Technology is just helping; instead of six human eyes on a court, it's now six human eyes and a whole lot of camera lenses that are there to collect as much data as the league can think of. “Let's get it right,” Milwaukee coach Doc Rivers said. Using technology helps with game flow thanks to shorter review times, helps with the accuracy and also provides transparency in the ability to show fans and players computer-generated images to explain how calls were made. Cameras in arenas are helping to precisely make calls such as the ones along sidelines and baselines — who was a ball off, was it out of bounds, that sort of thing — as well as determining if blocked shots were good or was goaltending committed on those plays. “What we're doing is tracking a bunch of objects in space with incredible precision,” Wasch said. We're tracking them in space with cameras and sensors. And there's an element of machine learning and artificial intelligence to build those algorithms on top of that to then know what in fact happened from a basketball perspective based on the movement of all those things.” The technology isn't limited to calls or non-calls. Some referees have been wearing earpieces during this preseason as the league tinkers with ways for better communication methods. There's been talk at the league of sending alerts to smartwatches about decisions on calls. And at summer league this year, there was even a sensor placed inside the ball to help collect data. Hundreds of players used the ball, which typically weighs somewhere around 600 grams; nobody noticed that it was about a gram heavier than usual. “It lets them focus on the things that they train for this job to do.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Iranian lower court handed heavy prison sentences to two French citizens charged with spying for France and Israel, the semi-official Fars news agency reported on Tuesday, a week after Paris and Tehran indicated progress in talks to release them. Cecile Kohler and her partner Jacques Paris are the only two French citizens being held in Iran and have been detained since 2022. An 18-year-old French-German cyclist arrested this year, Lennart Monterlos, was released last week after a court acquitted him of espionage charges. Without specifically naming the defendants, the court sentenced one French citizen to six years in prison for spying on behalf of France, five years in prison on charges of conspiracy to commit a crime against national security, and 20 years of imprisonment for assisting Israeli intelligence services. The other defendant was handed 10 years in prison for spying on behalf of France, five years in prison on charges of conspiracy to commit a crime against national security, and 17 years of imprisonment for assisting Israeli intelligence services. The two defendants can appeal their sentences to a higher court. France has repeatedly accused Iran of holding Kohler and Paris arbitrarily, keeping them in conditions akin to torture in Tehran's Evin prison and not allowing proper consular protection. Iran has accused France of arbitrarily detaining Mahdieh Esfandiari, an Iranian student living in the French city of Lyon, who was arrested this year over anti-Israel social media posts. Iran's judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir said on Tuesday that accusations against Esfandyari were baseless and that France had refused to release her temporarily on bail. Iran's Revolutionary Guards have detained dozens of foreign and dual nationals in recent years, often on espionage-related charges. Rights groups and Western countries accuse Tehran of using foreign detainees as bargaining chips, which Iran denies.</p>

She says children's media is very different from how it used to be. “I grew up in the 1980s when we would go watch Saturday morning cartoons all huddled together while my parents slept,” she told Vox. “There was a time and a place when technology could be watched, and that's what's really different about today. Now we have endless content on-demand and we have marketplaces and platforms where these pieces of content are competing for kids' attention.” Radesky has tools for parents when it comes to best practices for kids and their media consumption. Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Radesky, edited for length and clarity. Can you rank the best children's media out there? It could be quality for lovely storytelling that's meaningful to a child. The really best stuff, the stuff that is clearly made with some care and some thoughtfulness is still [like] Sesame Street, the PBS kids stuff like Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, and then there's some newcomers like Bluey and Ms. Rachel. They tell stories that are meaningful to a child's experience, and that is one way that we define good content: It is reflecting back the world that children are in to children and helping them make meaning of it. We also code for things like designs that just try to capture attention. We call this “bedazzling,” just this extra stuff that's on a YouTube video but often is kind of shallow and gimmicky attention-grabbing content. [For this reason] I'd say AI-generated slop is definitely at the bottom. If you ever see a video that just looks like a computer-generated bunch of cars being driven by Spider-Man and Elsa and the Hulk crashing into a whole bunch of soccer balls, that's the worst and not worth your kids' time and attention. It's all the gimmicky things that kids want to click on so that's why it trends in the algorithm and those videos have billions of views. So we've mentioned some of the greatest hits, but I have to ask about Cocomelon. Where does Cocomelon fall in the spectrum of children's entertainment? To speak like my 16-year-old son: Cocomelon's pretty mid. Even kids need conflict in their media! We've done a little bit of research comparing when kids read off a print book versus a tablet or when they play physical games versus digital games. Kids create much more of what we called “solitary space” around a tablet. There's so much informal learning that children do in early childhood, and we can really teach kids that media is for sharing. It's not for when each of us is stressed out and doesn't want to talk to each other. Make it predictable, make it shared if you can, or at least in a shared space so you can monitor. Also, make it not just whenever your child is fussing. If your child is used to being calmed down or managed behaviorally by media, that could create a dependence. Early childhood is such a great opportunity for kids to learn other emotional awareness and coping skills. Here's how to really think about it. ﻿Why are so many young men turning toward fatherhood?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democratic New York mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani expressed confidence that he is leading a “movement that won the battle for the soul of the Democratic Party” in a progressive-packed rally Monday. Mamdani spoke alongside embattled New York Attorney General Letitia James, former Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Lina Khan, and a host of other progressive Democrats in Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood. The state assemblyman is battling with former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa to become the city's next mayor. The Democratic Socialists of America member got his hits in on President Donald Trump while rallying his movement, which showed up over 3,000 strong at the event. We are not afraid of our own ideas. For too long, we have tried not to lose. Mamdani shocked New York political observers when he beat Cuomo in the June Democratic primary, signaling that the city wanted a definitive change instead of a return to the establishment. James has been a prominent Mamdani ally, even before his primary victory. In speaking to a raucous crowd, she said that she expects them all to have one another's backs. City Councilman Chi Osse said he believes Mamdani's socialist movement will prevail. “Understand that this election is to be part of a political revolution that continues inside and outside the halls of government,” he said. DSA member and New York state Sen. Kristen Gonzalez said Mamdani's movement wants “a mandate” to implement its agenda. Mamdani is expected to win the November election, but Cuomo is also expected to place more pressure on Sliwa to drop out so that he can gather the opposition support against the socialist. The first mayoral debate is on Thursday. “Between a city you can afford or more of the same,” he concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An unusual double-ring structure spotted in space with the help of citizen scientists has turned out to be a cosmic rarity. Odd radio circles, also known as ORCs, likely consist of magnetized plasma — charged gas that is strongly influenced by magnetic fields — and are so massive that entire galaxies reside at their centers. But they are also incredibly faint, and usually detectable only through radio light. It's also only the second odd radio circle that has two rings. “ORCs are among the most bizarre and beautiful cosmic structures we've ever seen — and they may hold vital clues about how galaxies and black holes co-evolve, hand-in-hand,” wrote Hota,  an assistant professor at the University of Mumbai's department of atomic energy's Centre for Excellence in Basic Sciences, in an email. Odd radio circles were first discovered about six years ago, but the structures remain largely elusive. Astronomers train users to recognize patterns in faint, fuzzy patches of radio waves and analyze astronomical images, Hota explained. It is the largest and most sensitive radio telescope operating at low frequencies. While RAD@home participants weren't specifically trained to look for odd radio circles, the unusual double-ring structure stood out, marking the first odd radio circle identified using LOFAR. The rings appear to intersect which researchers believe is because of our vantage point from Earth, but they are likely separated in space. Astronomers offer an explosive origin theory for giant odd radio circles in space “This work shows how professional astronomers and citizen scientists together can push the boundaries of scientific discovery,” Hota said. Astronomers once thought the odd radio circles might be the throats of wormholes, shockwaves from black hole collisions or merging galaxies, or powerful jets pumping out energetic particles. “We suggest that a major explosive event took place in the central galaxy,” Hota said. “The resulting shock or blast wave could have re-energised ancient clouds of magnetised plasma, making them glow again as radio rings.” A new shockwave essentially illuminated “smoke” left behind by the galaxy's past activity, he added. Black holes don't directly gobble up stars, gas and dust. Instead, that material falls into a rotating disk around the black hole. The powerful magnetic fields around black holes help channel these energetic, superheated particles away from black holes in jets that nearly reach the speed of light. Both odd radio circles are in galaxies that sit within larger clusters of galaxies, meaning the jets launching from their supermassive black holes interact with surrounding hot plasma that could help shape the radio rings, Hota said. “These discoveries show that ORCs and radio rings are not isolated curiosities — they are part of a broader family of exotic plasma structures shaped by black hole jets, winds, and their environments,” said study coauthor Dr. Pratik Dabhade, assistant professor in the astrophysics division of the National Centre For Nuclear Research in Warsaw, Poland, in a statement. Image reveals unprecedented view of the third interstellar object observed passing through our solar system “ORCs are really hard to find, but we know there must be hundreds in the data,” Norris said. “By studying them across different cosmic times, we can begin to reveal how such energetic outbursts influence the surrounding gas and trigger or suppress star formation,” Hota noted. Many questions linger about odd radio circles, including why astronomers only see them at such large sizes. Hota and Dabhade want to know whether the circles expand from smaller bubbles that are undetectable. And if odd radio circles do spring from the mergers of galaxies or supermassive black holes, why aren't they spotted more frequently? The help of citizen scientists, and next-generation telescopes like the transcontinental Square Kilometre Array in South Africa and Australia, will be needed to answer such questions. Astronomers find fresh clues of hidden world in our solar system Even though these dishes and antennas will be in two different parts of the world, they will form one telescope with more than 1 million square meters (386,102 square miles) of collecting area, allowing astronomers to survey the entire sky much more quickly than ever before.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court denied a last-ditch effort on Tuesday by controversial InfoWars founder Alex Jones to overturn a $1.4 billion judgment against him for false claims he made about the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The high court did not elaborate on its decision to reject Jones's petition for review, which was widely believed to be a long shot. The Supreme Court's order comes days after Jones had asked the justices to pause the judgment against him pending their decision on his petition, a request that is now moot. Jones was ordered by a Connecticut jury in 2022 to pay the more than $1 billion judgment after falsely claiming the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 26 people were killed, was a hoax. The families of victims successfully sued Jones for the harm his false statements about the massacre caused them, with multiple appeals courts rejecting Jones's attempts to toss the ruling. Jones's bid at the Supreme Court was his last chance to stop the judgment from being handed down. Jones's lawyer had argued the high court was “obligated to make its own independent evaluation of the entire record here, which can only be done” by reviewing the case, claiming the lower courts in Connecticut had not properly ensured the families had proven Jones committed actual malice with his comments. Facing the prospect of paying the significant judgment, Jones filed for bankruptcy in 2022, and the courts then sought to take control and sell off his assets to pay the families. Last year, a bankruptcy judge rejected a bid from satirical news outlet the Onion to buy Jones's InfoWars, citing the lack of transparency and uneven playing field in the bid process. Jones's lawyers said in filings to the Supreme Court that the families “have no possible hope of collecting all” of the $1.4 billion judgment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several U.S. airports will not show Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem‘s video about the government shutdown‘s effects on travel out of concern that it violates the Hatch Act. The refusing airports include those in Portland, Oregon; Buffalo, New York; Seattle, Washington; Los Angeles, California; Charlotte, North Carolina; Cleveland, Ohio; Phoenix, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada, according to a Newsweek report. “It is TSA's top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience possible while we keep you safe. However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay,” Noem says in the video. “We did not consent to playing the video in its current form, as we believe the Hatch Act clearly prohibits use of public assets for political purposes and messaging,” Hansen said. We believe consenting to playing this video on Port assets would violate Oregon law.” The Hatch Act was passed in 1939 “to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, and to ensure that federal employees are advanced based on merit and not based on political affiliation,” according to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel. It's unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship. Portland officials haven't shied away from criticizing the White House lately. There have also been several protests outside Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. Several federal agencies have included website banners that blame Democrats, and several federal agencies' out-of-office email messages also blamed Democrats for the shutdown.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE — GE Aerospace is launching a new $30 million initiative to bolster the industry's workforce in alignment with an April executive order signed by President Donald Trump. Trump's order, titled “Preparing Americans for High-Paying Skilled Trade Jobs of the Future,” directs the administration to produce a report within 90 days outlining “opportunities to integrate systems and realign resources to address critical workforce needs.” Christian Meisner, chief human resources officer for GE Aerospace, suggested to the Washington Examiner that the new initiative, a series of multiyear grants distributed across a five-year window, will not only benefit GE but also the entire American aerospace industry. White House officials chose not to comment on GE Aerospace's Tuesday morning announcement. GE Aerospace previously invested a million dollars into AMTEP in February of this year. Those same officials explained that while the company has expanded its manufacturing workforce beyond pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, the same can't be said of many of their suppliers. “We're only as good as our supply base, and so part of the thinking here is helping develop the kind of next generation workers for us, yes, but frankly, just as much for our supply base,” one official said. Furthermore, GE Aerospace officials likened the initial investment to a pilot program, saying they expect other industry players to become involved after the launch. “And so this is one of those things where I think people would love to help. GE Aerospace Chairman and CEO Larry Culp is expected to speak on the new program Tuesday morning in Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Douglas Jackson, a service-disabled veteran who was laid off during Friday's federal government layoffs, couldn't believe it when he heard the vice president say the Trump administration was being forced to choose between Americans and “federal bureaucrats.” I'm not a DC bureaucrat,” he told CNN, just days after the White House sent reduction in force — or RIF — notices to more than 3,500 federal workers. Jackson, who served in the Marines for four years during which he was exposed to burn pits in Iraq, described a feeling of disgust and betrayal when he heard President Donald Trump say most of those laid off “happen to be Democrat-oriented.” “There's no way he could know our party affiliation,” Jackson said, noting he's not registered with either party and has voted for Democrats and Republicans alike. The 40-year-old had been reinstated earlier this year to his public affairs job in the IRS' Large Business and International Division after being cut as part of the Department of Government Efficiency's downsizing. The Trump administration pulled the trigger on layoffs across seven federal agencies on Friday, dismissing employees who handle a wide range of topics — from IRS matters like those Jackson works on to housing grants, special education programs and defending the country against cyberattacks. Another wave of RIFs could be on their way, the administration said in a court filing. The White House Office of Management and Budget advised agencies in late September that the shutdown would provide an opportunity to cut programs that are deemed “not consistent” with Trump's priorities. Trump doubled down late Friday afternoon, saying that he plans to fire “a lot” of federal workers in retaliation for the government shutdown, vowing to target those deemed to be aligned with the Democratic Party. However, budget experts pointed to several reasons why Vance's statement wasn't true. Among them, many federal workers aren't being paid during the shutdown, so laying them off wouldn't free up any funds — plus, if they were being paid, the money wouldn't be available for 60 days, when most must actually leave their jobs, said Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress and a former OMB official during the Biden administration. Also, the Trump administration last week said it will extend WIC's funding using tariff revenue. What's more, any funds saved by laying off several thousand federal employees would be only a tiny fraction of what's needed to fund WIC and the military, said Michael Linden, a former senior OMB official during the Biden administration who is now a senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. Meanwhile, AFGE, along with another union representing federal workers, filed a lawsuit in a California federal court seeking to stop the Trump administration from initiating the mass layoffs, calling them illegal. She has yet to rule on the request. “It creates uncertainty for everyone affected, and I don't know how this stands up in court.” At least 1,300 IRS employees received RIF notices last week, according to a source familiar with the matter. The source familiar with the program told CNN, “This was our organization within HR looking at improving and modernizing our training.” The division “contains programs, projects or activities that are inconsistent with the Administration's priorities,” according to a memo obtained by CNN. The letter added that, as a result, the office “will be undergoing a major reorganization, and your position may be reassigned to another organization, transferred to another function, or abolished.” The office is responsible for assessing how the department's energy programs, policies and regulations affect minority communities. HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD), which oversees grants to support low-income communities, housing and homelessness programs, also faces workforce reductions. “During the last administration, CISA was focused on censorship, branding, and electioneering. This is part of getting CISA back on mission,” an agency spokeswoman told CNN. Employees at the EPA's Office of Land and Emergency Management received intent to RIF notices on Friday. The division focuses on hazardous waste cleanup and responding to hazardous waste sites, including overseeing the Brownfields program that helps states clean up and reuse previously contaminated sites. “It is appalling that the Trump administration is using the government shutdown as an excuse to fire federal workers, including dedicated EPA employees who provide critical services to communities across the country,” Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238 said in a Friday statement. Workers who had been laid off included employees who oversaw battery recycling and safety, plastics reduction, data collection on national solid waste data collection and recycling grants, Chen said. Reached for comment on Friday, an EPA spokesperson said, “It's unfortunate that Democrats have chosen to shut down the government and brought about this outcome. The Education Department has cut nearly all of its staff that handles special education, multiple sources within the agency tell CNN. The office supports programs that serve millions of children, youth and adults with disabilities nationwide. Linda McMahon is dismantling the Education Department — but first she'll help make school ‘patriotic' again A Department of Education spokesperson told CNN that “some” of the office's employees will be impacted but would not answer specifics about how many would be affected overall. Around 1,300 workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received layoff notices late Friday night, but approximately 700 were reinstated on Saturday, according to AFGE. Among reinstated employees are staff that publish the agency's flagship journal, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report; the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; the Global Health Center; and the Public Health Infrastructure Center, which manages more than $3 billion in grants to 107 state and local governments to help build local public health workforces. Also, staff and officers at the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service who were able to check their emails received notices that their firings were in error.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? ﻿Maybe we don't want to centralize power over elections in this particular federal government? The law was America's first serious attempt since Reconstruction to build a multiracial democracy, and it succeeded beyond even the most radical post-Civil War Republicans' dreams. Two years after the VRA became law, that rate was 60 percent. But it also rests on assumptions about how power is distributed in the United States that may no longer be true. The central problem that the VRA targeted was illiberal states, ruled by white supremacists determined to cut Black Americans out of political power. In addition to the Voting Rights Act, Johnson signed laws banning race discrimination in employment, schools, hotels, restaurants, theaters, and housing. So it made sense that his signature voting rights law centralizes power in the federal government. One key provision, which the Republican justices effectively repealed in 2013, required states with a history of race discrimination in elections to “preclear” any new election laws with federal officials in Washington, DC. Another, which is now before the Supreme Court in Louisiana v. Callais, allows federal judges to intervene when a state enacts a law that “results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any US citizen to vote on account of race or color.” The central premise of the VRA, in other words, was that federal officials in both the executive and judicial branches could be trusted to pursue the goal of racial equality in elections — without regard to which political party would benefit if this goal became a reality. It is tough to argue that this premise still holds today. How else can one explain Trump's extraordinary winning streak in the Supreme Court? Chief Justice John Roberts, in particular, crusaded against the law for nearly half a century. If Roberts and his fellow Republican justices strike down the VRA, their party is likely to benefit. Moreover, while racial gerrymandering is a separate legal concept from partisan gerrymandering (which occurs when the majority party draws maps to reduce representation by the minority party) the two concepts are intertwined. This is especially true in states with large numbers of Black voters. Thus, in the likely event that the VRA's restrictions on racial gerrymandering fall, it will be easier for red states — especially in the South — to eliminate districts that elect Democrats of color and replace them with districts that elect white Republicans. In the South in particular, many red state congressional delegations could become entirely white, as the Republican state legislature draws new maps that deny representation to (predominantly Black) Democrats. The Court's Republican majority frequently applies one set of rules to abortion opponents, and another, more favorable set of rules to the religious right. The Voting Rights Act's language is quite broad, and unscrupulous judges could easily manipulate it to partisan ends. Democrats, in other words, may need to rethink whether it makes sense to centralize power over something as important as elections in a federal government that is increasingly controlled by illiberal Republicans eager to entrench their own rule. That case set the framework for when federal judges should strike down legislative maps because they dilute minority representation — and it grew out of a political fight that Roberts lost. Thus, even if a Voting Rights Act plaintiff cannot prove that a particular state law was motivated by racism, the law may still violate the VRA if it has a negative impact on minority representation. The amended VRA's language is sufficiently broad that illiberal judges could easily read it to achieve much more nefarious ends. Although Roberts was one of several White House and Justice Department officials who tried to convince Reagan to veto this amendment, Reagan signed it into law in 1982. In Gingles, the Court considered what impact the 1982 amendments had on claims that a state's congressional or state legislative maps unlawfully prevented voters of color from electing their preferred candidates. And the Court's answer to that question was fairly ingenious. But it primarily turns on two questions: 1) whether a state is residentially segregated by race; and 2) whether the states' voters are racially polarized, meaning that voters of one race tend to vote for one party while voters of another race tend to vote for the other party. The genius of Brennan's approach is that it recognized that, when residential segregation and racial polarization coexist, they produce two separate political communities who will consistently vote for opposing candidates. Thus, to ensure that both communities are represented, Gingles held that judges must sometimes redraw a state's legislative maps if the state's original maps dilute a minority community's representation. The 1982 amendments' language — which, again, prohibits a state law that “results” in someone being denied the right to vote because of their race — is open-ended. But it is also safe to say that the elaborate framework Brennan laid out in Gingles does not inexorably flow from the Voting Rights Act's broadly worded text. And so he read the VRA in light of this historical purpose. But the amended VRA's language is sufficiently broad that illiberal judges could easily read it to achieve much more nefarious ends. Lots of state election laws will, at least at the margins, have a disproportionate impact on one race or another. A MAGA judge could simply read the Voting Rights Act to strike down laws that have even the slightest negative impact on white Republican voters, perhaps stating that they are the racial and political class that needs protection from discriminatory maps. Meanwhile, the same judge could uphold state laws that have much greater negative impacts on racial groups that favor Democrats. Such a judge might even order blue states to draw maps that maximize congressional representation for white Republicans. Indeed, this scenario isn't even particularly far-fetched, as the current Supreme Court often gives favorable treatment to Republicans and to causes that are favored by the Republican Party. As I laid out in detail here, the Supreme Court's Republican majority applied one set of rules to Joe Biden and a better set of rules to Donald Trump, and they applied one set of rules to abortion providers and another, less favorable set of rules, to abortion opponents. So they could just as easily apply the Voting Rights Act selectively to strike down state laws that supposedly burden white Republicans — while simultaneously blessing voting restrictions that target racial groups that tend to favor Democrats. In fairness, the current crop of Republican justices have largely resisted this temptation. The Republican justices' decision in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), for example, effectively neutralized the VRA's provision requiring certain states to preclear new election laws with federal officials. But that could change overnight if Trump gets to fill more seats on the Supreme Court. While Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett may not want to use the Voting Rights Act to lock their political party into power, it's easy to imagine a Supreme Court staffed by MAGA judges like Andrew Oldham, James Ho, Aileen Cannon, and Emil Bove doing so. For a window into how many younger Republican judges approach election cases, consider Oldham's opinion in Republican National Committee v. Wetzel (2024), which was joined by Ho. Trump and his Republican Party have targeted mailed ballots because, in recent elections, Democrats were more likely to cast a ballot by mail than Republicans. It's difficult to even find a legal argument in Oldham's opinion. But he does spend three whole sentences claiming that Congress's decision to set an election date implicitly requires state election officials to know how many ballots they need to count by the end of that day. He cites no legal authority that supports this argument. Wetzel shows just how far the next generation of Republican judges are willing to stretch the law to lock their party into power. If they can read a law setting an election date as a license to toss Democratic ballots in the trash, imagine what they could do with the open-ended language of the VRA. It was a strong Union that defeated the Confederate states and ended slavery. And it was a strong federal government that enacted laws like the Voting Rights Act, which broke the back of Jim Crow. If American democracy survives the second Trump administration, and if Democrats do regain power in a future election, they must reckon with the question of whether too much power is concentrated in the federal government. The first major lawsuit seeking to repeal Obamacare, for example, was at least nominally rooted in an appeal to federalism. Republicans claimed that only the states, and not the federal government, can require people to buy health insurance — even though the federal government has long taxed Americans to pay for federal health insurance programs such as Medicare or Medicaid. But federalism is also one of the most important checks on Trump's attempts to consolidate his authoritarian rule. Trump, for example, is pressuring Republican states to redraw their congressional maps to lock Democrats out of power in the US House — something Texas has already done. And blue states like California may enact their own gerrymanders to balance out the impact of the new Texas maps. In an alternative version of the United States where congressional maps were drawn by Congress, by contrast, the GOP could redraw the maps in all 50 states to maximize their own power. At a minimum, states having the power to draw their own maps prevents Congress or the president from manipulating maps in Democratic-controlled states to Republicans' benefit. Similarly, another important check on federal power is that the US government does not actually employ very many law enforcement officers. And, under the Supreme Court's “anti-commandeering” doctrine, the federal government is not allowed to take control over state or local police — or, at least, it cannot do so without the state's consent. So this aspect of US federalism prevents Trump from transforming every beat cop in America into his own personal enforcement squad. Right now, liberals and Democrats — at least at the federal level — can only watch in impotent horror as Trump tries to become an American Viktor Orbán. And the federal judiciary, which is supposed to be the Constitution's last defense against an aspiring dictator, is led by a Supreme Court dominated by Republicans who've acted like sycophants toward Trump. But, if American democracy survives the second Trump administration, and if Democrats do regain power in a future election, they must reckon with the question of whether too much power is concentrated in the federal government. Perhaps, by 2028, American voters will be so sick of MAGA Republicanism that they will give Democrats the power to do something even President Franklin D. Roosevelt couldn't accomplish at the height of his power and popularity: packing the Court with more Democratic justices to dilute the votes of its current Republican majority. The federal judiciary is likely to be controlled by highly partisan Republicans for decades. And that sad reality, at the very least, requires liberals and Democrats to confront the question of whether we can still have nice things — at least when those nice things depend on the premise that federal judges can be trusted. ﻿New political science research suggests democracy can survive leaders like Trump.
