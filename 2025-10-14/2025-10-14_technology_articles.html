                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No, your new “AI PC” or “Copilot+ PC” is not great at running AI—at least, not with any amount of compute that matters. Nvidia, which became a trillion-dollar company thanks to AI, is now asking you to stick an ounce of that cloud on your desk. Nvidia first announced its $4,000 DGX Spark AI compute machine, then dubbed “Project Digits,” during CES 2025. While CEO Jensen Huang was talking up the AI and graphics capabilities of the firm's RTX 50-series GPUs, Spark was being pushed elsewhere on the floor as an at-home device built specifically for high-end AI workloads. The company went so far as to call it a “new class of computer” in its announcement post—despite the fact that it's powered by a Blackwell chip, an architecture that shows up across several other Nvidia lines. The DGX Spark is set to start shipping on Wednesday. Nvidia's usual partners like Acer, Asus, Lenovo, MSI, Dell, and Gigabyte are already lined up to put out their own versions of the device. You may not find those products when roaming the sparse halls of your nearest Best Buy, but Nvidia said it will ship them to Micro Center stores in the U.S. Nvidia made a big deal of handing out Sparks to major companies like OpenAI and Microsoft, as well as to Elon Musk at the Starbase headquarters in Texas. Maybe the billionaire founder of xAI will plug it in and use it to vibe code that AI-centric “Wokipedia” competitor—which he promised would help people “understand the universe.” I saw both Nvidia's and Acer's versions of Spark at IFA 2025. Spark runs a customized, Ubuntu-based Linux distribution loaded with several of Nvidia's AI tools for AI image models and LLMs, or large language models. If all that mattered was core count, the Spark would tie Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070, one of its lower-end GPUs. On its face, those specs don't sound very “supercomputer.” But inside, you'll find much more performance and power draw than a typical desktop PC. Its Blackwell chip promises 1 petaflop of AI compute performance, which is many times more than the 170 teraflops Nvidia's 2016 DGX-1 AI compute machine offers, though it's worth noting that flops, a measure of how fast a GPU can perform a certain number of floating point operations per second, are a rough metric. For another loose example of AI compute capability, the DGX Spark promises to perform around 1,000 TOPS, or trillions of operations per second. For comparison, Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme chip is supposed to be much better for AI than its predecessor, thanks to a redesigned neural processing unit, but that can only claim 70 TOPS of AI performance. Don't worry: Nvidia doesn't expect every Joe Schmoe to buy one of these for the sake of running Windows 11 Recall. The DGX Spark is built for nascent AI developers, students, or, perhaps, curious AI dabblers who can afford to drop the equivalent of two $2,000 RTX 5090 GPUs to buy a specialized computer. Its real mission is to get more developers to create AI applications that people actually want to use—or, in Huang's words, “the next wave of breakthroughs.” Hopefully, that'll take the form of something beyond a chatbot interface promising to fix home decoration or remedy the abstract concept of loneliness. Good thing it's only the entire economy propped up by this right now. Nevada could've fined the company more than $3 million, but regulators are seeking a reduced penalty of $242,800, citing an “extraordinary number of violations.” Maingear's new PC puts an extra premium on its pretty build, but it's a damn nice desktop besides.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palmer Luckey and Mark Zuckerberg never quite cracked virtual reality headsets for consumers, but they're taking another crack at it with the US military as their new audience. On Monday, Luckey's military tech company Anduril announced its AI-powered mixed reality system EagleEye, which will put hardware right into the helmets of Army soldiers and provide them with a heads-up display to view information in real-time. “The idea of an AI partner embedded in your display has been imagined for decades. According to Anduril, EagleEye is a modular system that includes configurations for helmets, visors, and glasses. The company also claims its system will balance weight by reducing the “bulk of traditional night vision goggles” while introducing sensors “aligned with a warfighter's center of gravity.” The helmet module, notably, gives soldiers tactical cat ears. Frankly, we live in a time where it's entirely impossible to know if that is the most efficient design for the effort or if it's just another CEO with the sense of humor of a 13-year-old doing a multi-million dollar meme, a la Elon Musk running a government project named after a memecoin or making Tesla models spell out the word “SEXY.” Luckey used the announcement that his company was taking over a multi-billion-dollar mixed-reality goggles contract with the Army earlier this year to re-create his famous and meme-ified TIME Magazine cover, so it's not like he's above that kind of thing. The heads-up display is perhaps the most marketable part of Anduril's project, which was made in part with the help of Mark Zuckerberg and Meta, and the company showed it off with a preview video that looks like it was ripped right out of Call of Duty. EagleEye is something of a culmination of Anduril's work on the Army's Soldier Borne Mission Command (SBMC) and Soldier Borne Mission Command–Architecture (SBMC-A) programs, which is a rebrand of the Integrated Visual Augmentation System the company took over from Microsoft. Last month, the Army announced that Luckey's Anduril and Mark Zuckerberg's Meta received contracts from the Army to produce prototype mixed-reality combat goggles. We'll see if they have any other plans to UwU-fiy the military. Turns out a lot of people's creativity is limited to what someone else has already made. Zelda Williams has had enough of the "horrible TikTok slop."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study published on Monday found that communications from cellphone carriers, retailers, banks, and even militaries are being broadcast unencrypted through geostationary satellites. They found that roughly half of the signals they analyzed were transmitting unencrypted data, potentially exposing everything from phone calls and military logistics to a retail chain's inventory. “There is a clear mismatch between how satellite customers expect data to be secured and how it is secured in practice,” the researchers wrote in their paper titled “Don't Look Up: There Are Sensitive Internal Links in the Clear on GEO Satellites.” The findings are also being presented this week at an Association for Computing Machinery conference in Taiwan. “They assumed that no one was ever going to check and scan all these satellites and see what was out there. “They just really didn't think anyone would look up.” Even more surprisingly, the researchers didn't need any fancy spy gear to collect this data. Altogether, the system cost roughly $750 and was installed on a university building in La Jolla, San Diego. With their simple setup, the researchers were able to collect a wide range of communication data, including phone calls, texts, in-flight Wi-Fi data from airline passengers, and signals from electric utilities. When it came to telecoms, specifically, the team collected phone numbers, calls, and texts from customers of T-Mobile, AT&T Mexico, and Telmex. For instance, remote towers in desert regions of the U.S. connect to a satellite, which then relays signals to the carrier's core network. This extra internal step is known as backhaul traffic and was found unencrypted in some cases by the team. It only took the team nine hours to collect the phone numbers of over 2,700 T-Mobile users, along with some of their calls and text messages. “T-Mobile immediately addressed a vendor's technical misconfiguration that affected a limited number of cell sites using geosynchronous satellite backhaul in remote, low-population areas, as identified in this research from 2024,” T-Mobile said in an emailed statement to Gizmodo. “This was not network-wide, is unrelated to our T-Satellite direct-to-cell offering, and we implemented nationwide Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) encryption for all customers to further protect signaling traffic as it travels between mobile handsets and the network core, including call set up, numbers dialed and text message content. We appreciate our collaboration with the security research community, whose work helps reinforce our ongoing commitment to protecting customer data and enhances security across the industry.” Additionally, the team obtained unencrypted internet communications from US military sea vessels and even communications regarding narcotics trafficking from Mexican military and law enforcement. The team said it has notified all affected parties about the security flaws, and several have already confirmed that they have deployed a fix. While encrypting data can be an extra cost, it's worth it for some companies when the economics are clear, like satellite TV providers protecting themselves from piracy. But for other organizations, encryption can reduce efficiency and impact service reliability. Other times, encryption can simply be turned off by mistake, but the overall system keeps working without indicating that the data is no longer protected. Flock Safety's high-tech drones designed for cops are now being offered to private security firms. Neon wants use the calls to train AI, but a security concern forced it to go offline, for now. Astroscale aims to tackle the growing problem of space debris, one rocket part at a time.</p>

Intel on Tuesday formally introduced its next-generation Data Center GPU explicitly designed to run inference workloads, wedding 160 GB of LPDDR5X onboard memory with relatively low power consumption. Intel's inference-optimized Data Center GPU codenamed Crescent Island will carry a GPU (perhaps two) based on the Xe3P architecture, which is a performance-enhanced version of the Xe3 architecture used in the Core Ultra 300-series 'Panther Lake' processors for laptops and compact desktops. The GPU is said to support a 'broad range of data types' relevant for inference workloads and cloud providers. However, there are still some hints in Intel's press release. The board will carry 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory (a lot more than one typically expects from a graphics card), which suggests the usage of many LPDDR5X devices. An LPDDR5X DRAM IC features two 16-bit channels, so its total interface width is 32 bits. In both cases, it means that Intel will have two high-end graphics processors for inference, and the only question is whether these can also process graphics. Keep in mind that since LPDDR5X DRAMs feature two fully independent 16-bit channels, they cannot support butterfly mode (like GDDR6 or GDDR7), so it is impossible to connect 20 ICs using a single 320-bit interface to one GPU. Intel says that its inference-optimized Data Center GPU codenamed Crescent Island will be 'power and cost optimized for air-cooled enterprise servers,' so we would not expect the company to build a near-reticle-sized GPU for these cards. Intel plans to start sampling its Crescent Island products sometime in the second half of 2026.

AMD has showcased its Helios next-generation AI hardware platform built for the Meta OpenRack Wide form-factor at the Open Compute Project Global Summit in San Jose, California. Built for streamlined scalability within an AI-first data center environment, this is AMD's big pitch to compete directly with Nvidia's rack-based GPU and CPU combinations, like the Blackwell and Grace-powered GB300 NVL72. AMD debuted the Helios platform earlier this year, highlighting its ground-up design using all-AMD hardware. To enhance that scalability, AMD has now demonstrated it as compliant with the new Open Rack Wide specification developed by Meta. It was developed to improve power, cooling, and serviceability for AI systems. “Open collaboration is key to scaling AI efficiently,” said Forrest Norrod, executive VP and GM of the Data Center Solutions Group, AMD. “With ‘Helios,' we're turning open standards into real, deployable systems — combining AMD Instinct GPUs, EPYC CPUs, and open fabrics to give the industry a flexible, high-performance platform built for the next generation of AI workloads.” AMD even took a swipe at Nvidia in the announcement, claiming that this will work out to 50% greater memory capacity than Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin will offer. AMD also announced the first customers with this Helios system. In what's described as an "expansion of their long-standing, multi-generation collaboration," AMD has partnered with Oracle for the first deployment of the Helios rack system.

Although consumers will need to wait for Nvidia and AMD to launch next-generation graphics products designed for gaming, AI developers have a big head start and a better idea of what's coming down the pipe. Although everyone is scrambling for any compute power they can get for AI data center developments, if AMD's hardware couldn't at least offer credible competition to Nvidia's future Vera Rubin designs, it wouldn't be striking deals like this.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>— Seattle area tech executive David Azose is now chief technology officer for San Francisco's Airtable. Azose joins the database and workflow automation company from OpenAI, where he was head of engineering for ChatGPT's business products. Azose began his career at Microsoft, departing the tech giant in 2017 after more than nine years to take the role of director of engineering at Uber's Seattle office. With the advent of AI, the opportunity to amplify that mission feels inevitable and energizing, and I can't wait for what's ahead,” Azose said on LinkedIn. — Microsoft hired former United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as a part-time advisor. While Sunak said he will “not be advising on any UK policy matters,”  a report from ACoBA noted, “As the former Prime Minister there is a reasonable concern that you could be seen to offer unfair access to, and influence in, the UK government. Sunak served as prime minister for nearly two years, ending in July 2024. Sunak is donating his Microsoft salary to The Richmond Project, a charity that helps children and adults with math skills that he launched with his wife Akshata Murty. — Jonathan Rosenbluth joined Seattle AI startup Oumi as the head of product and go-to-market. Oumi, which aims to open the “black box” of foundational AI models to spur innovation, came out of stealth in January and has raised $10 million from investors. The company's virtual healthcare service is now available in 39 states and Washington, D.C.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>— Seattle area tech executive David Azose is now chief technology officer for San Francisco's Airtable. Azose joins the database and workflow automation company from OpenAI, where he was head of engineering for ChatGPT's business products. Azose began his career at Microsoft, departing the tech giant in 2017 after more than nine years to take the role of director of engineering at Uber's Seattle office. With the advent of AI, the opportunity to amplify that mission feels inevitable and energizing, and I can't wait for what's ahead,” Azose said on LinkedIn. — Microsoft hired former United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as a part-time advisor. While Sunak said he will “not be advising on any UK policy matters,”  a report from ACoBA noted, “As the former Prime Minister there is a reasonable concern that you could be seen to offer unfair access to, and influence in, the UK government. Sunak served as prime minister for nearly two years, ending in July 2024. Sunak is donating his Microsoft salary to The Richmond Project, a charity that helps children and adults with math skills that he launched with his wife Akshata Murty. — Jonathan Rosenbluth joined Seattle AI startup Oumi as the head of product and go-to-market. Oumi, which aims to open the “black box” of foundational AI models to spur innovation, came out of stealth in January and has raised $10 million from investors. The company's virtual healthcare service is now available in 39 states and Washington, D.C. Your company's success depends on finding and keeping great talent—whether it's an all-star engineer or a world-class salesperson. That's why GeekWire and Prime Team Partners have teamed up on GeekWork, a new initiative designed to help employers connect with outstanding candidates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Tuesday, the company launched a Gemini-powered “Help me schedule” feature that will surface ideal meeting times based on calendar availability and then display them to the person you're emailing to set up a meeting. The launch of the new feature comes amid a flurry of Google Workspace announcements that focus on infusing AI more deeply into users' everyday tools. This includes the introduction of Google's latest image editing model, Nano Banana, and Gemini features in Google Slides; tools to share custom AI assistants called Gems with other team members; new formats in NotebookLM; improved AI video tools in Google Vids; and more. This will display a series of timeslots where you have open availability. You can click an edit button to change or remove some of the options, then insert them into your email and send it to the recipient as usual. While there are several meeting assistants and automated scheduling tools already on the market, like those from Calendly, Doodle, Zoom, HubSpot, and others, Google notes that its tool uses Gemini's AI to use the email's context when it makes its meeting suggestions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Any watch fan looking to tick all of the above boxes would normally expect to be a dab hand with a spring bar removal tool to experience all the above individually, but a new strap developed by Malaysian independent brand Ming appears to now offer the best of all worlds. Ming says that the strap, which is made up from rows of 15 equilateral triangles, meshed together and bookended by larger end pieces, “has more motion engineered into the radial axis than the lateral one,” leading to a supple end result that drapes like fabric yet retains the strength of titanium. The straps each take several hours to produce, requiring hundreds of layers of additive manufacturing in an inert gas environment. To the extent that straps have been an area for innovation in the watch world, recent attention has tended to focus on brands' development of proprietary mechanisms for swappable straps, to varying degrees of success and popularity. Sustainability programmes that focus on leather alternatives such as reclaimed apple peel or mushroom-based material, or textiles woven from ocean plastic. Rolex's 2015  Oysterflex strap featured an elastomer virtually indistinguishable from rubber with thin blades of titanium-nickel alloy embedded within it for strength. The last time a brand released anything that could realistically be described as an innovative hybrid would probably be Rolex's 2015 introduction of the Oysterflex strap: an elastomer virtually indistinguishable from rubber with thin blades of titanium-nickel alloy embedded within it. But the aesthetic result bears no comparison to Ming's Polymesh; to achieve a slinky, supple feel with a metal bracelet usually requires brands to invest heavily in hand-craft—like that of Patek Philippe's recent Golden Ellipse, which the brand says is crafted by master chainsmiths from 363 components—and the end result will naturally be limited to much more traditional constraints. Over the years, other companies have sought to improve on traditional straps for various reasons. Some artisanal watches feature curved spring bars (as in fact does the Polymesh), or insist on solid gold (like Berneron); Omega once prototyped a strap woven from synthetic spider silk, which has finally made it to production as the Biosteel nato. California start-up Barrelhand whose Monolith is being developed for space exploration uses a strap built by Nick Mankey Designs that it says is “UV resistant, water proof, freeze proof, overstretch resistant, extremely lightweight and machine washable,” from polyester elastic webbing with grade five titanium hardware. Operating since 2018, Mankey last year created the Chronogrip, after two years of development and 90 design iterations. Essentially a unique take on nato straps with two different security measures for strap retention, as Mankey's version doesn't need to pass under the base of the watch case, his design is also good for smartwatches. Still, there's nothing quite like Ming's revolutionary new take on things. The brand, which says it is also working on a version in stainless steel and will soon offer a 22mm lug width to go with the existing 20mm specification, will be showing off the genuinely innovative Polymesh at WatchTime New York laster this month, and at Dubai Watch Week in November. Compatible with any Ming timepiece, the Polymesh is being sold separately (yes, you don't get a watch with this thing) and can be pre-ordered now for CHF 1,500, approximately $1,900, and take six to eight weeks to reach purchasers.

Coco Robotics co-founder and CEO Zach Rash told TechCrunch the company's goal has always been to operate its last-mile delivery robots autonomously to cut the overall costs of delivery. Now, Rash said the company has collected enough data to dive deeper into automation. Zhou's research around computer vision and robotics has largely focused on micromobility, as opposed to full-scale vehicles, Rash said. Rather, it will be used for the company to improve its automation and efficiency, which will mainly pertain to the local models its robots run on. Rash said they also plan to share their research findings with the cities they operate in when applicable, to help fix obstacles and infrastructure that slows their bots down. How do we make this much more affordable for businesses and customers? I think that's going to create a tremendous amount of growth in this ecosystem.” Becca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle-based startup Humanly is buying three recruiting technology companies — Sprockets, Qualifi, and HourWork — as it aims to build a comprehensive hiring platform that unites sourcing, screening, interviewing, and post-hire engagement under a single system. Founded in 2018, Humanly uses automation software to help companies screen job candidates, schedule interviews, automate initial communication, run reference checks, and more. The deals mark a major expansion for Humanly, and comes just after Workday's $1 billion acquisition of Paradox, one of Humanly's main rivals. M&A activity in the HR software sector is up this year. Humanly's broader goal is to help employers automate outreach and screening for every applicant — not just the small fraction that typically receives a response. “Anytime there's a two-way conversation with a job candidate, we want to make that more efficient, more equitable,” said Humanly CEO Prem Kumar. This trend is also making it harder to differentiate candidates. Humanly is equipping companies with AI tools of their own to help sort through applications, including its new AI Video Interviewer, which launched earlier this year and automatically conducts and transcribes interviews. “It's helping you get to 100% of candidates, not 5%,” he said. He added that there is some pushback from job candidates who don't want to engage with an AI system. “But what we're finding is it's not the difference between talking to AI and a human — it's a difference between talking to AI or being ignored,” Kumar said. Humanly uses the millions of transcripts collected from its AI chat and video systems to train models that score candidates more accurately and help recruiters make decisions. The startup now claims 600 million candidate profiles and helps companies interview about 250,000 candidates per month. Kumar said Humanly is intentionally not profitable as it invests ahead in infrastructure. Humanly now has over 100 customers, including Microsoft, Rogers Communications, MGM, and Dish Network. Kumar said the company tripled its revenue in 2025 and plans to raise more investment next year. He co-founded Humanly with Andrew Gardner and Bryan Leptich.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That was the case for Michelle Lim, who, while running Warp's growth marketing efforts through last year, realized that the company wasn't updating its website quickly enough. She noticed that potential customers were asking ChatGPT and other AI bots all kinds of questions about Warp's offering, but the information they sought, such as how the product compared with a newer competitor, wasn't available on the startup's website. Lim felt that this content gap would become even more critical as next-generation AI agents begin actively crawling the internet to gather intelligence for users. It was clear that Warp needed to add more content, but making and uploading each additional web page was a time-consuming task involving a design agency and multiple people across different departments. “Marketers just can't wait one month for design and development teams to build the page,” she told TechCrunch. Joining her in the effort was Max Levenson, an engineer who previously led simulation and infrastructure teams for autonomous vehicle startup, Nuro. On Tuesday, Flint emerged from stealth mode with $5 million in seed funding. Flint's goal is to create websites that continuously optimize themselves, perform their own A/B tests, and dynamically learn from both visitors and market trends, such as a sudden interest in a specific keyword. Lim claims the platform can do all of this in “about a day,” though she didn't give any more details. “At this point, customers provide their own copy,” Lim said. She added that while Flint's content writing functionality is roughly a year away, future versions will give customers the option to have AI write the text. Flint says it doesn't design sites or “vibe code” anything. The startup is already working with customers like Cognition, Modal, and Graphite, for whom it has created live pages. You can see Windsurf's here, Modal's site, and this is what Graphite's looks like. “I was showing her this deck, and I was sharing how, in my personal experience, it took five teams three months to build one A/B test just to increase conversion by 10% on our Google ad,” Lim said.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Only by a few grams, but that'd be enough to potentially land me in legal hot water if I were to fly it in the same ways and locations as its sub-250-gram predecessor, the DJI Mini 4 Pro. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Due to manufacturing tolerances, the actual weight of the product may vary slightly within a range of ±4 g. Minor weight fluctuations are normal. We recommend that when UK users are operating the drone, local regulations are complied with, which can be found here.” The company refers to it as a “near-250g drone”—terminology I'd never encountered from DJI. This isn't just pedantic nitpicking over a few grams. Previous Mini models have been just under this limit, and it seems like an oversight during the design process to not keep this one comfortably below it, too. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. There's good news, though: With UK drone rules set to change at the beginning of 2026, I don't have too long to wait until the Mini 5 Pro (and, interestingly, the much bigger DJI Air 3S) becomes completely legal to fly in built-up areas, public parks, and close to people. The tidings for US-based pilots aren't so cheery, though. As with all of its recent products, DJI isn't officially launching the Mini 5 Pro in the US. You can blame the impending DJI ban, and it's a real shame, because, weight issues aside, this is a fantastic camera drone. The Mini 5 Pro's slight weight increase comes with genuine benefits. The main improvement is the camera, which now features a 12-MP (or 50 MP in Quad Bayer terms) 1-inch sensor, a significant upgrade from the smaller sensors in previous Mini models. The image quality is edging towards DJI's Air range, which is remarkable for a drone this size. You're getting professional-level image quality in a pocketable drone. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The camera improvements extend beyond just sensor size. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. You can shoot 4K at 60 frames per second in regular modes, and now push things to 4K 120 fps for smooth slow-motion sequences. The footage is 10-bit H.265 with a maximum ISO of 12,800, and there's support for D-Log M and HLG color profiles for those who want maximum flexibility in post-production. DJI claims up to 14 stops of dynamic range, and from my testing, shadow and highlight detail are genuinely excellent. The 2x digital zoom—essentially a crop that gives you an equivalent 48-mm medium telephoto field of view—is surprisingly usable. Using a digital crop isn't something I'd typically recommend on smaller-sensor drones, but thanks to DJI's processing and the headroom offered by the 1-inch sensor, it's well worth making use of here. As with most DJI drones, the Mini 5 Pro is a joy to fly. It's zippy and responsive when flown manually. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Safety features have seen significant upgrades, too. During my testing, this proved genuinely useful during golden hour (and later) flight; those lighting conditions are challenging for vision-only systems. All the usual automated flight features are present and work well. The drone feels stable and predictable, whether you're using subject tracking, waypoint navigation, or just hovering in place. For beginners, it's as approachable as any Mini model, but experienced pilots will appreciate the improved performance. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Interestingly, battery life takes a major hit when using the camera. With the camera rolling and a standard battery fitted, you might get 21 minutes of flight time, but it can be as much as 36 minutes when the camera isn't recording. It folds down to a genuinely pocketable size, and DJI includes a protective cover that keeps both propellers and the camera safe when folded. That's around the same price as the Mini 4 Pro, and here you're obviously getting a lot more for your money. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I'd strongly recommend the RC 2 touchscreen controller version if your budget allows. It eliminates much of the preflight setup faff you get with phone-mounted controllers and leaves your phone free for calls or other tasks. Coming back to that weight issue: it's genuinely frustrating. The Mini series has always been about simplicity—buy one and fly it almost anywhere without worrying about complex regulations. The Mini 5 Pro muddies those waters in a way that feels unnecessary, especially given DJI's somewhat unsatisfying response to the situation. If you're in Europe with its Class 0 designation, this isn't a concern. It's not a deal-breaker, but it does chip away at one of the Mini series' core appeals. The Mini 5 Pro represents a significant step forward in camera technology and flight performance, wrapped in DJI's typically excellent design. The image quality improvements are genuine and substantial, and this really does deliver Air-class performance in a much smaller, easy-to-carry package. But that weight slip-up feels like an uncharacteristic mistake from a company that usually gets these details right. If you're a UK dweller, just be prepared to pay more attention to local regulations than you would with its predecessors—at least until the laws become clearer in January 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group turns one year old. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. In the first year, AMD and Intel have managed to ratify four new features that are set to be supported by the upcoming processors from these companies, including long-awaited memory tagging. The technology is described as a replacement for traditional x86 interrupt and exception mechanisms, so ultimately it is designed to simplify context switches, reduce latency, improve performance, and security when working with operating systems that support it. FRED speeds up how the CPU switches between user mode (ring 3) and kernel mode (ring 0) with a hardware-defined entry and exit path. While this does not sound too impressive, replacing the old x86 mechanism (which uses the Interrupt Descriptor Table and IRET) is a big deal. At present, every time an application interacts with the OS (which happens millions of times per second), the CPU must switch between user mode and kernel mode, which introduces fairly high latencies with today's machines. Up until today, AMD's stance on FRED was unclear, but now that the feature is recognized by the x86 EAG as a cross-vendor capability, it will be added to AMD's platforms over time. The feature is added to catch memory safety errors — problems like buffer overflows, use-after-free, and out-of-bounds memory access — directly in hardware. Memory tagging is rapidly becoming a standard feature in modern CPUs as it is valuable (can catch a variety of bugs in hardware) and easy to implement, which is why modern processors from Apple and Ampere now support Arm's MTE technology. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The announcement by the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group signals both are committed to supporting this feature, but there is no obligation to implement it within a certain timeframe. Meanwhile, hardware changes of this depth typically require building them into the CPU microarchitecture itself, so expect support of FRED and ChkTag to come several years down the road.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Be honest: Have you ever looked up someone from your childhood on social media with the sole intention of seeing how they've aged? One of my colleagues, who shall remain nameless, certainly has. “Can you believe we're the same age?” he asked, with a hint of glee in his voice. The years certainly are kinder to some of us than others. But wrinkles and gray hairs aside, it can be difficult to know how well—or poorly—someone's body is truly aging, under the hood. A person who develops age-related diseases earlier in life, or has other biological changes associated with aging (such as elevated cholesterol or markers of inflammation), might be considered “biologically older” than a similar-age person who doesn't have those changes. Longevity clinics offer a mix of services that largely cater to the wealthy. Doctors have long used functional tests that measure their patients' strength or the distance they can walk, for example, or simply “eyeball” them to guess whether they look fit enough to survive some treatment regimen, says Tamir Chandra, who studies aging at the Mayo Clinic. But over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging. What they've found is changing our understanding of aging itself. “Aging clocks” are new scientific tools that can measure how our organs are wearing out, giving us insight into our mortality and health. It measures how our bodies are handling the passing of time and—perhaps—lets us know how much more of it we have left. It's not just scientists who are using these clocks. Longevity influencers like Bryan Johnson often use them to make the case that they are aging backwards. “My telomeres say I'm 10 years old,” Johnson posted on X in April. The Kardashians have tried them too (Khloé was told on TV that her biological age was 12 years below her chronological age). Even my local health-food store offers biological age testing. Some are pushing the use of clocks even further, using them to sell unproven “anti-aging” supplements. The science is still new, and few experts in the field—some of whom affectionately refer to it as “clock world”—would argue that an aging clock can definitively reveal an individual's biological age. But their work is revealing that aging clocks can offer so much more than an insta-brag, a snake-oil pitch—or even just an eye-catching number. Ultimately, and most importantly, they might soon tell us whether we can reverse the whole process. Molecules called methyl groups can attach to DNA, controlling the way genes make proteins. This process is called methylation, and it can potentially occur at millions of points along the genome. In 2011, Steve Horvath, then a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles, took part in a study that was looking for links between sexual orientation and these epigenetic markers. That study didn't find a link between DNA methyl­ation and sexual orientation. But when Horvath looked at the data, he noticed a different trend—a very strong link between age and methylation at around 88 points on the genome. Many of the affected genes had already been linked to age-related brain and cardiovascular diseases, but it wasn't clear how methylation might be related to those diseases. If a model could work out what average aging looks like, it could potentially estimate whether someone was aging unusually fast or slowly. It could transform medicine and fast-track the search for an anti-aging drug. In 2013, Horvath collected methylation data from 8,000 tissue and cell samples to create what he called the Horvath clock—essentially a mathematical model that could estimate age on the basis of DNA methylation at 353 points on the genome. If a model could work out what average aging looks like, it could potentially estimate whether someone was aging unusually fast or slowly. It could transform medicine and fast-track the search for an anti-aging drug. The epigenetic clock was a success story in “a field that, frankly, doesn't have a lot of success stories,” says João Pedro de Magalhães, who researches aging at the University of Birmingham, UK. It took a few years, but as more aging researchers heard about the clock, they began incorporating it into their research and even developing their own clocks. Scientists started asking for selfies with him at conferences, he says. Some researchers even made T-shirts bearing the front page of his 2013 paper. Some of the many other aging clocks developed since have become notable in their own right. Examples include the PhenoAge clock, which incorporates health data such as blood cell counts and signs of inflammation along with methyl­ation, and the Dunedin Pace of Aging clock, which tells you how quickly or slowly a person is aging rather than pointing to a specific age. Many of the clocks measure methylation, but some look at other variables, such as proteins in blood or certain carbohydrate molecules that attach to such proteins. Horvath himself favors his GrimAge clock, which was named after the Grim Reaper because it is designed to predict time to death. That clock was trained on data collected from people who were monitored for decades, many of whom died in that period. Horvath won't use it to tell people when they might die of old age, he stresses, saying that it wouldn't be ethical. Instead, it can be used to deliver a biological age that hints at how long a person might expect to live. Someone who is 50 but has a GrimAge of 60 can assume that, compared with the average 50-year-old, they might be a bit closer to the end. While it can strongly predict time to death given the health trajectory someone is on, no aging clock can predict if someone will start smoking or get a divorce (which generally speeds aging) or suddenly take up running (which can generally slow it). They've been able to predict that people over the age of 105 have lower biological ages, which tracks given how rare it is for people to make it past that age. A higher epigenetic age has been linked to declining cognitive function and signs of Alzheimer's disease, while better physical and cognitive fitness has been linked to a lower epigenetic age. But accuracy is a challenge for all aging clocks. Part of the problem lies in how they were designed. Most of the clocks were trained to link age with methylation. Aging clocks are still judged on how well they can predict a person's chronological age, but you don't want them to be too close, says Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, head of machine learning at Shift Bioscience, who was awarded $10,000 by the Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for developing a clock that could estimate age within a range of 2.55 years. If a clock is really good at predicting chronological age, that's all it will tell you—and it probably won't reveal much about your biological age. No one needs an aging clock to tell them how many birthdays they've had. Camillo says he's noticed that when the clocks get too close to “perfect” age prediction, they actually become less accurate at predicting mortality. Therein lies the other central issue for scientists who develop and use aging clocks: What is the thing they are really measuring? A methylation-based aging clock might tell you about how that collection of chemical markers compares across individuals, but at best, it's only giving you an idea of their “epigenetic age,” says Chandra. We don't know why some methyl groups appear or disappear with age, either. Or have they been responsible for keeping that person alive into very old age? To make matters even more complicated, two different clocks can give similar answers by measuring methylation at entirely different regions of the genome. No one knows why, or which regions might be the best ones to focus on. “The biomarkers have this black-box quality,” says Jesse Poganik at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. What we know is that, as things stand, none of the clocks are precise enough to predict the biological age of a single person (sorry, Khloé). “We don't know what [a clock result] means for a person, [or if] they're more or less likely to develop disease.” And it's why plenty of aging researchers—even those who regularly use the clocks in their work—haven't bothered to measure their own epigenetic age. “Let's say I do a clock and it says that my biological age … is five years older than it should be,” says Magalhães. You might think this lack of clarity would make aging clocks pretty useless in a clinical setting. Some longevity clinics are more careful, and will regularly test their patients with a range of clocks, noting their results and tracking them over time. And then there are the people who use aging clocks to sell supplements. While no drug or supplement has been definitively shown to make people live longer, that hasn't stopped the lightly regulated wellness industry from pushing a range of “treatments” that range from lotions to herbal pills all the way through to stem-cell injections. Tom Weldon of Ponce de Leon Health told us his gray hair was turning brown. His biological age was supposedly reversing so rapidly that he had reached “longevity escape velocity.” New movie The Substance showcases how women are thought about in terms of youth and fertility. That idea makes for bad research and health guidance. But if the people who buy his supplements expect some kind of Benjamin Button effect, they might be disappointed. His company hasn't yet conducted a randomized controlled trial to demonstrate any anti-aging effects of that supplement, called Rejuvant. Weldon says that such a trial would take years and cost millions of dollars, and that he'd “have to increase the price of our product more than four times” to pay for one. More generally, Horvath says he “gets a bad taste in [his] mouth” when people use the clocks to sell products and “make a quick buck.” But he thinks that most of those sellers have genuine faith in both the clocks and their products. The accuracy of the clocks is at a level that makes them useful for research, but not for individual predictions. Even if a clock did tell someone they were five years younger than their chronological age, that wouldn't necessarily mean the person could expect to live five years longer, says Magalhães. “The field of aging has long been a rich ground for snake-oil salesmen and hype,” he says. Most people in the longevity field seem to have mixed feelings about the trendiness of aging clocks and how they are being used. With a surge in funding and an explosion in the number of biotech companies working on longevity, aging scientists are hopeful that innovation and progress will follow. So they want to be sure that the reputation of aging clocks doesn't end up being tarnished by association. Because while influencers and supplement sellers are using their “biological ages” to garner attention, scientists are now using these clocks to make some remarkable discoveries. Discoveries that are changing the way we think about aging. One is a youthful three-month-old, its fur thick, black, and glossy. Its whiskers are short, and it generally looks kind of frail. But the two mice are about to have a lot more in common. He then carefully stitches the two animals together—membranes, fascia, and skin. At first, the two still-groggy animals pull away from each other. White, who studies aging at Duke University, has been stitching mice together for years; he has performed this strange procedure, known as heterochronic parabiosis, more than a hundred times. Experiments with heterochronic parabiosis have been performed for decades, but typically scientists keep the mice attached to each other for only a few weeks, says White. In their experiment, he and his colleagues left the mice attached for three months—equivalent to around 10 human years. “You'd think that they'd want to separate immediately,” says White. “But when you detach them … they kind of follow each other around.” The most striking result of that experiment was that the older mice who had been attached to a younger mouse ended up living longer than other mice of a similar age. They were more active and maintained their strength for longer, he adds. When his colleagues, including Poganik, applied aging clocks to the mice, they found that their epigenetic ages were lower than expected. The effect seemed to last, too—at least for a little while. “It preserved that youthful state for longer than we expected,” he says. But in their case, the effect seemed to be short-lived, says White: “The young mice went back to being young again.” To White, this suggests that something about the “youthful state” might be programmed in some way. Maybe we don't have to go through the biological process of aging. Some believe it's simply a result of accumulated damage. Some believe that the aging process is programmed; just as we grow limbs, develop a brain, reach puberty, and experience menopause, we are destined to deteriorate. Others think programs that play an important role in our early development just turn out to be harmful later in life by chance. And there are some scientists who agree with all of the above. If that's the case, there's a silver lining: Knowing how youth is lost might point toward a way to somehow regain it, perhaps by restoring those youthful programs in some way. Horvath's eponymous clock was developed by measuring methylation in DNA samples taken from tissues around the body. Given that our organs are thought to age differently, it was remarkable that a single clock could measure aging in so many of them. But Horvath had ambitious plans for an even more universal clock: a pan-species model that could measure aging in all mammals. He started out, in 2017, with an email campaign that involved asking hundreds of scientists around the world to share samples of tissues from animals they had worked with. The pan-mammalian clock suggests that there is something universal about aging—not just that all mammals experience it in a similar way, but that a similar set of genetic or epigenetic factors might be responsible for it. “I learned that people had spent careers collecting [animal] tissues,” he says. “They had freezers full of [them].” Amenable scientists would ship those frozen tissues, or just DNA, to Horvath's lab in California, where he would use them to train a new model. Horvath says he initially set out to profile 30 different species. Could a single clock really predict age in all of them? “But it turned out that I was completely wrong.” He and his colleagues developed a clock that assessed methylation at 36,000 locations on the genome. The pan-mammalian clock suggests that there is something universal about aging—not just that all mammals experience it in a similar way, but that a similar set of genetic or epigenetic factors might be responsible for it. “We still have the instructions in place, but they become a little messier.” The research in different mammals suggests that cells can take only so much change before they stop functioning. “There's a finite amount of change that the cell can tolerate,” she says. “If the instructions become too messy and noisy … it cannot support life.” Clocks can be trained on data from volunteers, and by matching the patterns of methylation on their DNA to their chronological age. But they can also be used on samples from children. They can be used to work out the biological age of cells that make up embryos. Scientific advances, public interest, and an unprecedented level of investment are pushing the longevity industry to help us live longer in better health. “The pluripotent cells measure as minus 0.5; they're slightly below zero.” Vadim Gladyshev, a prominent aging researcher at Harvard University, has since proposed that the same negative level of aging might apply to embryos. “It's interesting how this coincides with philosophical questions about when life starts,” says Olova. Some have argued that life begins when sperm meets egg, while others have suggested that the point when embryonic cells start to form some kind of unified structure is what counts. The ground zero point is when the body plan is set out and cells begin to organize accordingly, she says. This doesn't mean that life begins at the embryonic state, but it does suggest that this is when aging begins—perhaps as the result of “a generational clearance of damage,” says Poganik. But knowing when aging begins could help inform attempts to rewind the clock. If scientists can pinpoint an ideal biological age for cells, perhaps they can find ways to get old cells back to that state. “Presumably, there may be opportunities for targeting aging before … you're full of gray hair,” says Poganik. When White first started stitching mice together, he would sit and watch them for hours. The effect their partnership appears to have on their biological ages, if only temporarily, is among the ways aging clocks are helping us understand that biological age is plastic to some degree. White and his colleagues have also found, for instance, that stress seems to increase biological age, but that the effect can be reversed once the stress stops. Both pregnancy and covid-19 infections have a similar reversible effect. Poganik wonders if this finding might have applications for human organ transplants. Perhaps there's a way to measure the biological age of an organ before it is transplanted and somehow rejuvenate organs before surgery. But new data from aging clocks suggests that this might be more complicated than it sounds. Poganik and his colleagues have been using methylation clocks to measure the biological age of samples taken from recently transplanted hearts in living people. If being old is simply a case of losing our youthfulness, then that might give us a clue to how we can somehow regain it. Young hearts do well in older bodies, but the biological age of these organs eventually creeps up to match that of their recipient. The same is true for older hearts in younger bodies, says Poganik, who has not yet published his findings. It also suggests that scientists working on ways to rejuvenate individual organs may need to focus their anti-aging efforts on more systemic means of rejuvenation—for example, stem cells that repopulate the blood. Whole-body rejuvenation might be some way off, but scientists are still hopeful that aging clocks might help them find a way to reverse aging in people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So you might expect that those space-based radio communications would be encrypted to prevent any snoop with a satellite dish from accessing the torrent of secret information constantly raining from the sky. You would, to a surprising and troubling degree, be wrong. Roughly half of geostationary satellite signals, many carrying sensitive consumer, corporate, and government communications, have been left entirely vulnerable to eavesdropping, a team of researchers at UC San Diego and the University of Maryland revealed today in a study that will likely resonate across the cybersecurity industry, telecom firms, and inside military and intelligence agencies worldwide. There are some really critical pieces of our infrastructure relying on this satellite ecosystem, and our suspicion was that it would all be encrypted,” says Aaron Schulman, a UCSD professor who co-led the research. “They just really didn't think anyone would look up.” The researchers say that they've spent nearly the past year warning companies and agencies whose sensitive data they found exposed in satellite communications. Most of them, including T-Mobile, moved quickly to encrypt those communications and protect the data. UCSD and UMD researchers pose with their satellite receiver system on the roof of a university building in San Diego. From left to right: Annie Dai, Aaron Schulman, Keegan Ryan, Nadia Heninger, Morty Zhang. The researchers' work looked at only a small fraction of geostationary satellites whose signals they could pick up from San Diego—roughly 15 percent of those in operation, by the researchers' estimate. This suggests vast amounts of data are likely still being exposed over satellite communications, says Matt Green, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University who focuses on cybersecurity and reviewed the study. Large swaths of satellite data will likely be vulnerable for years to come, too, as companies and governments grapple with whether and how to secure outdated systems, Green says. The fact that this much data is going over satellites that anyone can pick up with an antenna is just incredible,” Green says. “This paper will fix a very small part of the problem, but I think a lot of it is not going to change.” “I would be shocked,” Green adds, “if this is something that intelligence agencies of any size are not already exploiting.” The phone calls and text messages the researchers obtained, in particular, were exposed due to telecoms' often overlooked use of satellite communications for offering cellular coverage to normal phone users who connect to cell towers in remote locations. Doing so allowed the research team to obtain at least some amount of unencrypted backhaul data from the carriers T-Mobile, AT&T Mexico, and Telmex. Cellular towers in remote regions sometimes connect to a satellite that relays their signals to and from the rest of a telecom's core cellular network—the internal communications of the network known as “backhaul” traffic. Did we just wiretap?” says Dave Levin, a University of Maryland computer science professor who co-led the study. In fact, he says, the team didn't actively intercept any communications, only passively listened to what was being sent to their receiver dish. “These signals are just being broadcast to over 40 percent of the Earth at any point in time,” Levin says. Mexican telecom Telmex also transmitted unencrypted voice calls, the researchers found. The researchers further discovered that AT&T Mexico transmitted raw data over satellites that included users' internet traffic—most of which was encrypted with HTTPS by the apps or browsers they used—but also some calling and texting metadata. They also found decryption keys that the researchers believe could likely have been used to decipher other sensitive information the AT&T Mexico network transmitted—though they didn't attempt this. T-Mobile responded by encrypting its satellite transmissions within weeks, but responses from other cell carriers were mixed. “Last year, this research helped surface a vendor's encryption issue found in a limited number of satellite backhaul transmissions from a very small number of cell sites, which was quickly fixed,” a T-Mobile spokesperson says, adding the issue was “not network-wide” and that the company has taken steps to “make sure this doesn't happen again.” In another statement after this story was published, T-Mobile noted that it has also added Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) encryption for all customers across the US “to further protect signaling traffic as it travels between mobile handsets and the network core, including call set up, numbers dialed and text message content.” The researchers say they didn't see any unencrypted Verizon or AT&T US traffic from their dish. "We typically route traffic on our closed, secure backhaul network,” the spokesperson says. Beyond just cell towers in remote locations, it's possible that a lack of encryption for cellular backhaul data could make anyone on the same network vulnerable, points out Johns Hopkins' Green. “The implications of this aren't just that some poor guy in the desert is using his cell phone tower with an unencrypted backhaul,” says Green. “You could potentially turn this into an attack on anybody, anywhere in the country.” The researchers' satellite dish also pulled down a significant collection of unprotected military and law enforcement communications. (A spokesperson for the US Defense Information Systems Agency acknowledged WIRED's request for comment but had not provided a response at the time of writing). For Mexican military and law enforcement, the exposures were far worse: The researchers say they found what appeared to be unencrypted communications with remote command centers, surveillance facilities, and units of the Mexican military and law enforcement. In some cases, they saw the unprotected transmission of sensitive intelligence information on activities like narcotics trafficking. “When we started seeing military helicopters, it wasn't necessarily the sheer volume of data, but the extreme sensitivity of that data that concerned us,” says Schulman. The Mexican military did not immediately respond to WIRED's requests for comment. In one case, they found that the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), Mexico's state-owned electric utility with nearly 50 million customers, was transmitting its internal communications in the clear—everything from work orders that included customers' names and addresses to communications about equipment failures and safety hazards. In other cases they have yet to publicly detail, the researchers say they also warned US infrastructure owners about unencrypted satellite communications for industrial control system software. In their phone calls with those infrastructure owners, some owners even expressed concerns that a malicious actor might have the ability to not only surveil the control systems of their facilities, but also, with enough sophistication, potentially disable or spoof them to tamper with the facility's operation. The researchers obtained a vast grab bag of other miscellaneous corporate and consumer data: They pulled down in-flight Wi-Fi data for Intelsat and Panasonic systems used by 10 different airlines. Within that data, they found unencrypted metadata about users' browsing activities and even the unencrypted audio of the news programs and sports games being broadcast to them. They also obtained corporate emails and inventory records of Walmart's Mexican subsidiary, satellite communications to ATMs managed by Santander Mexico, as well as the Mexican banks Banjercito and Banorte. “Our satellite communications systems are designed so that every user data session follows established security protocols,” the spokesperson says. “Generally, our users choose the encryption that they apply to their communications to suit their specific application or need,” says a spokesperson for SES, the parent company of Intelsat. “For SES's inflight customers, for example, SES provides a public Wi-Fi hot spot connection similar to the public internet available at a coffee shop or hotel. CERT-MX did not respond to WIRED's repeated requests for comment. A spokesperson for Santander Mexico says that no customer information or transactions were compromised, but confirmed that the exposed traffic was linked to a “small group” of ATMs used in remote areas of Mexico where using satellite connections is the only option available. “While we cannot share specifics, we can confirm that our communications lines have been evaluated and confirmed secure,” a spokesperson for Walmart says. (The researchers confirm that they observed Walmart had encrypted its satellite communications in response to their warning.) “The information of our customers and infrastructure is not exposed to any vulnerability,” a spokesperson for Grupo Financiero Banorte says. “SIA and its members remain diligent in monitoring the threat landscape and continue to participate in various security efforts with government agencies, industry working groups, and international standards bodies,” says Tom Stroup, the president of the Satellite Industry Association, adding that it does not comment on specific company issues. The researchers' satellite dish on the roof of their UC San Diego building was in a position to pick at least some signals from about a quarter of that ring. That suggests anyone could set up similar hardware somewhere else in the world and likely obtain their own collection of sensitive information. The barrier to entry for this sort of attack is extremely low,” says Matt Blaze, a computer scientist and cryptographer at Georgetown University and law professor at Georgetown Law. “By the week after next, we will have hundreds or perhaps thousands of people, many of whom won't tell us what they're doing, replicating this work and seeing what they can find up there in the sky.” As for the in-depth, highly technical analysis of obscure data protocols they obtained, that may now be easier to replicate, too: The researchers are releasing their own open-source software tool for interpreting satellite data, also titled “Don't Look Up,” on Github. But they argue it will also push more of the owners of that satellite communications data to encrypt that data, to protect themselves and their customers. “As long as we're on the side of finding things that are insecure and securing them, we feel very good about it,” says Schulman. There's little doubt, they say, that intelligence agencies with vastly superior satellite receiver hardware have been analyzing the same unencrypted data for years. In fact, they point out that the US National Security Agency warned in a 2022 security advisory about the lack of encryption for satellite communications. (The NSA did not respond to WIRED's request for comment). “If they aren't already doing this,” jokes UCSD cryptography professor Nadia Heninger, who co-led the study, “then where are my tax dollars going?” “The threat model that everybody had in mind was that we need to be encrypting everything, because there are governments that are tapping undersea fiber optic cables or coercing telecom companies into letting them have access to the data,” Heninger says.
