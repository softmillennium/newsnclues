The psychological thriller, which has become a Top 10 global show for Amazon since its Sept. 10 release, centers around the twisted triangle of son Daniel (Davidson), his fiery new girlfriend Cherry (House of the Dragon‘s Cooke) and his obsessive mother Laura (Wright). Throughout the six episodes, viewers are intentionally misled about which woman is more sympathetic, as the series flips back and forth between Cherry and Laura's conflicting perspectives on the first months of a whirlwind romance between Daniel and Cherry. Neil Young Pulls Music From Amazon: "Don't Go Back to the Big Corporations Who Have Sold Out America" On Set With Molly-Mae: How Britain's Biggest Influencer Built an Empire Out of Oversharing (Exclusive) Instead of Cherry falling to her death and Laura emerging victorious like in the book, it's Laura who dies in the series. In the season finale, Laura drugs Daniel in hopes he will finally hear her evidence that Cherry is dangerous, but he emerges in a drug-induced haze, breaks up the two women fighting in the family's pool and accidentally drowns his mother. Delivering a Greek tragedy-style ending for the Oedipal tale was Wright's idea, as the star, executive producer and director pushed to surprise viewers with Daniel killing Laura, instead of the more obvious Cherry. What Wright didn't anticipate was that people still wouldn't believe Laura is dead by the end of the finale, which concluded with a one year flash-forward of Daniel finally hearing the evidence and fearing now-wife Cherry, who is pregnant with their child. “People were like, ‘Laura could have been resuscitated. Daniel is a doctor,' and also, ‘He could have let her die,'” says Wright about viewers being split on if Laura could have survived the accidental drowning. “It's kind of fun that people are wondering about what happened in the end [that we don't show].” Still, “if it didn't get a second season, I would be completely satisfied,” she says. Were you expecting this show to pop like it has? I don't like to put myself in that position. It was a lot of work, so I feel very relieved. What was the trickiest part about directing and acting in those beginning episodes, when we don't yet know which one of you is the psychotic one? That's what it felt like, where you go, “OK, this is the protocol we have to achieve for this perspective. So we want to make sure we get this beat and this beat.” So you have a great script supervisor who keeps notes of when we flipped from one perspective to the other, because then on another episode, Laura would start the episode and Cherry would finish. So we were just trying to do the math. Did we get enough beats that are different? And then [in the end], you realize that Laura was right along! You had a long and respected TV run on House of Cards. The Girlfriend is a limited series, but as is common with buzzy limited series, there's clamor for a second season. When you signed on, was doing a one-season series part of the appeal? Amazon greenlit a limited series of six episodes adapted from the book. When you're moving forward with one season in your head, that's all you've got to complete — it has to come full circle and has to shock at the end. So it could go both ways, right? I don't know what their [Amazon] plan is, to tell you the truth. Because Amazon has a lot of content, as we know, but they didn't have anything like this. I know that Daniel being the one to kill Laura was your idea. Why did you feel like it should end that way, and did you have to do some convincing to get everyone on board? You're going through what you know as a reader of novels, and I was like, “Let's just flip it on its head.” But it's also left open. You don't know after cut, when Daniel is holding Laura in the pool, could he have resuscitated her? Did you intentionally leave the door open for Laura to be alive, or were you thinking everyone would assume she's dead? People were like, “Oh, she could have been resuscitated.” And also, “He could have let her die.” So it's kind of fun that people are wondering about what happened in the end [that we don't show]. Cherry did try to stop Daniel while he was drowning Laura, which was a surprising turn of empathy for her. Was that a moment you talked about and debated? I said to Andrea Harkin, who directed the latter three episodes [including the finale], “Wouldn't it be interesting to do one take, just so you have it in the editing room, of Cherry trying to stop her drug-filled fiancé, who is drug-filled by his own mother?” Cherry is saying to Daniel, “Don't do that; you and I will just escape.” A lot of these things were added at the last minute, because we were in the scene and able to rehearse: “How do you get to that emotion? What would come out of Cherry's mouth based on this conversation we've just had?” And that was so invigorating, to work with such pros. When you're acting and you get to hang out with all of your costars it's like a beautiful therapy, because you discover things together and everybody throws their idea on the table based on coming from their character personally. Was there another version of the ending you came close to doing? I'm sure there were a couple of other ideas. We probably talked about, “Should Daniel kill Cherry, and then he wakes up and realizes what he did?” That could have been one idea. There were many, many discussions about all of these things, and how did we want to drop crumbs? And not go into the melodrama, but base it in reality that this shit can happen. If it didn't get a second season, I would be completely satisfied. We had such an incredible team building this architectural game. I couldn't have done it without them. I don't know [about a second season]. You know Scenes From A Marriage, the five-part series with Jessica Chastain? That's what inspired me to do a limited series and wear three hats. Has it surprised you that there is Cherry fandom; did you think viewers would tilt more to Laura's side? It doesn't surprise me because that was the intention — to have the viewer ping-pong for six episodes and go, “I'm Team Laura today. And now I'm Team Laura again.” Think about if that limited series was 13 episodes. I think this worked in a truncated fashion. How do you feel about Laura by the end, in terms of what she deserves. They're both very strong-willed and determined to get everyone to believe their story and get what they want out of it. And that is what we experience in life a lot. Do you think Laura would have chewed up and spit out anyone her son brought home? No, we collectively decided that shouldn't be who Laura is at her core. Yes, she'll be aching in her heart because she's going to lose her son to a woman he falls in love with, and he's going to move out of the house — even though he's still living at home at 29. But no, I don't think she would have. From the get-go, she just suspected, “This girl is not to be trusted.” You feel it; you feel that as a woman, “Something rubbed me the wrong way about that person. Had you and Olivia Cooke met before making this show? And she was always my first choice. Was there a piece of her prior acting that caught your attention? She was great in Sound of Metal. Her performance in that really got my attention. I liked that there was a cool confidence about her. And when she smiles, what a sweetie pie. Look at her in Slow Horses, she's great. How did you two find your chemistry? In the rehearsals that were very short, I said, “I think it's beneficial if we can get the characters of the Sanderson family — Daniel, Mom, Dad [played by Waleed Zuaiter] and Cherry — in a room.” We started talking about the scene, “What do you think for your character?” They pitched it, and then I could respond based on what they were going to do. The most important thing with what little time we had was that I said, “Give me something different every take, because we may only get two takes.” They did, and I had so much material in the editing room to play with to morph and mold. We would take things we shot from our algebra list of what we were going to achieve in Laura's versus Cherry's perspectives, and I would steal some of Laura's reactions or lines and throw them into Cherry's perspective. And you're like, “Oh, it's much better over there.” We'd do that Rubik's Cube a lot. Did Laura remind you of Claire; who was your inspiration? I think Laura is just an overly protective mother who really believes her son is potentially going to be in peril with this woman in his life. From Cherry's perspective, that's not something she believes in. She's like, “I just happened to fall in love with a young man who's from a very wealthy family, and I get the perks on top of it. So we're back to the dual perspectives. Olivia and I talked about that a lot, how you have to like your character, no matter how venal they are. You were on one of the first streaming shows with House of Cards, when viewership data was unknown. There were a lot of weeks doing that, and that's very different from [director/executive producer] David Fincher establishing the style of House of Cards and deciding to get onto the streaming train. You had restrictions and you had to find a way to bring your style within those restrictions. The Girlfriend was a very different beast. We didn't even have the scripts written; they were writing as we were starting to shoot. So it was about finding together what's going to be the most gripping, cinematic, on-the-edge-of-your-seat, can't-wait-to-get-to-the-next-episode story. That's your main goal: How do we get people to watch the next episode? There are a lot of people involved and if you're working for a platform, you have to wait until the execs figure out the what, why, when and how. I'm just really wondering if you're dead or alive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ezra Sosa shared an update on his relationship with Anna Delvey one year after they were paired together on “Dancing with the Stars.” During an October 2025 appearance on Danielle Fishel's “Danielle With the Stars” podcast, Sosa was asked if he was still “friendly” with Delvey. “We're not talking right now,” the ballroom pro admitted. “Yeah, there was definitely an unfollow,” Sosa confirmed. After Fishel noted that “we're all on our different journeys,” Sosa agreed. One year ago, Sosa, 24, appeared thrilled by his partnership with Delvey. In a post on his Instagram page last fall, the newly crowned pro dancer wrote, “Excited to announce my very first partner for DWTS is none other than the iconic @theannadelvey!” At the time, Sosa told TV Insider he loved Delvey because she “keeps it real.” “She's got nothing to hide,” he said. Delvey, who served two years in prison after being convicted of defrauding businesses, per CNN, was on house arrest during her time on DWTS. She was required to wear a GPS ankle monitor during her time in the ballroom. Sosa and Delvey were the first couple eliminated on DWTS Season 33. For his second season on DWTS, Sosa was partnered with Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles. In September, he posted an Instagram Reel that showed him lifting up the athlete with the caption, “Pov: I actually have a shot this year.” It's possible that didn't go over well with Delvey. Chiles told People magazine that she was “so ecstatic” to be partnered with Sosa. “I'm so happy he gets this opportunity and a better experience in a better way, and that he just gets to really showcase who he is,” she added, in a clear reference to the dancer's controversial turn with Delvey. “I was happy that I was gonna be his partner where our energy just matched right away,” Chiles added. While they're not on speaking terms at the moment, Sosa shared some funny memories of working with Delvey on Fishel's podcast. “With Anna, I was like, ‘Do you want to win?' “ I was like, ‘Okay, we're going to have a gag. She almost got arrested because of me!” the DWTS  pro laughed. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. The funniest thing about Todd Rohal's “Fuck My Son!” — alas, one of the only funny things about this impressively sick but tiresomely self-amused celebration of bad taste — is that the most controversial aspect of the movie isn't its title, or its demented story about a gun-packing mother who forces a random woman to have sex with her monstrous son (imagine if the Sarlaac from “Star Wars” had a baby with the alien from “Mac and Me,” nipples and boils everywhere, diaper oozing wet shit, just a gaping hole full of hotdogs where his dick should be), or even how brutally it treats the sex slave's elementary school-age daughter, Belinda, who will be cooked in an oven if her mom doesn't comply with their captor's demands). Related Stories ‘Send Help' Trailer: Rachel McAdams and Dylan O'Brien Are Deserted on an Island Together in Sam Raimi's Latest Thriller ‘The Mastermind' Review: Josh O'Connor Is an Art Thief Hijacked by His Own Heist in Kelly Reichardt's Jazzy 1970s Throwback No, the most controversial aspect of “Fuck My Son!” is that it uses some very crude and obvious AI for what amounts to roughly 90 seconds of screen time. I guess some things are just too obscene for audiences to stomach. Like everything else in Rohal's film, the AI-afflicted scenes are designed to triple-underline their own grotesqueness. A prologue modeled after an AMC theater pre-show (“No jacking off in the theater,” “Do not pee or crap in your seat,” “Our restrooms are now closed”) is filled out with inhuman crowds, while the characters from Bernice's favorite show — a “Veggietales”-esque abomination called “The Meatie Mates” — pop up throughout the movie in increasingly artificial form, their every appearance better reflecting the ghoulish slop that today's children eagerly consume on YouTube. As in Radu Jude's recent “Dracula,” the technology isn't used as a shortcut (if anything, incorporating AI made Rohal's work considerably more difficult), but rather as a commentary on the soullessness of modern “art.” Reactive to a world in which people have become more offended by form than content, “Fuck My Son!” exists to explore the efficacy of shock value at a time when image-making itself has become so repulsive and society has ingested its own memetic sickliness as a sign of the future. Rohal wants to push back against the numbing dystopia of Project 2025, so he's cooked up a collective experience — one that will tour across the country, advertising its lack of streaming availability as its greatest hook — designed to startle us back to our senses and restore the sheer joy of transgression. Little other joy is on offer (either within this movie, or outside of it), but “Fuck My Son!” feels like it was only made to indulge in the fact that it still could be. So while I may not have particularly enjoyed the experience of watching it, I have no choice but to admit that it does, indeed, exist. Critics are raving “This is a real thing that people made.” Put it on the poster. Of course, this material didn't originate with Rohal; an idea as pure and profound as “Fuck My Son!” has to come from somewhere. Usually it's from a divine vision or the liquid meth they sell at the front of America's finest gas stations. And that's just as well, because the movie has no interest in making such intellectual property more palatable to a wider audience. Either you want to see a movie called “Fuck My Son!” or you don't (“It's just garbage,” the director has said. “It's made by trashmen for trashmen”), and Rohal's film is squarely targeted at the people who might conceivably pay for a ticket; the aforementioned pre-show offers viewers the choice of “Perv-o-Vision” glasses that make all of the characters naked, or a “Nude Blok” edition for those who pray to “fill their lives with blissful ignorance and intolerance” (the film's spirit all but requires comparisons to John Waters, even if its execution cleaves a lot closer to early James Gunn). The world of “Fuck My Son!” is a small and seedy place where every mote of innocence only exists as an invitation for perversion, or worse. We first meet Sandi (Tipper Newton, recalling Sarah Silverman in her ability to conflate innocence with repulsion) as she takes little Bernice (Kynzie Colmery) dress shopping, where — of course — a peeper is spying on all of the dressing rooms. Shot like an '80s Z-picture but always self-indulgent enough to make clear that it's in on the joke, the movie soon introduces its leading ladies to an overbearing mother (a Chris Farley-esque Robert Longstreet, growling in drag) who's fallen and can't get up. The mother lures Sandi and Bernice to her van, knocks them out, and takes them to the remote farmhouse where she lives with her mutant son Fabian (Steve Little). There's so much sex in the world, and she can't stand the thought that her sweet child will never get to have any of it. The mother wheels Fabian in, places Bernice nearby with a front-row view, and — wait for it — demands that Sandi fuck her son. Rohal pays lip-service to the idea that parents will do anything for their children, but this movie is much less interested in developing its themes than it is in watching Sandi fish around Fabian's innards for his Lovecraftian penis (spoiler alert: she finds it, and the massive appendage becomes a veritable character in its own right). But the grossness doesn't scale at a particularly engaging rate, and while Rohal's agenda required a certain amount of cheekiness to validate the fun of its own shock value, it's hard to overlook the reality that “Fuck My Son!” is far less disturbing than the movie promised by its title. For all of its eldritch horrors (Fabian's penis eventually penetrates almost everything you can imagine, with child rape being the most obvious red line that Rohal won't cross), this heightened story is too “fun” to be even half as fucked up as the things we read in the headlines every day, and not funny enough for its increasingly whacked out “WTF”-ness to be enjoyable on its own terms. What meaning there is behind “Fuck My Son!” is easy enough to understand: Enjoy this kind of garbage while you can, because it won't be long before late night TV hosts are locked in jail, Donald Trump starts talking about Eddington as if it were a real town he saw on Fox News, and everyone who saw “One Battle After Another” is labeled as a card-carrying member of Antifa (the “A” in “AMC A-List” stands for “Anarchy”). “Fuck My Son!” opens at the IFC Center in New York City on Thursday, October 16, before traveling to other theaters around the country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alec Baldwin and his brother Stephen Baldwin were involved in a vehicle crash in The Hamptons on Monday, Oct. 13, TMZ reports. The two got in the accident when “they barreled head-first into a tree as they drove in their Range Rover.” In them, Baldwin and his brother are seen talking with police, as well as in another photo showing Baldwin appearing very stressed while speaking on the phone. And then a garbage truck can be seen in another shot; however, the owner told TMZ that the truck's driver was not at fault. What's not clear is who was driving and who owns the Range Rover,” the outlet writes, adding that they reached out to the Hampton Police Department for ore information but have yet to hear back. TMZ also reached out to representatives for Alec and Stephen Baldwin, but there has been no response. A post shared by Alec Baldwin (@alecbaldwininsta) Following the crash, Baldwin posted a video on his Instagram, updating fans. “I just want to post a quick message. I got all these inquiries about my car thing this morning. I was in a car accident this morning. My brother Stephen was out visiting me on Long Island, and we spent the weekend out there for the film festival,” he said. It has been a rough couple of years for Baldwin, who has been dealing with the fallout from the tragic accident that occurred on the set of the Western movie “Rust,” where Baldwin was holding a prop revolver that went off and killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Baldwin faced involuntary manslaughter charges, which were filed in January 2024 due to negligent use of a firearm without due caution or circumspection. But, in 2024, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer, threw out the charge after finding that prosecutors withheld key evidence from the defense. When the charges were thrown out by the judge, Baldwin was overcome with emotion, seen breaking down in tears. A post shared by Alec Baldwin (@alecbaldwininsta) In Week 4 on this season of “Dancing with the Stars,” Baldwin's wife, Hilaria was eliminated. “It was wonderful to be able to support you as you support us every day,” he wrote. Baldwin was in the crowd each and every week to support his wife, and was even seen with the Kardashian family matriarch. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The same can't be said of Linda Liddle (Rachel McAdams), one of only two plane crash survivors in Sam Raimi‘s latest thriller, Send Help. The other, as you probably already guessed, is her employer Bradley Preston, played with appropriately off-putting swagger by Dylan O'Brien. But while most of us in Linda's position would likely be the ones calling for help out of this literal nightmare scenario, Linda sees only opportunity. As it turns out, Linda is actually quite good at the game of tropical survival. Better yet, they're “not in the office anymore” and, at least in Linda's estimation, “No help is coming.” It's a perfect chance for her to give herself a little promotion. “You are stuck with an asshole boss, just like I was,” she tells her new subordinate. It's not just the genre legend's first non-Marvel feature in over a decade (since 2013's Oz The Great And Powerful), but an entirely original film based on no existing IP. “I found the two lead characters, Linda and Bradley, to be complex, human, and constantly at odds with each other in often conflicting situations,” Raimi recently told Entertainment Weekly of the Damian Shannon and Mark Swift-penned script.

Will Eubank directs (Land of Bad, Underwater) from a script by Chris Papasadero and Oscar nominee Randall Wallace (Braveheart, We Were Soldiers). Pic is produced by David Zelon and William Sherak. His first feature, Love, was a breakout success, playing at numerous film festivals and won the Santa Barbara International Film Festival's “Best of the Fest” award. The filmmaker is repped by CAA, Anonymous Content, and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole LLP (JSSK).

But to many horror fans, his sole original directorial outing of the 2000s remains his best work of the century: “Drag Me to Hell.” Anyone who prefers their Raimi films bloody, darkly funny, and reminiscent of his '80s and '90s output has likely been longing for another film in that vein for years — and now they might be getting their wish with “Send Help.” Related Stories ‘The Mastermind' Review: Josh O'Connor Is an Art Thief Hijacked by His Own Heist in Kelly Reichardt's Jazzy 1970s Throwback 2025 Critics Choice Documentary Awards Nominations Led by ‘Orwell: 2+2=5' Raimi's new film, which hits theaters in January and released its first trailer today, is a psychological thriller set on a deserted island in which two co-workers (Rachel McAdams and Dylan O'Brien) are stranded together after a plane crash. “I've always loved stories where interesting, dynamic characters are pushed to extremes,” Raimi said in a press release. “In our story, the power shifts create an escalating situation that's brimming with unexpected turns and suspense.” “Send Help” is written by Damian Shannon & Mark Swift, with frequent Raimi collaborator Danny Elfman composing the original score. Raimi produces alongside Zainab Azizi and JJ Hook. In addition to recent films like “Locked” and “Don't Move,” he continues to oversee a steady flow of new “Evil Dead” movies (next up: “Evil Dead Burn” in 2026) and has teased a desire to return to the “Spider-Man” franchise with Tobey Maguire. A 20th Century Studios release, “Send Help” opens in theaters on Friday, January 30. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: James Norton has been tapped to play The Beatles longtime manager Brian Epstein in Sam Mendes' The Beatles — A Four-Film Cinematic Event, sources tell Deadline. With each of the Mendes-directed Beatles films telling the story of a different member of the band, unknown how significant a role he'd have in each film but given Epstein's influence on group, he is expected to be featured in each film. Epstein first met the Beatles in 1961 at a lunchtime concert at Liverpool's Cavern Club and even though he had no experience managing musicians, Epstein put them under contract. He also attempted to get the Beatles a recording contract, eventually securing a deal with EMI's Parlophone label. Mendes will direct from scripts written by Jez Butterworth, Peter Straughan and Jack Thorne, as we told you first, though it's unclear which projects each is tackling. A collaboration between Sony Pictures Entertainment and Mendes' Neal Street Productions, the films will be produced by Mendes, Pippa Harris and Julie Pastor of Neal Street, as well as Alexandra Derbyshire, in association with Apple Corps for Sony Pictures. Norton is no stranger to biopics about legendary musicians recently appearing in Paramount's Bob Marley pic Bob Marley: One Love. Norton can be seen in the highly anticipated Netflix limited series House Of Guinness which recently premiered on the streamer last month. He is repped by WME and The Artists Partnership.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>R&B legend D'Angelo has died at 51 years old following a battle with cancer, the singer's family confirmed in a statement on Tuesday (Oct. 14). “The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,” the statement, which was shared with Billboard, began. “After a prolonged and courageous battle with cancer, we are heartbroken to announce that Michael D'Angelo Archer, known to his fans around the world as D'Angelo, has been called home, departing this life today, Oct. 14, 2025.” “We are saddened that he can only leave dear memories with his family, but we are eternally grateful for the legacy of extraordinarily moving music he leaves behind,” the statement continued. “We ask that you respect our privacy during this difficult time but invite you all join us in mourning his passing while also celebrating the gift of song that he has left for the world.” Born Michael Archer in Richmond, Va., D'Angelo became a pioneer of the neo-soul movement in the mid-'90s while pulling on elements of hip-hop, jazz, gospel, R&B and funk. He broke through co-producing the top 40 Billboard Hot 100 hit “U Will Know” for Black Men United in 1994. D'Angelo released his Brown Sugar debut album in 1995 on EMI to critical acclaim. The LP was powered by lead single “Brown Sugar” (No. D'Angelo made an appearance on Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in 1998 and the iconic singer's much-delayed Brown Sugar follow-up, Voodoo, arrived in January 2000 via Virgin Records. Voodoo was preceded by a triumvirate of singles with “Devil's Pie,” “Left & Right” (No. 70) and “Untitled (How Does It Feel),” which reached No. The groovy Raphael Saadiq co-produced hit peaked at No. D'Angelo's sophomore album was a commercial success, debuting atop the Billboard 200 in February 2000 with 320,000 total album units earned in its opening set. His third and final album finally arrived in December 2014, as Black Messiah topped the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. He also won best male R&B vocal performance in 2001 for “Untitled (How Does It Feel”) and  best R&B song in 2016 for “Really Love.” The latter hit was also nominated for record of the year, his only nomination in a “Big Four” category. Tributes have continued to pour in on social media from peers around music, including comments from Tyler, the Creator, Jill Scott, E-40, Royce Da 5'9 and Timbaland.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Has anyone been more employed on the festival circuit this year than Josh O'Connor? The Challengers actor stars in Oliver Hermanus' History Of Sound, Kelly Reichardt's The Mastermind, and Rian Johnson's Wake Up Dead Man, all of which already have teasers or trailers for those of us who couldn't make it to Cannes or Toronto. Now, we also have a trailer for Rebuilding, O'Connor's fourth festival film of the year. Max Walker-Silverman's sophomore feature bowed this past January at Sundance, and if the trailer is any indication, it'll be another great addition to the growing canon of melancholy but beautiful O'Connor-led films. In the “gently humanist” story, O'Connor plays Dusty, a Colorado rancher and “reserved, divorced father whose ranch has burned down in a devastating wildfire,” per the film's synopsis. While he said the experience of returning to the formerly “green and magnificent” expanse was “sad in countless ways,” it also provided a sliver of hope: “There was green too. And seeing the small stubborn ways that nature returns was so fascinating it left hardly any space for sadness at all.” Peacemaker goes out on a series high with "Full Nelson" By Jarrod Jones October 10, 2025 | 11:24am There's only one movie you need to understand The Smashing Machine's Mark Kerr By Jacob Oller October 6, 2025 | 8:00am SPLINTERTrump Bankrupted Tons of Crypto Bros and Caused Its Biggest Wipeout Ever With One TruthSocial Post</p>

The book, which started out of a strike-induced desire to channel energy into a creative project, covers all the topics he knows people want to hear about. Mainly: his very public whirlwind romance (and equally whirlwind divorce) with celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton and the time that a video of an accidentally un-muted director criticizing his apartment during an audition (“These poor people live in these tiny apartments”) went viral. Gage also spends significant time reflecting on his childhood in San Diego and opens up about his recent borderline personality diagnosis.

How does releasing a book feel, especially compared to promoting your acting work?With acting, if you get a bad review, you can kind of blame it on the writing or the director or the editing. There's so many things that are not in your control. This book is just me, so there's no one to blame. No, I do give a shit what people think. We live in such a weird time right now where anyone can get famous overnight. It was chaotic, and I'm still kind of juggling that. A lot of people write memoirs and either don't think about, or forget, that people are going to read it. Oh yeah, I was very much aware that everything I was writing would be out in the world. The title is a double entendre, it's me seeking attention and validation and understanding from the world and reaching out, but it was also me seeking that for myself. What is your current relationship to reading about yourself online? There was this really weird side of myself that fed off this dark, negative criticism — and I was fueling it by only searching for the bad things. I'm always going to be a curious little freak, but I don't need to let it consume me anymore. I don't need to be so involved with what Sally from Ohio hates about me and my book and my face. But anyone who says they don't read reviews and stuff at all is full of shit. When you read through your old journals to write about your childhood years, what stuck out to you must? I lied so much to my own journal. Lying was a tool to help me get out of certain situations, but I didn't realize how much it was also a tool to change my own narrative about myself. Did you give any of your exes a heads up that you'd be writing about your relationships with them? Being cordial is fine, but I don't try to keep up conversations with them. And there are two sides to every story, so if their perception of what happened is different than mine, involving them gets messy. Some people are more obscured; you have a character called The Ex that I thought was Chris Appleton at first. There was no way to obscure my ex-husband's identity because that relationship played out so publicly. There's also just less to say about it. Do you expect to hear from people who are in the book? Even the people where it's like, I know you hate me and our relationship's fractured, but here's the book. I was a little surprised that you wrote about the experience of your video with the director critiquing your apartment, mostly because I figured you'd be sick of talking about it by now. Did you wrestle with wanting to just move on? I've been asked about it so much, but also in short interviews you can only sort of deliver sound bites on it. I wanted to explore the parts I haven't been able to talk about, which is that even though I chose to post the video, it didn't come without its repercussions. I didn't want to get anyone canceled. Getting recognition for the first time, as the kid who got made fun of for his apartment, wasn't on my vision board. Do you still feel like a working actor? Yes, my career isn't much different than it was five years ago. But I think being competitive fires me up. I am really excited for Rosebush Pruning, this film I'm in with people like Riley Keough, Callum Turner, Elle Fanning. I've never played a role in a film that is this substantial; I'm mostly just like doing jump scares into TV shows and then leaving, so I think this is going to show people a different side of me.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Julianna Barwick and Mary Lattimore have joined forces for a new tour and album. Tragic Magic is a work of “musical telepathy,” says Barwick, who has collaborated with Lattimore on a string of songs and remixes, most recently the Adult Swim single “Canyon Lights.” The album arrives January 16, 2026, via InFiné, and the duo's dates in North America and Europe kick off the following month. Find their full itinerary below, along with the album art and tracklist. Co-produced by Trevor Spencer, Tragic Magic was recorded in the wake of the January 2025 wildfires in California, to which “Melted Moon” is a response. The song is accompanied by a live performance video, shot at Lou Lou's Jungle Room at San Diego's Lafayette Hotel and directed by Joel Kazuo Knoernschild. The album also includes a song written by Roger Eno (“Temple of the Winds”) and a Vangelis cover (“Rachel's Song”). 11-07 Utrecht, Netherlands - Le Guess Who?02-14 Los Angeles, CA - Sid the Cat Auditorium02-15 San Francisco, CA - Great American Music Hall02-17 Seattle, WA - Crocodile02-18 Portland, OR - Mississippi Studios03-12 Chicago, IL - Thalia Hall03-14 Kalamazoo, MI - Bell's Eccentric Cafe03-15 Ann Arbor, MI - The Ark03-17 Toronto, Ontario - Great Hall03-18 Montreal, Quebec - Gesu03-19 Boston, MA - Arts at The Armory03-20 Philadelphia, PA - First Unitarian Church03-24 Washington, DC - Miracle Theater03-25 Raleigh, NC - Rialto Theatre03-26-29 Knoxville, TN - Big Ears Festival04-10 Paris, France - Philharmonie de Paris (Musée de la Musique)04-11 London, England - EartH Theatre04-12 Copenhagen, Denmark - DR Koncerthuset, Studie 204-13 Stockholm, Sweden - Fasching04-14 Helsinki, Finland - G Live Lab04-16 Oslo, Norway - HIMMEL04-17 Brussels, Belgium - Église Notre Dame de Laeken04-18 Amsterdam, Netherlands - BIMHUIS04-19 Berlin, Germany - Silent Green-Kuppelhalle04-21 Düdingen, Switzerland - Bad Bonn 01 Perpetual Adoration02 The Four Sleeping Princesses03 Temple of the Winds04 Haze with No Haze05 Rachel's Song06 Stardust07 Melted Moon Pitchfork may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In October 1971, John Lennon is turning 31, coming off his first post-Beatles success with Plastic Ono Band, about to hit Number One with his brand new Imagine. But he and Yoko Ono feel bored in their lavish English country mansion Tittenhurst Park, even after building a studio and cutting most of Imagine there. As he shrugs, “We didn't like being Lord and Lady of the Manor.” They thrive on the city's electric energy, with neighbors like Bob Dylan and Allen Ginsberg. They get their counterculture tickets punched by every two-bit hippie hustler in town. Power to the People gathers the music they made in their New York radical days, in a giant box set with their son Sean Ono Lennon as producer and creative director — nine CDs, 3 Blu-Rays, with a 204-page book. It follows two superb deluxe boxes devoted to Imagine and Mind Games, but this package has a trickier task: salvaging the dodgy 1972 album Sometime in New York City. In a clever strategic move, it downplays the album to focus on live material, outtakes, acoustic home demos, for a documentary of the busy hippie energy swirling around the couple during this brief interlude in their lives. They hooked up with a greasy bar band called Elephant's Memory, though smartly recruiting their pal Jim Keltner on drums, crediting the whole thing to “John & Yoko/Plastic Ono Band with Elephant's Memory Plus Invisible Strings.” The cover declared “Ono News That's Fit to Print.” It also had producer Phil Spector's face and the caption “To Know Him Is To Love Him.” Alas, as 1970s ex-Beatle albums go, Sometime ranks with George's Dark Horse, Wings' Wild Life, and Ringo's Bad Boy at the bottom of the barrel. John and Yoko sing about their new celebrity-radical buddies, marijuana laws, prison conditions (“Attica State, Attica State, we're all mates with Attica State”), the Troubles in Northern Ireland (“you Anglo pigs!”), with sentimental slogans and half-assed music. John keeps cheering “What a bad-ass city,” flipping off the Feds trying to deport him. John Lennon's Famed ‘Lost Weekend' Glasses Expected to Sell for $400,000 at Auction A Toast to Taylor and Travis: This Love Changed the Prophecy It was Ono's unfortunate title for a confrontational feminist message, though she could have gotten a better title out of the key line, “Woman is the slave to the slaves.” It's the only moment on Sometime where Lennon faces up to his complicity as part of the oppression, since everyday misogyny was part of his life in ways that “Attica State” and “John Sinclair” weren't. You can hear that John is terrified, with a nervous gum-snapping edge in his voice that suits tough tales like “It's So Hard” and “Well Well Well.” You can also hear that the back-up sweathogs in Elephant's Memory sincerely believe they're qualified for this gig, with no qualms about showing off. (Hilariously diplomatic comment from Sean Ono Lennon in the liner notes: “Let's just say, if I was in a band with John Lennon, I wouldn't solo over his voice when he's singing.”) There's a great live “Hound Dog,” enhanced by Yoko's canine howls and John spluttering “Elvis, I love ya!” in the final verse. “This is what you call an encore,” he tells the crowd. You gotta be the encore too!” That leads into “Give Peace a Chance,” with Stevie Wonder singing along. In an early outtake of “New York City,” John rails against “that clean, clean, fuckin' recorded sound which I hate.” There's little of that cleanliness here. The new remixes include longer versions of “Sunday Bloody Sunday” and “John Sinclair.” There's a disc of raw studio jams on Fifties rock & roll oldies like “Honey Don't,” “Yakety Yak,” and “Ain't That a Shame.” They rough it up at political rallies and TV chat-shows. There's the “Live Jam” material that stretched the original Sometime into a pricey double—getting noisy at the Fillmore with Frank Zappa's Mothers, recruiting friends in 1969 (Eric Clapton, Keith Moon, good old George Harrison) for a 16-minute feedback jam on “Don't Worry Kyoko.” There's also a bizarro reggae version of “Give Peace a Chance” featuring none other than Jerry Lewis, from his Labor Day MDA Telethon. The studio banter is full of humor that doesn't necessarily show up on the finished album, like when Yoko begins “Born in a Prison” with the words, “I'm going to be singing either in Liza Minnelli style or Yoko Ono style.” After “Sunday Bloody Sunday,” John quips, “Sorry Paul, it's all over now,” since even he realizes that he's failed to meet the not-terribly-lofty standard of Wings' “Give Ireland Back to the Irish.” (Macca's song about the infamous Bloody Sunday massacre might have been clumsy, but at least he wasn't singing, “It's those mothers' time to burn!” Let's just say the bar was pretty low for Bono.) The final disc is pure joy: John alone with his guitar, in previously unreleased 1971 hotel tapes. He drifts away into beautifully fragile solo reveries on Fifties rock & roll tunes from his idols like Buddy Holly, Little Richard, and Elvis Presley, with witty romps through “Hi-Heel Sneakers” and “Slippin' and Slidin'.” There's also previously unheard acoustic demos of originals like the poetically poignant ballad “When the Teacher,” cut in an Ann Arbor hotel room in December 1971. He also teams up with protest singer Phil Ochs, playing back-up guitar as Ochs sings familiar standards like “I Ain't Marching Anymore.” He rages, “I'm really sick and tired of fighting E.M.I./Capitol—who over the years have fucked up some of my/our most radical, and effective covers—including the now rare and expensive — Beatle meat 'n' babies picture — not to mention ‘Two Virgins' (another classic! What ‘Monster: The Ed Gein Story' Gets Right and Wrong Suspect in Palisades Fire Allegedly Used ChatGPT to Generate Images of Burning Forests and Cities John and Yoko shied away from making any personal statements in their protest period — there's nothing like “Oh My Love” or “Oh Yoko!” here. On Election Night 1972, they went to Jerry Rubin's place to watch the results as Nixon won 49 states; Lennon got drunk and went into the next room to have sex with another woman while Ono just sat there. (She turned the experience into her song “Death of Samantha.”) Their romantic and radical ideals collapsed together. Less than a year after releasing Sometime in New York City, the couple separated. John jetted off to L.A. for his Lost Weekend — guzzling his weight in Brandy Alexanders, getting thrown out of bars with Harry Nilsson, jamming with Paul and Elton, making the scene with his groovy new muse May Pang. Instead, it frames these songs in the context of a short-lived but creative interlude in the tangled lives of two complex artists. Before the Lost Weekend, John and Yoko had their New York Year — turning their personal confusions into beautifully vivid moments of rage and pain.</p>
