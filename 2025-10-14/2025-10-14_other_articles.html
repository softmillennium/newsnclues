Alex Jones, host of Infowars, at a November 2020 rally in Atlanta, Georgia

The US Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal by far right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of the $1.4 billion in damages he has been ordered to pay for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax.

The top court turned down Jones's appeal of the defamation judgment without comment.

Jones, founder of the website InfoWars and host of a popular radio show, has been found liable in multiple lawsuits brought by relatives of the victims of the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, which left 20 children and six teachers dead.

Jones claimed for years on his show that the Sandy Hook shooting was "staged" by gun control activists and that the parents were "crisis actors," but has since acknowledged it was "100 percent real."

Sandy Hook families maintained that Jones's lies and denialism, coupled with his ability to influence the beliefs of thousands of followers, caused real emotional trauma.

Jones filed for personal bankruptcy in his home state of Texas after losing the defamation case.

Free Speech Systems, the Texas-based parent company of InfoWars, also declared bankruptcy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicole Briese is a contributing writer at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2022. Her work has previously appeared in Us Weekly, Brides and MTV News. The Amityville house at 108 Ocean Ave. in Amityville, N.Y., is one of the most famous haunted houses in history, but both its backstory and its current paranormal status have been hotly contested. Its legend grew with the release of a 1979 movie based on the book starring James Brolin and Margot Kidder that later spawned an extensive film franchise. Though the home was the site of a gruesome mass murder in 1974, Anson's book is centered on a series of strange occurrences that reportedly took place in 1975 that caused its inhabitants, George and Kathleen Lutz, to flee their new residence just 28 days after moving in. “[People] ask if I think what the Lutzes told me is true," Anson told Writer's Digest in 1979. But I'm sure that the Lutzes believe what they told me to be true.” Here's everything to know about the events that took place in the Amityville house, what happened to it after the alleged hauntings and who owns it today. The Amityville House was a normal family home until 1965, when Ron and Louise DeFeo moved in with their four children, with another on the way. On Nov. 13, 1974, the couple's 23-year-old son Ronald Jr. “Butch” DeFeo shot his parents and his four siblings — Dawn, Allison, Marc and John Matthew — to death at what he claimed was the command of “voices.” Ronald Jr. was later convicted of all the murders and sentenced to six consecutive sentences of 25 years to life in prison, per A&E. As seen in the movie, George and Kathleen Lutz, who moved in with their three children one year after the DeFeo killings, claimed they experienced a host of paranormal activity during their time in the house, including levitation and temporary paralysis. The Lutzes also claimed they saw green slime oozing from the walls, a door being ripped off its hinge and demonic presences in the home — most notably, a pig-like creature with red eyes that glowed from the “eye-shaped” windows. George told ABC in 2016 that the scene in which a priest visits the home and is told to “get out” by an unknown voice was real. George addressed the doubt surrounding his family's story in a 1977 interview with PEOPLE, saying, “If we had tried to perpetrate some kind of hoax, I think we would have been much surer of when and how things happened, because we would have been inventing them." In 1979, he suggested that those who didn't believe him weren't close enough to the case, telling The Washington Post, “Our critics are people who've never been in the house, just people who read a book. No one who was ever in the house, who investigated it, ever called it a hoax. No one with any credentials who was personally involved ever called it a hoax.” Ronald Jr.'s defense lawyer, William E. Weber, claimed to PEOPLE in 1979 that he and Lutz planned the book's plot together. "I know this book's a hoax," he said. "We created this horror story over many bottles of wine.” “I told George Lutz that Ronnie DeFeo used to call the neighbor's cat a pig," he said. George doubled down on his claims in a 2002 interview with ABC. I couldn't get warm in the house for many days." The former Amityville house owner claimed that he was awoken every night at 3:15 a.m., the approximate time Ronald Jr. is said to have killed his family. George also told ABC that he saw his wife levitate and move across the bed. The couple's children, however, had mixed beliefs about their parents' claims. Daniel, one of the sons, told the New York Post in 2012, “My brother and myself shared a levitation experience in our beds. The Conjuring movie series is based on some of the most famous investigations done by paranormal experts Ed and Lorraine throughout their careers. While the Amityville house is not a focus of the films, it spawned its own franchise of more than 15 movies that can be considered Conjuring-adjacent. “If you gave me one billion dollars, I wouldn't go in that house again,” Lorraine has said of the Amityville house, claiming that she levitated inside the residence. In 1960, the couple's daughter sold their home to John and Mary Riley, who lived there for five years without incident before selling the property to Ron and Louise. One year after they were killed in 1974, the house was purchased by George and Kathleen, who fled just 28 days after moving in. In 1997, Brian Wilson purchased the house for $310,000. Wilson ultimately sold it to Caroline and David D'Antonio for $950,000. It remained on the market until March 2017, when it sold to a couple for $605,000, per the New York Post. Barbara, who moved into the house with her husband James in 1977, told PEOPLE that “everything was a hoax.” James expressed a similar sentiment to Newsday. "Nothing weird ever happened, except for people coming by because of the book and the movie," he said. Its current owners have not publicly commented on the space. As the Amityville house is a private residence, public visitors are not welcome at the property, which was changed from its original address to deter fans from seeking it out. Hundreds of horror buffs were able to get a glimpse of the property in 2010, however, when the home was opened up for a moving sale.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This series, coordinated and moderated by Ignasi Ribas, a researcher at the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia and the Institute of Space Sciences of the CSIC, will explore innovative research and cutting-edge projects in astrobiology with figures such as Charles Cockell, David Kipping, Frances Westall and Laura Kreidberg. On Tuesdays from 21 October to 11 November, the CosmoCaixa Science Museum will host the series of lectures ‘The Frontiers of Astrobiology', which offers a journey to the limits of astrobiology to explore how and where life could exist outside Earth. In four lectures, different specialists will address the study of extremophile microorganisms as a model for assessing the habitability of other worlds, the origin of life on Earth to recognise biological signals on distant planets, the comparison between our solar system and other planetary systems to understand whether Earth is unique or shares features with other habitable worlds, and the latest advances in answering the big question: Are we alone in the universe? ', which explores our fascination with the idea of extraterrestrial life and how we have imagined worlds beyond our own, and projects some possible futures through science and technology. The series kicks off on 21 October at CosmoCaixa with the lecture ‘Extreme Life on Earth and in Space' by Dr Charles Cockell, an international authority on the study of life in extreme conditions. In this session, he will discuss how microorganisms manage to survive in inhospitable environments and what this reveals about the possible habitability of other worlds. Based on pioneering research, some of it carried out in underground laboratories or during space missions, the lecture will offer the keys to understanding this knowledge, which drives exploration and future human settlement in space, and will bring us closer to the possibility of determining whether microbial life could exist beyond Earth. The second session will take place on 28 October and is entitled ‘Searching for extraterrestrials... through time'. In this meeting, David Kipping, PhD in Physics and Astronomy, will address the question of our place in the cosmos based on the few reliable data available. He will analyse the silence of the universe, without signals, and why these apparent absences impose limits on what could exist. With a critical eye, he will also explain how humanity's short technological history conditions the search and will present plausible scenarios for future contact and its impact on space exploration. Dr Westall will also share with attendees her research on the oldest biological traces on Earth and how they guide the exploration of exoplanets. This scientist, whose career ranges from the discovery of fossilised bacteria in marine sediments to working at NASA, will offer a unique insight into early geobiological processes and their usefulness in recognising life on Mars and beyond. To close this cycle, on Tuesday 11 November, Dr Laura Kreidberg, PhD in Astrophysics, will give a lecture entitled ‘Is Earth really special?'. The expert will discuss whether Earth is an exceptional planet or just one of thousands discovered outside the solar system. Thanks to the James Webb Space Telescope, it is now possible to study the atmospheres of similar worlds and assess their potential habitability. Kreidberg will explore the latest advances in this search and analyse Earth-like worlds, from lava planets with constantly changing atmospheres to systems that reveal unique secrets about planetary evolution. Charles Cockell obtained his first degree in Biochemistry from the University of Bristol and his DPhil in Molecular Biophysics from the University of Oxford. He is currently a member of NASA's Scientific Analysis Group for the Search for Life, which evaluates upcoming astrobiological missions to Mars. David Kipping is a British-American astronomer and associate professor at Columbia University. He holds a PhD in Science from the University of Cambridge and a PhD in Physics and Astronomy from University College London. He has been recognised with several awards and distinctions, including the Kavli Fellow in 2019, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship in 2018, and Popular Science magazine's annual Brilliant 10 award in 2015. He has created the YouTube channel Cool Worlds. Frances Westall holds a PhD in Geology from the University of Cape Town and a postdoctorate in Marine Geology from the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany. She was director of research at the CNRS laboratory, Centre for Molecular Biophysics, in Orleans, where she led the Exobiology Group until 2021. Since 2022, Westall has been professor emeritus at the CNRS laboratory and is dedicated to her research and writing scientific articles. Laura Kreidberg is an astrophysicist and director of the APEx (Atmospheres and Processes of Exoplanets) Department at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. She is a Clay Fellow at the Harvard & Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics and a Harvard Junior Fellow.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, like most long-running shows, the popular horror series was criticized for fumbling its ending. After going up against countless foes and even God himself, fans felt it was justified that Supernatural's favorite character was given the happy ending he deserved all along. However, the million-dollar question is, did Dean want what everyone thought he wanted? Was dying on a hunt the goodbye that Supernatural had always intended for its most exciting lead? Dying is subjective in the world of Supernatural. Dean's resurrection in Season 4 and return from Hell set a precedent that the higher purpose associated with the Winchester bloodline wasn't going to be endangered by something as mere as death. Therefore, whether it was intentional or accidental, Sam and Dean died and came back to life at least a dozen times in the course of 15 seasons. That's why, after a certain point, it became routine for the brothers to leverage death in favor of completing the mission, giving the impression that it was a luxury that they could manipulate. Sam arrived just in time for a final goodbye and to hear his brother say the words he had been saying since the very beginning; for Sam to live a long, normal life. However, why couldn't Dean find it in his heart to have the same wish? What's more, why couldn't the show give Dean or the audience some closure, especially when his character had gone through valuable changes? It felt too ordinary for a legendary character like Dean to go out on a random vampire hunt after surviving angels, demons, and God's wrath. From the moment Dean called Sam for help in the first episode to his final farewell, he had been on a continuous journey with an ever-evolving character. Throughout the series, Dean slowly learned that he was more than a soldier and his brother's keeper. Therefore, it seemed more frustrating than befitting to disregard all that character development in favor of such a mundane end. On the other hand, it's highly likely the show might have been going for a grounded death for Dean after having so many near-death experiences in epic battles. It might have been symbolic of how, after everything, Dean was only human. Even if they hadn't fought angels and monsters from Purgatory, Dean might have died anyway on some random hunt, maybe even without his brother. Unfortunately, even if fans were to accept this explanation after almost five years, it still completely undermines every facet of Dean's character development. Even if it had been for a little while, Dean deserved some downtime of his own. It couldn't have been explicitly for family, but he could have at least said goodbye to the hunting world after being consistently at war for more than a decade. He was practically thrown into this tumultuous life by his father and was forced to play a parental role when he himself needed one. Therefore, that insatiable need for "hunting things and family business" was only an unintended consequence of being on the road with John. Luckily, Sam had the opportunity to get out, but Dean had been hardwired to believe, because of his circumstances, that he was the one to carry the burden, whether it was of supporting his father or protecting Sam. Regardless, even if it felt that Dean was meant to be a hunter all along, that was not the emotional input his character deserved, especially in the end. Supernatural implied that Dean died doing what he loved, but he would have loved more to have a little piece of the average life. It's safe to say that, in contrast to the lukewarm effect of the finale, episodes like "Regarding Dean" had more depth and heart. This particular episode is more meaningful than what the series finale intended to deliver. It was an underrated storyline that highlighted Dean's sentimental value and poignancy in the narrative, in addition to being the show's constant comic relief. Seeing the helplessness in both Sam and Dean's eyes as the latter slowly loses his sense of identity is what fans truly deserved out of Dean's final goodbye. To him, forgetting himself was far more significant than hunting or saving the world, proving Dean was more than everyone's sacrificial lamb or hero. Dean had finally learned that his life was worth something and that he didn't need to lay it down every chance he got. His sense of self-preservation had been dormant for so long that it took him quite a while to value his life, but in the end, it amounted to pretty much nothing with that run-of-the-mill vampire hunt. After ascending to Heaven, Dean continued to explore multiple timelines, fighting the good fight and looking after his parents in a universe where they had a happy ending. Ultimately, it all boils down to the fact that Dean Winchester's legacy is too big to end, and it even transcends time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Peruvian bishop submitted his resignation to Pope Leo after a Vatican investigation revealed that he was secretly dating multiple women simultaneously. 51-year-old Ciro Quispe Lopez, the bishop of Juli, in Peru, stands accused of having up to 17 secret lovers. Although he denies the allegations against him as part of a defamation campaign by ‘dark hands', Lopez handed in his resignation to the Pope last month, more than two decades earlier than Catholic bishops usually retire. The Vatican investigation began after an investigation by Kevin Moncada, a journalist for the Peruvian newspaper Sin Fronteras, found that Ciro Quispe Lopez had been exchanging explicit messages, photos and videos with various women. On top of that, he accidentally sent pictures and videos intended for his mistresses to his house cleaner, who alerted the Catholic Church. “It was a real soap opera, but also lifted the lid on a serious abuse of power. “In April of last year, we received information that one of the bishop's alleged lovers had practically come to blows with another young woman, Kevin Moncada told Hildebrandt Magazine. Quispe is believed to have accidentally sent his house cleaner pictures and videos intended for his mistresses, which only confirmed her suspicions. The woman promptly filed a complaint to the Catholic Church, claiming that she had seen women's hair in his shower and that ‘his sheets had stains' which she had to clean. In light of all this evidence, Ciro Quispe Lopez was forced to hand in his resignation as bishop, even though he denies the charges against him.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, a group of spiritual investigators is hoping to separate fact from folklore — and turn their findings into a television series. This week, they've set their sights, and their equipment, on one of Denver's most storied venues: Ophelia's Electric Soapbox, housed inside the Airedale building. For more than a century, the Airedale Building has stood at 20th and Lawrence. According to paranormal investigators — and some current staff — not all those tenants have left. “There are two types of people in this world,” says investigator Arthur Schmidt. His search for proof has fueled decades of investigation — and now, a new TV project called Awakened: Haunted Wild West. According to Ophelia's managers, strange things have been happening inside the former saloon and hotel for years — some of it playful, some unexplainable. There's probably a few people here,” says general manager Rachel Noble. General Manager Rachel Noble recalls one encounter in the women's restroom: So I'm like, oh, not a big deal…Well, that shot out of the stall. '” The staff has even given their unseen resident a name: Ophelia. Noble describes the presence as “feminine and always very supportive of me and the other feminine leadership that we've had in this building. From lights flickering to music volumes mysteriously shifting during live sets, they've learned to work around their ghostly guest. One thing they agree on: “We've never felt that here [the spirit] is negative. The Awakened crew isn't just after jump scares. They're using history, storytelling, and advanced paranormal tools to collect evidence. They've also paired up with Dark Side of Denver Ghost Tours and a psychic medium, Carol Whitebear. “Even as a skeptic, I feel like it's still hard to deny,” says investigator James Doyle. “If you have gone through this, we've got your back. That's why he and his team try to “calm people down” while collecting evidence. For Schmidt, it's also about pushing viewers out of their comfort zones: “It's to open the light a little bit, open your eyes, your minds and hearts and souls, to really, what is there?” he said. Awakened: Haunted Wild West aims to give audiences more than campfire ghost tales. As Schmidt puts it: “This show is not to scare you, even though my crew and I will get into some very terrifying situations… Let's give voices to people who have gone through stuff like I did… and open up skeptics' minds.” If you want to catch the Awakened crew in action, Ophelia's Electric Soapbox will be the star of their next investigation — and maybe, whatever still resides inside, will make themselves known on camera. The show is still in production, so keep an eye out for updates on Awakened's social media accounts.</p>
