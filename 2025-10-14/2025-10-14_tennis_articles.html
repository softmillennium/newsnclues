                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zhu Lin won 16 of the last 19 points against an ailing Emma Raducanu in the AUX Ningbo Open first round, while Dayana Yastremska pulled off a second-set comeback to defeat Victoria Mboko and Karolina Muchova won an all-Czech derby over Marketa Vondrousova. Three champions at Grand Slam or WTA 1000 level took to the court on Tuesday at the AUX Ningbo Open, but none survived their first-round contests. Marketa Vondrousova returned to action for the first time since a knee injury forced her to withdraw ahead of her US Open quarterfinal against Aryna Sabalenka, and was knocked out by fellow Czech Karolina Muchova 6-4, 6-3. Finally, a physically ailing Emma Raducanu was defeated 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 by home favorite Zhu Lin. 31 Zhu was forced to miss the entire Chinese swing after an elbow injury sidelined her for six months. "This year, I'm trying my best to perform," she told the crowd in her on-court interview. 219 and competing in Ningbo as a wild card, Zhu's determination paid off as she scored her second Top 30 win since returning to action in January. The last four games of the first set all went to deuce, culminating in a riveting final game in which Raducanu saved three break points before converting her fifth set point with a forehand winner. She picked up where she left off in the second set, smothering Raducanu from the baseline with a series of cleanly-struck winners. Though Raducanu showed grit of her own to break Zhu back twice, the Chinese player never took her foot off the pedal and sealed the set with a third break of serve. A second medical time-out down 2-1 did not help matters. On resumption, Zhu rattled through 16 of the last 19 points of the match as Raducanu's resistance fell away. 1 seed Mirra Andreeva -- one of three players in the Ningbo draw still in contention for WTA Finals qualification. Yastremska snaps losing streak, Mboko's goes on Yastremska and Mboko came into Ningbo in similar positions. Both were on three-match losing streaks affected by health issues: Mboko sustained a wrist injury during her winning Montreal run, pulled out of Cincinnati, and on returning to action fell to Barbora Krejcikova at the US Open, Anastasia Potapova in Beijing and Ekaterina Alexandrova in Wuhan. Both sets followed a similar pattern: a bright start and a break lead for Yastremska, who then lapsed into error to lose her advantage before regaining her accuracy. 30-ranked Yastremska was two points from being taken to a decider four times trailing 5-2, but she began hitting her spots just enough to avoid facing a set point. Upon coming through that game, Yastremska suddenly rediscovered her best level, racing through nine of the next 10 points, three games in a row and ultimately the match after a dominant tiebreak. Yastremska will face another WTA Finals contender next, No. Muchova and Vondrousova aren't just compatriots but friends and members of the same club back at home in Prague. When they landed in Ningbo, they paired up for their first practise -- only to discover that the draw had pitted them against each other. "I'll talk for both of us that we didn't like to see it," Muchova said in her on-court interview. Two players who have suffered more than their fair share of injuries, both Muchova and Vondrousova have been sidelined for several months of this season alone. Though she came up with some delightful passing shots early on, Muchova repeatedly caught her out with a barrage of inside-out forehand winners. "I wish her the best," Muchova said afterwards. She's such a greeat player and great competitor and so talented, so I'm happy I was able to finish in two sets." 7 seed Diana Shnaider in an intriguing first-time encounter. Zhu Lin won 16 of the last 19 points against an ailing Emma Raducanu in the AUX Ningbo Open first round, while Dayana Yastremska pulled off a second-set comeback to defeat Victoria Mboko and Karolina Muchova won an all-Czech derby over Marketa Vondrousova.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Frenchman Arthur Cazaux captured his fourth ATP Challenger Tour title on Sunday to secure a new career-high in the PIF ATP Rankings. Following his triumph, the 23-year-old is now No. Jinan marks Cazaux's first Challenger trophy of this season, during which he has competed in five events at that level. The Montpellier native reached his first tour-level final this year in Kitzb√ºhel. ‚ÄúFirst title of the year!‚Äù Cazaux wrote on Instagram, adding a hashtag ‚Äò#loveindoors'.
