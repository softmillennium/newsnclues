                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global demonstrations — not Trump or Netanyahu — are the real reason why we have a ceasefire now, says Ofer Cassif. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. As President Trump addressed the Israeli Knesset on Monday, he was briefly interrupted by two lawmakers who waved signs reading “Recognize Palestine.” The two Knesset members, Ayman Odeh and Ofer Cassif with the Hadash-Ta'al alliance, were expelled from the chamber. “Yesterday, there was a disgusting display of flattery and personality cult by two megalomaniacs who are hungry for power and blood,” says Cassif. “This was a minimum protest against the policy of the genocidal government of Israel.” Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: We begin today's show in Israel, where the family members of the 20 remaining released hostages are welcoming their loved ones home. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. On Monday, as President Trump addressed the Israeli Knesset, a group of leftist Israeli lawmakers briefly interrupted his speech, shouting at President Trump and waving signs that said “Recognize Palestine.” PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Everybody loves Steve, and they respect him, and they somehow can relate to him. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That was very efficient. AMY GOODMAN: The two lawmakers were Ayman Odeh and Ofer Cassif. They're members of the Hadash-Ta'al alliance. Footage shows professor Rashid Khalidi's book, The Hundred Years' War on Palestine, resting on MK — that's member of Knesset — Cassif's desk as he's sitting before being ousted. He'll join us in a minute. Recognize the simple truth: There are two peoples here, and no one is going anywhere. We're joined now by Ofer Cassif, a Jewish Israeli member of the Knesset and the leftist Hadash-Ta'al coalition. Welcome back to Democracy Now!, sir. If you can start off by describing exactly what happened? You have for the first time President Trump addressing the Israeli Knesset, before taking off for Egypt, where he signed the ceasefire deal. OFER CASSIF: Well, first of all, thank you for having me. Yesterday, there was a disgusting display of flattery and personality cult by two megalomaniacs who are hungry for power and blood. That's the main bond between Netanyahu and Trump. And we used this opportunity, which I dare say, or I would like to say, that, luckily, doesn't happen too often, that someone like Trump attends the Knesset, and we used it to display our signs calling for the recognition of the state of Palestine. And all of that was taking place under the auspices of the governments of the United States, in plural — Biden and, later on, Trump. And this was our protest against the policy that both share. That's the reason we did it. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Ofer Cassif, I wanted to ask you the — there's been much made here in the United States of Trump's initiative to create this peace plan. But to what degree do you feel what happened in the weeks before, especially at the U.N. General Assembly, as one U.S. ally after another — Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, Portugal — recognized the state of Palestine — what impact do you think that had on pushing forward this ceasefire? People were terrified by the pictures from what was going on in Gaza. Those demonstrations, for sure, influenced, had their impact on Trump. And same about those leaders, like Sánchez in Spain or Petro in Colombia and others. There's no doubt that if we should thank someone for the end, for ending the genocide and releasing the Israeli hostages, it's not Trump, let alone Netanyahu. And the proof is that a couple of days ago, President Trump told Prime Minister Netanyahu — and I quote, almost word by word — “Israel cannot stand against the whole world.” Why did he say that? He said so specifically because he was witnessing those demonstrations and change of mood, including the recognition by 150 states, recognition of the state of Palestine, and the two-state solution. Alas, he still hasn't gone enough — far enough to say explicitly that the two-state solution and the liberation of the Palestinian people are a must. And I hope that he will. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what is your sense now of the impact on Israeli society and on your democracy of this peace plan, and the fate of Netanyahu in the future? OFER CASSIF: First of all, if I may refer to what you said about Israel as a democracy, it pops out to my mind, you know, something that Mahatma Gandhi said. He was asked once what he thought about British civilization, and he said, “I think it's a wonderful idea.” So, if you ask me what I think about the Israeli democracy, I would answer the same: I think it's a wonderful idea. Unfortunately, we are not there yet. But perhaps that's for another chat. But the influence of the change in the international atmosphere does influence the public discourse within Israel, still too little and too late, but it's better than nothing and never. You could see throughout those two years, and we participated in those demonstrations all the time, since the beginning. Within those demonstrations, there were two main voices. The other voice, which we led and was in the beginning in a tiny minority, said that we do, of course, care a lot and want to release the hostages and stop the bloodshed of Israeli soldiers, too, but, obviously, we also emphasized the terrible death toll and destruction, etc., in Gaza and of Palestinians. We were, in the beginning, quite isolated and marginalized, sometimes even physically attacked. But you could see that throughout, as time went by, we began to gain more and more support. So, that, of course, shows that the public discourse and the public opinion within Israel did shift. You could also see that in different organizations from below, so to speak, by workers, you know, social workers, physicians, professors, teachers, artists and the writers, who began to raise a voice in the last few months against the genocide in Gaza, using the term “genocide” clearly and explicitly, like the very famous writer David Grossman did in an interview to La Repubblica, an Italian newspaper. And no less importantly is that no less than 600 ex-generals in the so-called Israeli security services also signed a petition in which they referred to the ongoing situation in Gaza as ethnic cleansing and war crimes and called to stop that. AMY GOODMAN: During his address to the Knesset Monday, President Trump suggested Netanyahu should be pardoned on corruption charges. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Hey, I have an idea. Mr. President, why don't you give him a pardon? You know, whether we like it or not, this has been one of the greatest wartime presidents. AMY GOODMAN: So, that's President Trump calling for Netanyahu to be pardoned. Can you talk about the significance of this, Ofer Cassif? And for people to understand, many believe that he extended the assault on Gaza to extend his own trial, to put off the end of that trial. And we're not even talking here about the charges in the international court of crimes against humanity. OFER CASSIF: Absolutely, there's no doubt about it. If you put the all blame on Netanyahu, we miss a great deal of others who are totally blamed for the carnage that took place in Gaza and the sacrifice of the Israeli hostages, as well. Those are combined through — you know, totally, and there's no way to distinguish between them. So, Netanyahu, on the one hand, is interested only in his own good, just like Trump. I mean, those two psychopaths are good friends. So, as far as Netanyahu himself is concerned, from the very beginning, he was interested in doing whatever possible to stay in power, and, by that, to refrain from being behind bars. And because of that, he formed a coalition and a government that in the past he himself refused to form, because he knows exactly who we are dealing with. We are dealing with messianic bigots. We are dealing with little fascists. But Netanyahu decided to join forces with them, to add them, and to base his government and coalition on them, not only, by the way, in the sense of collaborating with bigots like Ben-Gvir and Smotrich — that is to say, to another parties — but to change the Likud party from within. Let's not forget that in the last few years, Netanyahu transformed totally the Likud party. The Likud party, which was never my cup of tea, but the Likud party had, you know, serious politicians, people with values, which I do not share, which I object, but still with values and some respect and commitment to democratic rules of the game. What Netanyahu did, once he understood that he may find himself in prison, is to get rid of those people and to substitute them and add others who are messianic and bigots and racists, no less than Smotrich, Ben-Gvir and their allies. So, all together, we can see a combination, a constellation, of a prime minister who is accused in serious corruption charges, who's afraid, as a coward, who is afraid of prison, together with messianic, fascist bigots who think that the blood of human beings, Israelis and Palestinians alike, is the red carpet of the Messiah. So, that's — that combination, actually, created the genocide in Gaza that took place and that continued for two years at the expense also of the Israeli hostages and soldiers. That's the key to understand what was going on. And when President Trump dares say that Netanyahu should get a pardon, first of all, of course, he intervenes in domestic issues which are not his business. But on top of that — and in my view, worse than that — is that he actually speaks the language of a mob, of the mob. AMY GOODMAN: Ofer Cassif, I want to thank you so much for being with us, member of the Israeli Knesset and the Hadash-Ta'al coalition. On Monday, he and the Palestinian parliamentarian Ayman Odeh were ousted from the Knesset during President Trump's speech, after the two shouted “terrorist” at Trump and held up signs that read “Recognize Palestine.” OFER CASSIF: I want to correct you, please. We didn't shout at all. We just held the sign, “Recognize Palestine.” That's it. AMY GOODMAN: And are you going to be allowed back into the Knesset, or were you expelled? At the moment, I am suspended anyway, until the end of December, because I dare say that there was genocide going on. But I appeal to the Supreme Court. Let's see what's going to happen. AMY GOODMAN: Well, when we come back, we're going to Physicians for Human Rights Israel in Ramallah to talk about the Gaza doctors who are still being held, imprisoned by Israel, including the pediatrician Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital. And we hope to go to Gaza, which has lost internet connection, but we hope to speak with Al Jazeera's Hani Mahmoud. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Governor says bill would cause sudden product shift, sparking debate among chefs, lawmakers and environmentalists Gavin Newsom vetoed a California bill that was set to ban the sale of cookware and other consumer goods manufactured with Pfas, also known as “forever chemicals”, human-made compounds linked to a range of health issues. The governor's decision on Monday followed months of debate and advocacy, including from high-profile celebrity chefs such as Thomas Keller and Rachael Ray, who argued that nonstick cookware made with Pfas, when manufactured responsibly, can be safe and effective and urged lawmakers to vote against the proposal. Newsom said in a statement that the legislation was “well-intentioned” but would affect too broad a swath of products and would result in a “sizable and rapid shift” of cooking products available in the state. Concerns over the use of Pfas, chemicals used to make cookware and other items non-stick and water-resistant, have grown significantly in recent years. Called “forever chemicals”, because they do not break down naturally, Pfas are used in non-stick cookware, waterproof mascara and dental floss, among other items. Pfas have been linked to a number of health issues, with some linked to high cholesterol, reproductive issues and cancer. The bill had the support of major environmental groups, as well as opposition from influential figures, such as Ray and Keller, and high-profile chefs who argued it would place an unfair burden on restaurants. Over the weekend, Newsom also vetoed legislation focused on racial justice, including a bill that would allowed universities to give the descendants of enslaved people preference in admissions preference, while approving funding for a reparations study. He also signed a bill allowing a wide range of family members to care for children if the federal government deports their parents.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Attorneys for Debbie Brockman, released with no charges, deny agent's claim she ‘threw objects' at border patrol car Attorneys representing a producer for Chicago's WGN television station who was temporarily detained by federal agents last week in Chicago, say the incident “should be alarming and horrifying to every person in this country”. Debbie Brockman, a US citizen and a WGN employee, was arrested on Friday by federal agents during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) operation in Chicago's Lincoln Square neighborhood. At the time, a homeland security official claimed that Brockman “threw objects at border patrol's car” and was “placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer”. In a news release issued by attorneys representing Brockman on Tuesday, which was sent to the Guardian as well as several Chicago news outlets, her lawyers disputed the government's account. They said they “adamantly deny any allegation that she assaulted anyone” and that “Brockman was the one who was violently assaulted by federal agents on her way to work” on 10 October. Her lawyers say that at the time of the arrest, Brockman was “not acting in any professional capacity as an employee for WGN” but that she was just “walking to the bus stop as part of her morning commute when she was attacked by Border Patrol agents. “Brockman, who is a US Citizen born in this country, was violently detained on Foster Avenue,” the statement continues. According to her lawyers, Brockman was held in federal custody for about seven hours before being released. Brad Thomson, one of her attorneys, added in the statement: “If armed, masked, federal agents are snatching US citizens off the street as they walk to work and throwing them in unmarked vehicles, you can only imagine what these agents must be willing to do to our immigrant neighbors and people who dare to speak out against them.</p>

Trump has claimed, without evidence, that the gunman was motivated by left-wing ideology, and has seized upon the killing as an opportunity to conduct a sweeping crackdown on leftists and his political opponents. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. “We of course unequivocally reject political violence,” the organizations wrote in their open letter. No president – Democrat or Republican – should have the power to punish nonprofit organizations simply because he disagrees with them.” Such actions are “not about protecting Americans or defending the public interest,” but rather “about using unchecked power to silence opposition and voices he disagrees with,” they continued. This attack on nonprofits is not happening in a vacuum, but as a part of a wholesale offensive against organizations and individuals that advocate for ideas or serve communities that the president finds objectionable, and that seek to enforce the rule of law against the federal government. The letter was published earlier this month, just a couple of weeks after Trump issued an executive order declaring that “antifa” is a domestic terrorist group. As part of his campaign against “antifa,” Trump said that the administration would be monitoring groups with “anti-American,” “anti-capitalist,” and “anti-Christian” views, as well as those who are “extreme” on issues of “migration, race and gender,” without providing legal specifics. For example, the directive orders the IRS to “take action to ensure that no tax-exempt entities are directly or indirectly financing political violence or domestic terrorism,” and to refer “such organizations, and the employees and officers of such organizations, to the Department of Justice for investigation and possible prosecution.” Beyond the open letter condemning Trump's plan to target left-leaning groups, several organizations' leaders have expressed dismay with the transparent attempt to interfere with their free speech rights. “President Trump's order mobilizing federal law enforcement to investigate perceived opponents of his administration turns reality on its head,” and “fabricates a nonexistent plot as a pretext to suppress speech and ideas across the U.S. political spectrum,” Human Rights Watch executive director Federico Borello said late last month. When the president uses his pen to take aim at anything, it will cause a chilling effect,” wrote Adam Goldstein, Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression vice president of Strategic Initiatives. What will the overreactions to this new memo look like? Donors ending their support because they don't want to risk an investigation? Groups being denied bank loans or leases because they're on a government list with no way to appeal that determination? Activists going underground because they want to challenge an orthodoxy, hiding their opinions from the places where they would otherwise be challenged in the marketplace of ideas? Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Well, a clear measure is travel openness, the ability to slip into destinations around the world with a breezy wave of your passport, no visa required. The Henley Passport Index is one of several rankings measuring passport potency in this regard and, for the first time in its 20-year history, the US passport has fallen out of its top 10 list altogether. The United States, meanwhile, is down in 12th place in the latest quarterly ranking, tied with Malaysia. Citizens of both nations enjoy visa-free access to 180 of the 227 countries and territories tracked by the index, which was created by the London-based global citizenship and residence advisory firm Henley & Partners, and uses exclusive data from the International Air Transport Association. And because Henley counts multiple countries with the same score as a single spot in its standings, there are actually 36 countries that outrank the US on the list. It's down to a series of access changes. In April, Brazil withdrew visa-free access for citizens from the US, Canada and Australia due to a lack of reciprocity. China has been introducing more welcoming policies, offering visa exemptions for dozens of mostly European countries, including Germany and France, but the US hasn't made the cut. Papua New Guinea and Myanmar have also tweaked their entry policies, which boosted other passports' rankings while further eroding that of the US. “The declining strength of the US passport over the past decade is more than just a reshuffle in rankings — it signals a fundamental shift in global mobility and soft power dynamics,” said Christian H. Kaelin, chair of Henley & Partners, in a statement. “Nations that embrace openness and cooperation are surging ahead, while those resting on past privilege are being left behind.” The UK passport, which once held the top spot on the index in 2015, has also fallen to its lowest-ever position, dropping two places since July, from 6th to 8th. During this past decade of decline for the UK and the US, China has been making a sharp ascent on the rankings, climbing from 94th place in 2015 to 64th in 2025, gaining visa-free access to 37 more destinations in that time. The Henley Passport Index report points to China's recent moves — granting visa-free access to Russia, new agreements with the Gulf states, South America and several European countries — as examples of Beijing's ongoing strategy of increased openness. 106, Afghanistan remains locked in bottom place, with visa-free access to just 24 destinations, two fewer than at the start of this year. 105 (with 26 destinations) and Iraq is at No. That's a yawning mobility gap of 169 destinations between the top- and bottom-ranked passports. “Can we make a linkage, if you will, to immigration policies of the Trump administration?” said Quest. “Yes, you probably can, at some level, say there is a direct relation between one and the other.” “There are certainly citizenships that give greater access and availability to travel,” said Quest, and there are wealthy individuals who seek to obtain them through investment schemes, such as the $5 million “gold card” proposed by Trump in February. Henley & Partners advises its clients upon just these kind of residence and citizenship opportunities. “But for the average person, it's not a jot of difference,” said Quest. Arton Capital's Passport Index takes into consideration the passports of 193 United Nations member countries and six territories — Taiwan, Macao, Hong Kong, Kosovo, the Palestinian territories and the Vatican. Territories annexed to other countries are excluded. It's also updated in real-time throughout the year and its data is gathered by close monitoring of individual governments' portals. Arton's Global Passport Power Rank 2025 puts the United Arab Emirates in the top spot, with a visa-free/visa-on-arrival score of 179. Second place is held by Singapore and Spain, each with a score of 175.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Volodymyr Zelensky stripped Odesa Mayor Hennadiy Trukhanov of his Ukrainian citizenship after years of allegations that he possessed a Russian passport. "The presence of Russian citizenship has been confirmed for certain individuals. The decision would effectively oust Trukhanov from his post. Ukraine's Security Service have confirmed to the Kyiv Independent that Zelensky revoked Ukrainian citizenship of Trukhanov, ballet dancer Serhii Polunin, and former Ukrainian politician Oleg Tsaryov. According to the Security Service, Trukhanov has an active Russian passport, issued in 2015, a year after Russia launched its war against Ukraine and occupied the Crimean Peninsula. Reports that Trukhanov held Russian citizenship have circulated since 2014. After repeatedly denying the fact, Trukhanov had his passport annulled through a Russian court in 2017, due to alleged procedural violations. He claimed to have learned about the passport online. In 2018, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) published a copy of Trukhanov's Russian passport and offshore documents, showing he was registered as living in the city of Sergiev Posad in Moscow Oblast. Last year, activist Serhii Sternenko published documents allegedly indicating that Trukhanov still holds Russian citizenship. The data also suggested that a person with the same name as Odesa's mayor applied for a Russian bank account just weeks before Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) previously said it had found no evidence of Trukhanov's Russian citizenship. On Oct. 13, a petition was launched urging the president to strip Trukhanov of his Ukrainian citizenship. According to the petition, the Odesa mayor's alleged dual citizenship "raises national security concerns and damages public confidence in local leadership." Despite a political career marked by multiple scandals, including graft allegations, he has so far managed to avoid losing office. For years, Trukhanov has been widely seen as a Russian sympathizer. In 2018 Trukhanov was charged with embezzling Hr 92 million ($2.2 million) by purchasing Odesa's Krayan factory building for the city government at an inflated price. An Odesa court acquitted him amid allegations of political pressure on the judges in 2019. Trukhanov was twice arrested in the case before being released on bail. According to political analyst Ihor Reiterovych, confirmation by the president of Trukhanov's Russian citizenship would prompt political issues, since it "obviously dates back much earlier." But when you have a mayor like that, you can always keep him on a short leash, and he won't make any moves against the central government,” Reiterovych told the Kyiv Independent. Unlike some other outspoken mayors, Trukhanov hardly ever voiced criticism towards the central government in light of the trend of mounting pressure on local authorities. In the past week, Zelensky has openly criticized local officials, suggesting upcoming staff reshuffles. The move to terminate Trukhanov's citizenship also comes just weeks after a devastating flood hit Odesa in late September, killing at least 10 people. Local authorities faced criticism over their handling of the disaster's aftermath. When asked about the emergency, Zelensky replied emotionally on Oct.11, saying: "Everything must be done consistently and fairly. And we will deal with the situation in Odesa as well." "I wouldn't rule out that, in this context, the authorities simply decided to seize the moment — using a formal pretext to apply additional pressure on local government representatives," Reiterovych said. "There have long been rumors that the central government wants to gain, or at least tighten, control over key cities — including Odesa." Stripping Ukrainian officials of their citizenship is not a new practice, and it has been mired in controversy. Loss or termination of Ukrainian citizenship can serve as grounds for removing a person from office, including an elected one such as mayor, according to the law. Later in the evening, Zelensky confirmed he would appoint a head of the military administration, saying that Odesa "deserves greater protection and stronger support.

"First of all, it is essential that this ceasefire remains stable and that no violations occur. As you know, Israel does not have a very good record when it comes to respecting ceasefire agreements. This situation compels us to be more vigilant and meticulous. Israel knows the cost of returning to genocide will be high. We make this clear at every opportunity," Erdogan told reporters from his press pool after returning from Egypt. He also remarked that "many [Gaza] agreements reached in the past were never implemented." "Unfortunately, Israel's inconsistency and the lack of [international] determination have contributed to this. We saw this shared stance again at the summit in Egypt. I believe that [US President Donald] Trump will continue to lead the process he began," Erdogan added.</p>

MOSCOW, October 14. /TASS/. Russia continues its special military operation in Ukraine due to a lack of options but remains ready to resolve the conflict peacefully, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a briefing.

"Russia is ready for a peaceful settlement. Russia continues the special military operation at the moment due to a lack of alternatives," he pointed out, commenting on French President Emmanuel Macron's remarks who had made an allegation about Moscow's "military stubbornness" and threatened that Russia would have to pay "a price" unless it "returned to the negotiating table."

"One way or another, Russia will safeguard its interests and achieve its goals," Peskov emphasized.

Russia has repeatedly stressed that it would prefer to resolve the Ukraine conflict through peaceful political and diplomatic means, ensuring equal and indivisible security for all countries in Europe. However, the Kiev regime, actively backed by the West, keeps finding excuses to reject a fair settlement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko said on Oct. 14 that he is willing to strengthen ties with the U.S. as long as the move aligns with Belarus's interests. The comments come amid intensifying dialogue between the Trump administration and Minsk, a key ally of Russia during its all-out war against Ukraine. They love these big deals," Lukashenko said at a government meeting on the U.S.-Belarus relations, according to the Belta state news agency. "We are ready to make a big deal with them." The Belarusian dictator also noted that both Minsk and Washington have their own questions and requests regarding mutual ties, adding that he views U.S. President Donald Trump's proposals as "absolutely normal." "But our interests must also be taken into account." The U.S. in September helped to negotiate the release of 52 political prisoners of different nationalities held in Belarus, while Washington agreed to lift sanctions on the Belarusian state airline, Belavia. Trump's envoy, Keith Kellogg, later revealed that the goal of the renewed dialogue with Belarus is to "ensure lines of communication" with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of a broader push to end the war in Ukraine. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994, allowed Russian forces to launch attacks on Ukraine from Belarusian territory at the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022. As a result, Belarus has faced massive Western sanctions and diplomatic isolation. The military monitoring group Belarusian Hajun was an open-source intelligence project that tracked Russian and Belarusian troop movements and other military activity in Belarus. "Poisonous smoke floats over the city, which can be seen even from Stary Krym (25 kilometers away)," local media reported. The comments come ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels on Oct. 15, chaired by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha urged U.N. member states to condemn Russia's Oct. 14 attack on a U.N. aid convoy in Kherson Oblast, which left one truck destroyed and another badly damaged. The proposal, initiated by the Russian National Automobile Union, comes amid a deepening supply crisis exacerbated by Ukraine's escalating drone strikes on Russian oil infrastructure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Woman seeking to prove president wrong about Antifa insists immigration protests are civilised Weaving through a pack of masked protesters with her phone held aloft, a slight woman in her sixties pushes herself to the front of a colourful crowd assembled in Portland, Oregon. Pam Hemphill, formerly known as “Maga Granny”, has come to the city to document immigration protests and to prove Donald Trump is wrong about Antifa, the Left-wing group he designated a terrorist organisation. Don't you have a right to stand up and protest? I don't care what side, you want to make sure that both sides are able to do it,” she told The Telegraph. The president's sweeping clemency shuttered the largest investigation in US justice department history, including more than 300 pending cases. In a remarkable about-turn, Hemphill refused the presidential pardon, insisting she was guilty and had been brainwashed into taking part in the insurrection. She proudly hangs a framed letter sent to her by Mike Pence, the former vice-president, in which he applauds her for turning down the pardon. “Plus, I didn't want to be a part of his narrative that the DoJ [department of justice] was weaponised against us. Today, she compares her time in Maga to that of a cult. Before her Left-wing conversion, she posed with a toy gun for a photograph captioned: “On my way to Washington DC January 6th!” She travelled to Portland for a second time, eager to disprove the president's characterisation of it as a “lawless hellhole”. Protesters in the city are holding nightly protests outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) centre in response to the president's crackdown on illegal migrants. To combat the disorder, Mr Trump said he was sending National Guard troops “to protect war-ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists”. “They're [Antifa] not throwing eggs on cars or threatening to kill anyone. Hemphill suggested all Biden-voting Democrats were being labelled Antifa because they are enemies of Mr Trump. I am Antifa [under their definition] because we know there's 81 million people that voted for Biden.” Of the situation in Oregon, she said: “You have your little bad apples but it's not warranting the National Guard.” Hemphill accused the Trump administration of using extreme language to paint a picture that was not real. It is a theatre because they're going to show you the smoke bombs, because ‘everybody's violent', and they got to get them away, right?” Hemphill accused the administration of being blinded by the accounts of Right-wing influencers who have descended on Portland. “Do you know why we have a divorce court? Because there's two sides to every story,” she said. Last week, conservative influencers were invited to the White House to tell Mr Trump how they had been harassed in Portland. Nick Sortor, a Maga influencer with 1.2 million followers, was recently arrested by the Portland police department and charged with disorderly conduct. “With knowing both sides, you could then make a choice and be informed. They know who I am by now. Hemphill slipped into the crowd of misfits that had gathered outside the city's detention centre on Thursday evening, her partner acting as a de-facto bodyguard. Small in stature, she was easy to lose. “One of the protesters made it for me. Yeah, that's worth more than diamonds,” she said.</p>

On Wall Street, markets are watching earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., Johnson & Johnson, BlackRock Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. “If one looks at the recent history of export controls and charges for ships docking in ports, then it's been largely interpreted as a path towards negotiation rather than a fresh outbreak of hostilities on the trade front between the U.S. and China,” Investec chief economist Philip Shaw said. “So yes, there is uncertainty, but you've had a huge rally, not just in U.S. stocks, but a lot of global indices as well. And while there are still some question marks over U.S.-China trade friction, I'd interpret the latest sell-off as a bit of a correction rather than a huge stepping-up of investor uncertainty,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a former president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy has been behind many doors closed to the average French citizen. On October 21, as the cold steel of his jail cell door clangs behind him, he'll be in one room to which few would covet entry. The former French leader was convicted in September of criminal conspiracy in what the court heard was a scheme to finance his 2007 presidential campaign with funds from Libya in exchange for diplomatic favors. That wing is reserved for prisoners considered unsuited to be among the prison's general population, usually out of fears for their own safety. They could be politicians, former police officers, members of far-right organizations or those tied to Islamist terror groups, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. Sitting opposite an old people's home in a residential corner of Paris' 14th arrondissement, La Santé's unassuming presence is only given away by the occasional wailing siren as prisoners are transported to and from the site. Over the past century and a half, the walls of La Santé have deprived many famous French men of their freedom. One of the world's most wanted terrorists of the 1970s and 1980s, Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, aka “Carlos the Jackal,” spent time in La Santé, as did Jacques Mesrine, a notorious murderer and bank robber of the 1970s whose criminal career was portrayed in a 2008 film starring Vincent Cassel. Mesrine famously also broke out from La Santé's walls. Other well-known inmates include Alfred Dreyfus, the Jewish army captain at the center of the late 19th-century Dreyfus Affair, in which antisemitism saw him wrongly convicted of treason, and more recently Alexandre Benalla, an aide and former bodyguard of Emmanuel Macron sentenced to jail time after he was filmed beating Yellow Vest protesters. Sarkozy won't even be the prison's first world leader. Unsurprisingly, Sarkozy isn't happy about heading to prison. She's likely to be one of the first former supermodels to enter the prison if she pays him a visit. But  behind its high brick walls, La Santé is no dungeon. Built in 1867, with a distinctive radial layout designed to give prisoners the feeling of being under constant surveillance, the prison recently underwent a four-year renovation and modernization program, reopening in 2019. If Sarkozy is housed in the VIP wing, one of 18 identical cells will be allotted to him, each of which boasts a cooking hob, fridge, television, shower and toilet, as well as a fixed telephone line allowing prisoners to call certain authorized numbers. The cells measure nine square meters (nearly 97 square foot), no bigger than normal cells, although residents in this special wing aren't required to share a cell, typically out of concern for their safety. Still, a stay is far from comfortable, those who've experienced it say. “The problem is the noise,” Didier Schuller, a former civil servant and politician held for several weeks in La Santé told BFMTV in 2022. Former FBI Director James Comey to be arraigned Wednesday A former policeman interviewed by the broadcaster described the insults shouted non-stop by prisoners on other wings when they learned he had arrived as an inmate. There's little chance that Sarkozy won't attract similar attention behind bars. “You know when you're going in,” Patrick Balkany, former mayor of Levallois-Peret, northwest of Paris, told BFMTV of La Santé, where he served several months for tax evasion before being released on health grounds.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. protectionism has brought visibility and urgency to the auto industry's decades-long drift.CHRIS HELGREN/Reuters Greig Mordue is an associate professor and the ArcelorMittal Dofasco Chair in Advanced Manufacturing Policy in the faculty of engineering at McMaster University. Rather, Canada's auto industry endures because of industrial policy measures it took decades prior. Now we must draw upon that playbook once more. In the early 1960s, Canada's auto industry was also under pressure. The economy was sputtering, car sales dropped and automotive employment cratered. Tariffs of 17.5 per cent on imported vehicles meant that almost every car sold in Canada was made here. It removed tariffs on vehicles and parts if automakers built one car in Canada for every one they sold here and performed value-added work equal to 60 per cent of sales. Failure to meet both conditions triggered an import tariff of 9.1 per cent. Opinion: Carney must remember: Trump's sound and fury signify nothing Politics Insider: Trump's Lutnick dismisses possibility of tariff-free auto deal for Canada North America faced recession and the OPEC oil crises caused gasoline prices to soar. Vehicle sales plummeted and employment in the sector collapsed. Canada initially chose punitive measures against the Japanese upstarts, including imposing port blockages and negotiating limits on Japanese auto exports. Eventually, these “sticks” were complemented by a collection of “carrots”: duty remission schemes and (by today's standards) modest grants to encourage Japanese production in Canada. Once again, Canada had linked its auto industry to the world's most successful players. Today, Toyota and Honda produce about 900,000 vehicles in Canada each year - around three-quarters of total national production. Canada established a practice of skillfully balancing incentives and restrictions to connect its automotive sector to the most successful, ascendent players. However, the U.S. administration's aggressively insular turn results in Canada's assembly plants struggling to gain mandates for production. It is the global leader in electric vehicles (EVs) and new technologies. For example, my own research shows that over the past decade, China has generated automotive patents at five times the U.S. rate and 150 times Canada's. The effect: Canadian consumers have limited access to affordable EVs. It also means Canada's 60-year practice of drafting its automotive manufacturing sector to the industry's most successful, innovative actors is in jeopardy. Canada still has choices; options that may be revealed through its current 60-day review of the Electric Vehicle Availability Standard (EVAS), which until last month mandated 100-per-cent zero-emission vehicle sales in Canada by 2035, and its commitment to review its 100-per-cent tariff on Chinese vehicles on the one-year anniversary of its enactment (this month). With this, pressing questions emerge: Is a policy of supporting U.S. automakers that have almost abandoned Canadian production still defensible? Can Canada afford to ignore China, the world's ascendent automaking power? Can Canada revive tactics from the 1960s and 1980s to sustain its industry? Should Canada simply wait for a possible U.S. policy shift in 2029 - and if it does, will there be an industry left to save? If it delays doing anything until 2029, the window for a potential Chinese investment may close. Should the U.S. and China reach a trade agreement, Chinese automotive investment interests will shift to the U.S. and Canada will be bypassed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. As Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's reign nears its end, a 12-day war in June laid bare the fragility of the system he built. Israel battered Iranian cities and military installations, paving the way for the United States to drop 14 bunker-busting bombs on Iranian nuclear sites. The war exposed the enormous gulf between Tehran's ideological bluster and the limited capabilities of a regime that has lost much of its regional power, no longer controls its skies, and exercises diminished control over its streets. The 1979 revolution transformed Iran from a Western-aligned monarchy into an Islamist theocracy, flipping it virtually overnight from an American ally to a sworn enemy. Because Iran today remains a pivotal state—an energy superpower whose internal politics shape the Middle East's security and political order and ripple across the global system—the matter of who (or what) succeeds Khamenei is of enormous consequence. Over the past two years—since Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which Khamenei alone among major world leaders openly endorsed—his life's work has been reduced to ashes by Israel and the United States. His closest military and political proteges have been killed or assassinated. His vast nuclear enterprise, built at staggering cost to Iran's economy, has been buried under rubble. The regime's enduring slogans—“Death to America” and “Death to Israel” but never “Long Live Iran”—make clear that its priority is defiance, not development. Power outages and water rationing have become fixtures of daily life. His tenure has rested on two pillars: unwavering commitment to revolutionary principles at home and abroad and outright rejection of political reform. Khamenei has long believed that diluting the Islamic Republic's ideals and strictures would do to the Islamic Republic what Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost did to his country, hastening its death rather than prolonging its life. Once Khamenei is gone, several possible futures are foreseeable. Like China after the death of Mao Zedong, Iran might recalibrate by replacing rigid ideology with pragmatic national interest. It could double down on repression and isolation, as North Korea has done for decades. Clerical rule might yield to military dominance, as it has in Pakistan. And although increasingly unlikely, Iran could still tilt toward representative government—a struggle that dates back to the Constitutional Revolution of 1906. Iranians often see themselves as heirs to a great empire, yet their modern history has been punctuated by repeated invasions, humiliations, and betrayals. In the nineteenth century, Iran lost nearly half its territory to predatory neighbors, surrendering the Caucasus (encompassing present-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Dagestan) to Russia and relinquishing Herat to Afghanistan under British pressure. This legacy has bred generations of Iranian rulers who see plots everywhere, suspecting even their closest aides of being foreign agents. Reza Shah, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty and a leader that many Iranians still revere today, was forced to abdicate by the Allied powers during World War II, given his suspected affinity for Nazi Germany. False American promises “cost me my throne,” he concluded, after being deposed by the 1979 revolution. Once in power, Khomeini executed thousands of opponents on charges of serving as foreign agents; his successor, Khamenei, laces nearly every speech with references to American and Zionist plots. Iraj Pezeshkzad's My Uncle Napoleon—a beloved Iranian novel, later adapted into an iconic 1976 TV series—satirizes a paranoid family patriarch who sees foreign plots everywhere, especially British ones. A 2020 World Values Survey found that fewer than 15 percent of Iranians believe “most people can be trusted”—among the lowest rates in the world. Over the past century, just four men have ruled the country, with cults of personality substituting for durable institutions and politics cycling between brief bursts of euphoria and long years of disillusionment. The Islamic Republic has sharpened this pattern by formally dividing its citizens into “insiders” and “outsiders.” In such an atmosphere of mistrust, negative selection prevails: mediocrity is rewarded, obscurity promoted, and loyalty prized over competence. Khamenei's rise in 1989 was a textbook case of this dynamic, and the same criteria are likely to inform his preferred succession plan. It will continue to cast a long shadow over Iran's future. Authoritarian transitions rarely follow a script, and Iran's will be no exception. But history shows that unexpected internal sparks—a natural disaster, a fruit vendor's self-immolation, a young woman killed for showing too much hair—can prove just as consequential. For nearly five decades, Iran has been governed by ideology; its future, however, will hinge on logistics—above all, who can most effectively manage a country nearly five times as large as Germany, endowed with vast resources yet beset by daunting challenges. Out of this volatility, Iran's post-Khamenei order could take several forms: nationalist strongman rule, clerical continuity, military dominance, populist revival, or a unique hybrid of these. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) seeks to entrench its power. Disenfranchised citizens, including ethnic minorities, demand dignity and opportunity. None of these factions are monolithic, but it is their aspirations and actions that will define the struggle over the kind of country that Iran will become. Both tried to avenge the past and impose a new vision at home and abroad, inflicting devastation not only on their own people but also on neighboring states. Despite their dueling ideologies—one militantly atheistic, the other theocratic—the parallels are striking. The Soviet collapse was accelerated by Gorbachev's reforms, which loosened central control and unleashed forces the system could not contain. Out of that turmoil rose Vladimir Putin, a former officer with the KGB, the Soviet security agency, who promised stability and pride, replacing communist ideology with resentment-driven nationalism. Yet their long association with the current system makes such familiar figures unlikely standard-bearers of a new dispensation. By the time the Soviet Union collapsed, it had already entered its third generation of leaders, while Iran is only now entering its second. And Iran has had no Gorbachev: Khamenei has blocked reform precisely because he believes it would precipitate the republic's demise. Yet the larger truth remains: when a totalizing ideology collapses, it often leaves behind not civic renewal but cynicism and nihilism. An Iranian Putin could borrow some of the tactics of the Islamic Republic, seeking stability by sowing instability among Iran's neighbors, threatening global energy flows, cloaking aggression in a new ideology, and growing rich with other elites while promising to restore Iran's dignity. It can just as easily deliver a new strongman equally unbound by scruples, armed with renewed grievances, and driven by fresh ambitions. The “China model” has long appealed to Islamic Republic insiders who want to preserve the system but recognize that a failing economy and widespread public discontent demand some attempt at reform. In this scenario, the regime would remain repressive and autocratic, but it would soften its revolutionary principles and social conservatism in favor of rapprochement with the United States, broader integration with the world, and a gradual transition from theocracy to technocracy. The Revolutionary Guards would retain their power and profits but, like China's People's Liberation Army, turn from revolutionary militancy to nationalist corporatism. But it was his eventual successor, Deng Xiaoping, who used that opening to reorient the country from ideological orthodoxy to pragmatism and launch transformational reforms. Iran has produced would-be Dengs—including former President Hassan Rouhani and Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of the revolution's founder—but none could overcome Khamenei and like-minded hard-liners, who long believed that any compromise on revolutionary ideology, especially rapprochement with the United States, would destabilize the system rather than strengthen it. Even then, Iran might struggle to follow the Chinese path. Iran, by contrast, has a rentier economy more akin to that of Russia. If the regime abandons ideology without delivering material improvements, it risks losing its existing base without winning over new supporters. A less ideological Iran that normalizes relations with the United States and drops its opposition to Israel's existence would mark a significant improvement over the status quo. Yet as China's experience shows, economic growth and international integration can also fuel greater regional and global ambitions—replacing today's challenges with new ones. And it is far from clear that Iran could maintain internal stability through such a turbulent transition. If the Islamic Republic continues to put ideology before national interests, its future could resemble North Korea's present: a regime that endures not through popular legitimacy but through brutality and isolation. Khamenei's preference has long been to perpetuate rule by a supreme leader, an austere cleric committed to the revolutionary principles of resistance against the United States and Israel and upholding Islamist orthodoxy at home. Yet nearly five decades after 1979, few Iranians want to live under a system that deprives them of economic dignity and political and social freedoms. Although Khamenei may try to engineer succession in favor of someone who will remain loyal to revolutionary principles, the pool of viable candidates is small, as few if any hard-line clerics have a base of popular support or legitimacy. That leaves Khamenei's 56-year-old son, Mojtaba, as the most prominent contender. Yet hereditary succession would directly betray one of the founding principles of the revolution: Khomeini's insistence that monarchy was “un-Islamic.” Mojtaba has never held elected office, has virtually no public profile, and is known chiefly for his behind-the-scenes ties to the Revolutionary Guards. Risible attempts by his supporters to liken him to the dynamic Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—including campaigns on social media with the hashtag #MojtabaBinSalman in Persian—are an indication that even Khamenei's revolutionary base recognizes that a forward-­looking vision is more appealing than a backward-looking one. The country's dour, 69-year-old chief justice, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni Ejei, is little more than a hanging judge, involved in dozens of executions; perhaps his most memorable public act was biting a journalist who had criticized censorship. Any succession that involved a figure of this sort would rest not on popular consent but on the loyalty of the IRGC. The North Korea model would also collide with a society that aspires to the openness and prosperity of South Korea. Few Iranians will tolerate a system that prizes ideology over economic well-being and personal security even more stridently than the current one. Totalitarian rule would require mass imprisonment at home, the mass exodus of professionals abroad, and perhaps a nuclear shield to deter foreign pressure. Yet unlike North Korea, Iran cannot hermetically seal itself off: Israel dominates its skies and has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to strike nuclear sites, missile bases, and senior commanders. Ahmad Kasravi, a secular Iranian intellectual assassinated by Islamists in 1946, once wrote that Iran “owed” the clergy one chance to rule so their failings could be exposed. After nearly five decades of theocratic mismanagement, that debt has been settled. The U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq gave the IRGC license to expand its budget and fund and equip proxies abroad, while sanctions enriched the organization by turning Iran's ports into conduits for illicit smuggling. But the IRGC is not a cohesive bloc: it is a constellation of competing cartels whose rivalries—generational, institutional, and commercial—have been contained under Khamenei's authority. His departure will likely bring those feuds into the open. One scenario in which the IRGC might move from dominance to outright rule would involve the guards allowing unrest to fester before stepping in as “saviors of the nation.” This would mirror Pakistan's military, which has long justified its dominance by presenting itself as the guardian of national unity against both India and internal disintegration. But the IRGC's current dominance should not be mistaken for popularity. Its top leadership is handpicked by Khamenei, rotated frequently to prevent the accrual of too much power to individual officials, and widely associated with repression, corruption, and incompetence. As Siamak Namazi, an American who was held hostage by the organization for eight years, told me, “Iran is today a collection of competing mafias—dominated by the IRGC and its alumni—whose highest loyalty is not to nation, religion, or ideology but to personal enrichment.” Israel's assassinations of nearly two dozen senior IRGC commanders in their bunkers and bedrooms underscored both the group's vulnerability to penetration and the weaknesses of an institution that prioritizes ideological loyalty over competence. For an IRGC regime to endure, it would almost certainly require a new generation of leaders, less dogmatic than those cultivated by Khamenei and capable of appealing to the public through nationalism rather than clerical ideology. A grievance-driven commander could cast himself as an Iranian Putin, substituting nationalism for Islamism while continuing confrontation with the West. A more pragmatic officer might resemble an Iranian Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, preserving authoritarian rule while seeking an alliance with the West, much as Egypt's president has done. In their writings, IRGC strategists often contrast the fates of Saddam and the Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi—both of whom lacked nuclear weapons and fell—with North Korea's regime, which has nuclear weapons and has survived. An IRGC-led Iran would face the same dilemma: pursue a bomb for survival or forsake it for the benefits of recognition. Like Pakistan, such an Iran would be defined less by clerics than by generals—nationalists, keen to stoke the ardor of their people, and perpetually vacillating between confrontation and accommodation with the West. In terms of territory, population, culture, and history, Iran has few cousins closer than Turkey, another fiercely proud, non-Arab, Muslim country burdened by a long legacy of mistrust toward great powers. The Turkish experience under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offers one possible parallel: elections that bring a popular leader to power, initial reforms that resonate with ordinary citizens, and then a gradual slide into majoritarian authoritarianism cloaked in the language of democracy. For Iran to follow such a path, however, wholesale institutional change would be required. Without these prerequisites, genuinely competitive and accountable politics cannot take root. As the social scientist Kian Tajbakhsh has noted, the regime's creation of thousands of local councils and municipal bodies produced “dual-use institutions: created to serve an authoritarian order, but structurally available to support democratic transition—if given the chance.” In effect, Iranians have long practiced the forms of representative government without enjoying their substance. A populist leader could well emerge from any remotely fair election. In a country home to both significant resources and deep inequality, populism has been a recurring force in modern Iranian politics. In 1979, Khomeini railed against the shah and his foreign backers while promising free utilities, housing for all, and oil wealth that would flow to the people rather than a corrupt elite. A generation later, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a little-known mayor of Tehran, rose to the presidency in 2005 by vowing to put “the oil money on people's dinner tables.” Whether through open or competitive elections, a post-Khamenei Iran could again see the rise of a populist outsider with nationalist credentials and the ability to mobilize anger against both elites and foreign enemies. For many Iranians, this would be preferable to continued theocracy or military rule. Yet as Turkey's experience illustrates, populism can open the door not to pluralism but to a new form of authoritarianism—one with mass backing and a ballot-box mandate. In December 1978, just one month before the shah's departure, a leading American scholar of Iran, James Bill, wrote in Foreign Affairs that “the most probable alternative” to the shah would be “a left-wing, progressive group of middle-ranking army officers.” Other scenarios, he suggested, included “a right-wing military junta, a liberal democratic system based on Western models, and a communist government.” The “United States need not fear,” wrote Bill, “that a future government in Iran will necessarily be antithetical to American interests.” Most strikingly, just weeks before Iran's clerics seized power, Bill predicted they “would never participate directly in the formal governmental structure.” Iranian intellectuals also misjudged events. Weeks before Khomeini consolidated his theocracy and commenced mass executions, one of Iran's leading intellectuals, the philosopher Dariush Shayegan, declared, “Khomeini is an Islamic Gandhi. Just as 1979 confounded both insiders and outsiders, outlier scenarios are again conceivable. Yet having spent nearly half a century abroad, he will need to overcome the absence of organization and on-the-ground muscle to prevail in the ruthless contests that define authoritarian transitions. Another possibility—perhaps the greatest dread of many Iranian patriots, including even staunch opponents of the regime—is a Yugoslavia-style breakup along ethnic lines. Iran's minorities could see a weakening of the center as an opening for revolt or as an opportunity to begin anew. Unlike Yugoslavia, however, Iran is anchored by a far older and more coherent identity: more than 80 percent of Iranians are either Persian or Azeri, nearly all speak Persian as a lingua franca, and even non-Persian groups identify with a state that has a continuous history for more than 2,500 years. In essence, Iran once again appears to be a country up for grabs, with futures that could diverge dramatically. Moscow may prefer the continuation of an Islamic Republic that can serve as a perennial thorn in Washington's side and a source of instability that drives up global energy risks. Yet to whatever degree outside powers may tilt the balance, Iran today is large and resilient enough to chart its own destiny. It has all the makings of a G-20 country: an educated, globally connected population, tremendous natural resources, and a proud civilizational identity. For Iranian democrats, however, the international climate could hardly be less favorable. Western governments that once championed democracy have withdrawn resources and are preoccupied with their own democratic backsliding. The United States has pared back institutions—such as the National Endowment for Democracy and Voice of America—that were central to its Cold War success. Majority opinion may not determine Iran's transition, but to the extent that political hopefuls seek to appeal to it, one reality appears clear: Iranians are not yearning for empty slogans, personality cults, or even lofty notions of democracy. The Islamic Republic's tenure has amounted to a lost half century for Iran. KARIM SADJADPOUR is a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
