                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI on Tuesday announced a council of eight experts who will advise the company and provide insight into how artificial intelligence could affect users' mental health, emotions and motivation. Through check-ins and recurring meetings, OpenAI said the council will help it define what healthy AI interactions look like. OpenAI has been expanding its safety controls in recent months as the company has faced mounting scrutiny over how it protects users, particularly minors. In September, the Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry into several tech companies, including OpenAI, over how chatbots like ChatGPT could negatively affect children and teenagers. The company is building an age prediction system that will automatically apply teen-appropriate settings for users under 18, and it launched a series of parental controls late last month. Parents can now get notified if their child is showing signs of acute distress, for instance. psychology and human-computer interaction as it formalized the council, which officially launched with an in-person session last week. In addition to its expert council, OpenAI said it is also working with researchers and mental health clinicians within the Global Physician Network who will help test ChatGPT and establish company policies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday suggested the central bank is nearing a point where it will stop reducing the size of its bond holdings, but gave no long-run indication of where interest rates are heading. Speaking to the National Association for Business Economics' conference in Philadelphia, Powell provided a dissertation on where the Fed stands with "quantitative tightening," or the effort to reduce the more than $6 trillion of securities it holds on its balance sheet. While he provided no specific date of when the program will cease, he said there are indications that the Fed is nearing its goal of "ample" reserves available for banks. "Our long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions," Powell said in prepared remarks. "We may approach that point in coming months, and we are closely monitoring a wide range of indicators to inform this decision." Though balance sheet questions are in the weeds for monetary policy, they matter to financial markets. When financial conditions are tight, the Fed aims for "abundant" reserves so that banks have access to liquidity and can keep the economy running. As conditions change, the Fed aims for "ample" reserves, a step down that prevents too much capital from sloshing around the system. Since mid-2022, the Fed has been gradually allowing maturing proceeds of those securities to roll off the balance sheet, effectively tightening one leg of monetary policy. However, because it had to raise interest rates so quickly to control inflation, it has seen operating losses. Congressional leaders such as Sen. Ted Cruz, (R-Texas) have suggested terminating the payments on reserves. However, Powell said that would be a mistake and would hinder the Fed's ability to carry out policy. "While our net interest income has temporarily been negative due to the rapid rise in policy rates to control inflation, this is highly unusual. Our net income will soon turn positive again, as it typically has been throughout our history," he said. "If our ability to pay interest on reserves and other liabilities were eliminated, the Fed would lose control over rates." "While the unemployment rate remained low through August, payroll gains have slowed sharply, likely in part due to a decline in labor force growth due to lower immigration and labor force participation," he said. "In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen." While markets strongly expect two more cuts this year, and several Fed officials recently have endorsed that view, Powell was noncommittal. "There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate the tension between our employment and inflation goals," he said. Policymakers rely on metrics like the nonfarm payrolls report, retail sales and various price indexes to make their decisions. "Based on the data that we do have, it is fair to say that the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting four weeks ago. "Data available prior to the shutdown, however, show that growth in economic activity may be on a somewhat firmer trajectory than expected." The Bureau of Labor Statistics has said it has called workers back to prepare the monthly consumer price index report, which will be released next week. Powell said available data has showed that goods prices have increased, largely a function of tariffs rather than underlying inflation pressures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump could still slap China with 100% tariffs on Nov. 1 or sooner, depending on Beijing's next move in a dispute over rare earths, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC Tuesday. "A lot depends on what the Chinese do," Greer told CNBC in an interview. "They are the ones who have chosen to make this major escalation." China announced sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports last week that would disrupt U.S. defense, technology, semiconductor and automobile industries if implemented. Trump retaliated with the threat of massive tariffs that would effectively shut down trade between the world's two largest economies. But the president appeared to dial back his rhetoric earlier this week, saying saying "it will all be fine" with China. "We can't have a situation where the Chinese keep this regime in place, where they want to have veto power over the world's high tech supply chains," the U.S. trade representative said. The restrictions took the White House by surprise ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit later this month in Seoul, South Korea. Trump and Xi are still scheduled to meet, Greer said, though he suggested those plans are subject to change depending on how the situation develops. "Whether it will go through or not, I don't want to precommit either ourselves or the Chinese," Greer said of the meeting. "But I think it makes sense for people to talk when they can." U.S. and Chinese officials at the senior staff level spoke as recently as Monday in Washington about the rare earth dispute, Greer said. The U.S. stock market erased about $2 trillion in value on Friday in response to Trump's tariff threat against China. Rare earths are critical minerals used to manufacture magnets, which are key inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, the semiconductor industry and other applications. China controls about 60% of rare earth mining and more than 90% of refining worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency. The U.S. is dependent on China for roughly 70% of its rare earth imports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Justice has seized about $15 billion worth of bitcoin held in cryptocurrency wallets owned by a man who oversaw a massive "pig butchering" fraud operation based in Cambodia, prosecutors said Tuesday. An indictment charging the alleged pig butcher, Chen Zhi, was unsealed Tuesday in federal court in Brooklyn, New York. Zhi, who is also known as "Vincent," remains at large, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. He was identified in court filings as the founder and chairman of Prince Holding Group, a multinational business conglomerate based in Cambodia, which prosecutors said grew "in secret .... into one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organizations. U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella said that Zhi "directed one of the largest investment fraud operations in history, fueling an illicit industry that is reaching epidemic proportions." "Prince Group's investment scams have caused billions of dollars in losses and untold misery to victims around the world, including here in New York, on the backs of individuals who have been trafficked and forced to work against their will," Nocella said. The Prince Group, which operates businesses in more than 30 countries, ran "forced-labor scam compounds across Cambodia," the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a press release. "Individuals held against their will in the compounds engaged in cryptocurrency investment fraud schemes, known as 'pig butchering' scams, that stole billions of dollars from victims in the United States and around the world," the release said. The scams duped people contacted via social media and messaging applications online into transferring cryptocurrency into accounts controlled by the scheme with false promises that the crypto would be invested and produce profits, according to the office. Prosecutors said that hundreds of people were trafficked and forced to work in the scam compounds, "often under the threat of violence." Zhi and a network of top executives in the Prince Group are accused of using political influence in multiple countries to protect their criminal enterprise and paid bribes to public officials to avoid actions by law enforcement authorities targeting the scheme, according to prosecutors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Multiple major U.S. airports are refusing to air a video showing Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats in Congress for the ongoing federal government shutdown. Noem in the video says, "It is TSA's top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe," according to MSNBC. "However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay," says Noem, whose department oversees the TSA. Some airports that refused to show Noem's video cited its political nature, with a few directly pointing to the Hatch Act, which prohibits certain political activities by government employees. The airports that refused to show Noem's video include the three major airports in the New York City area — John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in Queens, and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. "The Port Authority's longstanding policies prevent airing of politically partisan messages at our facilities, so airports are not airing the video on airport-controlled screens," said a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates those three airports. A spokesperson for Charlotte Douglas International Airport said, North Carolina municipal law as well as CLT Airport's policy for digital content do not permit the referenced video." "The limited digital screens owned by CLT are designated for static content that supports wayfinding, provides essential travel information and promotes CLT's revenue-generating services." Spokespeople for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas said those facilities declined to post the video because of policies barring political content. "Additionally, as a facility that hosts federal operations, we remain mindful of the Hatch Act's restrictions on political activity in government workplaces. We remain committed to providing travelers with clear information that supports a smooth and efficient screening process." The Port of Portland, which operates Portland International Airport in Oregon, received a request from TSA to show Noem's video message about the shutdown. "However, we did not consent to playing the video in its current form, as we believe the Hatch Act clearly prohibits use of public assets for political purposes and messaging," Molly Prescott, aviation communications manager for the Port told CNBC by email. We believe consenting to playing this video on Port assets would violate Oregon law." Cleveland Hopkins International Airport has reportedly refused to show Noem's video. In a statement to CNBC, Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, reiterated comments that Noem made on the video. "It's unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship," she said. A shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown has caused flight delays and disruptions, CNBC reported last week. Last week, delayed flights occurred across the U.S. at airports including Burbank, California, and Nashville, Tennessee. Air travel was snarled during the more than monthlong government shutdown that ended in January 2019, hours after a shortfall of air traffic controllers disrupted flights in the New York area. Before that, some airport security checkpoints were closed due to elevated sick calls from Transportation Security Administration screeners who are also working without pay. On Tuesday, air traffic controllers received their first partial paycheck. If the shutdown continues, they will miss a full paycheck on Oct. 28. The government shutdown began Oct. 1 after the Senate failed to pass stopgap funding measures that would have maintained normal operations, at least for a while. Republicans, who hold a majority in the Senate, want to approve a so-called clean resolution passed by the House that would provide only short-term funding. Democrats insist that any such continuing resolution include a provision to extend the life of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. Those credits, which are due to expire at the end of 2025, lower the cost of health insurance for 22 million Americans who purchase plans from Obamacare marketplaces.

"It's the start of trillions being spent in this build out of the fourth Industrial Revolution," said Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities. "Big tech right now is doing the equivalent of building Vegas in the 1950s where there was just sand. You're really building out the future economy for consumers and enterprises," he added. A September 2025 analysis from Deutsche Bank argued that without AI-related investment, the US economy might already be in a recession. "GDP is being driven by all this investment," said Barry Knapp, managing partner at Ironsides Macroeconomics. "Earnings growth is being driven by all this investment. The S&P 500... [is] pretty unbalanced right now. And that does create a vulnerability to an investment bust at a point when we've blown out government spending to unprecedented levels." Unlike the dot-com boom, where companies had little revenue, many of today's AI giants are bringing in a lot of cash, but some experts are worried it may not be enough to sustain the elevated level of spending. Oracle, Meta and CoreWeave have each raised billions in debt or private credit to finance new data center infrastructure. "It's on the precipice of a more pronounced decline." Despite the risks, many see long-term upside from the current investment cycle and bullish investors remain optimistic. "Will there be bumps along the road? Yeah but I don't fear that this is too big to fail given it's propped up by tech. Trillions on the balance sheet, generating another $3 to $400 billion of cash a year," Ives said. "The reality is it's an arms race US versus China," Ives added. "And they don't have time to slow down because China is accelerating as well. And I think that's bullish in terms of the capex cycle that I really view as an AI supercycle."

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lara Sophie Bothur, Deloitte Germany's first corporate influencer. Bothur now works freelance as a tech influencer. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I joined the Big Four firm Deloitte in February 2021 as a business analyst in the innovation consulting division. My job was to talk to Deloitte's experts in quantum, AI, blockchain, smart manufacturing, and smart mobility teams. I didn't understand everything they said, which made showcasing their work tough. His curiosity made me realize how powerful it is when complex ideas become understandable. By explaining it to him, I turned something abstract into something emotional and relatable, and it made me realize I could do the same with how I communicate technology at work. I wrote a LinkedIn post about that conversation. I was shocked and impressed by the power of LinkedIn. In January 2022, we created a new role called "Voice for Innovation." It wasn't the most engaging title, so half a year later, when a business magazine called me the first full-time corporate influencer in Germany, I embraced it. In the beginning, I worked hard to actively build up my network — connecting with 100 relevant people each week. That is what I was doing for Deloitte — making people feel connected to the brand. I wasn't reposting job advertisements or promoting the firm like a PR. We wanted to show that Deloitte is not just an auditor, so it was my job to present the work and demonstrate our culture through storytelling. I was still a salaried employee and earned the same as consultants. I spent my days traveling, visiting tech hubs, attending and moderating events, networking with potential clients, and generating content around it all. No one else was doing that community and content management. My work impacted talent, clients, partnerships, and the brand. Another time, a woman told me she chose to join Deloitte over BCG because she'd seen me speak at an event and liked that they were clearly supporting my career as a young woman. We're entering a new era of business communication and influencer marketing, where it's about employees becoming the face of a company. I am a LinkedIn Top Voice and have one of the largest and most influential profiles on LinkedIn for tech translation. Last year, I reached 400 million impressions globally — which has a marketing value of $13 million — and I generated 10,000 marketing leads for Deloitte. You can pay for advertising, or you can make your employees visible and position your topics through them. There must be an intrinsic motivation to communicate a topic that you're passionate about, and you need to share the company's values. Deloitte Germany now has around 250 employees working part-time as corporate influencers. It's not easy being the face of a company. Last year, I faced criticism from some German media outlets. It was shocking, but trust is one of our key values at Deloitte, and we proved them wrong. It helped that Deloitte is an auditor — I had help from its data and statistics experts. Through explaining my approach, I earned the name "LinkedIn algorithm whisperer" in Germany. Any time you're public online, people form opinions. I often bring others onstage to share the spotlight. Still, as a corporate influencer, you must balance the company and your individual persona. This influencing approach requires followers to understand you and your values. I never post about politics or religion, but that doesn't mean I can't stand up for my values. Stepping out of the group can feel dangerous — but that's what innovation is. You must connect offline, and online, you need to respond to comments and shares quickly — especially in the first hour, when the LinkedIn algorithm decides if a post will take off. Sometimes it's pretty hard, but if you have a mission, and I have one, then you can do it. Toward the beginning of 2025, I started taking on some self-employed work moderating and speaking, and this summer, I decided it was time to leave Deloitte. I've become one of the most influential tech influencers in Europe, and I wanted the freedom to work with multiple companies. Requests have been pouring in since I announced my departure. I'll still collaborate with Deloitte, but can now partner internationally with new major clients, including SAP, Salesforce, AWS, Meta, and HP. But I also believe this field is the future. We talk about AI taking jobs, but new roles are being created, and corporate influencers are one of them — especially in the tech world. These roles didn't exist a few years ago, but now they're essential.</p>

Any young professional making their career on Wall Street will tell you that building skills means a ton of learning on the job. For Madison Crutchfield, one element of her background gave her a head start in mastering the busy trading floor: Being a Division I lacrosse player at Duke University. Crutchfield started out as a sophomore summer intern at Goldman Sachs in 2016, and has worked her way up the firm for the last seven years as a full-timer. Today, she's a vice president in equity derivative sales, and attributes a lot of her success to the skills she gained from playing lacrosse. In an interview, she told us how her days on the field have helped prepare her for the trading floor, including words of wisdom from her coach and what she expects from student-athlete job candidates. BI: What was life as a student athlete like? How did your background as a student athlete help you get to Goldman? MC: My coach would always say: 'Play fast, not hurried.' And that's really transferable in the world of sales and trading, where there's usually some 'game clock' ticking — be it you're executing an order, showing pricing for an order, answering a client, meeting a project deadline, whatever it might be. Having the ability to be efficient but not rushed is a critical edge. BI: What other lessons from sports do you use in your job now? MC: I think sports teach you how to win and lose. Seasons are marathons, not sprints, and you quickly learn not to get too high or too low — staying even keeled and patient is a must in order to stay focused. Missed calls by officials, inclement weather, showing up late to a game because of bus engine problems (which did happen), a rowdy crowd — I can't do anything about those things. Similarly, in corporate America, you have to battle back. It really rewards those who are resilient, who, rather than shutting down, become a quick study and turn it into a learning experience. MC: If someone was a student athlete, it tells me that they're accustomed to collaborating and know how to approach work with that 'we' mindset. When you're on a team, there's a commitment to each other and to a common goal, and it tells me that they likely understand and value the importance of doing their job in order for the team to succeed. BI: What advice would you give to student athletes eyeing Wall Street careers? My advice would be to focus on the culture of your target workplace and how that firm operates.</p>

Every startup lives with the same tension: a large incumbent can copy or crush it at any time. For Harvey, an artificial intelligence startup that builds tools for law firms and enterprises, the model-maker that powers its tech also has the power to destroy it. From Harvey's Manhattan office on Friday afternoon, cofounders Winston Weinberg and Gabe Pereyra put it bluntly. Harvey's toughest competitor isn't another niche startup; it's OpenAI. "Our largest competitor is by far, indirectly, OpenAI," Weinberg said. "I mean that in the sense of just — you need to make sure that your product gives so much more value than whatever the general products they're releasing are." The OpenAI Startup Fund wrote one of the first checks into Harvey and has continued to increase its stake with additional funding. The startup, last valued at $5 billion, has counted on being domain-specific to attract large law firms. The founders say they tell their team that customers will measure Harvey against whatever general-purpose tool OpenAI ships next, even if it doesn't specifically target legal work. Surveys by the American Bar Association and the Thomson Reuters Institute indicate that lawyers are already using ChatGPT to draft memos, conduct legal research, and predict case outcomes — with mixed results. Judges are increasingly catching fake citations in court documents. Across the software market, concerns are growing that the foundation model companies will launch specialized tools for narrow domains or use cases. Recently, OpenAI blogged about a set of internal tools — a contract review tool among them — that it uses to run its own business. Harvey builds on its models and works closely with the company to deploy custom-trained models and features for legal professionals. OpenAI hasn't publicly released the tools it showed off. Harvey's founders say the threat persists whether OpenAI targets lawyers or not. Pereyra argued that big cloud and model providers will continue to perfect general-purpose AI platforms — helpful developments, but not a focus for Harvey. "If you think about them as the main competitor," Weinberg said, "all that does is make you create better tools for your vertical faster."</p>

Richard Murby, whom I met while waiting in a long line to get into OpenAI's DevDay conference last week, agrees. He's the director of business development at Devpost, which helps developers participate in hackathons. This Q&A has been edited for clarity and length. Q: From what you witnessed at DevDay, is OpenAI now a force to be reckoned with in the minds of developers? Or does it still have work to do here? From our vantage point at Devpost, they are in a race for developer engagement and trust, and that's exactly the problem we help companies solve. (Full disclosure, we work with OpenAI and their competitors.) Q: Take me inside the mind of a developer. Why would they be clamoring to engage with OpenAI? What's the payoff for developers to build things on this nascent/emerging platform? GenAI offers a direct payoff for most developers, assisting them with everything from bug fixes to feature development. OpenAI is competing to be a developer's default choice. This is a clear signal that OpenAI is attempting to create a platform where developers can find users and earn revenue, much like Apple did with the App Store. Q: What are the drawbacks for developers building on OpenAI's platform? What did you see on Monday that changes this situation, if anything? With such fierce competition and an intense pace of innovation, the primary challenge for developers is simply keeping up. This is compounded by the fact that new AI benchmarks are surpassed almost weekly by different competitors, and internal security and IT teams can only ingest so many new tools at once. In the meantime, as the race is on, developers are utilizing these tools both at work and in their free time. This is why hackathons are so critical—they provide a dedicated space for companies to test tools and for developers to gain hands-on experience, all while providing valuable feedback. From what we saw on Monday, OpenAI is making a significant statement that it wants to be the next platform. Their investments in infrastructure, the new app directory, and a new coding agent all signal that they are here to stay and want to be the default choice for developers. Q: How far away is OpenAI from challenging the current major platforms, Apple iOS, Google Android etc? The comparison to Apple and Google is a red herring. What OpenAI is doing is not a traditional platform play — it's a straight-up attempt to build the dominant conversational operating system of the future. That's a new frontier, and I feel incredibly fortunate to be a part of it and see how it unfolds. One of the things Jony Ive said really stuck with me.</p>

The latest round of federal worker firings could leave laid-off public servants with student loans high and dry. Fired federal workers could lose progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments. For payments to count toward PSLF, a borrower must be working for a qualifying employer, like the federal government, when the payments are made. Carolyn Fast, director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider that she recommends borrowers affected by the federal cuts document their PSLF payment count now and make sure they have copies of it to avoid any issues down the road when they have to verify their payments to receive relief. She also said that borrowers who are at the 120 payment mark should apply for forgiveness as soon as they can. "So it'd be important to do that while you're still a federal worker." The PSLF buyback process could also be beneficial for some federal workers, Fast said. Buybacks allow borrowers to "buy back" months spent in deferment or forbearance periods by making payments equal to what they would have owed at the time, if those payments would enable them to reach the 120 payment threshold. Federal workers with over 10 years of public service but who have not yet received forgiveness should consider whether they might qualify for a buyback, Fast said. Employees who received a RIF notice were placed on administrative leave beginning October 10, according to the notices reviewed by Business Insider, and the terminations will become effective in early December. The student-loan repayment system is undergoing major changes. The Department of Education held negotiations in July on President Donald Trump's executive order to limit PSLF eligibility, which the department said could end up delaying or blocking relief for some borrowers. At the same time, the department is working to implement a repayment overhaul that Trump signed into law as part of his "big beautiful" spending legislation passed in July. The department also proposed new caps on graduate and professional borrowing.</p>

The US economy is strong, but America may be entering an era of "jobless growth" because of artificial intelligence, Goldman Sachs wrote in a Monday note. "The modest job growth alongside robust GDP growth seen recently is likely to be normal to some degree in the years ahead," analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote. They added that this trend is likely to continue, with most potential growth coming from AI-driven productivity. Meanwhile, population and lower immigration would contribute only modestly to the labor supply. There are already signs of a weaker job market, wrote the analysts. However, concerns about technology displacing workers are nothing new, Goldman's analysts acknowledged. Until recently, that disruption hasn't shown up clearly in the data. "While we are skeptical of the boldest claims that rapid technological progress could lead to very high unemployment, some transitional friction is possible," wrote Goldman's analysts. They described that friction as a normal part of the economy adjusting to new technologies. The bank's research shows that past waves of technological progress have temporarily increased unemployment and forced more workers to change occupations. The kind of innovation matters, too: Some technologies create jobs, while others, like many AI tools, replace them. "If AI is mainly labor-substituting, it could present a greater challenge to maintaining full employment," the analysts warned. "In past recessions, employment of workers in routine occupations has dropped sharply — especially when they followed productivity booms — and did not recover after," they wrote. After the 2001 recession, US GDP bounced back quickly thanks to tech-driven productivity, but total employment lagged for years as companies used the downturn to cut jobs. "A leading explanation for this phenomenon is that companies use recessions to restructure and streamline their workforce by laying off workers in less productive areas," they wrote. "This is especially true when recessions follow productivity booms that give companies some pent-up ability to cut labor costs and improve efficiency without significantly hurting their productive capacity," they added. AI could also deepen inequality, rewarding workers who can leverage new technology while squeezing out midlevel jobs. AI could "hollow out" middle-income white-collar roles, much like factory automation once displaced skilled blue-collar workers, the analysts wrote. Early evidence suggests that in some cases, the technology might actually help lower-skilled workers more than higher-skilled ones. In September, the private sector lost 32,000 jobs, according to ADP data.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>France has airlifted Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina out of the country after weeks of youth-led protests and military defections plunged the Indian Ocean nation into chaos. The dramatic evacuation, reportedly carried out on a French military aircraft, follows mass demonstrations demanding Rajoelina's resignation and marks the latest in a wave of youth-driven uprisings shaking governments across Africa. Rajoelina confirmed in a late-night address posted on the presidency's social media accounts that he had left the country, citing threats to his life. He said constitutional order must be maintained in Madagascar but cautioned that youth frustrations “must not be exploited by military factions.” Siteny Randrianasoloniaiko, the leader of Madagascar's parliamentary opposition, told reporters that Rajoelina left after key army units defected to join demonstrators demanding his resignation. The unrest began on September 25 as small protests over power and water shortages but quickly morphed into a nationwide uprising. The demonstrations form part of a broader wave of youth-led movements worldwide, echoing recent protests in Nepal, where the prime minister resigned last month, and in Morocco, where young people have rallied against unemployment and inequality. Rajoelina's authority began to unravel when CAPSAT, an elite military unit that helped him seize power in a 2009 coup, joined the protests. Also read: Madagascar uprising sees soldiers defy orders, fueling fears of another coup in Africa On Monday, thousands gathered in Antananarivo's Independence Square, waving flags and chanting, “The president must quit now.” At least 22 people have been killed in clashes between protesters and security forces since the unrest began, according to the United Nations. Also read: Gen-Z protest in Madagascar faces fatigue as it comes to a temporary halt In one of his final official moves before leaving, Rajoelina reportedly pardoned several prisoners, including two French nationals convicted of plotting a coup in 2021, a gesture widely interpreted as an attempt to shore up diplomatic goodwill with Paris. Despite being the world's largest producer of vanilla and rich in minerals including nickel, cobalt, titanium, and graphite, Madagascar's 30 million people face extreme poverty, with over 75% living on less than $2 a day.
