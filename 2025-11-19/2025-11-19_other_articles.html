                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Have you ever imagined accidentally filming a UFO while simply testing your camera? This month, two men in the United States experienced exactly that. The incident happened on Nov. 4 this year in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The people filming were 33-year-old Alex Ramage and 38-year-old Andrei Volk. During a break at work, they planned to film airplanes in the sky to test the zoom function on a Samsung phone. After watching the bizarre footage, both Alex and Andrei were shocked. Alex believes they captured evidence of extraterrestrial life. Both insist the video was not fabricated, and they cannot explain the unidentified flying object in it. We were terrified!” They were only filming airplanes, and never expected to see a disk-shaped object in the playback. Alex said the object moved differently from an airplane. The discovery left both of them thrilled and astonished. Alex has always believed UFOs exist, but never imagined he would witness one with his own eyes. Reports say another UFO sighting occurred on the 13th of this month. A black ring appeared in the sky above Disneyland in California, causing panic among visitors who feared there might be extraterrestrial life nearby. You are now signed up for our newsletter</p>

Fresh from finding potential biosignatures on the Bright Angel formation in Cheyava Falls, announced in September, NASA's Perseverance rover has discovered a highly unusual and out of place rock on Mars. Every now and then, the rovers exploring the Red Planet send back an image of an unusual rock on our neighbor planet. These can range from the interesting, for example, this coral-shaped rock, to the interesting to conspiracy theorists, such as this "crab shark" formation. The 80-centimeter (31-inch) wide rock, named “Phippsaksla", stands out from its environment. According to analysis from NASA, the rock likely did not originate on Mars. "This rock was identified as a target of interest based on its sculpted, high-standing appearance that differed from that of the low-lying, flat and fragmented surrounding rocks," Candice Bedford, Research Scientist at Purdue University, explained in a NASA blog post. "Last week, Perseverance targeted Phippsaksla with the SuperCam instrument revealing that it is high in iron and nickel. This element combination is usually associated with iron-nickel meteorites formed in the core of large asteroids, suggesting that this rock formed elsewhere in the solar system." "As such, it has been somewhat unexpected that Perseverance had not seen iron-nickel meteorites within Jezero crater, particularly given its similar age to Gale crater and number of smaller impact craters suggesting that meteorites did fall on the crater floor, delta, and crater rim throughout time," Bedford added. Estimates, looking at NASA's InSight seismometer data, suggest that the planet gets hit by around 280 to 360 meteorite impacts every year, which are large enough to produce craters larger than 8 meters (26 feet) wide. In fact, it's a little intriguing why we haven't spotted more of them, given the robots and orbiters we have exploring the planet.</p>

Charlie Kirk's former head of security, Brian Harpole, is pushing back against online conspiracy theories surrounding the Utah shooting that killed the conservative commentator. Speaking with podcaster Shawn Ryan, Harpole addressed the viral claims that his “unusual hand movements” before the attack were coded signals — a theory that has exploded across social media. Harpole clarified how real security teams operate and emphasised that no professional detail would ever rely on ambiguous hand gestures, especially ones easily confused with normal movement. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a revelation that has sent ripples through the astronomical community, an international team of scientists claims to have uncovered the first tangible evidence of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. Out of over five million sources, the team pinpointed seven candidates exhibiting unusual infrared emissions unexplained by natural phenomena. The Hephaistos team developed sophisticated models to detect partial Dyson spheres, focusing on infrared waste heat as a key signature. The team acknowledges this, planning follow-up observations with ground-based telescopes to rule out contaminants. Building on decades of SETI efforts, Project Hephaistos represents a shift toward data-driven searches for alien technology. Unlike traditional radio signal hunts, this approach targets ‘passive' evidence of industrial activity on a cosmic scale. The candidates, all red dwarf stars within 900 light-years, show mid-infrared excesses that align with theoretical models of Dyson swarms at temperatures around 100-600 Kelvin. The James Webb Space Telescope, for instance, has already provided strong evidence of potential biosignatures on exoplanets like K2-18b, as detailed in a 2025 report by Reuters. For space industry insiders, these findings underscore the growing intersection of astrophysics and engineering. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, pursuing megastructures in our own solar system, might draw inspiration—or caution—from these distant anomalies. ‘If verified, this could redefine our understanding of technological progress,' remarked Harvard's Avi Loeb in discussions about interstellar objects like 3I/ATLAS, covered by Charisma Magazine Online. Public reaction on platforms like X has been fervent, with posts amplifying claims of imminent announcements. Yet, experts like those at Virginia Tech warn against hype, emphasizing rigorous verification. Recent discoveries, including a super-Earth 20 light-years away detailed in ScienceDaily, enhance the habitable zone search. The Hephaistos team counters this by employing AI-driven filters to minimize errors, aligning with BBC reports on AI's role in extraterrestrial searches. International cooperation is key, with Indian-led expansions in intelligent life searches reported by The Hindu. Upcoming missions, including NASA's Roman Space Telescope, promise higher-resolution data to scrutinize these candidates. Beyond Dyson spheres, 2025 has seen claims of Mars biosignatures from NASA's Perseverance rover, as hyped in CNET. ‘This could be a tipping point,' echoed astronomers in The Guardian, though Nature's coverage highlights ongoing skepticism. For industry leaders, confirming alien megastructures could spur investments in energy-harvesting tech, mirroring Dyson's vision. Ethical debates arise: Should humanity broadcast our presence, or remain silent amid potential risks? As X posts from users like Michael Salla speculate on ‘November surprises,' the scientific community remains grounded. With follow-ups planned for 2026, these findings—while provisional—ignite a new era in cosmic exploration.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recently captured NASA SkyCam video has left audiences utterly captivated. The footage shows a triangular object sporting what witnesses describe as striking 'red exhausts', igniting widespread discussion among viewers. This extraordinary sighting is now setting the internet alight, prompting many to question what the camera captured high above Earth. A clip shared online, labelled 'NASA SkyCam Footage', has generated widespread discussion on social media. Many who have seen the video assert it features a three-sided flying object emitting prominent 'red exhausts'. These striking images have sparked a fresh discussion of unidentified flying objects. Still, experts in space technology say the reports do not correspond to any known NASA mechanism, suggesting they could be mistaken identity. The alleged NASA SkyCam footage of a triangular object with 'red exhausts' is linked to several unexplained flying object (UFO) sightings and speculative narratives, rather than a verified or formally acknowledged event or phenomenon from NASA. A large triangular UFO flew near the ISS earlier today. Dr Drew agreed to the request in a second post, sharing two different recordings. Some people asked for it, so here was the original ISS video today. You can see a large triangular UFO flying right-to-left around time 0:38 seconds (video 1). Then NASA turns off both video and audio signals at time 1:00. 'You can see a large triangular UFO flying right-to-left around time 0:38 seconds (video 1)', he wrote. Then NASA turns off both video and audio signals at time 1:00. 'An enlarged close-up of that triangular UFO is shown in video 2. NASA will hold their dog-and-pony show tomorrow', he noted. In his third message on X, Dr Drew suggested that another long International Space Station clip is being shared, which appears to show some 'space wreckage' tracking the 'real triangular UFO' as it crosses the view from right to left. There is another long ISS video going around, which looks as if some kind of "space wreckage" follows that "real triangular UFO" through the scene from right to left. I do not wish to comment on that long video at present because: (a) it might be a fake put out by NASA, to try… Nevertheless, he chose not to provide commentary on the previous recording, offering these justifications: (b) that real UFO may really have blown something up? (c) I find it hard to believe that NASA would be DUMB enough to restore the feed, after a huge triangular UFO passes by!' He maintains that some directive clearly went out to spread that deceptive explanation on X, posing the question of why, when anyone can tell it is not 'lights on the ground'. 'For me, it is enough to document a real, spectacular UFO, and not get caught up in other information that may be a deliberate fake, or else disastrously real, if we do not know which. Best wishes with love and respect to you all.</p>

NASA has not issued a specific statement on this clip yet. NASA historically explains that these cutaways are automatic when the station drops out of relay satellite coverage or controllers switch cameras, which happens many times a day. In past flare-ups, NASA spokespeople described the ISS video system as automated and prone to blue-screening during Tracking and Data Relay Satellite handoffs. NASA also notes that bright “objects” often prove to be meteors, reentering debris, satellites or simple reflections from the station or Earth. The High Definition Earth Viewing experiment that made these public feeds famous ended on August 22, 2019. Today's public views come from other external cameras that behave the same way during link gaps. NASA's current UAP policy is to study unusual sightings with better data rather than speculation. Treat third-party timestamps cautiously unless mirrored by official logs. NASA's public ISS video rides the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites. When the ISS drops out of KU-band coverage or controllers switch sources, the public video automatically reverts to a blue screen or preset slate. As per a CBS News report dated July 14, 2016, NASA spokesperson Daniel Huot said, Sometimes the slate appears just as a bright point enters the frame, which viewers read as intent. Past NASA statements describe coincidence tied to link margins and automation, not manual censorship. Space.com's summary of the same 2016 controversy adds that both “object in view” and “feed cut” happen regularly, and that NASA “did not turn off the camera intentionally.” Meteors or reentering debris often skim Earth's limb. Small flecks of ISS-adjacent debris can flash as they tumble. And optical artefacts from the station's structure, window reflections, lens flare or even bad pixels are routine. As per Space.com report dated July 14, 2016, NASA representatives stated, Media breakdowns of 2015 to 2017 clips emphasized that both “object” and “feed cut” are normal and not evidence of a deliberate blackout. The 2016 CBS coverage included NASA's technical explanation and pointed to meteors or reentering hardware as likely sources. On odd audio or video moments, recent confusion came from a misrouted training drill that aired by mistake. As per The Guardian report dated June 13, 2024, NASA's ISS account posted,</p>

N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), sometimes referred to as the "spirit molecule," has potentially been used for thousands of years. You may already be aware of the substance through the work of American philosopher, ethnobotanist, and author Terence McKenna, who developed some pretty strange views on the topic, or UFC commentator turned podcaster Joe Rogan. The drug, when inhaled, produces an intense psychedelic experience which can be unsettling, profound, or destabilizing, and can last for up to 45 minutes. "DMT is a reliable method for crossing in to a dimension that human beings have debated the existence of for 50.000 years," McKenna said of the drug. "Is there an invisible nearby world inhabited by active intelligences with which human beings can communicate? Otherwise we just don't have anything to talk about." One particularly odd aspect (we should stress this is likely due to changes taking place in the brain, though we don't know the precise mechanism yet) is a certain similarity in experiences that have been reported by DMT users. McKenna described his own experience of encountering "entities" which became known in the DMT-taking community as "machine elves". "During my own experiences smoking synthesized DMT in Berkeley, I had had the impression of bursting into a space inhabited by merry elfin, self-transforming, machine creatures," he said in his book True Hallucinations. "Dozens of these friendly fractal entities, looking like self-dribbling Faberge eggs on the rebound, had surrounded me and tried to teach me the lost language of true poetry." That's a pretty odd experience, and McKenna went on to describe other bizarre hallucinations, where the "elves" and "jesters" toyed with him, or else presented advanced technology to him which could be operated through song. Study author Stephen Kagan attempted to break these experiences down into categories of Places, Objects, Entities, Feelings, and Attributes, which were further broken down (for instance, the Places category contains experiences of domes, caves, space, and hyperdimensional places). This often meant that what they experienced was more vibrant, complex, varied or detailed than what they normally experienced in their daily lives. In most cases the ability to perceive their normal surrounding reality did not remain intact and if it did, then the content and structure of their DMT experiences were superimposed upon and within the external world." Some of the more interesting "entities" seen by DMT users included "gods:mythic", "jester:clown", "elves:goblins" and a rather sinister category of "disembodied". "Sometimes they appear as aliens, family members, have strange shaped bodies or heads, limbs with extra joints or that separate in unusual ways," the study reads. "Their clothing varied from spacesuits to tribal to that of ancient Egyptians or Greeks and their skin varied in color, sometimes blue, red or golden. In many of the experiences, the hallucinated entities acted as guides, imparting wisdom whether they were an insectoid or a simple geometric shape. Another small study found that 94 percent of the participants experienced "encounters" with other beings, with over half describing these "encounters" as benevolent. She was definitely giggling, as if to say, ‘This fucking stupid idiot here he comes again I'm gonna show him, Bang! "This female entity is fucking all-powerful but at the same time very mischievous and jokey and infantile… So she's like, ‘I'm the master and orchestrator of this whole situation, but I like having a laugh at the same time'… In that space it's almost like she came to get me, kind of knew I was coming – ‘Come, come, come, giggle giggle, laugh, look at that, now you are here, now I just sit back and watch you!'" Though these experiences are certainly taking place in the brain (we're a science website, please don't get mad at us for saying that), they can certainly have a profound effect on the user. "More than half of those who identified as atheist before the experience no longer identified as atheist afterwards," another study explains. They note that "entity encounter experiences have many similarities to non-drug entity encounter experiences such as those described in religious, alien abduction, and near-death contexts." So what is going on in the brain during these experiences? One idea, backed by a study that used electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on people undergoing a DMT dose, is that DMT blurs the boundaries of brain networks, resulting in "global functional connectivity". Humans have unusually big brains and model an unusually large amount of the world," first author Dr Chris Timmermann, from the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London, said in a statement at the time. What we have seen with DMT is that activity in highly evolved areas and systems of the brain that encode especially high-level models becomes highly dysregulated under the drug, and this relates to the intense drug ‘trip'." Though we would like to give something more conclusive for why users report these experiences, the truth is that we have a better picture from studies like these, but more research is needed. "Our results revealed that when a volunteer was on DMT there was a marked dysregulation of some of the brain rhythms that would ordinarily be dominant. The brain switched in its mode of functioning to something altogether more anarchic," senior author Professor Robin Carhart-Harris, founder of the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London, added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘Supernatural' ran for 15 seasons — and introduced more than one cast member to their partner Supernatural may be a show about hunting demons and facing the paranormal, but for many stars, it also sparked real-life love stories. The fan-favorite CW drama, which ran for 15 seasons from 2005 to 2020, followed brothers Sam and Dean Winchester — played by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, respectively — as they traveled the country hunting demons, ghosts and other paranormal creatures while uncovering dark family secrets. Jared met his future wife, Genevieve Padalecki, on set while she was filming a scene as the demon Ruby, and the Winchesters' on-screen dad, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, met his wife, Hilarie Burton, thanks to a castmate's introduction. When the series finale aired on Nov. 19, 2020, it marked an emotional farewell between the actors and their beloved characters — but also a moment of gratitude for what the show had brought into their lives. Genevieve honored that chapter with a heartfelt Instagram tribute to her husband and their shared journey: You walked in a young kid of 23 and walked away married to a demon and spawned 3 children," she wrote. From on-set meet-cutes to behind-the-scenes romances, here's a look at the real-life love stories that began in the world of Supernatural. I interrupted her while she was reading a book and I think she got kind of fussy about it." In 2010, Jared and Genevieve moved to Austin, Texas, where they raise their three kids — and a flock of chickens. They welcomed their first son, Thomas "Tom" Colton, on March 19, 2012, and their second son, Austin "Shep" Shepherd, was born at home on Dec. 22, 2013. Jared and Genevieve had their daughter, Odette Elliott, on March 17, 2017. “Because of this show, we're now celebrating almost 11 years married, 3 amazing kids, traveling the world together, and making incredible friends who have formed and shaped who we are today,” Genevieve wrote on X following the Supernatural finale. "She sacrificed so much while I was in Vancouver [shooting Supernatural] ... She was home a lot with the kids, changing diapers and making lunches. Jensen has been married to One Tree Hill actress Danneel Ackles since 2010. However, unlike costars Jared and Genevieve, the two were married before Danneel appeared on Supernatural in 2018. The couple wed in Dallas in 2010, and Danneel shared a series of pictures from the event on their eighth wedding anniversary on Facebook, calling her husband “the most patient man on earth.” The couple now share three children; they announced the birth of their first child, Justice Jay, on May 30, 2013, and three years later, Jensen and Danneel welcomed fraternal twins Zeppelin Bram and Arrow Rhodes. They have since taken on several projects together, launching Chaos Machine Productions in 2020 with their first project as co-executive producers being a Supernatural spinoff called The Winchesters. Jensen and Danneel also co-own the Family Business Beer Co., a brewery with a nod back to Supernatural's famous opener. The couple went on to welcome two children: son West and daughter Maison. Collins confirmed that he and Vantoch had separated in the acknowledgments of his 2021 poetry collection, Some Things I Still Can't Tell You. He seemingly debuted a new relationship in August 2024, when he posted a picture on Instagram with Emily Farallon at the Democratic National Convention. “Emily's so excited to be here, she finally let me post a photo,” Collins wrote. Mark Sheppard, who played the demon Crowley for seven seasons of Supernatural, met his wife, Sarah Louise Sheppard, thanks to the show. The couple first crossed paths at a 2014 Supernatural convention in Vancouver — what was meant to be Sarah's last, according to her Instagram. It was like time stopped when we started talking," she recalled. A longtime fan of the show, Sarah acknowledged the conversations around Mark dating a fan — “as well there should have been,” she noted on Instagram — but added that she and Mark were “the real deal.” The two welcomed a daughter, Isabella Rose Sheppard, on March 1, 2016, and also parent Mark's two sons from a previous marriage. In 2023, Mark credited Sarah with saving his life after he suffered six heart attacks. "If not for my wife, the @losangelesfiredepartment at Mulholland and the incredible staff @providencecalifornia St. Joseph's - I wouldn't be writing this," he wrote on Instagram. For Morgan, who played the demon-hunting father of Sam and Dean, love also found its way into his life through Supernatural. It was fellow cast member Jensen and his wife, Danneel, who introduced Morgan to One Tree Hill actress Hilarie Burton on a blind date in 2009. Burton told PEOPLE that their decision to get married was about being honest with each other and the relationship they had. I think there comes a point where you just don't want to go another day by being inauthentic about it," she said. Burton played Lucille, the late wife of Morgan's character, Negan, whose infamous barbed wire-wrapped bat is named after her. Their son, Augustus, even made his acting debut in the same episode, appearing as a young zombie. She is known for her work on Strangers in a Strange Land (2018), according to her IMDb, but she's also played a behind-the-scenes role in many of Mark's biggest projects — including Dexter, Lost and Supernatural. In a video shared on Tracy's Instagram, Mark revealed that she often "stealth directed" him through scenes as his on-set acting coach. The couple split their time between Los Angeles and Paris, according to Tracy's Instagram bio, and have posted sweet photos together in the City of Love, including a picture of the two kissing in front of the Eiffel Tower, which Mark captioned, "Lovers in paradise. The two developed a romantic connection off-screen and announced their engagement on Oct. 29, 2024, with Benedict telling PEOPLE that he proposed earlier in the year, just before the birth of their first daughter, Margaret. He added, "We're getting a lot of love and support from my older children," referring to Audrey and Calvin, whom he shares with his ex-wife, Mollie. "We are very happy and looking forward to the adventure." Connell also shared the birth news on Instagram along with a sweet picture of the newborn's feet, writing, "In love. Actors DJ Qualls and Ty Olsson also found love through the Supernatural universe — though they never actually met on set. "Ty and I became inseparable at the very beginning, just immediately," Qualls shared. "Over the last 10 years, our relationship evolved to what it is today and now we're getting married." [He is] the best friend I ever had. And now we're going to be old men together, which is so crazy,” Qualls said. After the episode aired, congratulations poured in from fans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tammy Bruce, the Fox News contributor turned State Department spokesperson who is now awaiting confirmation as deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, spent years promoting baseless Islamophobic conspiracy theories and espousing incendiary rhetoric, including about then-President Barack Obama. A CNN investigation examined Bruce's public comments beginning in the early 2000s and found “a pattern of demeaning language about Muslims,” including statements suggesting that American Muslims “needed to prove their loyalty” to the U.S. following 9/11. “Somewhere in Kenya, a village is missing its idiot,” she wrote on her blog. Her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled for Wednesday. In a post announcing her nomination to the deputy ambassador role, in which she would be serving under Ambassador Mike Waltz, Trump wrote, “Since the beginning of my Second Term, Tammy has been serving with distinction as Spokesperson of the State Department, where she did a fantastic job.” ”Tammy Bruce will represent our Country brilliantly at the United Nations. Bruce's incendiary rhetoric was not limited to online blogs; as a Fox News personality, she garnered controversy after describing then-Harvard President Dr. Claudine Gay as “that Black woman at Harvard,” and making fun of an autistic child, calling him a “snowflake.” Bruce also used to mock Secretary of State Marco Rubio, her boss for much of this year, dubbing him “Little Marco” and criticizing him for “sounding like his Establishment handlers.” During one interview, CNN anchor Pamela Brown told the former Fox host, who had refused to answer questions about Rubio's withdrawal from Ukraine peace talks, “You are the State Department spokesperson.” “It is very fair for me to ask you basic questions about what has been said publicly.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this episode, Angus Fletcher explains why the human brain doesn't work like a computer and why our deepest strengths come not from logic or data processing but from imagination, emotion, and the ability to invent new futures. Drawing on neuroscience, Shakespeare, evolutionary biology, and his work with U.S. Army Special Operations, Fletcher shows how storytelling is the brain's oldest “technology,” why intelligence is rooted in action rather than analysis, and what most people get wrong about creativity and common sense. Angus Fletcher is a professor of story science at Ohio State's Project Narrative, the world's leading academic think tank dedicated to understanding how stories work. He earned his PhD from Yale, conducted postdoctoral research at Stanford, and in 2023 received the U.S. Army's Commendation Medal for his groundbreaking work with Army Special Operations on primal intelligence.
