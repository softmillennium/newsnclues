                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Memo may not be the world's fastest barista, but it is impressive—for a robot. I recently watched as Memo, a new home robot from a company called Sunday Robotics, made coffee in an open-plan kitchen in Mountain View, California. Today most robots still do precise, repetitive work in tightly controlled environments; for example, moving the same item from one position to another over and over again. The last decade has seen some companies build robots that use AI to do simple things, like identify objects on a conveyor belt and decide how to grasp them. The real question is how well Memo can perform tasks in a wide variety of homes without Sunday's engineers nearby. This feat was especially impressive because it involved figuring out how to grasp two glasses in the same hand. Memo held one glass between its thumb and pointer finger, and used the rest of its hand to grab the second. The training data gathered from glove-wearing workers is fed into an AI model that takes input from the robot's sensors and controls its motions. “This is a very exciting variant on home robots,” says Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at UC Berkeley and the cofounder of Ambi Robotics. The fact that any company thinks it can build a useful and functional home robot is a sign of skyrocketing optimism about progress in robotics—and not without reason. Researchers have shown in the last few years that robots can tap into the capabilities of large language models, the brains behind today's chatbots, and use them to respond to commands or make sense of a scene. Some researchers hope that gathering large amounts of data that shows how to perform different actions—picking up cups, folding shirts, and so on—will produce a more general kind of robotic intelligence. Zhao worked on a project called Mobile ALOHA at Stanford University that involved training robots using a low-cost mobile teleoperation system. Chi worked on a project from Stanford, Columbia University, and the Toyota Research Institute, that showed how a cheap clawlike device could be used to gather data from humans doing tasks like cleaning dishes. We just don't have the internet for robotics.” A handful of other startups are currently hustling to develop and deploy more capable robots, including systems designed to work in ordinary homes. Physical Intelligence, Skild, and Generalist are all working on robot models that can adapt to new situations using this approach. 1x recently revealed a humanoid home robot, though this system still requires teleoperation to perform some tasks. Eric Vishria, a general partner at venture capital firm Benchmark, which is backing Sunday, said in a statement that the startup's practical approach is the way to make robots more useful. “The promise of AI robotics isn't doing a backflip or dancing demos, but robots that work in messy, real-world situations,” Vishria said, adding that Sunday's “breakthroughs mark the start of an exponential curve toward a future where robots actually work in our day-to-day lives.” The pilot program will show how people respond to having a home robot that can do certain chores—albeit slowly, and perhaps not perfectly every time. A key question will be how reliably and efficiently Memo is able to do chores in real homes where kids, pets, and mess are guaranteed to complicate the challenge. After beta testing, Zhao says Sunday will roll Memo out to the first users. Just as early home computers were complicated and appealed mostly to enthusiasts, he believes Memo might initially be popular with those who want to live in a robotic future and are willing to tolerate some rough edges. This might even involve users showing their robots how to do something new. “I do think that people should be able to teach their own robots,” Zhao says. Perhaps the era of truly capable home robots is almost upon us. Updated 1:26 pm ET, November 19, 2025: Added comments from Sarah Guo and additional details about the Sunday team.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China has your back if you ever need to repair an expensive Nvidia GPU. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The connector is readily available on Chinese second-hand e-commerce marketplaces, such as Goofish, for less than $25. This information is helpful in case you accidentally damage the connector and need a replacement. One incident resulted from a failed liquid-cooling attempt on the expensive GeForce RTX 5090, while the other was caused by improper packaging during transportation, affecting an even more eye-watering RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell. Although both damages were attributed to user error, the outcome was favorable, as Nvidia unexpectedly agreed to provide replacements in both instances. The connectors are priced at approximately $19 to $23, with some sellers offering free shipping. Nvidia was generous in resolving both situations, despite the apparent cause being user error. The chipmaker could have easily declined to provide replacements, as user error is outside the scope of standard warranty coverage. One cannot help but ponder whether there exists an ulterior motive behind Nvidia's actions. The RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell, featuring a damaged PCIe connector, was allegedly the property of a high-profile tech YouTuber boasting over 40 million subscribers. One might contend that Nvidia just wanted to avoid negative publicity. It also makes you wonder whether an average Joe would receive the same level of treatment. Nvidia is the world's first company to reach a valuation of $5 trillion; therefore, replacing a graphics card costing $1,999 or even $10,000 will not even dent its financials. Moreover, the graphics card merely requires a replacement of the PCIe connector, which Nvidia can easily replace and subsequently sell. The issue is that Nvidia doesn't sell individual replacement parts, so you or a third party can't do the replacement.

Desk said it is processing 100+ closed transactions per month, with inaccuracies on fewer than 0.2% of deals. Desk, founded earlier this year, is also targeting brokerages to help them maintain transaction records. Sylvan said the February release of Claude 3.7 was a breakthrough, transforming how accurately AI can read and interpret real estate contracts — including edge cases like handwritten signatures and custom conditions. “Being an agent is a contact sport filled with 10-second phone calls and short texts,” he said. I could care less if an AI put the paperwork together. Sylvan and co-founder Stewart Renehan previously launched Lotside, a startup billed as “Zillow for house flippers.” That company didn't quite take off but still has 20,000 monthly users, Sylvan said. University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines. Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

Blue screens of death in public are an increasingly rare yet ever-so-hilarious phenomenon. Now, Microsoft is tightening its rope on even these unorthodox BSOD appearances with a new "Digital Signage Mode" announced at the Ignite 2025 event. Once enabled, any blue screen of death will only remain visible for 15 seconds, then automatically disappear without needing manual intervention. Keep in mind that a BSOD almost always leads to an immediate restart anyway, so these are edge-case scenarios we're talking about. "Once enabled, it helps ensure no Windows screens or error dialogs will show on your public displays," said Microsoft in the announcement blog, which also details AI agents that we recently covered in our Agent Workspace story. Digital signage mode is not related to the already existing Kiosk mode, which locks down Windows to just one platform or application, often booting directly into it without loading other UI. Kiosks run enterprise-grade Windows, which is more stable to begin with, but a lot of the time, billboards and posters are managed more leniently, where such a fallback could be of genuine help in an emergency. Once again, we're only referring to non-interactive screens showing adverts here, so that lousy government software-running terminal in your local office won't be affected. Microsoft says in its blog post that Kiosk mode is still the ideal choice for interactive displays, such as those issuing tickets at a bank, or perhaps an ordering counter at a restaurant. Aside from this new recovery feature set to rob us of iconic public BSODs, Microsoft also introduced other stability-based improvements in Windows, such as a more comprehensive restore point system, called "Point-in-time Restore." Copilot made an expected appearance at the event as well, with lots of focus on AI features we all definitely asked for. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google Maps is rolling out new features designed to help users save time and feel more prepared, including a Gemini-powered “know before you go” tool. The navigation app is also launching an improved Explore tab and a new EV charger availability prediction feature. Now, when users search for places in Maps like restaurants, hotels, or concert venues, they'll see a new “know before you go” tips section that will surface important information about the place. This “know before you go” tips section is rolling out now in the U.S. on Android and iOS. As for the updated Explore tab, Google has made it easier and faster to find trending spots near you. Users can now swipe up to see trending and popular restaurants, activities, and sights nearby, such as a new cafe that just opened up or a quirky art gallery around the corner. The updated Explore tab starts rolling out this month globally on Android and iOS. Additionally, the company announced that EV drivers can now see how many chargers will likely be available once they arrive at their destination by searching for “EV chargers” in Maps. EV charger availability predictions start rolling out next week on Android Auto and cars with Google built-in. Google is also making it possible for users to leave reviews under a nickname, such as “Eager Elf” or “Julia Loves Sweets.” Reviews are still associated with a Google Account behind the scenes, so users can only leave one review per business. Wednesday's announcement follows Google Maps' recent integration of Gemini, which lets users ask about points of interest along their route, get answers on topics like sports or news, and perform tasks such as adding events to their calendar.

Editor's note: This series profiles six of the Seattle region's “Uncommon Thinkers”: inventors, scientists, technologists and entrepreneurs transforming industries and driving positive change in the world. Uncommon Thinkers is presented in partnership with Greater Seattle Partners. After earning his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, Brian Pinkard spent six months “flipping rocks,” as he describes it, in Colorado's Rocky Mountains. His passion to do good, paired with an engineer's drive for problem solving, led him to a doctoral degree from the University of Washington and then to launching Aquagga, a startup that's destroying PFAS — a toxic class of pollutants known as “forever chemicals.” “Brian has been very laser focused on his mission,” said Igor Novosselov, Pinkard's PhD advisor and research professor at the UW's Department of Mechanical Engineering. But a few steps before PFAS, Pinkard was focused on nerve gas in the Middle East. When Pinkard joined Novosselov's lab, it had U.S. Department of Defense funding to develop an in-the-field, mobile strategy for treating barrels of abandoned chemical weapons in the Syrian desert. RELATED: ‘Forever chemicals' are eternal no more thanks to a pollution destroying device from Tacoma startup Then as he was preparing to finish his PhD in June 2020, the COVID pandemic hit, derailing his plans to apply for a university postdoctoral fellowship as no one was hiring. Pinkard teamed up with engineer and tech innovator Nigel Sharp to explore the potential for using the tech, called supercritical water oxidation, to treat sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants, but they realized the market wasn't viable. “Everybody was talking about PFAS,” he said, and if anyone could figure out how to destroy the chemicals, it would be a breakthrough. PFAS is a family of chemicals that for decades have been added to firefighting foams, food packaging, carpets and fabrics, water-repellent clothing and non-stick pans. “Unlike many entrepreneurs I've interacted with, he is also deeply interested in understanding the limitations and technical challenges associated with the technology. Aquagga's devices annihilates PFAS under super hot, high pressure conditions made caustic and corrosive through the addition of lye. The company has done nine field demonstrations of its technology, including a project at an airport in Alaska, a DoD-funded project in North Carolina involving firefighting foams, and a wastewater demo with the City of Tacoma. It's now close to signing its first long-term commercial deployment, Pinkard said, “which will be a huge milestone for us.” “It's really cool to see how much PFAS we've destroyed … even in our short journey,” Pinkard said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And it's easy to understand their appeal: Ask a question, get a polished synthesis and move on – it feels like effortless learning. However, a new paper I co-authored offers experimental evidence that this ease may come at a cost: When people rely on large language models to summarize information on a topic for them, they tend to develop shallower knowledge about it compared to learning through a standard Google search. Co-author Jin Ho Yun and I, both professors of marketing, reported this finding in a paper based on seven studies with more than 10,000 participants. Most of the studies used the same basic paradigm: Participants were asked to learn about a topic – such as how to grow a vegetable garden – and were randomly assigned to do so by using either an LLM like ChatGPT or the “old-fashioned way,” by navigating links using a standard Google search. The data revealed a consistent pattern: People who learned about a topic through an LLM versus web search felt that they learned less, invested less effort in subsequently writing their advice, and ultimately wrote advice that was shorter, less factual and more generic. In turn, when this advice was presented to an independent sample of readers, who were unaware of which tool had been used to learn about the topic, they found the advice to be less informative, less helpful, and they were less likely to adopt it. We found these differences to be robust across a variety of contexts. For example, one possible reason LLM users wrote briefer and more generic advice is simply that the LLM results exposed users to less eclectic information than the Google results. To control for this possibility, we conducted an experiment where participants were exposed to an identical set of facts in the results of their Google and ChatGPT searches. The findings confirmed that, even when holding the facts and platform constant, learning from synthesized LLM responses led to shallower knowledge compared to gathering, interpreting and synthesizing information for oneself via standard web links. Why did the use of LLMs appear to diminish learning? One of the most fundamental principles of skill development is that people learn best when they are actively engaged with the material they are trying to learn. While more challenging, this friction leads to the development of a deeper, more original mental representation of the topic at hand. But with LLMs, this entire process is done on the user's behalf, transforming learning from a more active to passive process. Rather, our message is that people simply need to become smarter or more strategic users of LLMs – which starts by understanding the domains wherein LLMs are beneficial versus harmful to their goals. But if your aim is to develop deep and generalizable knowledge in an area, relying on LLM syntheses alone will be less helpful. As part of my research on the psychology of new technology and new media, I am also interested in whether it's possible to make LLM learning a more active process. In another experiment we tested this by having participants engage with a specialized GPT model that offered real-time web links alongside its synthesized responses. There, however, we found that once participants received an LLM summary, they weren't motivated to dig deeper into the original sources. Building on this, in my future research I plan to study generative AI tools that impose healthy frictions for learning tasks – specifically, examining which types of guardrails or speed bumps most successfully motivate users to actively learn more beyond easy, synthesized answers. Such tools would seem particularly critical in secondary education, where a major challenge for educators is how best to equip students to develop foundational reading, writing and math skills while also preparing for a real world where LLMs are likely to be an integral part of their daily lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has resigned from OpenAI's board days after Congress released an extensive cache of emails with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which included details of intimate affairs. The university newspaper also reported that Summers will step back from public commitments. Epstein, who referred to himself early on in the exchanges as Summers' “wing man,” told him in a June 2019 text: “She is doomed to be with you.” Later in the messages, Summers wrote that his “best shot” at getting his mentee to ostensibly sleep with him was that the woman found him “invaluable and interesting” and that “she can't have it without romance/sex.” Throughout June, Epstein urged him to play the “long game” and keep the woman in a “forced holding pattern.” Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Profit has tanked for the auto brand with a track record of making billions. The reasons for Porsche's misfortune are no secret. There was Porsche scrapping projects to build its own EV batteries in-house and instead developing new combustion and hybrid models. However, whether or not the EU decides to rewrite its EV transition timetable, the future for autos, sooner or later, will not be combustion but electric. So this means that European car companies playing the long game must still show their prowess in electrification. The Cayenne is Porsche's first fully electric SUV. This new electric SUV is the most powerful production Porsche of all time, and the specs are fittingly mighty. A new drive system develops up to 850 kW (1,156 PS) and up to 1,500 Nm of torque when the cars' Launch Control is activated. The “entry-level” Cayenne model has 300 kW (408 PS) in normal operation and 325 kW (442 PS) and 835 Nm of torque with Launch Control. Energy recovery for the Cayenne Electric is also impressive, with recuperative power matching Gen 3 Formula E levels of up to 600 kW. Both models can be specced with rear-axle steering too. Being electric, the battery is key, and these Cayenne models sport a newly developed 113 kWh battery, which gets double-sided cooling for better thermal management. A WLTP range of up to 398 miles for the Cayenne Electric, and up to 387 miles for the Turbo. This means charges that bring the battery from 10 to 80 percent in less than 16 minutes, theoretically, and the addition of about 200 miles of range within 10 minutes. However, what caught my attention at a preview recently in Germany was that this is the first Porsche to have inductive charging, and at up to 11 kW, too—so the same as a home EV wall charger. The Cayenne Turbo Electric goes from 0 to 62 mph in 2.5 seconds, and on to a top speed of 162 mph. As you can see here, the design language is distinctly Porsche, an evolution of the Cayenne rather than a radical rethink. But the tweaks have been worthwhile, delivering a drag coefficient of just 0.25, benefiting range and energy use. Sticking with this efficient theme, active aerodynamic elements include movable cooling air flaps in the nose, an adaptive roof spoiler, and active aeroblades at the rear of the Turbo. These extend the lateral tear-off edges, improving air flow, which, according to Porsche, leads to an increase in range at higher speeds. Porsche's new Flow Display looks like a folding tablet but works surprisingly well. More good news: If you've had enough of touchscreen controls, Porsche has wisely read the room and included physical controls for vital things like climate control and volume. But a digital key is available so you can stop carting around that darn fob and just use your smartphone to unlock the car. However, I can tell you what it's like to be driven in one: fast, and seemingly easy to feel where you are on the road and what the car is doing. More on that when Porsche lets me get behind the wheel, though. For now I can confirm it certainly has a “Porsche feel,” which is what the engineering team was shooting for. There is one last mystery yet to be revealed for the Cayenne Electric, however. Despite seeming very proud of it at my technical briefing, no one at Porsche will tell me which AI model its new “Voice Pilot” uses. In fact, at the time of that briefing I was told no one there in Leipzig knew which LLM powered Voice Pilot, and thus enabled it to “understand complex, interrelated queries, recognize the context” and help it “respond like a real conversation partner.” In the two months since that briefing, I've asked three times for an answer. Could it be the company hasn't yet signed up to a specific model? But it's very odd to shout about putting an AI helper into a car then avoid all questions about which model is powering it. Porsche will have to come clean at some point, of course. It's arriving in hybrid and full-on combustion-engined models too. Which means that this car, at its heart, is compromised in all the ways that cars are when their design is forced to accommodate ICE powertrains as well as electric. You have to wonder what it would have been capable of if Porsche had held its nerve and gone all-in on EV.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the Trump Administration mulls slapping tariffs on foreign robotics, it's being warned that such a move could disrupt efforts to revive manufacturing in the United States. “A tariff on foreign robotics would raise the cost of capital investment for U.S. manufacturers who rely on this machinery to modernize and become more competitive,” explained Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research, in Las Vegas. “This increased expense on essential automation tools would squeeze profit margins, especially for small-to-mid-sized firms, making their final products more expensive compared to international rivals who can acquire the same technology tariff-free,” he told TechNewsWorld. “They need equipment that is not only capable but also supported by readily available service, training, and spare parts.” “Imposing tariffs or restrictions on our equipment would place these critical capabilities out of reach for many small businesses, forcing them either to delay modernization or to seek lower-quality alternatives that could compromise their competitiveness,” they maintained. American companies need robots to lower labor costs, increase productivity, and assure factory uptime, added Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst of the Enderle Group, an advisory services firm, in Bend, Ore. “In addition, existing robots become obsolete or wear out, and it is easier to replace robots with those from the same manufacturer than to switch providers,” he told TechNewsWorld. Tariffs will also put U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage when purchasing equipment in global markets. “Tariffs are most typically passed on to the buyer,” explained Enderle. “This is because manufacturers in key producing nations like Japan and Germany have strong, growing markets elsewhere and have diversified their global sales, making them less reliant on U.S. market access,” he explained. Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade, and Michael Petricone, senior vice president of government affairs, at the Arlington, Va.-based Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which represents more than 1,200 member companies in the U.S. technology industry, concurred that tariffs on robotics and industrial machinery — products that constitute critical inputs in manufacturing — would significantly increase costs for equipment and machinery on factory floors, discourage investment into new U.S. production capacity and threaten jobs. “This is underscored by the fact that domestic production of critical inputs alone is insufficient to sustain the needs of U.S. manufacturers,” they wrote in comments to Commerce. Thus, 16% of manufacturing inputs must be imported in order for U.S. manufacturers to operate.” “In fact, in key sectors such as automotive manufacturing, domestic suppliers of critical machinery for manufacturing and assembly already suffer from overcapacity, illustrating the reality that current U.S. supply cannot meet growing demand for advanced machinery,” they continued. The CTA urged Commerce to exclude industrial robots, industrial machinery, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), and other complete computer-controlled mechanical systems, including LiDAR modules, from any trade action. These technologies are critical to U.S. industrial capacity, enable reshoring, and support globally competitive production. Because production lines have been optimized around these systems, replacing them would require years of reengineering, in turn delaying domestic investment and manufacturing expansion, the CTA added. “This trend is partly a legacy issue, as countries like Japan and Germany historically excelled at producing the specialized, high-precision machine tools required to make these robots.” Steidler recommended that the U.S. court Japan and its robot companies to invest directly in the U.S. and to make joint investments with U.S. companies for robot development here. He also recommended adopting lower tax rates and faster depreciation of investments, as well as fostering a climate in which U.S. companies can acquire foreign robotics companies and bring their operations to the U.S., or find ways to work with them jointly. “Those actions will have much more immediate and positive benefits than tariffs, which are likely to raise prices and create a lot of disruption here at home,” he added. His areas of focus include cybersecurity, IT issues, privacy, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence, big data and consumer electronics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Tuesday, Zoox debuted a program called “Zoox Explorers” that invites users in San Francisco to download the Zoox app, and get on the waitlist to potentially take a free ride in one of these—I guess you could call it a “buggy,” since Zoox doesn't want us to call it a car. Using the app could already get you a free ride starting in September, but only if you were going up or down the Las Vegas Strip. The Zoox vehicle has a plausible reason for looking so cutesy. It's a purpose-built robotaxi with no steering wheel or pedals. It resembles nothing so much as certain ferris wheel gondolas—an interior that only has room for two bench seats at opposite ends, where passengers face one another instead of all looking forward. You can also “initiate an emergency stop if you must exit the robotaxi.” I can only assume this last feature is known as the “puke button” around the Zoox office.
