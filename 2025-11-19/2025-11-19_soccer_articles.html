                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KANSAS CITY (Nov. 19, 2025) — Kansas City Current midfielder Ally Sentnor has been called up for the United States Under-23 Women's National Team for the upcoming FIFA international window. U.S. Soccer announced its 20-player roster for a pair of overseas friendlies on Wednesday. Players born in 2002 or later are age-eligible for this year's U-23 Women's National Team. The U-23 matches are another step in U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) head coach Emma Hayes' emphasis on this age group and its importance along the player pathway. The U.S. will first travel to Senec, Slovakia, for a unique opportunity for the U-23 squad to play against a senior national team. The Stars and Stripes will face the Slovakia Women's National Team at its national training center on Friday, Nov. 28. The U-23s will then travel to Accrington, England, where they will square off with the England U-23 Women's National Team on Monday, Dec. 1, at Wham Stadium. No stranger to the USWNT system, Sentnor earned her first senior team cap in front of over 78,000 fans at Wembley Stadium against England on Nov. 30, 2024. Her first USWNT goal came in the opening match of the 2025 SheBelieves Cup against Colombia on Feb. 20 in what was her first start and third cap, becoming the first U.S. player to score her first USWNT goal in the SheBelieves Cup Tournament. Sentnor's first senior team assist was on KC Current forward Michelle Cooper's goal in the second match of the SheBelieves Cup vs. Australia three days later. She then capped off the event by scoring in the final SheBelieves Cup game against Japan on Feb. 26, and her first brace in a U.S. uniform was in a friendly with Jamaica on June 3. A native of Hanson, Mass., Sentnor was named the 2024 U.S. Soccer Young Female Player of the Year a month prior to her SheBelieves Cup breakthrough. Sign up for latest news, offers & more!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (Nov. 19, 2025) – Twenty players have been called up to the U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team by new head coach Heather Dyche for a training camp and matches in Europe running from Nov. 22 to Dec. 1 that will feature a game against the full Women's National Team of Slovakia and the England U-23 WNT. These U-23 matches are another step in U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes' emphasis on this age group and its importance along the player pathway to the full National Team. Midfielders (7): Kimmi Ascanio (San Diego Wave; Doral, Fla.), Abi Brighton (Juventus FC, ITA; Beaufort, S.C.), Riley Jackson (North Carolina Courage; Roswell, Ga.), Simone Jackson (Orlando Pride; Redondo Beach, Calif.), Ally Lemos (Orlando Pride; Glendora, Calif.), Sarah Schupansky (Gotham FC; Pittsburgh, Pa.), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; Hanson, Mass.) “As Emma has been saying since she took over the National Team, getting meaningful international competition for this age group is invaluable,” Said Dyche. These are ideal situations for players to continue their growth.” Hayes also held a “Futures Camp” last January alongside the USWNT in Florida. These will be Dyche's first international matches as head coach. The USA will then travel to England where it will face the England U-23 WNT on Dec. 1 at Wham Stadium, a small venue in Accrington. Players born in 2002 or later are age-eligible for this year's U-23 WNT, and the roster features players from six birth years ranging from 2002 to 2006, along with one born in 2008. Seventeen-year-old San Diego Wave midfielder Kimmi Ascanio, who was born in 2008 and was age-eligible for this year's FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup but did not play in that tournament, gets her first call-up to the U.S. U-23s.</p>

The USA have leapfrogged Mexico to restore their status as CONCACAF's top side, at least on the FIFA Men's World Rankings, which have also confirmed advantageous seeding for the Democratic Republic of Congo and Iraq, who will get a bye to the finals of the World Cup's inter-confederation playoffs. Rising two places saw the USMNT bypass the opponent they beat in such emphatic fashion in Tampa, Fla. as well as Mexico, whose preparations for the World Cup were hindered by a defeat to and draw with the same opponents their CONCACAF rivals faced. Meanwhile, a win for Brazil over Senegal in London and subsequent draw with Tunisia were enough to take Carlo Ancelotti's side over the Netherlands and Portugal and into fifth place. They do, however, trail by some distance the quartet who arguably rank as favorites for the World Cup: leaders Spain, Argentina, France and England. All seven aforementioned teams are set to be top seeds for the World Cup group phase when the draw is made in Washington D.C. on Dec. 5. That had previously been occupied by Italy, whose hopes of benefitting from their lofty standings faded with a crushing home defeat to Norway in the final round of qualifiers. They must now book their World Cup spot through the European playoff round. It remains to be confirmed by FIFA but any team that does qualify through that path is expected to be placed in Pot Four. Rounding out the top seeds are hosts USA, Mexico and Canada. The unseeded teams, who must win a semifinal and final to advance, are Jamaica (70th), Bolivia (76th), Suriname (123rd) and New Caledonia (149th). The draws for both the inter-continental and European playoffs will be made in Zurich on Thursday, with games in the former competition to be held in Guadalajara and Monterrey. No team dropped more points than Denmark, pipped to a World Cup berth by Scotland in stunning fashion on Wednesday, while Republic of Ireland accrued the most thanks to their equally dramatic wins over Portugal and Hungary. Meanwhile Haiti climbed four places after beating Nicaragua and Costa Rica to qualify. There is no gambling offered on this site.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex Muzio, the chairman of the Union of European Clubs (UEC), a body representing  mid-sized and smaller clubs on the continent, has called out FIFA for failing to distribute the $250 million solidarity payment promised from last summer's inaugural 32-team Club World Cup. In his speech at the UEC's Forum in Brussels, Belgium, Muzio highlighted FIFA's inaction: “The Club World Cup participants received their prize money - otherwise they would have probably not turned up as you may have noted from the conversations around Real Madrid at the time. It's on to the next topic to distract, I guess - maybe a peace prize, maybe at the next FIFA press conference, which may come at the next Club World Cup?” The solidarity program was to assuage fears that the tournament's excessive prize money of $1 billion would further distort competitive balance. That prize money was not shared equally but distributed according to a participation-success distribution key, ensuring that Europe's biggest clubs benefited the most. Real Madrid, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain all made the semi-finals. Former Everton player and UEC CEO, Gareth Farrelly, says: “At the time, people were questioning whether that was a realistic figure or whether that would be the final amount. But just for those non-participating clubs globally, I don't believe anyone's gotten a check yet. In a recent letter to The Guardian, FIFA's media director Bryan Swanson, defending FIFA's decision to establish a peace prize, wrote that “The revenue it generates is reinvested in football, and all 211 member associations benefit from the commercial success of the Fifa World Cup.” Farrelly said: “The point is that there are never any questions asked.” FIFA boss Gianni Infantino has always claimed that his organization has been reformed, but Muzio believes that a decade after FIFAgate, the global governing body is lacking, more than ever, the slightest form of good governance. He explained: “There are no more votes, just votes by acclamation, there is no more engagement. FIFA is really going beyond the pale in terms of interaction, transparency, and governance. It's pretty clear that FIFA governance has somehow worsened in the last ten years, which is coming from the lowest possible bar.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JERSEY CITY, N.J. (Nov. 19, 2025) - Five Gotham FC players have been named to the 26-player U.S. Women's National Team roster for its upcoming international friendlies against Italy. The 25-year-old Howell returns to the U.S. squad for the first time since April 9, 2022, when she scored her first and only international goal in a win over Uzbekistan. She was on the roster for the U.S. trip to Europe in October 2022 but did not see action. Lavelle and Sonnett are two of three players in their 30s called into the team this international window, joining Lindsey Heaps. Lavelle (115 caps) and Sonnett (112) hold the second and third-most caps on the roster behind Heaps (167). She recorded two goals during the window. Shaw earns her second consecutive call-up after spending earlier FIFA windows this year with the U.S. U-23s. She has 29 caps and eight goals for the United States and became the first USWNT player to score in her first five starts. Reale, a nominee for 2025 NWSL Rookie of the Year, returns to the senior U.S. roster, where she has made four appearances this year. She has played in every NWSL match for Gotham FC this season, including the semifinal win over Orlando in which she helped secure a clean sheet to send Gotham to the 2025 NWSL Championship. The second match will take place Monday, Dec. 1, at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale. Both matches will air on TNT and HBO Max in English and on Peacock in Spanish. Before joining the U.S., all five players will feature in the 2025 NWSL Championship, presented by Google Pixel, when Gotham faces the Washington Spirit on Saturday at PayPal Park.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup is into its final stages. Argentina will defend their title after Lionel Messi completed his long and occasionally tortuous path to glory at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. La Albiceleste have since retained their Copa America title and finished top of the notoriously gruelling CONMEBOL qualifying section. Here's everything you need to know about World Cup qualification, who has made it to the finals and how many teams from each continent will take part. MORE: Who can qualify for the World Cup this week Each confederation has more slots available under the expanded format. The AFC has double the qualification spots it had at Qatar 2022, up from four guaranteed places to eight, while there will be nine African nations instead of five. CONCACAF will have at least double its 2022 representatives, up from three to six, although half of those slots are accounted for by the United States, Mexico and Canada qualifying automatically as hosts. As was the case at the previous World Cup, two slots will be decided via an inter-continental playoff. MORE: Host countries, cities for FIFA 2026 World Cup By finishing top two in their group in the third round of AFC qualification, they secured an automatic bid to the competition. Following them shortly after was Cape Verde, as the tiny island nation of just 600,000 people earned their first-ever World Cup spot by winning their group ahead of Cameroon. Beating that in November was Curacao, who became the smallest-ever nation to qualify for a World Cup with their population of 150,000. The AFC began its crucial third round of qualification in September 2024. Eighteen teams were split across three six-team groups to contest 10 games in a round-robin format. The teams placed third and fourth in each group advanced to a fourth round split between two groups of three. Nine groups of six teams played each other home and away in Africa. DR Congo prevailed to with the playoff on penalties against Nigeria, moving them into March's inter-confederation round. MORE: Can Nigeria still qualify for World Cup 2026? CONCACAF began the second round of its qualification phase in June 2024, with 30 teams drawn into six groups of five. Each team played every opponent in their group once, with two away games and two home games once the phase concluded in June 2025. South America retained its celebrated marathon World Cup qualification round, with all 10 of the confederation's countries playing one another home and away in a gruelling league format. Argentina clinched their place at the finals thanks to a memorable 4-1 demolition of arch rivals Brazil. The second round, running across October and November 2024, saw two groups of four playing for the four spots in round three. New Caledonia will enter the inter-confederation playoffs, so they have another chance to get there, albeit a slim one. Twelve of UEFA's 16 spots will be taken by the group winners from the initial format of four or five-team groups. Those 16 teams will be drawn into four paths with two single-game rounds. The four-game playoff will be used as a World Cup test event and played in one or more of the host countries. MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, will host the final on July 19.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thomas Tuchel has to take Cole Palmer to the World Cup, especially after what has just come out about Chelsea's Club World Cup final against PSG. The international break is now behind us, but conversations about England will continue to bubble from now until June. Palmer's latest fitness update suggests he won't be back as soon as this weekend, which is a shame for many reasons. One is that he needs to start playing his way into Tuchel's plans. Chelsea insiders are confident Palmer will be selected, but he'll have a loftier ambition in mind — nailing down a starting berth. He should start for England, and tales from before last summer's Club World Cup final explain why. Back in July, Chelsea were faced with the unenviable task of facing a PSG side fresh off a Champions League title. The French giants were in a league of their own last season, and weren't a side anyone wanted to face. Piece on:🔵 His Chelsea comeback🔵 Bulking up🔵 Staying involved🔵 Big-game mentality🔵 Making up for lost time https://t.co/Hj6dmOICeQ He does not worry what might be said or written about him and is virtually oblivious to any outside noise.” Tuchel has been warned not to make the same Palmer mistake that saw him used only as an impact sub in Germany last year, and this is just another reason. The hopes and dreams of a nation are at stake when international tournaments come around, which can be too much for certain players to handle. That's when he can make all the difference.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Global football has witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime moment: Curaçao is now the smallest nation in history to qualify for a World Cup. To understand the magnitude of this feat, it's enough to note how many far larger nations—with deeper resources, bigger talent pools, and stronger infrastructures—collapsed along the way. Curaçao, a territory smaller than many cities in the Americas, executed a flawless qualifying campaign built on discipline, clarity, and tactical consistency. Much of the success stems from a foundational project that has grown steadily, supported by a generation of players with Dutch roots competing in European leagues. Their experience under pressure has been crucial in the moments that mattered most. Even so, his work had already shaped a disciplined, confident team on the brink of making history. Advocaat adds this achievement to an extraordinary résumé that includes managing the Netherlands, South Korea, Belgium, and Russia, as well as winning league titles in multiple countries. His imprint on Curaçao is now permanently etched in Caribbean football history. With identity, structure, and courage, even the smallest nation can break barriers and reach the global stage. Now, the island prepares for its first World Cup with a sense of pride it has never experienced before.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlo Ancelotti has explained why he ordered Estevao Willian to hand Brazil's second penalty to Lucas Paqueta in the draw against Tunisia, with the West Ham star's subsequent miss proving costly for the Selecao. The five-time world champions squandered a host of chances throughout the 90 minutes as they limped to a 1-1 draw against the African nation in their final international match of 2025. Brazil ended 2025 on a disappointing note as they were held to a 1-1 draw by a spirited Tunisia side, as Ancelotti oversaw his second draw as Selecao boss on Tuesday. Casemiro and Vincius Junior then both came close to equalising before Estevao restored parity from a spot-kick in the 44th minute. Brazil were handed a second penalty in the 78th minute after Ferjani Sassi fouled Vitor Roque. Estevao, who had earlier converted a penalty, was instructed not to hand the kick over to West Ham star Lucas Paqueta, who then blazed over the crossbar. Speaking to reporters after the game, Ancelotti explained why he ordered Estevao to stand down despite scoring the first-half penalty, telling reporters: "Paqueta was the penalty taker. For the second penalty, I changed because I wanted to take some of the pressure off Estevao, so I put Paquetá in, who usually takes them very well." A few are missing, the list is quite complete. There are two friendlies left, but there are six months left, where anything can happen, the schedule is very demanding, the risk of injury is very high. The players are serious, professional, and patriotic. They have a lot of affection for the shirt, and these are very important aspects."

Brazil will have two more friendlies in the March international break before they head to North America for the 2026 World Cup. Ancelotti went on to reveal his message to the squad ahead of a lengthy international hiatus, saying: "I spoke with them (the players), wished them the best for the games they are going to play, we are observing them, staying in contact with them, talking, keeping the communication open until March and the World Cup. Estevao, who has enjoyed a fine start to his career at Chelsea, scored in both the friendly matches that the Selecao played in November and is likely to be a key member of Ancelotti's World Cup squad next summer. Tunisia boss Samsi Trabelsi hailed the youngster as a 'football genius' before Tuesday's game and backed the 18-year-old to become one of the best players of his generation. If he manages to have good performances or win titles, whether with his club or national team, he will be among the players who, in the coming years, could even compete for the Ballon d'Or.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are no new alerts at this time From tiny Curaçao to the Tartan Army, jubilant fans celebrated Tuesday as a succession of minnows ended long waits to secure their spot alongside global icons and popular powerhouses competing for international sport's most coveted prize. Curaçao and Scotland — whose dramatic victory sent Edinburgh into rapture, kilts and all — are now among those to have qualified for next year's men's FIFA World Cup in North America. While many will be eager to see the likes of holders Argentina and favorites Spain and England take center stage, some unlikely nations will now be joining them. An island nation in the Caribbean, Curaçao made history by becoming the smallest country by population to ever qualify for the FIFA World Cup, a record that was previously set by Iceland in 2018. “I think we deserve this,” a fan told Reuters. “It is time for us to celebrate right now.” Though it regularly boasts players at top European teams and draws huge crowds, Scotland's soccer history is widely seen as one of glorious failure. Not so in Edinburgh on Tuesday, where a 4-2 upset victory over Denmark that included two epic stoppage time goals meant Scotland could avoid the perils of European playoffs and secure their first World Cup appearance in 28 years. Panama confirmed its second trip to a World Cup on the final matchday of qualifiers, defeating El Salvador 3-0. The Central American nation had to come through a difficult qualifying campaign, but the team eventually found its stride when it mattered most. Two of the world's populous nations, India and China, will both continue their absence from the World Cup following disappointing performances in qualifying. Others face an anxious wait, with a final playoff tournament to be held in Mexico next year. Iraq, where soccer is hugely popular but which hasn't made the World Cup since it was last in Mexico in 1986, had to rely on a 107th minute penalty to book its spot at the intercontinental playoffs.

It's a complicated system which keeps outcomes in limbo longer than ever, but here's a handy guide about what to expect from Thursday's draw... The draw will take place on Thursday at 12pm UK time from FIFA's home in Zurich, Switzerland. Follow live coverage on Sky Sports digital platforms. The World Cup play-offs will take place in March 2026 and will consist of four 'paths', one for each vacant spot at the finals. Every path will include a team from each of four seeding pots, with Pots 1-3 decided by November's FIFA World Rankings, while Pot 4 consists of the four countries qualifying through their Nations League performance. Of those, 12 places are reserved for UEFA qualifying group winners, with the other four coming via the play-offs. There is still a chance every home nation, plus the Republic of Ireland, could be in Canada, the USA and Mexico next summer. Northern Ireland sealed a play-off spot owing to their Nations League performance, even though they did not finish in the top two of their qualifying group. More often than not, this means the four additional play-off spots are filled by four of the 14 Nations League group winners. That's exactly the case here, with Northern Ireland, Romania and Sweden confirmed ahead of Tuesday - and North Macedonia sealing the fourth spot after losing to Wales in Cardiff. Forty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below: Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Al Jazeera's breakdown of the qualified teams, playoffs and shock omissions from the FIFA World Cup in North America. Emotions ran high on a night of historic wins and last-gasp goals as the last eight of the 43 automatic qualification spots for the FIFA World Cup 2026 were sealed across Europe (UEFA), Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF). With less than seven months to go until the expanded 48-team tournament co-hosted by Canada, Mexico and the United States, European heavyweights Spain and the tiny Caribbean nation Curacao were among those to book a spot amid tears of joy and wild celebrations late on Tuesday. Curacao became the smallest country ever – with a population of just 156,000 – to qualify for the World Cup on November 18 as Haiti booked their return to the tournament for the first time in 52 years, along with Panama. It was also a week of heartbreak and shock for some of the biggest names in football, including former European champions Greece and African powerhouse Nigeria, as they were knocked out of contention for the most popular sports tournament in the world. Meanwhile, four-time world champions Italy find themselves in the European playoffs along with 15 other teams in a fight for four slots, and four-time Arab champions Iraq booked a place in the intercontinental playoffs. Asia: Australia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Uzbekistan Europe: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, England, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Switzerland Americas: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay, Curacao, Panama, Haiti The playoffs are divided into two parts: European and intercontinental. European playoff teams: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czechia, Denmark, Italy, Kosovo, Poland, Republic of Ireland, Slovakia, Turkiye, Ukraine, Wales, Romania, Sweden, Northern Ireland, North Macedonia Intercontinental playoff teams: Bolivia, DR Congo, Iraq, Jamaica, New Caledonia and Suriname The top two seeded teams – Iraq and DR Congo – have earned direct qualification for the two finals, while the other two finalists will be determined via two semifinals played between the four remaining teams. Nigeria were among the latest big names to be eliminated from the qualification process, following on from Chile, who were third-place finishers in 1962. While China are not considered among the football powerhouses in Asia, their focus on building the game at home and seeing themselves in another World Cup, following their 2002 appearance, was crushed on June 5. Some of the other shock omissions: Cameroon, Mali, Costa Rica, Greece and Serbia. US President Donald Trump confirmed, in August, that the draw for the World Cup will take place on December 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, and didn't rule out that he himself might oversee the event. The draw will begin at noon local time (17:00 GMT). Earlier this month, Ronaldo confirmed the tournament will be his swansong on football's biggest stage. “Definitely, yes, because I will be 41 years old [at the World Cup],” said the Portuguese superstar, who is also the top scorer in history with 143 international goals. Meanwhile, Messi has also expressed hope that he will lead Argentina's title defence in North America but acknowledged that his age and fitness will dictate his role. Speaking to NBC News in October, the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner said he will take time next year to assess his physical condition before deciding whether to play in the tournament. I'm going to assess that on a day-to-day basis when I start pre-season next year with Inter, and see if I can really be 100 percent, if I can be useful, and then make a decision. “I'm really eager because it's a World Cup. We're coming off winning the last one, and being able to defend it on the field again is spectacular, because it's always a dream to play with the national team.”</p>

Swedish international striker, Roony Bardghji, who left FC Copenhagen to devote his future to FC Barcelona, says he hopes to meet Denmark in the playoffs for the World Cup qualification.

Roony Bardghji left FC Copenhagen for FC Barcelona on 14 July 2025, signing a four-year contract until 2029. The transfer was motivated by his desire to seek new challenges in a different environment, with FC Copenhagen stating he had fulfilled his ambition to test himself elsewhere.

Now he could make an unexpected return to the Parken Stadium as Sweden potentially could face Denmark in the Danish national arena in Copenhagen in the semi-final of the World Cup qualification playoffs.

"I heard that we can get Denmark. That would be nice. They are all tough opponents, but Denmark would be nice. It is also close, so you don't have to travel that far", he tells the Swedish news agency TT.

"I think we have the best chance against Denmark."

The draw for the World Cup qualification playoffs will be made on Thursday. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Curacao have qualified for their first World Cup after drawing with Jamaica The record was held by Iceland, who reached the 2018 finals, but their country is far bigger than Curacao, which has a population of just over 150,000 (similar to Cambridge or Huddersfield) and a land area of 171 square miles, smaller than the Isle of Man. Former England boss McClaren resigned as Jamaica boss after his side, who needed a win in Kingston to qualify for their first World Cup since 1998, were held to a goalless draw, including having an injury-time penalty overruled by VAR. Curacao boss Dick Advocaat, who was not at the game for personal reasons, will become the oldest coach at a World Cup, aged 78, beating Otto Rehhagel's record when he was in charge of Greece aged 71 in 2010. "It's crazy and would be one of the biggest things that will happen to Curacao," said midfielder Juninho Bacuna, a former Huddersfield, Rangers and Birmingham player before the match. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, he added: "It's incredible and amazing. In 10 qualifying matches, they have won seven and finished their campaign unbeaten. The Caribbean Island of Haiti sealed their place at a first World Cup since 1974 after defeating Nicaragua 2-0. Since January 2024, Dutchman Advocaat, 78, has been in charge of his eighth national side after three spells with the Netherlands, as well as coaching the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Belgium, Russia, Serbia and Iraq. His list of clubs managed includes PSV Eindhoven, Rangers, Zenit St Petersburg, Sunderland and Feyenoord. "Everyone knows Dick Advocaat is a big name, he is a big coach and everyone respects him in his decisions and the way he works," added Bacuna. "His presence is really important for us as a team and also for the country, and his impact has been really big. Their squad includes Livingston defender Joshua Brenet, Rotherham midfielder Ar'jany Martha, Middlesbrough forward Sontje Hansen and Sheffield United midfielder Tahith Chong, who was born in Curacao and previously played in the Premier League with Manchester United. For Bacuna, playing for Curacao was also a chance to play international football with his older brother Leandro, the national side's captain, and that was a key part of his motivation after he had represented the Netherlands at under-21 level. "At that time I was only 21 and had a lot of years in front of me to see my chances for the Dutch national team. "But I made a choice early to play for Curacao. I saw a lot of players from my age already play for the Dutch national team but I didn't have a chance to be called up, so the choice was quick to make to play for Curacao."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team head into 2026 full of confidence after defeating Uruguay 5–1 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, F.L. Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay provided a benchmark of sorts on the night given their overall quality. A heavily rotated side looked organized and well-coached against the two-time World Cup winners. Their mid-block stifled Uruguay in possession as they found it difficult to play through the lines. Sebastian Berhalter, Alex Freeman and Diego Luna were all on the scoresheet in a first half blitz. The USMNT showcased their quality in transition, possession and on set pieces. A side missing Christian Pulisic, Chris Richards, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and others looked superior all night. A complete performance and the perfect sendoff given they won't play again until March. For all the trials and tribulations this team has dealt with in 2025, they certainly look transformed under Pochettino. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. While his starting place likely isn't in jeopardy, Pochettino will want Freese to be more calm and assured moving forward. Two goals on the night in an altered role has all but locked up his spot come 2026. McKenzie was accurate out of the back, but will be unhappy with how disorganized the defense was on Uruguay's lone goal. CB: Auston Trusty—7.6: Trusty was composed in place of Tim Ream. RM: Sergiño Dest—7.6: Another positive performance for the PSV defender. Dest certainly is a starter when fit and could be even more dangerous if Freeman plays behind him in a hybrid role. CM: Aidan Morris—7.3: Had his work cut out for him against a talented Uruguay midfield. Kept things ticking completing the most passes of any player. CM: Sebastian Berhalter—8.6: Did Berhalter just play his way into a 2026 World Cup roster spot? He might not be a starter, but his effort and set piece quality could make him a weapon next summer. RW: Timothy Tillman—6.8: Looked timid at times on the ball, but worked hard and influenced two goals on the night. One of his better performances in a USMNT shirt. Starting XI: Cristopher Fiermarin (GK); Nahitan Nández, Ronald Araújo, Mathías Olivera, Matías Viña; Manuel Ugarte, Rodrigo Bentancur, Giorgian de Arrascaeta; Rodrigo Zalazar, Federico Viñas, Maximiliano Araújo Subs used: Joaquín Piquerez, Rodrigo Aguirre, Brian Rodríguez, Emiliano Martínez, Facundo Torres Pochettino made nine changes to the side that defeated Paraguay on Saturday. A gamble given fans wanted to see him stick with a strong lineup to close out the year. Freeman, after being in the middle of a benches-clearing brawl, started at right center back with Dest in front of him. The Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder played it short to Dest before he laid it back off for Berhalter curling in a sensational effort. Shades of Toni Kroos's 2018 heroics against Sweden in the World Cup. Shortly thereafter, Berhalter turned provider with a pinpoint corner as Freeman headed home at the far post. Relentless effort from Tillman and Trusty pressing high forced a turnover in the final third as Freeman danced around the box and fired a shot low to beat Fiermarin. Luna added a fourth just on the verge of halftime. A slick passing sequence between Trusty, Tolkin and Tillman created another big chance as Luna made a late run into the box. Some calamity at the back gave Uruguay a lifeline as De Arrascaeta scored a highlight-reel worthy overhead kick in first-half stoppage time. Pochettino was even the more animated manager going into the tunnel unhappy with how his team switched off. Bielsa made multiple changes to start the second half looking for a spark. Pochettino followed with changes on the hour mark introducing Gio Reyna, Folarin Balogun and Tanner Tessmann. Things went from bad to worse for Uruguay in the 65th minute as Bentancur was shown a red card for a high challenge on Berhalter. Pochettino remained undefeated against CONMEBOL teams as USMNT boss improving his record to 3-1-0. Max Mallow is an associate editor for Sports Illustrated, primarily working on the SI FC brand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A stunning first half saw Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT continue its unbeaten run with victory over Uruguay in Tampa, Fl. First international goals from Sebastian Berhalter (17) and Alex Freeman (21, 32) were followed by Diego Luna (43) in an incredible opening 45 minutes against Marcelo Bielsa's visitors. Giorgian De Arrascaeta's bicycle kick on the stroke of half-time did at least get Uruguay on the board, but Tottenham midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur was sent off (64) for a challenge on Berhalter before Tanner Tessmann (68) completed the scoring at Raymond James Stadium. The U.S. signs off for 2025 with a five-game unbeaten run, all coming against teams that will feature at next summer's World Cup being co-hosted by Mexico, Canada and the United States. USMNT 5, Uruguay 1: Freeman, Berhalter make World Cup case in stunning rout The U.S. Soccer Federation and Portuguese Football Federation will soon confirm an exhibition match between their men's teams to take place at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta in March 2026, per our writer Adam Crafton. Portugal has confirmed their place at the World Cup after beating Armenia 9-1 on Sunday. The Portugal match is also significant because it will bring an end to an almost 12-year absence for Cristiano Ronaldo from playing soccer in the United States. He last played in the States on August 2, 2014, when he came on as a substitute for Real Madrid against Manchester United in front of a crowd of 109,318 at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor. USMNT pre-World Cup game vs. Portugal to be announced as Cristiano Ronaldo set for U.S. return It's glaring to see a Uruguay side give up in the first half. After Marcelo Bielsa told reporters on Saturday he expected a better performance versus the U.S. this was an utterly shocking result. I feel that what is most affected after this performance is my approach to the match, how I prepare the players.” The U.S. is now unbeaten in its last five games, with wins over the likes of Japan, Paraguay and Uruguay in that span. The Americans raced out to a 4-0 lead via goals from three players who weren't in the national team picture at this time last year: Sebastian Berhalter, Alex Freeman and Diego Luna. To show we're ready, especially against a good Uruguay team. Everyone did their role and a little bit more, and to get this win, in this fashion, in front of these fans, was pretty special.” We went into tonight wondering what nine changes would mean for this U.S. team. Well, they put in maybe the best shift of a U.S. team this year, dominating an Uruguay team that looked plain awful tonight. Considering how 2025 started with the failure at the March Nations League, this team certainly looks like it has an identity and is gaining confidence under Mauricio Pochettino. Now they get a four-month break to let it marinate ... Orlando City forward and two-goal hero Alex Freeman has spoken to TNT Sports: 💬 “It was something special, playing in my home state, I had to show up … especially with my family here and I hope we can all build on this. There were big names missing in this international window but you know what? They looked a much better team in these two games than any of the previous ones I'd seen. Hopefully those missing figures will have registered what has happened and what it should look like for when they get called back into the squad. One more change from Mauricio Pochettino, as Cristian Roldan comes on for Aidan Morris. The resulting corner is claimed by Fiermarin — which feels like a win for him. Into the final 10 minutes and USMNT has a free kick in a central position, crying out for someone to shoot here. Aguirre is booked for the challenge on Morris that conceded it. For the record, Max Arfsten amd Brenden Aaronson are now out there for the U.S., with Tillman and Tolkin making way. Here is that Tanner Tessmann goal to make it five. I'm sure we're all blasé about the scoreline now, right? Brin Rodrigues leaves the game with blood pouring from his nose and that challenge earns Balogun a yellow card. Reyna has also been booked for a late challenge. Bearing in mind Saturday's friendly against Paraguay ended with a mass brawl, who's to say what we'll get over the remaining 12 minutes here … And with Uruguay down to 10 men, the USMNT's fifth goal soon arrives! Tottenham midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur is sent off for a high challenge that goes over the ball and lands on the shin of Sebástian Berhalter. We hit the hour mark and Mauricio Pochettino makes his first changes. Into the game come Folarin Balogun, Gio Reyna and Tanner Tessmann. Making way are Deigo Luna, Haji Wright and Sergiño Dest — who looks fully back in favor. He's had two excellent games in this international window. We are just simmering along in this second half at the moment, but I wonder if there is going to be another spark soon. Another goal for the U.S. absolutely kills this as a contest, if it ever was one.</p>
