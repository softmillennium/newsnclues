                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Harvard University is reinvestigating connections between its former president Larry Summers and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after newly released emails. Harvard University students are reacting as former U.S. Treasury Secretary and current Harvard professor Larry Summers says he'll step back from public commitments after the release of emails showing he maintained a friendly relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. This combo shows Jeffrey Epstein, left, and U.S. economist Larry Summers. Harvard University has reopened an investigation into connections between former President Larry Summers and Jeffrey Epstein, a university spokesperson said Wednesday, and Summers' office said he would resign from the board of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. Regarded as a leading voice on the U.S. economy, the former treasury secretary was also affiliated with multiple think tanks, research centers and media organizations. Several of them confirmed that those affiliations have ended. An earlier review completed in 2020 found that Epstein visited Harvard's campus more than 40 times after his 2008 sex-crimes conviction and was given his own office and unfettered access to a research center he helped establish. Summers said late Monday that he would step back from public commitments. The OpenAI board said it appreciated Summers' contributions and perspective. Summers joined the OpenAI board in November 2023 as part of an effort to restore stability at the nonprofit and bring back its CEO, Sam Altman, after previous board members fired Altman days earlier. On Tuesday, Summers appeared before his class at Harvard, where he teaches “The Political Economy of Globalization” to undergraduates with Robert Lawrence, a professor with the Harvard Kennedy School. “Some of you will have seen my statement of regret expressing my shame with respect to what I did in communication with Mr. Epstein and that I've said that I'm going to step back from public activities for a while. But I think it's very important to fulfill my teaching obligations,” he said. Epstein, who authorities said died by suicide in 2019, was a convicted sex offender infamous for his connections to wealthy and powerful people, making him a fixture of outrage and conspiracy theories about wrongdoing among American elites. Summers served as treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. He was Harvard's president for five years from 2001 to 2006. When asked about the emails last week, Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life” and that his association with Epstein was a “major error in judgement.” Bloomberg TV said Summers' withdrawal from public commitments included his role as a paid contributor, and the New York Times said it will not renew his contract as a contributing opinion writer. This story has been corrected to show that Summers' statement about stepping back from public commitments was issued late Monday, not Tuesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Comey's attorneys argue he was targeted because he publicly criticized Trump and resisted political pressure during his tenure at the FBI. Prosecutors countered that Comey was charged “simply for lying to Congress,” not because the president harbors long-standing animus toward him. Justice Department attorney Tyler Lemons told U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff that the defense was making “inferential leaps” and had not shown evidence that Trump directed the case. “The president of the United States has caused the executive branch to prosecute a perceived enemy,” he said, pointing to Trump's September Truth Social post telling Attorney General Pam Bondi that “we can't delay any longer” over cases involving Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA). Dreeben said Trump had already forced out the previous U.S. attorney, Erik Siebert, after Siebert resisted bringing politically charged cases and appointed Halligan, who had no prosecutorial experience, in his place. Defense filings assert that “objective evidence establishes that President Trump directed the prosecution of Mr. Comey in retaliation for Mr. Comey's public criticisms and to punish Mr. Comey because of personal spite.” They argue that the case would “likely not have been brought” but for “the intervention of the President himself.” Comey's team has compiled more than 200 of Trump's comments about the former FBI director, including the message calling on Bondi to act, which was reportedly intended to be private. In written arguments, they said Trump's posts merely reflect his belief that Comey committed crimes and that “personal dislike does not equate to legal prejudice.” They emphasized that the charges, one count of false statements and one count of obstruction, involve Comey's 2020 Senate testimony about whether he authorized leaks to the press. “The Executive cannot be expected to ignore agency heads lying about official actions simply because they later become outspoken critics,” the DOJ wrote in court filings. Prosecutors also argued that Halligan's decisions reflected her own judgment and not Trump's, saying her presentation of the case to the grand jury “does not demonstrate animus.” “Was there a declination memo?” the judge asked. Lemons initially said he did not “know the world of what documents exist,” prompting Nachmanoff to ask whether he had even sought to find out. Lemons later admitted that he looked into the matter but was bound by instructions from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's office not to disclose the answer. Halligan's conduct is separately under scrutiny from Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick, who earlier this week wrote that Comey had made a “particularized and factually based showing” that irregularities may justify dismissing the indictment. Nachmanoff delayed Fitzpatrick's order requiring the DOJ to hand over grand jury audio, saying he would hear objections from the government by Wednesday afternoon and a response from the defense by Friday. The indictment against the New York attorney general, also brought by Halligan, is now intertwined with a separate challenge to Halligan's legal authority. Judge Cameron McGowan Currie is weighing whether Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney was lawful, a ruling she has said she will issue before Thanksgiving. James, who has pleaded not guilty to bank fraud and false statements charges concerning her residence in Norfolk, Virginia, is scheduled for her own selective and vindictive prosecution hearing the week after Thanksgiving. Comey, who pleaded not guilty in October, is scheduled for trial on Jan. 5, 2026. Nachmanoff said he would not issue any ruling on Wednesday, telling the courtroom that “the issues are too wavy and too complex.”</p>

Energy Secretary Chris Wright discusses President Donald Trump securing a trillion-dollar investment pledge from Saudi Arabia and reports of China expanding its nuclear test site on ‘America's Newsroom.' President Donald Trump vowed that the U.S. would work on securing peace in Sudan thanks to the urging of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump made the announcement while speaking to Saudi and U.S. officials at the Kennedy Center in Washington on Wednesday. The administration has been vocal about peace efforts in Sudan for months, but now Trump appears to be redoubling efforts. "Working with the crown prince was amazing because he said, 'Sir, you're talking about a lot of wars, but there's a place on Earth called Sudan, and it's horrible what's happening,'" Trump said, saying MBS explained the cultural history behind the conflict. "Really amazing to hear," Trump said, addressing the Saudi leader. "You know we've already started working on that, OK? We started about 30 minutes after you explained to us the great importance of that. Trump's efforts come after Pope Leo XIV also called attention to the persecution of Christians in Sudan and elsewhere on Tuesday. "In various parts of the world, Christians suffer discrimination and persecution. I think especially of Bangladesh, Nigeria, Mozambique, Sudan, and other countries from which we frequently hear of attacks on communities and places of worship," the Pope wrote in a statement. Fighters of the Sudan Liberation Movement, a Sudanese rebel group active in Sudan's Darfur state that supports army Chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, attend a graduation ceremony in the southeastern Gedaref state. "Let us pray that all violence may cease and that believers may work together for the common good." They have since gained momentum under Trump, with the U.S. forming a so-called international Quad in September with Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Earlier this month, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called for an immediate ceasefire in Sudan. Speaking on the sidelines of a conference in Qatar, Guterres said the war was "spiraling out of control." Members of the Sudanese army's Special Mission Forces battallion in the Northern State hold a parade in Karima city. "The fall of El-Fasher to the RSF is a defining moment in Sudan's brutal civil war", Mariam Wahba, research analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News Digital. The latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification found that famine is ongoing in the now-captured El-Fasher and in Kadugli, South Kordofan, with families trapped and surviving on leaves, animal feed and grass.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Bombshell about grand jury: Interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan took the stand briefly Wednesday, saying only two grand jurors reviewed the final indictment it handed up against former FBI Director James Comey. Comey's attorney then argued Halligan's testimony indicates, “there is no indictment” against his client. A federal judge in Alexandria, Virginia, heard former Comey's arguments for why his indictment should be dismissed. Comey's attorney, Michael Dreeben, argued the case was brought at the direction of President Donald Trump and based on his animosity toward Comey. • The case: Comey is accused of lying during a 2020 hearing about whether he ever authorized leaks to the press and has pleaded not guilty. The judge is weighing whether Trump's history of anti-Comey comments and a social media post asking Attorney General Pam Bondi for “justice” enough to show Comey was unfairly plucked for prosecution. Judge Michael Nachmanoff directed the Justice Department to respond in a filing by 5 p.m. Before ending the hearing around 11:30am ET, Judge Michael Nachmanoff said he would not make any ruling Wednesday on whether James Comey is being vindictively prosecuted after the revelation that a full grand jury never saw the final indictment handed up against Comey. Correction: This post has been corrected to update a quote from Judge Michael Nachmanoff. The full grand jury never reviewed the indictment it handed up against former FBI Director James Comey, interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan conceded Wednesday. In a shocking back and forth, prosecutors said that instead of presenting a new indictment to the grand jury after it declined to approve one of the counts, Halligan simply brought an altered version to the magistrate's courtroom for the grand jury's foreperson to sign. “The new indictment wasn't a new indictment,” prosecutor Tyler Lemons said, attempting to justify that it was only reviewed by the foreperson. Lemons carefully responded, “I wasn't there, but that is my understanding.” “There is no indictment,” he said, adding that the statute of limitations has now elapsed against Comey on charges of lying to Congress. Justice Department lawyer Tyler Lemons argued former FBI Director James Comey was making “inferential leaps” in arguing the case is selective and vindictive. “There's been no proof that US Attorney Halligan took” Trump's social media post “as a charge,” Lemons said, referring to Lindsey Halligan, who President Donald Trump to be interim US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. Lawyers for New York Attorney General Letitia James and federal prosecutors in Albany, New York, will square off next month. A federal judge set a hearing for December 4 for James to challenge the appointment of John Sarcone, the US attorney for the Northern District of New York, to try to get a subpoena he signed quashed. Sarcone is leading the criminal investigation into the attorney general's handling of two cases and whether anyone's constitutional rights were violated. He signed a subpoena in August seeking information related to James' case alleging President Donald Trump and the Trump Organization inflated the value of properties to get better interest rates on loans. The Justice Department said in court filings that a grand jury can issue subpoenas regardless of who is US attorney but they defended Sarcone's appointment as legally valid. Sarcone is the latest US attorney whose appointment has been challenged. Justice Department lawyer Tyler Lemons declined to say whether prosecutors have submitted a memo recommending that former FBI Director James Comey should not be prosecuted. Lemons told the judge that someone in Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's office told him he couldn't disclose “privileged” information without their permission. “At this point, my position would be, whether there was a declination memo, is privileged,” Lemons said, adding that “I don't know in the world of documents there is a declination memo.” Judge Michael Nachmanoff challenged the assertion, pushing Lemons to say that, “someone in the Deputy Attorney General's office” had instructed him not to say anything. “What did someone in the Deputy Attorney General's office instruct you not to say,” Nachmanoff asked. Lemons conceded that he has “reviewed” draft memorandums, but declined to give additional details. Prosecutor Tyler Lemons began his argument Wednesday by arguing that former FBI Director James Comey was charged simply for lying to Congress. Lemons also said that a grand jury properly handed up the indictment. “We'll have some questions about that,” Judge Michael Nachmanoff said. Trump, Dreeben said, directed Bondi to open a new investigation into high-profile Democrats linked to Jeffrey Epstein, despite a Justice Department memo from earlier this year saying there was no basis for additional prosecutions based on the evidence it had. Judge Michael Nachmanoff raised other comments Trump had made after his social media post directed at Attorney General Pam Bondi. In those comments, Trump told reporters that his post was not directing Bondi. “It doesn't walk back anything he said to the US Attorney General,” Dreeben replied. Dreeben compared the social media post to the famous line from King Henry II: “Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?” James Comey's attorney argued Wednesday that President Donald Trump's September social media post pushing the Justice Department to prosecute is a “crystal clear” example of why his client is being charged only because of the president's personal animosity. The post, Michael Dreeben, said, linked Comey to two other “enemies” of Trump, and portrayed his frustration that interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan's predecessor was resisting bringing charges. Dreeben was referring to Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James. “The President is underscoring what he wants here, [Erik] Siebert was not doing his job here.” The job of Siebert, who Trump replaced with Halligan, was to “prosecute,” Dreeben said. In his first question of the day, Judge Michael Nachmanoff asked James Comey's attorney Michael Dreeben if he was arguing the case was brought to punish the former FBI director for using his free speech rights or that Trump was targeting Comey because of his personal animosity toward against him. Former FBI Director James Comey is in court as a hearing on whether the indictment against him should be tossed kicked off. Dreeban argued Trump has gone after the former director to “punish Mr. Comey for speaking out against him.” Comey points to a Truth Social post by President Donald Trump from September as an example of why the case against him is unfairly brought. “Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, ‘same old story as last time, all talk, no action. They're all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,'” Trump wrote, referring to Comey, Sen. Adam Schiff of California, and New York Attorney General Letitia James. They also argue that Comey wouldn't be silenced by this prosecution and that it chose on its own accord to bring the case — just as it has prosecuted others for lying to Congress in the past. Trump's social media posts “reflect the President's view that the defendant has committed crimes that should be met with prosecution. “But they are not direct evidence of a vindictive motive.” Just look at all the social media posts, James Comey's legal team will be arguing to a federal judge on Wednesday. To make the argument, called a vindictive and selective prosecution motion, Comey's team has already submitted to the judge more than 60 pages of public statements of Comey and Trump sniping at one another over years. The majority of the social media posts are from Trump, and include his recent direction to Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute Comey and others in September. Motions like these are notoriously hard for defendants to win, though they are gaining some steam in court during this Trump administration, as top Justice officials make politically charged statements publicly about defendants under indictment. If Nachmanoff doesn't fully agree with Comey's team's argument on Wednesday, it's possible the judge could tell the Justice Department it needs to hand over more internal records and potentially even pursue sworn statements by top administration officials, like Attorney General Pam Bondi or even Trump himself. That would likely bring about new rounds of court fights over access and confidentiality. The arguments, however, also may highlight how entrenched Trump is in what some consider his retaliatory presidency. But other issues the defense is leaning into revolve around how the FBI and Justice Department prosecutors handled its investigation of Comey, including whether evidence used to bring charges this year was tainted and whether Interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan appropriately prosecuted the case. • The evidence was unfairly used – either it was too old, hadn't been authorized by a court to be accessed by investigators, or wasn't properly reviewed by the government to filter out Comey's communications with his attorney. • The question asked by Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2020 Senate hearing where Comey allegedly lied was far too ambiguous to base a case around. Separately, South Carolina-based federal Judge Cameron Currie is set to rule by next week on whether Halligan, serving as an interim US attorney, had the authority to prosecute Comey and another Trump political foe, New York Attorney General Letitia James, without being Senate confirmed. Will Judge Michael Nachmanoff bring up what interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan said to the grand jury – an approach so questionable it could prompt the case against James Comey to be dismissed? Earlier this week, a magistrate judge's opinion revealed multiple issues with Halligan's work so far. Nachmanoff is now set to review, as soon as this weekend, whether Comey's team will be entitled to the full grand jury record. • Pushing forward a case where the evidence may not have been handled appropriately nor was authorized to be used. It's unclear how much discussion of Halligan with arise at the hearing. Comey's defense team has focused its written arguments on the years of encouragement by Donald Trump for the Justice Department to charge Comey. Michael Nachmanoff, the federal judge overseeing the criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey, has throughout his career as an attorney and judge earned a reputation in Virginia's legal community as a thoughtful, fair arbiter. Legal sources who have won and lost cases before Nachmanoff have described the 57-year-old judge as someone who keeps his personal views well-guarded and as unlikely to further inflame the atmosphere around Comey's prosecution.</p>

(AP) — Federal agents have now arrested more than 250 people during a North Carolina immigration crackdown centered around Charlotte, the state's largest city, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday. Immigration officials have blanketed the country since January, pushing detention counts to all-time highs above 60,000. Big cities and small towns across the country are targeted daily amid higher-profile pushes in places such as Portland, Oregon, where more than 560 immigration arrests were made in October. The push to carry out arrests in North Carolina expanded to areas around the state capital of Raleigh on Tuesday, spreading fear in at least one immigrant-heavy suburb. Federal agents in North Carolina are expanding their immigration crackdown. Their targets include people living in the U.S. without legal permission and those who allegedly have criminal records. Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They've also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge. The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests. About 100 people gathered outside a Home Depot store in Charlotte on Wednesday, where federal agents have been spotted multiple times since the surge started. Protest organizers briefly went inside the store with orange and white signs that read, “ICE out of Home Depot, Protect our communities.” Customers at a laundromat left behind their clothes in washers and dryers and haven't returned after agents showed up at a shopping center on Sunday, said David Rebolloso, who owns the business. Agents didn't target his laundromat, but it still impacted his bottom line and shut down the neighboring shops, said Rebolloso, a Mexican-American born in Brownsville, Texas. “We're only open because I'm an American citizen, so it doesn't bother me,” he said. Around 250 federal border agents are set to descend on New Orleans in the coming weeks for a two-month immigration crackdown expected to begin in earnest on Dec. 1. “For the safety and security of law enforcement, we're not going to telegraph potential operations,” spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.</p>

Two teenagers were caught on camera allegedly partaking in the viral "Door Kick Challenge" in Elk Grove, California. Authorities are warning parents and teens that the prank could have serious consequences. A startling online trend is making a resurgence among teenagers who could face deadly consequences as they terrorize homeowners in a viral prank, police around the country warn. Home surveillance footage shows a group of masked California youngsters partaking in the "Door Kick Challenge," where pranksters run up to a stranger's home and kick the front door as hard as they can before rushing away, according to the Elk Grove Police Department. The community of Elk Grove – located roughly 15 miles from Sacramento – has seen at least eight reported incidents and five arrests over the past month, CBS News Sacramento reported. Last week, two 13-year-olds were arrested after allegedly causing more than $680 in damage to a homeowner's front door, according to authorities. Additionally, three juveniles were taken into custody earlier this month for their alleged involvement in the prank. Home surveillance footage captured two masked teens allegedly kicking the front door of a home in Elk Grove, California. Another incident left a homeowner with $900 worth of damage to their doorframe, the outlet reported. Any crime exceeding $950 in damages could reportedly result in felony charges, with parents on the hook for paying the cost of their child's actions. "Somebody could come out with a gun, and you could never know, these kids could be dead just for a stupid prank," Ronnie Monroe told CBS13. Authorities are warning homeowners about the resurgence of the viral "Door Kick Challenge," where pranksters run up to a random house and violently kick the front door, causing hundreds of dollars in damage. "You can't catch them if you can't see them," Monroe told the outlet. The Elk Grove Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. The trend has been popping up in various cities around the country as it regains traction among teens. On July 22, a Florida teenager was caught on camera kicking the front door of a Belleville home, FOX35 reported. One week earlier, homeowner Kevin Jasper reported being targeted by a lone teenager partaking in the prank, according to FOX35. "We didn't know what it was. Additionally, two teenagers in Volusia County were arrested and charged with felonies after they were caught on camera kicking a neighbor's door. Another incident earlier this year involved five juveniles allegedly kicking the front door of a Florida home before firing an Airsoft gun and fleeing the area, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. While teens may believe the prank is harmless, authorities are warning their actions come with grave risks. "Imagine being in your home at 2 in the morning, and you are getting these kicking sounds," Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood told FOX35. "And in Florida, under the ‘stand your ground' [law] you are coming out with your gun. Fox News Digital's Adam Sabes contributed to this report.

FIRST ON FOX: Hundreds of State Department employees will receive restitution after an internal review under Secretary Marco Rubio found they were denied promotions during the Biden administration for not meeting new diversity, equity and inclusion standards. In addition to removing the diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) precept from the State Department's promotion process, officials said roughly 295 employees who were marked down for not showing they would "seek diversity in staff" will now receive pay increases, administrative promotions and letters of commendation. "The Trump administration is providing restitution to State Department employees who were adversely impacted by the previous administration's ideological agenda," a State Department official said. The department conducted an internal review of 7,319 employees who competed for promotion in 2024. Those employees were judged on five precepts: communication, leadership, management, knowledge and DEIA. Under President Donald Trump, the DEIA precept was replaced with a new criterion: "fidelity," Fox News Digital previously reported. Hundreds of State Department employees will receive restitution after an internal review under Secretary Marco Rubio found they were denied promotions during the Biden administration for not meeting new DEI standards. Promotion board members were instructed to low-rank employees who exhibited a "lack of sensitivity to the importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA)," according to a State Department official. The DEIA promotion precept was damaging to those who displayed "little indication of seeking diversity in staff," the official claimed. "The Biden administration imposed ideological litmus tests on civil servants, penalizing competent and deserving government employees in the process," principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said. In addition to removing the diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) precept from the State Department's promotion process, officials said roughly 295 employees who were marked down for not showing they would "seek diversity in staff." "Under President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department rewards excellence, which is the right thing to do for our workforce, for our country, and for the American people." The Trump administration's restitution plan marks a broader rollback of DEI-based policies across federal agencies, part of Trump's pledge to restore merit-based advancement in government service. The State Department's previous hiring guide for 2022–2025 required foreign service employees to "demonstrate impact in diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility," according to the internal documents. On his first day in office in 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to pursue policies that advance equity. On his first day in office in 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to pursue policies that advance "equity." "Affirmatively advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our Government," he stated. "It is therefore the policy of my Administration that the Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks at the McDonald's Impact Summit, Monday, Nov. 17, 2025, in Washington. As President Donald Trump laid it out to reporters this summer, the plan was simple. Republicans, the president said, were “entitled” to five more conservative-leaning U.S. House seats in Texas and additional ones in other red states. Four months later, Trump's audacious ask looks anything but simple. After a federal court panel struck down Republicans' new map in Texas on Tuesday, the entire exercise holds the potential to net Democrats more winnable seats in the House instead. Trump's plan is to bolster his party's narrow House margin to protect Republicans from losing control of the chamber in next year's elections. Greg Abbott announces his re-election campaign for Texas governor in Houston, Sunday, Nov. 9, 2025. It also involves a tricky political calculus because the legislators who hold the power to draw maps often want to protect themselves, business interests or local communities more than ruthlessly help their party. And when one party moves aggressively to draw lines to help itself win elections — also known as gerrymandering — it runs the risk of pushing its rival party to do the same. That's what Trump ended up doing, spurring California voters to replace their map drawn by a nonpartisan commission with one drawn by Democrats to gain five seats. California voters approved that map earlier this month, and if a Republican lawsuit fails to block it, that map giving Democrats more winnable seats will remain in effect even if Texas' remains stalled. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, posted on X after the Texas ruling, mentioning his Republican counterpart in Texas along with the president. Rep. Kevin Kiley, a Republican whose northern California district would be redrawn under the state's new map, agreed. “It could very well come out as a net loss for Republicans, honestly when you look at the map, or at the very least, it could end up being a wash,” Kiley said. “But it's something that never should have happened. Gavin Newsom speaks during a rally with Harris County Democrats at the IBEW local 716 union hall in Houston, on Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025. There's no guarantee that Tuesday's ruling on the Texas map will stand. Many lower courts have blocked Trump's initiatives, only for the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court to put those rulings on hold. Texas Republicans immediately appealed Tuesday's decision to the high court, too. Even before Tuesday, Trump's push for mid-decade redistricting was not playing out as neatly as he had hoped, though he had scored some apparent wins. North Carolina Republicans potentially created another conservative-leaning seat in that battleground state, while Missouri Republicans redrew their congressional map at Trump's urging to eliminate one Democratic seat. Republicans in Kansas balked at trying to eliminate the state's lone swing seat, held by a Democratic congresswoman. After Trump attacked the main Indiana holdout, state Sen. Greg Goode, on social media, he was the victim of a swatting call over the weekend that led to sheriff's deputies coming to his house. That requires state lawmakers to adjust their legislative lines to make sure every district has roughly the same population. Inevitably, redistricting leads to litigation, which can drag on for years and spur mid-decade, court-mandated revisions. But some litigation hasn't gone the GOP's way. A judge in Utah earlier this month required the state to make one of its four congressional seats Democratic-leaning. Trump broke with modern political practice by urging a wholesale, mid-decade redraw in red states. Democrats were in a bad position to respond to Trump's gambit because more states they control have lines drawn by independent commissions rather than by partisan lawmakers, the legacy of government reform efforts. But with Newsom's push to let Democrats draw California's lines successful, the party is looking to replicate it elsewhere. Next up may be Virginia, where Democrats recaptured the governor's office this month and expanded their margins in the Legislature. Republicans currently hold 9 of the 19 House seats in those two states. Overall, Republicans have more to lose if redistricting becomes a purely partisan activity nationally and voters in blue states ditch their nonpartisan commissions to let their preferred party maximize its margins. In the last complete redistricting cycle in 2021, commissions drew 95 House seats that Democrats would have otherwise drawn, and only 13 that Republicans would have drawn. The State Capitol is seen in Austin, Texas, on June 1, 2021. On Tuesday, Republicans were reappraising Trump's championing of redistricting hardball. Incumbents usually don't like the idea of radically redrawing districts. It can lead to what political experts call a “dummymander” — spreading the opposing party's voters so broadly that they end up endangering your own incumbents in a year, like 2026, that is expected to be bad for the party in power. Incumbents also don't like losing voters who have supported them or getting wholly new communities drawn into their districts, said Jonathan Cervas, who teaches redistricting at Carnegie Mellon University and has drawn new maps for courts. Associated Press writers Joey Cappelletti and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Harvard University students are reacting as former U.S. Treasury Secretary and current Harvard professor Larry Summers says he'll step back from public commitments after the release of emails showing he maintained a friendly relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. This combo shows Jeffrey Epstein, left, and U.S. economist Larry Summers. Harvard University has reopened an investigation into connections between former President Larry Summers and Jeffrey Epstein, a university spokesperson said Wednesday, and Summers' office said he would resign from the board of OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. Regarded as a leading voice on the U.S. economy, Summers was also affiliated with multiple think tanks, research centers and media organizations. Several of them confirmed that those affiliations have ended. Harvard did not mention Summers by name, but the decision to restart the probe follows the release of emails showing that Summers, a former treasury secretary, maintained a friendly relationship with Epstein long after the financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008. An earlier review completed in 2020 found that Epstein visited Harvard's campus more than 40 times after his 2008 sex-crimes conviction and was given his own office and unfettered access to a research center he helped establish. The professor who provided the office was later barred from starting new research or advising students for at least two years. Summers said late Monday that he would step back from public commitments. The OpenAI board said it appreciated Summers' contributions and perspective. Summers joined the OpenAI board in November 2023, part of an effort to restore stability at the nonprofit and bring back its CEO, Sam Altman, after previous board members fired Altman days earlier. “Some of you will have seen my statement of regret expressing my shame with respect to what I did in communication with Mr. Epstein and that I've said that I'm going to step back from public activities for a while. But I think it's very important to fulfill my teaching obligations,” he said. Epstein, who authorities said died by suicide in 2019, was a convicted sex offender infamous for his connections to wealthy and powerful people, making him a fixture of outrage and conspiracy theories about wrongdoing among American elites. Summers served as treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. He was Harvard's president for five years from 2001 to 2006. When asked about the emails last week, Summers issued a statement saying he has “great regrets in my life” and that his association with Epstein was a “major error in judgement.” Bloomberg TV said Summers' withdrawal from public commitments included his role as a paid contributor, and the New York Times said it will not renew his contract as a contributing opinion writer. This story has been corrected to show that Summers' statement about stepping back from public commitments was issued late Monday, not Tuesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here. Today's Exhibit A is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who, over the past few weeks, has been ubiquitous on left-leaning TV and podcasts, primarily to attack Trump regarding the Epstein files. Once among the most mocked lawmakers regardless of party, she is now gaining fake respect from everywhere, including anti-Trump entities and television programs such as The View, CNN, and MSNBC. CNN: “What Marjorie Taylor Greene's political revolt may say about Trump” Politico: “Trump stews and Dems gloat over feud with Marjorie Taylor Greene” Associated Press: MAGA rift grows as Trump feuds with Greene before key 2026 midterm elections Legacy media are eating this grift up, after a week since the true political civil war broke out among Democrats, who were hoping to keep the government closed in perpetuity to resist Trump and rile up its growing left-wing base. The said rift began after Trump rightly pointed out to Greene that her chances of winning a possible Senate race against Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) were slim to none, with polls showing her losing by double digits in a state Trump won twice. Greene, once a staunch supporter of Trump, has since publicly revolted in a very personal manner, even going so far as to accuse the president of “protecting pedophiles” as it relates to Epstein. Examples are endless to support this perspective, including her endorsing a claim that wildfires in California were once started by “Jewish space lasers” led by Jewish elites in an effort to clear enough land for Gov. “Yes they can control the weather,” she wrote on X in 2023. “Well some of them are listed on NOAA, as well as most of the ways weather can be modified,” she wrote while supplying zero evidence. But during this anti-Trump media tour, none of the examples above are being broached in an effort to normalize her. And they're even allowing MTG to claim that Israel is somehow involved in covering up the Epstein files. “We saw Jeffrey Epstein with ties to [former Israeli Prime Minister] Ehud Barak,” she told CNN's Dana Bash. “We saw him making business deals with them, also business deals that involved the Israeli government, and seems to have led into their intel agencies. And I think the right question to ask is, was Jeffrey Epstein working for Israel?” We don't know, because Bash just moved on without following up. Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can't take a ranting lunatic's call every day,” he wrote on Truth Social. “I understand that wonderful, conservative people are thinking about primarying Marjorie in her District of Georgia, that they too are fed up with her and her antics and, if the right person runs, they will have my complete and unyielding Support,” he added. “She has gone far left, even doing ‘The View,' with their Low IQ Republican hating Anchors. Update: We also received a pipe bomb threat on my construction company's office building.” Greene goes after Trump for weeks on television and on social media, and the moment he responds, she does what she does best: plays the victim. She will ride this wave to an announcement in 2027 saying she's running for president while claiming to be more MAGA than Trump himself, who literally launched the movement. MAGA without Trump is like The Sopranos with Tony Soprano — it doesn't exist. That's a place where an unserious candidate receives tons of airtime after saying provocative things about their opponents while polling with 1% support. As the California congressman did in 2020, she will go off the exit ramp well before any votes are cast, but it will be mission accomplished regardless by officially assuming the mantle of internet troll and resistance figure without having to actually govern. Additionally, Greene has become quite rich since joining Congress in 2021. Since being elected, the congresswoman has executed more than 450 stock trades and has shown a Nancy Pelosi-like ability to vastly outperform the S&P 500. Her net worth has reportedly jumped to more than $20 million despite having a salary of $174,000 per year. And in the least surprising thing you'll read all week, there are actually those in the press who are gullible enough to buy her new act of humility and country-over-party. Except former President Joe Biden was seen by a solid majority of people as divisive. In fact, an April 2024 Rasmussen poll found that just 9% of likely voters said Biden had done more to unite the country than divide it. We live in a political world full of performance artists. And after years of being rightly mocked, she'll now be embraced by legacy media as courageous and evolutionary, all because of those precious sound bites from turning on the very president that elevated her in the first place.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The café, a favorite for Romans and tourists, shut its doors. Portraits of former clientele — including Wild West sharpshooter Buffalo Bill — were stripped from its walls; plush red velvet chairs, seating booths and bar stools removed; gilded porcelain tableware carried away. The venue, as popular among Rome's 19th-century bourgeoisie as it was with the 1960s “La Dolce Vita” in-crowd, became an empty shell. Antico Caffè Greco's sudden demise was the result of a long-running rent dispute between its proprietors, Carlo Pellegrini and Flavia Iozzi, and their landlord, the Israelite Hospital of Rome. The hospital is a private institution that also provides healthcare to patients through Italy's national health service. It began in September 2017 when an 80-year lease expired and the Israelite Hospital raised the monthly rent from 17,000 euros to 120,000 euros — a leap from about $20,000 to $140,000. The move, it said, was in line with other properties on the street, which is home to stores that include Gucci, Versace and Dior. High commercial rents have pushed many small businesses out of the center of Rome in recent years, especially since the Covid pandemic when lockdowns fueled the rise of home delivery and online shopping. “We would be ready to pay more rent to keep the café open but not six times the amount we're paying now,” Pellegrini said when the Antico lease expired eight years ago. “I feel very angry, but we will fight this.” That fight was dealt a decisive blow in 2024, when the hospital finally won a court battle to remove the café's occupants. It's aim is to reopen the venue with a new tenant. It was a favorite haunt of Charles Dickens, Henry James and John Keats in the 19th century. Later, Orson Welles, Audrey Hepburn and Sophia Loren all spent time there. Notorious 18th-century seducer Giacomo Casanova even mentioned a “tryst” at the café in his memoir. Despite above-average prices, customers always seemed to think sipping a cappuccino or hot chocolate from the same cups as Pablo Picasso or Princess Diana was worth paying extra. This 136-year-old London coffee store doesn't need to move with the times Lawyers for the hospital removed a temporary “closed for vacation” sign that had been taped to the doors since September. Antonio Maria Leozappa, special commissioner for the Israelite Hospital, told CNN the removed works and furnishings have since been seized by authorities and are now being protected by Italy's Culture Ministry until new tenants can be found. He said that the hospital was not seeking backpayment from Pellegrini for an annual 100,000 euros rent shortfall since the legal battle began eight years ago. ”The city, Romans, and tourists will continue to enjoy their coffee at the Antico Caffè Greco for centuries to come.” Pellegrini isn't ready to give up the battle just yet. In Turkey, your coffee comes with a side of destiny Whatever happens next, the once-grand space is now an eyesore on one of the most prestigious streets in the city center — one of many empty storefronts, some of which sit vacant for years, that have appeared as a result of soaring commercial and residential prices. Inside, the lights are on, but no one is making coffee. “I came here every day for almost 15 years,” Manuel Capponi, an elderly local who lives at the top of the Spanish Steps, told CNN.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? In a year marked by devastating cuts to aid and horrible humanitarian crises, global health and development progress is at risk of backsliding. But then, there are those who refuse to cave in. This year's honorees are all keeping progress on global health and development alive. Have ideas for who should be on next year's list? Tackling global health from new perspectives, these leaders have channeled their expertise to create lasting impact. Others have steered national health system transformations — including making cancer treatment free for all. Then, there are those who are rebuilding war-torn nations, when attention has been diverted elsewhere.They are united by a deep-seated, strategic commitment to addressing child mortality and poverty and by their determination to make progress in the face of a perpetually challenging world. master's degrees in music and early childhood education, Rachel Accurso started making singalong videos for her son back in 2019. He had a speech delay, and Accurso knew there was a gap in useful but fun content for kids like her son. Her channel, originally named Songs for Littles, transformed into a global phenomenon. Some 13 billion views later, the Ms. Rachel cinematic universe now encompasses books, a fast-selling toy line, and a top-rated Netflix series. It could have been easy for Accurso to focus only on making positive videos — the ones that toddlers can't stop dancing along to. On her other social media platforms, Accurso has a direct line to caregivers and adults — and she uses it to advocate for the most disadvantaged. Accurso has consistently used her immense platform to champion causes often avoided by public figures, speaking openly about her personal struggle with postpartum depression and brushing off conservative backlash for posting a Pride Month message last year. Perhaps none is more moving than her unwavering commitment lately to kids in Gaza, where the malnutrition crisis — caused by Israel's brutal military campaign and continued reluctance to allow consistent aid into the enclave — has now reached “catastrophic” levels, according to UNICEF. There, more than 320,000 children are at risk of acute malnutrition.“Please look at her eyes for one minute,” she said in one video earlier this year, pointing to a picture of an incredibly malnourished baby, Siwar Ashour, whose haunting stare became emblematic of the crisis in Gaza. Critics accused her of not “caring for all kids” after she raised more than $50,000 for Save the Children's Emergency Fund for kids in Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine, among others. “I have to just remind myself that kids' lives are more important than my reputation,” she told Glamour's Samantha Barry last month. We cannot have a better, healthier future without considering the well-being of children. Food, water, shelter, education, and access to medical care are all basic needs that are crucial for human development, especially in those first few years of life. “As an educator, you care about every child in your class,” she told Mohammed R. Mhawish, a journalist who escaped Gaza with his son, in June. It has not been an easy year for women and girls around the world. But there is one reminder that helps Anita Zaidi, head of the Gates Foundation's gender equality division, maintain what she calls relentless optimism: We've come so far. “I get a lot of energy from looking at how much women have achieved over the last 100 years,” she told me last year. She began her career fighting early child mortality in a small fishing village in Pakistan, her home country, eventually winning a $1 million prize to address malnutrition, improve vaccine and primary health care access, and train midwives and community health workers. Over the past few decades, Zaidi has pioneered highly successful interventions that take seriously the idea that poverty, at its core, is sexist, and solving global health issues means taking into account entrenched gender dynamics and the role of women from the start. Now, she has a lot more money to make that happen. In August, the Gates Foundation announced a new $2.5 billion commitment for research and development to improve women's health around the world. We're talking high-tech portable ultrasound devices, contraceptive patches that could be a game-changer for family planning, and simple postpartum hemorrhage drapes that can make giving birth much safer. In other words, Zaidi still has plenty to be optimistic about. Investing in women's health is “not just the right thing to do,” she told PBS, but “a tremendous opportunity for coming up with new solutions in a very exciting area of science.” —Sara Herschander, Future Perfect fellow After the White House began dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) early this year, it would have been easy for Caitlin Tulloch to throw up her hands in despair. Tulloch realized that by filtering these programs to find the most cost-effective ones, she could direct interested donors to focus on funding them, thereby saving as many lives as possible. She and her colleagues created Project Resource Optimization (PRO) to do exactly that. Soon, they'd narrowed it down to a few dozen programs — offering malnutrition treatment, safe water access, and more — that they labeled “urgent and vetted.” In September, PRO announced, “More than $110 million has been mobilized, ensuring continued delivery of life-saving aid to an estimated 41 million people across more than 30 countries…Given the way these programs are targeted, a large proportion of those reached will be children under the age of five.” What Tulloch did reminds me of a Leonard Cohen song — the one that urges us, “Ring the bells that still can ring / Forget your perfect offering.” We can't perfectly fix every problem in the world. But we can still make the world a better place for some. At a time when many Americans were just struck dumb, Tulloch rang the bells that still can ring. In August, biosecurity expert Beth Cameron co-authored a piece for The Atlantic called “No One in the White House Knows How to Stop Ebola.” She's right. And there is currently still no one in the White House focused on biodefense. Her work was pivotal to launching the Global Health Security Agenda, a public-private partnership to defend against biological threats, as well as numerous other biosecurity initiatives. She also founded NTI | bio, an influential arm of the Nuclear Threat Initiative think tank focused on biosecurity (and, disclosure: my former employer, although unfortunately we didn't overlap). She knows that it takes moments to destroy what it takes years to build — funding cuts have decimated America's biosecurity infrastructure — but she's not giving up. She's got a mind for strategy, extensive experience, and a deep commitment to protecting the world from biological risks. “When you're in the middle of a crisis and you have to ask for money, you're already too late,” Cameron told 80,000 Hours, a career guidance nonprofit, in a 2017 podcast interview on pandemic preparedness. “Countries really need to be able to quickly detect and stop outbreaks at the source before they become epidemics. … we really need to be much better prepared to respond in real time than we were during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.” — Shayna Korol, Future Perfect fellow Raed al-Saleh has spent over a decade rescuing Syrians from the rubble in the aftermath of brutal bombings. A co-founder of the famed White Helmets — a search and rescue organization that formed as a grassroots volunteer-led response to the Syrian civil war — al-Saleh stood before the United Nations pleading for that work to end last December. He slammed the international community for having “utterly failed” Syrians after nearly 14 years of war. “I truly dream that our work of pulling bodies from under the rubble will not continue,” he told AFP. Just four days later, Syrian rebels overtook Damascus and the Assad regime collapsed, ending over half a century of brutal rule. But al-Saleh's work of pulling people from rubble, which earned the White Helmets global acclaim, three Nobel Peace Prize nominations, and an Academy Award-winning short film, shows no sign of stopping. He is now minister of environment, emergencies, and disaster management in a new Syrian government charged with rebuilding a nation ravaged by war. As part of his new role, al-Saleh is tasked with battling wildfires, clearing land mines, and repairing roads across the country, and his over 3,000 now salaried White Helmets have been formally absorbed into the country's emergency response force. According to NPR, Al-Saleh now oversees a firefighting force in which White Helmets and Assad-era first responders slide down separate poles of the firehouse into the same fire truck, responding to emergencies side by side. But it's been over a decade since al-Saleh left his pre-war job as an electronics salesman to help build the White Helmets from the ground up. But by December, something remarkable had happened. In just three months, Rwandan health officials — led by Sabin Nsanzimana, the country's minister of health — made one of the largest Marburg outbreaks ever disappear. Over the past three decades, Rwanda, a country once ravaged by genocide, has managed to pull off a wholesale transformation of its health care system. Life expectancy has shot up by 26 years. It used to take most rural Rwandans more than an hour to reach the nearest health facility on foot, but thanks to a surge in new locations, most can now get the help they need in less than 30 minutes. The country has also become a model in global cancer care, and just this summer, Rwanda's community-based health insurance program began making cancer treatments free. It took Nsanzimana just 10 days to roll out an emergency vaccine trial for the virus. Next on his list is eradicating cervical cancer by 2027, dramatically expanding the medical workforce, and achieving universal health insurance coverage by 2030. And if he could beat Marburg in three months, he might just be able to pull it off.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? This year's honorees are all keeping progress on global health and development alive. Have ideas for who should be on next year's list? They're the ones making sure that every dollar saves the maximum number of lives, that foreign aid is steered by evidence instead of dogma. They're also the ones who are open to trying something new, such as giving the simplest solutions — like a plate of beans or a clear-eyed approach to masculinity — the platform they deserve. When the Trump administration sicced its newly minted “Department of Government Efficiency” on the US Agency for International Development earlier this year, for just a moment, Dean Karlan offered to help. After all, as USAID's first chief economist, Karlan's life's work revolved around efficiency. His job was to help the agency stretch its dollars more effectively, save more lives, and propel US goals around the world. He has preached against waste, fraud, and abuse for longer than some of the DOGE bros have been alive. “I'm not a political appointee,” he told me earlier this year. But it quickly became clear to Karlan that DOGE's wrecking crew couldn't care less about evaluating programs or prioritizing cost-effectiveness. Eventually, as he watched Elon Musk and Secretary of State Marco Rubio take a sledgehammer to relatively cheap, lifesaving initiatives like PEPFAR, as longstanding colleagues were sacked, and the agency denigrated as a “ball of worms” and a “criminal organization” that needs “to die,” Karlan did the only honorable thing left to do: He quit. And, like thousands of other morally indignant ex-USAID employees, he can't stop talking about what's been left behind. Karlan, who's also a professor of economics and finance at Northwestern University, has kept busy since quitting USAID. He is the founder of Innovations for Poverty Action, a nonprofit studying solutions to global poverty, and ImpactMatters, a nonprofit that rates charities and was later acquired by Charity Navigator. He has spoken far and wide about what the future may hold, and he is currently working on a bipartisan plan to restore a semblance of American foreign aid the morning after the Trump era comes to a close. Concerns around the modern “masculinity crisis” — a catch-all term for worsening mental health among boys and men — has reached a fever pitch in recent years. And for good reason: Male suicide rates have been on the rise, men are working less, and boys are falling behind in education, among other troubling indicators. As former Vox fellow Celia Ford has written, the crisis is “driving many young men toward the far-right ‘manosphere' — where anachronistic attitudes about women, society, and gender roles are resurging.” Gary Barker, co-founder and CEO of Equimundo, a global research nonprofit working to “shift norms, narratives, and policies” around gender equality in the US and beyond, has been working for decades to build a counter to the manosphere attitude; it's what he calls “positive masculinity.” His vision replaces the increasingly regressive view of manhood, based on ruthless competition, aggression, and emotional detachment, with one based on vulnerability, kindness, and warmth. That vision is being realized through Equimundo's innovative initiatives: The organization's educational and activities-based MenCare+ program reduced violence by men against their partners in Rwanda by over 40 percent in a randomized control trial. Similar trials in other countries that used Program H — the organization's program for young boys and girls — demonstrated positive effects, too. Equimundo also operates the IMAGES survey to understand men and women's attitudes about gender equality, which since 2008 has interviewed 67,000 people in over 30 countries. We need space for men, Barker and Thomas wrote, to “be unafraid and to explore a new, healthier model of identity.” — Kenny Torrella, senior reporter Ken Opalo speaks about African politics the way some people talk about family: with affection, frustration, and an understanding of how hard it can be sometimes to make things work. At Georgetown's School of Foreign Service, where he teaches political science, he's made a study of Africa's legislatures, tracing how power actually travels through them and how, despite the obstacles, it sometimes finds its way to the people it's meant to serve. Born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya, and then educated at Yale and Stanford, Opalo established himself with his 2019 book, Legislative Development in Africa, as a gentle challenger to the easy clichés about Africa. It provides an account of how governments across the continent have grown not just from colonial scaffolds but from the chaos, ingenuity, and sheer persistence that followed independence. Institutions, he reminds us, aren't dropped from the sky. These days, Opalo is wrestling with what he calls “the growth question.” To him, development isn't a glossy summit or a well-phrased aid campaign. “Without growth,” he says, “everything else is noise.” Beyond academia, Opalo writes An Africanist Perspective, a Substack newsletter where he translates political economy into stories that feel as lived-in as they are smart. He refuses to romanticize but insists that progress in the Global South will come because people refuse to give up on the hard, unglamorous work of democracy. In both his scholarship and his storytelling, Opalo clearly believes the future is still being written by those who refuse to settle for dysfunction. Pascaline Dupas is one of the more prolific and accomplished economists dedicated to reducing global poverty. An economics professor at Princeton University, Dupas has published novel, highly cited papers on how access to banking affects small business development in Kenya, the effects of separating students into groups by achievement levels, and the power of distributing free bednets to prevent malaria, to name just a few. Her research has influenced British foreign aid, government policy in several African countries, the World Health Organization, large NGOs, and global health practitioners. Dupas herself has been directly recognized for her contributions to the field; in 2015, she was named the Best Young French Economist by the French newspaper Le Monde, and years later, was awarded a prestigious Guggenheim fellowship. If that sounds weird to you, consider that beans are the healthiest, most sustainable (by far), most affordable protein source on Earth. And they're diverse and versatile enough to be enjoyed in cuisines from every part of the world, from a garlicky Egyptian ful medames to an indulgent South Asian rajma. They're so cheap and they've long been so foundational to human diets that they aren't aspirational, generally falling by the wayside as soon as a country becomes rich enough to eat large quantities of meat. Newnham leads Beans Is How — a campaign founded at the COP27 climate conference in 2022, aiming to double global bean consumption by 2028 — to change that. With a coalition of more than 120 partners globally, the initiative has secured commitments to get more beans onto menus around the world, from school meals to high-end, culturally influential restaurants. Partner organization AGRA (formerly the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa), for example, has helped serve high-iron beans, or beans bred to have extra-high iron content, to tens of thousands of schoolchildren in Kenya. Creative, ambitious work on beans has already been happening in siloes, from agricultural research to elite gastronomy. The best case for why development economics still matters is being made on Substack. In his Global Developments newsletter, Oliver Kim — a Coefficient Giving research fellow — does something rare. That means puncturing zombie “facts,” as he did in a viral post explaining why South Korea was not actually poorer than Kenya in 1960. It's re-examining foreign aid's track record with fresh historical series, and writing crisp explainers on workhorse development concepts like exchange rates that answer all the questions you were afraid to ask. It's also of the moment, focusing on how to direct scarce dollars and political capital toward what actually improves lives. That blend of clarity and empiricism is exactly what's needed at a time when the competition for every dollar of aid is so intense. Kim's writing is a compass you can actually steer by.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has promised to deliver $2,000 tariff rebate checks next year, raising hopes of a lifeline for millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet. Although Trump has suggested these checks are essentially a done deal, the reality is there are major, perhaps insurmountable, obstacles standing in the way. Experts tell CNN it is improbable the federal government will send out $2,000 checks next year – unless it looks like the US economy needs to be rescued from an imminent recession. “It's highly unlikely there is some sort of stimulus check sent out next year. I would be pretty shocked,” Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, told CNN in a phone interview. Bettors on prediction platform Polymarket seem to agree. They place just an 11% chance that Trump creates a tariff dividend by March 31. Tariffs are undoubtedly generating gobs of money for the federal government. It's hard to say exactly how much tariff dividend checks will cost because virtually no details have been released. Still, the Tax Foundation modeled three designs for tariff dividends – and all of them would cost more than the new tariffs are projected to bring in this year. For instance, if the checks went out only to tax filers and spouses, and had a hard cut off at $100,000 in individual income, they would still cost $279.8 billion, according to the analysis. That's $121 billion more than projected new tariff revenue this year. At the high end of the scenarios analyzed, tariff dividends could go out to tax filers and non-filers as well as spouses and dependents. That would cost up to $606.8 billion – or nearly double the combined 2025 and 2026 projected new tariff revenue. That's a problem because the Trump administration has already held up tariff revenue as a way to offset the cost of the sweeping tax and spending package Trump signed into law earlier this year. Another major problem is Congress would need to sign off on dividend checks – and it's far from clear there are the votes for that. Deficit hawks were already reluctant to back the president's tax law and this would only magnify budget worries. “I find it extremely implausible that Republican budget hawks are just going to be okay with blowing another $300 billion to $600 billion,” Lincicome. After topping $34 trillion for the first time in January 2024, the national debt has continued to mount, hitting $38 trillion late last month. There's no doubt many Americans could use $2,000 checks from Uncle Sam as they struggle to catch up to high prices at the grocery store, on car insurance and elsewhere. However, some economists warn that stimulus checks could backfire by worsening the affordability crisis. The problem is that while some people may use the money to pay down debt, others would likely spend it, and that would increase demand. As the last inflation crisis demonstrated, boosting demand without increasing supply drives up prices. In fact, many Republicans blamed former President Joe Biden's 2021 stimulus checks for causing the inflation crisis. That could make it difficult for those same lawmakers to support Trump-era stimulus checks. Academic research has found those stimulus checks contributed to the four-decade high in inflation, though they were hardly the only factor. “Sending out checks to people is a bad way to stimulate the economy,” Stephen Moore, co-founder of Unleash Prosperity and a former Trump economic adviser, told CNN in an email. “If there is tariff revenue, that should be used to cut income taxes across the board. Additionally, redeploying tariff revenue to pay for dividend payments risks sparking a revolt among the so-called bond vigilantes that drives up Treasury yields that set a benchmark for a number of loan rates. That in turn would make it even more expensive for small businesses to borrow and homebuyers to get a mortgage. “What Congress and Trump are trying to do with stimulus, the bond market could take away instantly,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. Beyond the budget, political and economic obstacles, there are legal ones, too. Most Supreme Court justices during oral arguments earlier this month sounded skeptical about Trump's reliance on emergency powers to impose his global tariffs. For all these reasons, investors and economists on Wall Street are hardly counting on the arrival of $2,000 tariff dividend checks in 2026. “We've learned that late night Truth Socials are not a direct line to reality,” said Bob Elliott, CEO and chief investment officer at alternative investment firm Unlimited. “It's almost like we shouldn't want stimulus checks to happen,” Mills said, “because it would be an indicator of something wrong.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's a margin typically reserved for proclamations and post office namings, not for what was perhaps the biggest defeat of President Donald Trump's second term, a fight that GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene declared on Tuesday had “ripped MAGA apart.” When Illinois Rep. Joshua Jackson patted Khanna on the back a moment later, it wasn't clear if he was acknowledging Khanna's work or just trying to squeeze by to get to someone on the other side. That morning, Khanna had noticed that Greene and Rep. Thomas Massie, his Republican co-sponsor on the discharge petition leading to Tuesday's vote, were trending on X and he wasn't. He is trying to be fine with that, as playing down the Democratic role to woo Republican support was always part of the plan. But Khanna doesn't hide his belief that Tuesday's triumph proves he should be taken seriously as a party leader and maybe even for the long-shot 2028 presidential run he is always happy to talk about. I make no secret about the fact that I believe I have the best economic vision for this nation,” he said in an interview with CNN before the vote, ticking through his emphasis on forgotten communities abandoned by billionaires he says have rigged the system. “It took him on his side and me on my side, and our working relationship before this, to be able to do this,” Massie said after finishing thanking the survivors at their press conference outside the Capitol on Tuesday morning. “Our chance of success was about 4 percent at the beginning, and we're going to succeed. “I think Ro Khanna is a brilliant human being. He's on the right side of history,” said Haley Robson, an Epstein survivor helping organize the trembling “sister survivors” who tend to arrive holding up pictures of themselves when they first met Epstein, speaking to CNN after the vote. “If it wasn't for Massie, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Ro Khanna, I don't think any of this would have been possible. Khanna, a 47-year-old who represents Silicon Valley, has gotten used to often getting a better reception as the token Democrat on right-wing media than he does from some of his colleagues. This time, he'd like a little more credit for being ahead of the curve. “In the beginning,” he told CNN, “I'm not going to say who, but some of the folks in our own party were like, eyerolls, ‘There goes Ro on one of his issues…' ‘Why aren't we talking about the price of eggs?' ‘Why aren't we talking about the price of health care?' And I said, ‘No, there is something legitimate here. That included building a relationship with Greene, whom he said he barely knew before – but had never blasted on Twitter like so many of his colleagues – and now texts with. Or carefully maneuvering how to get Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert in September to sign the discharge petition that forced the vote. Massie relayed that she'd do it if she didn't have to wait in line, so Khanna pulled the paper away from a Democratic colleague on the House floor and let her walk over and do it. To report about Khanna is to inspire exasperation from political journalists and operatives who've rued for years how many stories the congressman always manages to put himself into as the hinge point. But it's also to hear from a person who speaks to Barack Obama often that the former president keeps an eye on Khanna as an administration alumnus (Khanna was a deputy assistant commerce secretary in the first term, before launching a primary against an incumbent whom Obama endorsed). Without overstating it, the person said, Obama “appreciates that Ro is willing to show up across all varieties of platforms.” That gives Khanna a phone full of contacts to promote himself and his ideas, from MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon to forever never-Trumper Bill Kristol to  Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and Harvard president whom Khanna is now disgusted to think he was on the phone with arguing about economic policy just weeks ago. This idea that we should not be savvy about getting our message out in the media is setting us up for being ineffective.” Rep. Don Bacon, the retiring Nebraska Republican who's become friendly with Khanna through their subcommittee work, argued Republicans always wanted to release the files, despite Speaker Mike Johnson in a floor speech on Tuesday calling the vote a distraction from “urgent legislative work.” “It could have been anybody” leading the charge, Bacon said. At first, Khanna says, he took up the Epstein files cause because it was another way of sticking it to the elite class, the ones he travels the country talking about under his “economic patriotism” umbrella for shipping out their jobs and selling out their communities. But he was changed by what he calls the “emotionally horrific” meetings with survivors who started to come through his office — the guilt of having recruited friends, the trauma of being coerced, the women breaking down about how they've blocked memories of their own rapes and wanting the records of what happened so they can at least reclaim their own experiences. He shouldn't have waited until Trump's backing off his promise to release them got him going in the spring. “Had I met the survivors in 2019 or 2020,” Khanna told CNN. “I would have been more vocal in the Biden administration. I think it is a fair point that all of us should have been more vocal earlier.” Khanna's father taught him to be stoic, he said, so tears don't tend to flow, but the anger does. This wasn't about billionaires rigging the system, Khanna started to say. Khanna doesn't know if he'll be invited to the bill signing Trump is now promising. He hasn't talked to the president since January 6, 2021, not that their relationship was ever much more than hellos at first-term bill signings and one chat in the Oval Office about a new term-limits law. He thinks Trump won't be able to wiggle out of his promise, or of complying, and believes there are too many survivors' lawyers and former Justice officials who've seen the files to know if they get selectively scrubbed. Cutting defense budgets seems to have some crossover appeal. Maybe they can come up with a billionaire's tax that they'll say is all about taking on the Epstein class. If your goal is, ‘How do we build an enduring majority, which is what progressive Democrats like me want to do?' “This is a proof of concept that we need to actually figure out how we bring disaffected MAGA voters into our coalition, that we need to focus much more on railing against a system that has screwed Americans and offering a hopeful message about how we help them, more than just meme-ing against Donald Trump.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) used profanity when expressing his belief in the urgency of releasing files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In an appearance on Meidas Media, Schumer let loose when discussing the documents, expressing distrust of President Donald Trump and his Department of Justice. “I just had a meeting of 10 senators to discuss this — we got to make sure we get all of the Epstein files, all. They can't f*** around with this,” Schumer said. “They can't say, ‘Oh, we'll give you this but there are legal reasons we can't give you that,' and we are going to be pursuing them relentlessly to get everything because I don't trust this administration. I don't trust [Attorney General Pam] Bondi. I don't trust [FBI Director] Kash Patel. It will be all of our jobs to be on them and make sure that we get everything,” he added. The case involving Epstein received little attention in Congress following his death in custody in August 2019, but it re-emerged in July after Trump's DOJ stated that it had accepted the authorities' account of the circumstances surrounding the convicted sex offender's death. The announcement and ensuing angry reactions from Trump exposed a rare division in the usually united Republican Party, pushing congressional Democrats to make the issue front and center.</p>

Earlier this week, Leo XIV renewed his objections to President Donald Trump's immigration policies, saying foreigners were being treated in ways that were “extremely disrespectful.” Speaking to reporters at Castel Gandolfo, he urged Americans to “look for ways of treating people humanely, treating people with the dignity that they have.” In a recent video message, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said it was “disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement.” He warned that “the creation is crying out in floods, droughts, storms, and relentless heat,” saying one-third of the global population now lives in severe climate vulnerability. He urged political leaders to act with urgency: “There is still time to keep the rise in global temperatures below 1.5°C … but the window is closing.” Leo XIV argued that climate initiatives are not just moral imperatives, but also economic ones, saying, “Stronger climate actions will create stronger and fairer economic systems.” He also pressed governments to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement, adding, “It is not the agreement that is failing. Reactions to the transgender attendees were sharply divided online. X user “Wall Street Mav” wrote: “I didn't think it was possible, but this Pope might be even more radical left wing than the last one.”</p>
