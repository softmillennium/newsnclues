                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump has a long history of attacking journalists, directing particular vitriol toward female reporters. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. Bloomberg reporter Catherine Lucey was among the press gaggle aboard Air Force One on Friday. In a follow-up question to an earlier query on the Epstein files, Lucey asked Trump why he wouldn't just release the documents if they didn't include anything incriminating against him or his allies. Donald Trump viciously attacks a female journalist by calling her "piggy" to her face and not one man or one woman in the White House Press Corps stands up for her, objects or calls out Trump.This video is emblematic of the last decade in this country.pic.twitter.com/rv7f9rqAs6 On Tuesday, a White House spokesperson not only defended the president's actions, but baselessly attacked Lucey once more. “Our White House journalists perform a vital public service, asking questions without fear or favor,” a spokesperson for Bloomberg said regarding the attack on their reporter. “We remain focused on reporting issues of public interest fairly and accurately.” This isn't the only example of Trump lashing out at a female journalist this week — on Tuesday, when ABC News journalist Mary Bruce asked a question in the White House about U.S. intelligence's conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had “orchestrated the brutal murder of a journalist,” referring to former Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump interrupted her. “You don't have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that,” Trump went on. After Bruce asked another question relating to the Epstein files, Trump again attacked her credibility. “I think you are a terrible reporter,” Trump said, adding that he didn't like her “attitude.” Trump has a long history of berating journalists, at times even indicating to his base that he supports violence against people in media. In 2015, during a debate among GOP contenders for president, host Megyn Kelly questioned Trump about his previous attacks on women, to which Trump responded, “What I say is what I say.” In a subsequent interview, he directed his ire toward Kelly, saying he had “zero respect” for her, that she was “highly overrated,” and that she had “blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her, wherever.” Ava Thompson Greenwell, a professor within Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism, opined about Trump's attacks against female journalists during his first term in office. In a column this week on Trump's attack against Lucey, The Atlantic's Isabel Fattal noted that Trump's “vitriol against those exercising their First Amendment rights is not limited to women,” but that “his comments to female reporters, however, have another through line: Why can't you just be silent like a woman should?” Truthout relies on individual donations to publish independent journalism, free from political and corporate influence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unsealed indictment says Ryan Wedding tracked down witness who was then murdered before he could testify US authorities have charged a fugitive former Canadian Olympic snowboarder turned drug kingpin with the murder of a witness who was prepared to testify against him. The attorney general, Pam Bondi, said on Wednesday that Ryan Wedding was accused in a newly unsealed indictment of tracking down a witness in Colombia who was then murdered before he could give evidence. Bill Essayli, first assistant US attorney at the central district of California, told reporters that Paradkar was one of a dozen individuals who were recently arrested in an “international takedown”. Police in Canada also arrested Atna Onha, a Montreal man, and charged him with murder conspiracy in the killing of Acebedo-Garcia, a former member of Wedding's organization. “Make no mistake about it: Ryan Wedding is a modern-day iteration of Pablo Escobar,” the FBI director, Kash Patel, said. The state department also increased its reward for Wedding's capture and conviction from US$10m to $15m. Four years after the Games, Ryan Wedding was named in a search warrant investigating a marijuana-growing operation in British Columbia, but was never charged. In 2010, Wedding was convicted of drug trafficking after attempting to buy cocaine from a US government agent and was sentenced to four years in prison. Described by media at the time as a 2010 “Olympic hopeful”, Wedding sought to dismiss the charges, alleging “outrageous conduct” by US authorities, suggesting they used a “violent former KGB agent” as an undercover operative. But in the years since, he has emerged as a powerful and ruthless transnational narcotics trafficker.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Measure that would have formally reprimanded Stacey Plaskett over real-time texts during 2019 hearing collapses The measure, which would have formally reprimanded Plaskett and removed her from the House intelligence committee over her text message exchanges with Epstein during a hearing, failed by a vote of 209 to 214. But when newly released materials exposed Plaskett, a Democrat from the US Virgin Islands, for exchanging real-time messages with Epstein during a 2019 congressional hearing, all Democrats voted against her censure. Then, immediately after the vote, Democrats withdrew a planned censure resolution against Cory Mills, a Florida Republican representative facing allegations of stolen valor, financial misconduct and domestic abuse. The sequence prompted Lauren Boebert, a representative of Colorado, to shout at fellow Republicans on the House floor, wagging her finger and at one point directly confronting Mills. Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican representative from Florida, attempted to raise a parliamentary inquiry asking Mike Johnson, the House speaker, to “explain why leadership on both sides, both Democrat and Republican, are cutting back-end deals to cover up public corruption in the House of Representatives”. In one exchange, first reported by the Washington Post, Epstein alerted Plaskett that Cohen had mentioned Rhona Graff, Trump's longtime executive assistant. In a statement, Plaskett's office said she received messages “from staff, constituents and the public at large offering advice, support and in some cases partisan vitriol, including from Epstein” during the hearing. Several House Republicans accused their party leadership of orchestrating an agreement with Democrats to protect both Plaskett and Mills from censure. They did it to protect a Republican facing his own ethics issues”. “This backroom deal shit is swampy, wrong and always deserves to be called out,” she added. Republican Nancy Mace of South Carolina called it “another backroom deal” and Axios reported on Wednesday she could force a vote to censure Mills, stripping him of his assignments on the armed services and foreign affairs committees. Mace had previously attempted to censure Ilhan Omar, a Democratic representative, in September, which Mills had voted against on first amendment grounds, saying: “I'm a constitutionalist.” Plaskett, who represents the US Virgin Islands as a non-voting delegate, initially declined to return campaign contributions from Epstein after his 2019 arrest but reversed course after public criticism. She was named in a 2023 lawsuit by six Epstein accusers who alleged that Virgin Islands officials enabled his sex-trafficking operation, though the case against her was dismissed earlier this year.</p>

Although Epstein died by suicide in 2019, the files are still relevant given his many connections to prominent figures, including politicians like former President Bill Clinton and current President Donald Trump. After campaigning in 2024 on releasing the files — capitalizing on conspiracy theories that energized his supporters — Trump did an about-face on his promise earlier this year, shortly after Attorney General Pam Bondi told the press she supposedly had the files on her desk, including a list of clients who were part of Epstein's criminal enterprise. After months of delay, Bondi reversed her statement, claiming that such a list didn't exist and that further investigations into Epstein or those who associated with him weren't necessary. For months afterward, Trump harshly criticized anyone who pushed the issue, including members of his own party, frequently describing the matter as a “hoax” against him. Public pressure, as well as dissent from congressional Republicans in support of a bipartisan discharge petition to force a vote in the House, eventually led to Trump calling for the release of the files this past weekend. The bill would require the DOJ to release, within an online searchable database, “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” relating to Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, including his flight logs, travel records, and other information that was collected during the investigation into his child sex trafficking operation. The bill also allows the withholding of materials from the Epstein investigation “under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.” Given that Trump frequently describes opposition to his policies as threats to national security, and regularly describes people who criticize him as treasonous, it's not outside the realm of possibility that he will use this option to his advantage, especially given his propensity to issue executive orders based on questionable legal reasoning. Political observers, journalists, and lawmakers are skeptical that Trump's intention to sign the bill into law is genuine. “Anyone expecting full transparency is likely to be disappointed,” Political Wire's Taegan Goddard wrote. “There is simply no mechanism for Congress — or anyone else — to verify whether the Trump administration withholds, buries, or scrubs the most damaging material.” [Trump previously saying] that lawmakers ‘can have whatever they are legally entitled to' is less a promise of disclosure than a warning label. In a political environment where guardrails have been dismantled and enforcement is optional, don't get your expectations up. “I'm concerned that, now he's opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files,” Massie told reporters. Zeteo's Mehdi Hasan also weighed in on the matter. Truthout relies on individual donations to publish independent journalism, free from political and corporate influence.

MOSCOW, November 19. /TASS/. Russia and China have reaffirmed the importance of joint actions aimed at preventing the arms race in space, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

On November 18, Moscow hosted a regular round of Russian-Chinese inter-agency consultations on space security topics.

"The sides exchanged their views on the current situation in this domain and reaffirmed the importance of active joint effort to prevent an arms race in space," the ministry said.

The Russian delegation was led by Deputy Director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Department for Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Konstantin Vorontsov; the Chinese one - by Deputy Director General of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Department of Arms Control Li Chijiang.

The sides also called for the soonest launch of an international legally binding agreement aimed at preventing the arms race in space, based on the Russian-Chinese draft Treaty on Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and of the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects.

"The meeting confirmed the unity of Russian-Chinese approaches to space security. The need to continue close cooperation on the subject was noted," the ministry said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. BAM-T is aiming to raise US$10-billion for a new artificial intelligence infrastructure fund that has attracted Nvidia Corp. NVDA-Q and Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund as anchor investors. The fund will be the cornerstone of an AI infrastructure strategy that is aiming to acquire as much as US$100-billion of AI infrastructure assets. To reach that target, Brookfield would bring in more capital from co-investors and use “prudent” debt, investing in land, energy, data centres and computing power, the company announced Wednesday. Brookfield launches its first private equity fund tailored to individual investors in Canada Chief executive officer Bruce Flatt has said that is likely “just the beginning,” and that AI infrastructure could be Brookfield's biggest business within a decade. “AI is creating one of the largest infrastructure buildouts in history, comparable to the formation of the modern power grid and global telecom networks, but unfolding at a far greater pace and significantly larger scale,” Sikander Rashid, Brookfield's head of AI infrastructure, said in a statement. Brookfield's factories will mostly be built on an Nvidia design blueprint, using the company's chips to provide an AI cloud service called Radiant that Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang said in a statement will be “fast to deploy and designed to scale with the world's growing intelligence needs.” Mr. Flatt has framed the development of AI as a trend that will “change every single business in the world,” and said Brookfield is in a race to be at its forefront. A recent shift toward using more debt to finance the construction of those facilities, at a moment when even the most advanced AI models are only earning modest revenue, has raised concerns that a data-centre bubble could be forming. But Brookfield has said it insists on signing long-term contracts with steady counterparties, and that data-centre supply is still struggling to keep up with demand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The $100 million energy sector extortion racket reportedly run by Vladimir Zelensky's former business partner is taking down key figures in his government and exposing his closest inner circle to extreme public anger. The graft scandal kicked off last week, after the Western-backed National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) announced a probe into a “high-level criminal organization” allegedly led by Zelensky's former business associate, Timur Mindich, who immediately fled the country. The affair has hit the country's energy sector, prompting Justice Minister German Galushchenko and Energy Minister Svetlana Grinchuk to resign. Other high-profile individuals implicated in the scandal include Zelensky's chief-of-staff Andrey Yermak, former defense minister and current head of the National Security Council, Rustem Umerov, as well as former Deputy PM Aleksey Chernyshov. Ukraine is bound to end up with an “interim government” that will strike a peace deal with Russia to end the hostilities, Ukrainian MP Anna Skorokhod has said, speaking to a Ukrainian YouTube channel. Demands that Zelensky's top aide Yermak be fired are about the survival and “self-preservation” of the Ukrainian leader, she suggested. “We'll have an interim government, “anti-crisis,” “anti-corruption,” call it whatever you like, a government for several months that will ready the country for elections, conclude negotiations, and sign a peace agreement,” Skorokhod has stated. Ukraine's cabinet has tapped Lyudmila Slugak as interim Justice Minister to replace departed German Galushchenko, having previously served as his deputy with responsibility for “issues of Eurointegration.” Ukrainian officials embezzled at least $4.7 million in goods and services related to Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), which is now controlled by Russia, Kiev lawmaker Vladimir Ariev has claimed. Purchases listed as being for the plant continued until late August 2022. The MP had previously suggested that even larger figures were involved, claiming Energoatom raked in some $9.5 million in procurements for ZNPP. Faction leader of Zelensky's Servant of the People party, David Arakhamia, has downplayed an open letter being circulated by a fellow party member, dismissing it as a private opinion. “This is a statement by individual members of parliament, and they have the right to do so. Failure to oust Yermak will result in a political backlash from the notorious Zelensky ally with “a brutal purge of the political perimeter,” jailed Ukrainian opposition MP Alexander Dubinsky has warned. Should Yermak stay in power then former Ukrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko, widely regarded as one of the key figures behind the ongoing parliamentary push against Zelensky's inner circle, is bound to end up behind bars, Dubinsky warned. Ukrainian MPs have reportedly demanded that Zelensky fires his enigmatic chief of staff, Andrey Yermak, over the corruption scandal. The top aide has long been regarded as Zelensky's central powerbroker and enforcer, with some of his critics even describing Yermak as the true ruler of Ukraine altogether. Now, however, Zelensky is reportedly considering sacrificing Yermak to save his own face amid the scandal. Denying Zelensky's direct involvement in the corruption schemes going on in Ukraine is absurd, Swiss journalist Peter Hanseler told RT, arguing that the Ukrainian leader has not even been trying to hide his family's posh lifestyle. “That is a joke if you look at all the houses and the yachts and the shopping trips of his wife,” Hanseler told RT, adding that credible sources have told him Zelensky has been sending some $50 million a month to his bank accounts in the Middle East. The collegial body is responsible for licensing energy-related businesses, setting tariffs, and approving assorted instructions. “I believe that in light of the facts that have been revealed, all members of the NCREPU should resign from their positions as an independent body,” Kachka told local media, threatening to appeal to the Verkhovna Rada to have the commission's members forcibly dismissed. Zelensky's approval ratings have tanked since the energy sector corruption scandal erupted last week, according to Ukrainian opposition MP Yaroslav Zhelezhnyak, citing private internal polling. Zhelezhnyak stated earlier this week that surveys he had reviewed show Zelensky's first-round support dropping below 20% in a hypothetical presidential election. Ukraine's parliament, Verkhovna Rada has ratified the dismissal of Ukrainian Justice Minister German Galushchenko, formerly energy minister, and his successor, Svetlana Grinchuk. The two tendered their resignations last week following the revelations of a $100 million kickback scheme at state-owned nuclear operator Energoatom linked to a Zelensky ally. Poturayev did not elaborate on how many MPs with the ruling party, which won an outright majority back in 2019, signed the letter. RT wrote last week that NABU has opened a Pandora's Box – here's a really useful explainer on the toxic fallout and why we are still seeing the shockwaves rock Kiev. Kolomoisky is being held over the disappearance of $5.5 billion from his own bank that eventually cost Ukraine 6% of its GDP. Security Council chief Rustem Umerov was allegedly under the influence of Mindich during his tenure as the country's defense minister, leaked NABU documents circulated by Ukrainian media suggest. Opposition MP Aleksey Goncharenko has claimed NABU raided offices of Ukraine's state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz on Wednesday, targeting its chief security officer, Vitaliy Brovko. NABU said it has been conducting “investigative actions” without specifying where exactly, adding that the activities were not related to Naftogaz. BACKGROUND 1 In July, Zelensky attempted to take control of NABU and SAPO, claiming the Western-backed agencies were under “Russian influence” – this was just a day after his domestic security services had raided the anti-corruption offices and arrested a senior agent. BACKGROUND 2 Zelensky's power-grab triggered mass protests in Kiev, and a warning from EU queen, Ursula von der Leyen, that Ukraine's bid to join the bloc could be jeopardized. Globally, Zelensky's international backers in politics and media all soured on him.</p>

MOSCOW, November 19. /TASS/. Moscow will scale back Poland's diplomatic and consular presence in Russia in retaliation for the closure of the Russian Consulate-General in Gdansk, according to Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, speaking to TASS.

"In response, the Russian side will reduce Poland's diplomatic and consular missions in Russia," Zakharova stated.

Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski previously announced the decision to close the last remaining Russian Consulate-General in Poland, located in Gdansk. Additionally, in October 2024 and May 2025, Poland closed the Russian consulates in Poznan and Krakow, citing allegations that Moscow had orchestrated acts of sabotage within Polish territory.

In turn, Russia responded by closing the Polish consulates in St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad. Currently, Poland maintains a single consulate in Irkutsk, alongside its embassy and a consular office in Moscow. Russia, meanwhile, continues to operate its embassy in Warsaw and previously maintained a consulate-general in Gdansk.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But now, European leaders think it has something more valuable to sell: an immigration system tough and effective enough to neuter the hard right and keep mainstream parties in power. Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, has achieved what many center-left governments of recent years have found impossible: getting reelected. Britain's Labour government – which has been hounded by the populist Reform UK party over its struggle to control illegal immigration – has been so impressed by the Danish model that it sent officials to find out how the system works. Announcing a radical overhaul of Britain's asylum system on Monday, Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, said while Britain had “held rigidly to the old model, other countries have tightened theirs.” She singled out Denmark as a poster child. The old model referenced by Mahmood is a creature of Europe's post-war milieu. The United Nations Refugee Convention of 1951 applied only to Europe and sought to settle wartime refugees – primarily Jews who survived the Holocaust, ethnic Germans expelled from Eastern Europe and dissidents fleeing Soviet regimes. At the end of last year, 123 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced according to the UN, up from about 44 million people in 2010. “Our asylum system was not designed to cope with this,” Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer said bluntly Monday. In 2015, Europe received its most requests for asylum in a single year since World War II, as civil wars in Syria and Libya helped spur around 1.3 million people to travel to the region, mostly from the Middle East. When Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel famously said “Wir schaffen das (We can do it)!” urging Germans to welcome in refugees, Denmark took a different approach. Under Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Frederiksen's predecessor as prime minister who then led the center-right Venstre party, Denmark aimed to reduce the number of asylum seekers, improve integration, and swiftly deport those who arrived illegally. Rasmussen, who is now the foreign minister, first made refugee status temporary, not permanent. Before 2015, refugees could stay in Denmark for five years, after which their residence permits would automatically become permanent. Even then, it is not guaranteed: Refugees must be fluent in Danish and have held a full-time job for several years. Denmark has also made it harder for refugees to be joined by family members. The refugee must not have claimed government benefits for the past three years, and they must also put up a financial guarantee. Michala Clante Bendixen, head of the refugee advisory group Refugees Welcome Denmark, said removing the assumption that refugee status will become permanent has been detrimental to integration. But she feared the tightened requirements had “set the bar too high” for many new arrivals, discouraging some from trying at all – particularly older people with lower levels of education. I've met so many refugees who say, ‘No matter what we do, it's never good enough. I have done everything they require of me, and still it's not enough,'” she said. Denmark has also been criticized for its policy on “ghettos” (now termed “parallel societies”), which allows the state to sell off or demolish housing estates where more than 50% of residents are from “non-Western” backgrounds. Successive Danish governments had worried about poor levels of integration in certain neighborhoods. A charitable interpretation of the “ghetto” law, introduced in 2018, is that it supports integration by encouraging people from different backgrounds to live together, not merely side-by-side. In February, a senior adviser to the EU's top court said the policy amounts to discrimination based on ethnic origin. Other laws have also been criticized by human rights groups. Under the so-called “jewelry law,” authorities can seize assets worth over 10,000 Danish Krone (around $1,500) to help cover the cost of asylum support. The measure was only applied 17 times over its first six years, but still has dark historical resonances, with some drawing comparisons to confiscations of valuables by the Nazi regime. Few dispute that Denmark's policies have achieved their stated aim. While Denmark grants far more residence permits today than it did 30 years ago, the vast majority of these go to students and workers, not refugees. Of the 99,811 residence permits Denmark granted last year, just 859 went to asylum seekers – less than 1%. “Denmark in recent decades has shown that it is politically and practically feasible to transition to a system of overall higher migration, and more employment- and education-intensive immigration,” according to a report last month from Bruegel, a Brussels-based economic think tank. Over time, this has deterred refugees from seeking asylum in Denmark. Britain's Home Office said Denmark's policies had reduced asylum claims to a 40-year low and resulted in the removal of 95% of those whose claims are rejected. Britain plans to quadruple the wait for permanent settlement from five years to 20 – much longer than the eight-year wait for refugees in Denmark. A refugee's status will be reviewed every two-and-a-half years; if their home country is deemed to have become safe during that time, they will be deported. Bendixen warned the new 20-year path to permanent settlement would destroy refugees' sense of the future and make them “feel like they are second class citizens forever.” “Integration fails when you give young people the feeling that they don't belong. Although Starmer, like Frederiksen, insists that a more stringent asylum system is compatible with the progressive values of compassion and tolerance, others say the proposals are needlessly cruel and will not have the desired effect. “Plans to leave refugees in a state of perpetual uncertainty about where and if they can rebuild their lives are not just performative cruelty, they are counterproductive to integration and the economy,” Stella Creasy, a Labour MP, said Monday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Premier Danielle Smith said she and Prime Minister Mark Carney are keen to proceed with what she called a new vision for Alberta and the federal government.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press Ottawa and Alberta appear close to striking an energy accord long sought by Premier Danielle Smith to boost her province's oil and natural gas sector, with Privy Council Clerk Michael Sabia playing a key role in the negotiations, two sources say. coast, a plan to move ahead with changes to industrial carbon pricing in support of scaling up carbon capture technology, and a lowering or removal of the industrial emissions cap. Players in the federal and Alberta governments are expressing optimism that a deal is within reach and could be announced in time for next weekend's United Conservative Party of Alberta convention. The negotiations reflect a turnaround in relations between Alberta and Ottawa, which had soured under the Trudeau government's approach to energy and environmental policies. Since becoming Prime Minister, Mark Carney has taken a more collaborative approach, vowing to turn Canada into an energy superpower while still taking action on climate change. Energy projects have featured prominently in the list of infrastructure priorities that have been referred to the Major Projects Office, a central plank of Mr. Carney's strategy for asserting Canadian sovereignty. Ms. Smith told reporters Monday she and Mr. Carney are very keen to proceed with what she called a new vision for her province and the federal government, and suggested it rested on him being able to win over naysayers within his own caucus. “It may well be that there are some members of his caucus who are not fully on board with that new vision, but I will know in the matter of days whether or not they're influential enough to change the direction that I think the Prime Minister and I want to go,” she said. Ms. Smith had originally said she thought there would be a deal by the Grey Cup, which was on Sunday. Privy Council Clerk Michael Sabia is playing a key role in talks between Alberta and Ottawa, the sources said.Jenna Muirhead/The Globe and Mail The sources said Mr. Sabia, the former CEO of Hydro-Québec, BCE Inc. and Quebec's pension fund, got involved in the Alberta negotiations after Canada-U.S. tariff talks broke down over an Ontario TV advertisement that angered President Donald Trump. Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson is participating in some of the discussions with Mr. Sabia. But Mr. Carney and Ms. Smith have also been in regular contact, the sources said. pipeline would require a private sector proponent, buy-in from coastal Indigenous communities and environmental approvals. asks Ottawa to retain north coast tanker ban, blocking Alberta's pipeline ambitions The two sources cautioned that talks are fluid and nothing has been written in stone. Premier David Eby is adamantly opposed to lifting the ban. NDP convention on the weekend that doing so would undermine all of the support First Nations and other coastal communities in B.C. have for the various resource projects already under way − some of which were referred to the federal Major Projects Office last week. It is a 400-kilometre-long pipeline that would transport carbon trapped at oil-sands facilities to an underground hub near Cold Lake, Alta., with the aim of reducing emissions by 22 megatonnes a year. The Trudeau government put in place an investment tax credit that would cover up to 50 per cent of the project's capital costs, and Alberta's government is offering an additional 12-per-cent capital-cost subsidy. However, Pathways members have expressed reluctance to proceed because of revenue uncertainty. Alberta's pipeline pitch forces a thorny debate back into full view Mr. Carney was asked Tuesday how he could square that promise with a proposed new pipeline for Alberta.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China has warned there is “no market” for Japanese seafood exports, the latest veiled threat from Beijing as its diplomatic spat with Tokyo escalates over recent comments by Japan's leader on defending Taiwan. Beijing views the self-governing democracy of Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to take control of the island, by force if necessary. For Beijing, Taiwan's sovereignty is the most sensitive issue in its relations with other nations – a “red line” not to be crossed. For more than a week, China and its state media has issued near daily denunciations of Takaichi as well as threats to economically punish Tokyo unless the comments are retracted. Seafood emerged as the latest pressure point at a regular press briefing on Wednesday from China's foreign ministry. “Due to the erroneous remarks made by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on important Taiwan issues, there has been strong public outrage in China,” spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters. “Under the current circumstances, even if Japanese seafood were exported to China, there would be no market for it.” However Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara told reporters Tokyo has yet to receive any confirmation from the Chinese government on the matter. Mao's response did not confirm a ban was in place, but it has raised the prospect that one might be on its way as well as further punitive measures. “Japan should first retract its erroneous remarks and take concrete actions to safeguard the political foundation of China-Japan relations; otherwise, China will have no choice but to take further measures,” Mao said. China had only partly resumed imports of seafood from Japan earlier this year after banning them in August 2023 in response to Tokyo's decision to begin releasing treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Japan's devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami caused water within the plant to be contaminated with highly radioactive material. The threat of a new seafood ban comes after Beijing last week advised its citizens against travelling to Japan. Although the move is non-binding, it is hugely symbolic – nearly 7.5 million travelers from China visited Japan between January and September this year, by far the highest count of any country or region, according to official data cited by Japanese public broadcaster NHK. Yu Jinxin, the company's vice president, told CNN it was “a huge loss for us”, adding Chinese tour groups are a key part of their business. “We can withstand a short-term impact of one to two months, but if the situation becomes prolonged, the financial strain on our operations will be significant,” Yu added. Previous Japanese leaders have avoided discussing Taiwan in the context of a military response to avoid ruffling feathers in China – Japan's biggest trade partner. Takaichi, a hawk who has pushed to strengthen Japan's defense capacity, visited Taiwan earlier this year – before she became Prime Minister – and called for cooperation on “defense challenges,” which Beijing condemned at the time. She has previously criticized Beijing's increasing military presence in East Asia, and during the APEC summit, she met with Taiwan's representative, again angering China. CNN's Mai Takiguchi and Kloe Zheng contributed to this report.</p>

Meanwhile, seven missiles and 34 drones struck 14 locations, while debris from downed drones and missiles fell on six additional sites. Oblasts in western Ukraine, including Ternopil, Khmelnytskyi, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Lviv, located over 500 kilometers (about 300 miles) from the front line and the Russian border, were affected. The Russian attack on Ternopil killed at least 25 people, including three children, and injured 93 others, among them 15 children, according to Ukraine's Emergency Service. Two nine-story residential buildings were damaged in the strike. The Air Force later confirmed that the attack on apartment buildings in Ternopil was carried out using Russian Kh-101 cruise missiles, launched from strategic aircraft located in Russia's Vologda and Astrakhan oblasts. Rescue workers continue search-and-recovery efforts, with people still trapped beneath the debris. "In light of the tragedy, all entertainment events in Ternopil have been canceled, and government buildings will lower their flags to half-mast," the statement said. Around midnight local time, Russian drones attacked the city of Kharkiv, injuring at least 46 people, including two girls aged 9 and 13, according to Governor Oleh Syniehubov. The Slobidskyi and Osnovianskyi districts were targeted, with Russian forces launching 19 Geran-2 drones. In Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Russian strikes injured three people, including two children, Governor Svitlana Onyshchuk reported. A large fire was reported in Lviv and pictures posted on Telegram by Lviv City Council deputy Ihor Zinkevich, showed a huge plume of smoke across the city as the sun rose. Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi later said a warehouse storing tyres had been hit and that there were no casualties. The Russian strike in Lviv has also destroyed a newly opened office of Ukrposhta, Ukraine's state-owned postal service. Smelyansky added that the office would "definitely be restored," though he did not provide a specific timeline for its reopening. The Russian attack also damaged equipment at a thermal power plant operated by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company. DTEK also reported that on Nov. 19, during the restoration of an energy facility in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a Russian strike injured a team of workers. One worker is in serious condition, while the other four sustained concussions and shrapnel wounds. In Khmelnytskyi Oblast, nearly 2,000 residents across 27 settlements were left without power due to the Russian attack, with power lines also damaged in the Shepetivka district, Governor Serhii Tiurin reported. Vitaly Zaichenko, head of Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-grid operator, said Russia is attacking Ukraine's energy sector in "waves," warning that the load on western regions will increase as a result of the recent strikes. While this attack was smaller than previous ones in October, western Ukraine will experience "load shedding" for the first time this autumn, where power is cut to consumers to stabilize the grid, he said. But he expects it to only last one day. Russia regularly launches large-scale attacks on Ukrainian cities and in recent months, Moscow has intensified attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in an attempt to plunge Ukraine into another harsh winter. Effective sanctions and support for Ukraine can change that," President Volodymyr Zelensky said, stressing Ukraine's need for additional air defense. "Russia must be held accountable for its actions, and we must focus on everything that strengthens us — everything that allows us to shoot down Russian missiles, neutralize Russian drones, and stop their assaults," the president added. Romania also scrambled four military aircraft after detecting a Russian drone violating its airspace. Corneliu Pavel, a spokesperson for the Romanian Defense Ministry, told Digi24 that Romanian forces had authorization to shoot down the drone but did not, as "it appeared only periodically and was only visible on radar." The Romanian Defense Ministry reported that no aircraft crashes were detected. The Kyiv Independent's Oleksiy Sorokin sits down with Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center, to discuss Ukraine's biggest wartime corruption scandal, which involves people from President Volodymyr Zelensky's circle and several government officials. Russian forces in Pokrovsk are operating like sabotage and reconnaissance groups and complicating Ukraine's defense efforts by dressing as civilians, the commander of the 68th Jaeger Brigade, codenamed "Liutyi," told Suspilne on Nov. 19. Eight suspects have also been charged, and Timur Mindich, a close associate of President Volodymyr Zelensky, is allegedly the ringleader. Russian FPV drones are turning front-line towns on the Dnipro's right bank into “no right to life” zones, a Truth Hounds report finds, documenting rising civilian deaths in Kherson and Nikopol. On Nov. 11, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) Chernyshov was charged with illicit enrichment as part of a large-scale corruption case involving state nuclear power company Energoatom.

In Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, Russian strikes injured three people, including two children, Governor Svitlana Onyshchuk reported. A large fire was reported in Lviv and pictures posted on Telegram by Lviv City Council deputy Ihor Zinkevich, showed a huge plume of smoke across the city as the sun rose. Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi later said a warehouse storing tyres had been hit and that there were no casualties. The Russian strike in Lviv has also destroyed a newly opened office of Ukrposhta, Ukraine's state-owned postal service. Smelyansky added that the office would "definitely be restored," though he did not provide a specific timeline for its reopening. The Russian attack also damaged equipment at a thermal power plant operated by DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company. DTEK also reported that on Nov. 19, during the restoration of an energy facility in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a Russian strike injured a team of workers. One worker is in serious condition, while the other four sustained concussions and shrapnel wounds. In Khmelnytskyi Oblast, nearly 2,000 residents across 27 settlements were left without power due to the Russian attack, with power lines also damaged in the Shepetivka district, Governor Serhii Tiurin reported. Vitaly Zaichenko, head of Ukrenergo, Ukraine's state-grid operator, said Russia is attacking Ukraine's energy sector in "waves," warning that the load on western regions will increase as a result of the recent strikes. While this attack was smaller than previous ones in October, western Ukraine will experience "load shedding" for the first time this autumn, where power is cut to consumers to stabilize the grid, he said. But he expects it to only last one day. Russia regularly launches large-scale attacks on Ukrainian cities and in recent months, Moscow has intensified attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in an attempt to plunge Ukraine into another harsh winter. Effective sanctions and support for Ukraine can change that," President Volodymyr Zelensky said, stressing Ukraine's need for additional air defense. "Russia must be held accountable for its actions, and we must focus on everything that strengthens us — everything that allows us to shoot down Russian missiles, neutralize Russian drones, and stop their assaults," the president added. Romania also scrambled four military aircraft after detecting a Russian drone violating its airspace. Corneliu Pavel, a spokesperson for the Romanian Defense Ministry, told Digi24 that Romanian forces had authorization to shoot down the drone but did not, as "it appeared only periodically and was only visible on radar." The Romanian Defense Ministry reported that no aircraft crashes were detected. Rescue operations are still underway as authorities search for 26 people believed to be trapped under the rubble of a destroyed apartment building in Ternopil, western Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent's Oleksiy Sorokin sits down with Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine's Anti-Corruption Action Center, to discuss Ukraine's biggest wartime corruption scandal, which involves people from President Volodymyr Zelensky's circle and several government officials. Russian forces in Pokrovsk are operating like sabotage and reconnaissance groups and complicating Ukraine's defense efforts by dressing as civilians, the commander of the 68th Jaeger Brigade, codenamed "Liutyi," told Suspilne on Nov. 19. Eight suspects have also been charged, and Timur Mindich, a close associate of President Volodymyr Zelensky, is allegedly the ringleader. Russian FPV drones are turning front-line towns on the Dnipro's right bank into “no right to life” zones, a Truth Hounds report finds, documenting rising civilian deaths in Kherson and Nikopol. "According to initial reports, this ammunition was supposed to be destined for Ukraine, but in December 2023, the U.S. government announced that shells worth $147 million would also be sold to Israel," the report said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. MARK A. RAYMOND is Wick Cary Associate Professor of International Relations at the University of Oklahoma and Associate Director for International Security Policy at the Oklahoma Aerospace and Defense Innovation Institute. Selective Proliferation Will Strengthen the Global Order, Not End It American leaders are convinced that the spread of nuclear weapons would deeply hurt U.S. strategic interests and further destabilize the already fragile global order. In recent months, they have doubled down on their commitment to preventing proliferation, and the June strikes against nuclear sites in Iran have shown that Washington will use force to prevent more countries from acquiring the bomb. For decades, the United States invested in a nuclear order built around nonproliferation, even as Cold War disarmament agreements such as the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty expired. Opposing proliferation among unreliable states and adversaries makes sense, but a blanket opposition to the further spread of nuclear weapons obscures the significant benefits they can bestow. The United States would do well to reconsider its strict adherence to nonproliferation and encourage a small set of allies—namely Canada, Germany, and Japan—to go nuclear. For Washington, selective nuclear proliferation would allow these partners to take on larger roles in regional defense and decrease their military dependence on the United States. Skeptics and nuclear pessimists might blanch at the idea of a world with more nuclear-armed powers, but such concerns are less warranted when proliferation is pursued selectively. Far from ushering in a frightening new era of global instability, selective proliferation would help uphold the post–World War II order. Were Canada, Germany, and Japan to acquire nuclear weapons, they would rebalance global military capabilities in favor of a coalition of states committed to the rules-based system and to stopping the erosion of its key norms, especially territorial integrity. Confronted by the geopolitical challenge of a rising China in East Asia and pressed for resources to address issues at home, Washington has come to see ending European free-riding as a top strategic priority. What stands in the way of Europe's ability to provide for its own security today—and thus blocks a significant U.S. retrenchment—is the lack of German nuclear forces. Throughout the Cold War, U.S. leaders had hoped to withdraw American forces from Europe but determined that unless Germany acquired a nuclear deterrent, the continent would not be able to guarantee its own security. Encouraging Germany to develop its own nuclear weapons would finally create the kind of self-sufficient Europe that enables an American exit. Shortly after his election in February 2025, Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced that it was time to “achieve independence” from the United States, and he has since become an outspoken proponent of substantial rearmament. But it will take a long time to build up Germany's conventional capabilities, and Berlin still lacks a clear vision for how to meet the ambitious defense spending target of five percent of GDP that Merz and other European leaders agreed to at a NATO summit in June. Japanese proliferation will go a long way toward achieving the United States' main goal in East Asia, namely, the containment of China through strong local alliances. From Washington's perspective, the primary threat posed by Beijing is that it might achieve regional dominance and develop the military potential to seriously threaten the United States and its interests by, for example, disrupting semiconductor supply chains or establishing forward bases beyond its territory in East Asia and even further afield. Such Chinese regional hegemony would pose a major challenge to the United States. If combined with independent nuclear capabilities, that advantage would effectively guarantee Japan's security in the face of outside threats—and ensure that it does not fall under Chinese control. Beyond better defending itself, a nuclear-armed Japan would provide a more credible and immediate form of extended deterrence to East Asia than the United States can provide. China might doubt Washington's willingness to risk nuclear war over developments in East Asia, but Japan's proximity and direct stake in regional stability render its commitments far more credible. A nuclear-armed Japan would also insert an extra layer in crisis escalation scenarios, allowing an effective response to Chinese aggression without directly drawing in the United States. When contemplating an attack on Japan, China would be forced to consider the monumental costs of Japanese retaliation independent of any additional American support. Having nuclear weapons would also equip Japan, and perhaps East Asia more broadly, to handle a sudden change in Washington's security commitment. In North America, Canadian proliferation would enhance American homeland security. Although Canada does not face immediate threats to its territorial integrity from Russia or China, its relations with both countries have deteriorated significantly over the past decade. A Canadian nuclear deterrent reduces the chance that the United States would be called on to defend its continental neighbor, effectively freeing up American capabilities and removing an avenue of potential geopolitical encroachment. American support for a Canadian nuclear deterrent would also provide crucial reassurance about Washington's commitment to continental defense at a time when the neighbors' bilateral relationship is under strain. For Canada in turn, possessing nuclear weapons signals to the United States that it, too, accepts shared responsibility for continental defense and that Ottawa can deter potential aggressors without American support. As Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney put it in March, Canada's “old relationship” with the United States is “over.” Going nuclear would prepare Ottawa to face this new world by reconfiguring the continental partnership and helping the country go it alone. As states acquire nuclear capabilities, regional and global balances of power shift, calling into question existing security arrangements. A state with a nuclear deterrent, the thinking goes, can behave predatorily since it is now insulated from attempts to rein it in. When states committed to defending international rules and norms acquire nuclear capabilities, proliferation, in fact, increases the stability and strength of the global order. In addition to the material sources of stability it would provide, selective proliferation would thus strengthen the normative sources of stability essential to international order. Selective nuclear proliferation should thus be framed and understood as an investment in the revitalization of that order. For instance, there is no reason to fear that Canadian, German, or Japanese nuclear weapons would end up in the hands of rogue states or terrorist organizations; all three are paragons of responsibility, state capacity, and domestic stability. There is also no need to worry about the rationality of these states. If North Korean leader Kim Jong Un can exercise prudence and caution with regard to his nuclear arsenal, leaders in Ottawa, Berlin, and Tokyo can reasonably be expected to do the same. Knock-on proliferation is typically the result of preexisting rivalries and heavily conditioned by geographic contiguity, as exemplified by Pakistan's pursuit of a bomb in response to Indian proliferation. Other possible proliferators, such as Poland, might be convinced to forgo an independent nuclear weapons program with multi- or bilateral nuclear sharing agreements. In East Asia, an acquisition of nuclear weapons by Japan might push South Korea to act on its long-held nuclear ambitions, but Seoul's integration into the American security architecture substantially reduces its incentives to do so. Japan's geographic advantage and the fact that it is not stuck in a frozen conflict (as South Korea is with a nuclear-armed North Korea) make it a more attractive candidate for selective proliferation than South Korea. To be sure, if Seoul decided to forge ahead and build a bomb, it would also be a safe and reliable nuclear custodian. The potential for accidents involving nuclear weapons remains a reasonable concern. One of the virtues of selective nuclear proliferation is that Canada, Germany, and Japan are among the most well-equipped to minimize additional risk. For example, some U.S. experts have opposed proliferation among American allies on the ground that it would undermine the United States' influence, specifically over Germany and Japan. Washington's fundamental aim in Europe and East Asia is to prevent any single state from dominating either region. Although American influence over allies offers an indirect and uncertain path to preventing the rise of a regional hegemon, nuclear weapons in Germany and Japan would virtually guarantee that result. Post-1945 pacifism and general skepticism about nuclear energy predispose many Germans to oppose an independent deterrent. Overcoming this apprehension will no doubt be difficult, and states will have to convince skeptical citizens that the acquisition of nuclear weapons will not just keep them safer but also boost the overall health of the rules-based order. Implementing selective proliferation will not be easy or without risk. An immediate practical consideration is that Canada, Germany, and Japan would each need to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, in which they agreed not to develop a nuclear bomb. Although it is unrealistic to expect all other countries to accept such withdrawals, pursuing nuclear proliferation in a responsible and transparent way would signal each country's good intentions. It is here that American diplomatic cover can prove particularly valuable, coordinating with France and the United Kingdom to ensure that the new nuclear states do not become the target of United Nations Security Council enforcement measures. To provide as much reassurance to skeptical states as possible, the three proliferators should consider adopting a “no first use” policy, at least while they remain under the American nuclear umbrella. Selective nuclear proliferation requires careful management to fulfill its potential, but it offers genuine ground for optimism.
