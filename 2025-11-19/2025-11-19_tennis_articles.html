                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italy booked its fourth consecutive semi-final berth at the Davis Cup Finals on Wednesday, overcoming Austria with the help of a thunderous home crowd and confident performances by Matteo Berrettini and Flavio Cobolli. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings, handed Italy a 1-0 lead with his 6-3, 7-6(4) victory over Jurij Rodionov. The second set was briefly delayed due to lighting issues in the stadium, but the Italian rallied from a 2-5 deficit and saved three consecutive set points on serve at 4-5, swinging the momentum back in his favour before dominating the tie-break. Cobolli then stepped up and delivered a resounding 6-1, 6-3 win against Filip Misolic in just his third Davis Cup rubber, sending the home fans into a frenzy. With its win, Italy extended its winning streak to 12 ties and set a semi-final showdown with Belgium on Friday. As Italy pursues a fourth Davis Cup crown, Berrettini's influence remains pivotal. Last year, he did not drop a rubber, compiling a perfect 6-0 record — five wins in singles and one in doubles — on the country's march toward the title. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc.
