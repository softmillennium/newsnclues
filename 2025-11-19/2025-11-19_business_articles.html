                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Super Bowl of tech earnings is nearly upon us, and the AI trade is about to get a crucial update that will either confirm or dispel a lot of investors' fears from the last few weeks. Any sign of waning demand for chips from companies developing AI models will likely further derail this year's rally. Nvidia stock is down 10% month-to-date, but it's still up 35% for the year. They say that the results should reveal a continuation of strong demand that's carried Nvidia stock and the broader AI-fueled market higher this year. ET closing bell, and a call with analysts is scheduled for 5 p.m. The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. The AI-bubble debate is raging ahead of Nvidia's earnings report, but there's nuance to be aware of if you're going to make the argument either way, Business Insider's Joe Ciolli writes in today's First Trade. "No matter where you come out on the AI bubble debate, your next move will boil down to one thing: how long you're willing to wait. You want tangible results now, and that's impacting your investment decisions. AI bears also face a time conundrum: Do they dump positions now and wait for any inevitable storm to pass? As investing legend Jeremy Grantham once told me, on a returns basis, it's just as damaging to sell too early than it is to hit eject too late. So do these bears wait longer and try to time the market more precisely? That can be a stressful and high-risk situation as well. In its earnings preview, CFRA forecasts 18% year-over-year growth and 18% quarterly acceleration, the highest since early 2024. It maintains that Nvidia will need to post revenue of $61 billion and EPS of $1.42 for the January quarter, which its analysts think is achievable.

"We believe consensus long-term projections remain reasonable, while NVDA's valuation at about 22x CY 27 basis is enticing given growth prospects and management's blue sky TAM vision of $3T-$4T by decade's end," stated equity analyst Angelo Zino. DA Davidson's Gill Luria says his team doesn't think AI demand is set to slow in the coming year. He said that despite negative speculation and jitters around valuations, the firm believes Nvidia will maintain its dominance, even if competition rises and trade tensions with China persist.

While Arya notes that Nvidia may flick at a complicated macro outlook in the earnings call, he expects the micro outlook to remain solid.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Perplexity on Wednesday announced it will roll out a free agentic shopping product for U.S. users next week, as consumers ramp up spending for the holiday season. The artificial intelligence startup has partnered with PayPal ahead of the launch, and users will eventually be able to directly purchase items from more than 5,000 merchants through Perplexity's search engine. Perplexity initially released a shopping offering called "Buy With Pro" for its paid subscribers late last year. The company said its new free product will be better at detecting shopping intent and will deliver more personalized results by drawing on memory from a user's previous searches. Perplexity declined to share whether it will earn revenue from transactions that are completed through its platform. The startup's competitor OpenAI announced a similar e-commerce feature called Instant Checkout in September, which allows ChatGPT users to buy items from merchants without leaving the chatbot's interface. OpenAI has said it will take a fee from those purchases. Etsy and Shopify were named as OpenAI's initial partners for Instant Checkout, but it also inked a deal with PayPal late last month. Michelle Gill, who leads PayPal's agentic strategy, said the company has been building out infrastructure and protections as AI ushers in the "next era of commerce." Part of that means keeping consumers and merchants connected to PayPal as they engage on new platforms like Perplexity, she said. Perplexity said PayPal merchants will serve as the merchants of record through its agentic shopping product, which will allow them to handle processes like purchases, customer service and returns directly. Through its "Buy With Pro" offering, Perplexity had served as the intermediary that completed purchases. Gill said PayPal's buyer protection policies, which can help users get reimbursed if there are problems with their orders, will also apply to transactions on Perplexity. "We're really excited about this launch because we will see it come to life during a period that's so organic for people to shop," Gill said in an interview.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MP Materials surged Wednesday on a deal with the U.S. Department of Defense and the Saudi Arabian Mining Company, Maaden, to develop a rare earth refinery in the kingdom. The U.S. rare earth miner's stock was last up about 9%. Maaden's position will be no less than 51%. The binding agreement to form the joint venture comes after MP and Maaden signed a memoranum of understanding back in May. The agreement will "significantly expand MP's global footprint" and is structured to "ensure U.S. oversight and alignment with national security objectives," the company said. MP is also holding talks on a possible collaboration to standup magnet manufacuring in Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon struck a landmark deal with MP in July that includes an equity stake, a price floor, and offtake agreement. The Trump administration is investing in MP as it seeks to reduce U.S. dependence on China for rare earth imports and stand up a domestic supply chain. MP CEO James Litinsky has described the company as the U.S. "national champion" for rare earths. Rare earths are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, clean energy technology, semiconductor manufacturing and consumer electronics. Goldman Sachs initiated converage of MP on Tuesday with a price target of $77, implying about 32% upside from Monday's closing price. "We believe MP's downstream expansion into refining and magnet production, accelerated by a partnership with the US government, will strategically position MP as a key supply chain component for rare earth refining and magnet production," Goldman analyst Brian Lee told clients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brett Johnson spent over a decade breaking into systems, stealing identities, and selling stolen credit cards on the dark web. He stole millions of dollars, often making over $100,000 a month through tax-return identity theft. He told Business Insider's Carter Thallon in a recent interview that the crime world he helped invent is mutating into something harder to see — and almost impossible to stop. Cybercrime is becoming increasingly organized, and that's a problem, he said. Here are the three rising cyber threats that alarm him most. Johnson said deepfakes that convincingly mimic real people will become central to online fraud. Criminals already use them to forge voice messages and fake live video calls. Soon, this technology will make it impossible to trust what we see or hear online, Johnson said. However, deepfakes enable criminals to essentially bypass the effort of gaining trust by posing as an already trustworthy person, accelerating the process of victimizing you. One finance clerk, last year, for example, was conned into approving overseas transfers amounting to more than $25 million, Shubham Agarwal reported for BI. The clerk had been instructed to do so during a video call that turned out to be full of deepfakes recreations of his real coworkers, including the organization's chief financial officer. That threat is compounded by the speed of AI tools, which can mimic speech patterns, create realistic faces, and write messages tailored to a target's personality. Gone are the days when fraudsters acted alone, Johnson said. Some of these operations specialize in "pig butchering," long-term relationship scams that drain victims' savings. That's exactly what happened to Ahmet Tozal, who recently told BI's Matthew Loh of a relationship he built with a supposed woman online. Over several weeks, the woman convinced him to invest over a year's worth of his wages into a cryptocurrency that didn't exist. These scam farms are structured businesses, with workers rotating shifts and supervisors overseeing them. "Back then, you did see criminals working together, networking in a co-op type fashion. The same automation fueling deepfakes is driving identity fraud to a new level. It's especially concerning because "synthetic fraud is almost invisible because that person doesn't really exist," he said, adding that "it's 80% of all new account fraud. Once a fake identity establishes credit, it can be used to open bank accounts, apply for loans, or facilitate money laundering. If synthetic IDs continue to rise, it could make fraud detection exponentially harder. "A criminal now doesn't have to understand any aspect of the crime. They can immediately buy tutorials, take live instruction classes, buy anything that they need online, and immediately start being successful and profitable at crime," Johnson said. Johnson told BI's Manseen Logan earlier this year, six ways to lower your risk of hacking:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Walmart is in talks to buy a startup called R&A Data, a company founded by two Israeli scientists that works to reduce scams and counterfeits on online marketplaces, according to people familiar with the matter and records reviewed by CNBC. Walmart's third-party marketplace has become a central part of the company's strategy to increase profits faster than sales, and has helped it expand its e-commerce business, which grew 25% in the U.S. in its most recently reported quarter. The company has said it added hundreds of millions of product listings to the platform in recent years, growth that experts say increases the need for tools to detect issues with items. R&A Data has been working with Walmart as a third-party vendor since at least 2024, helping the company screen listings on its online marketplace for compliance issues, such as counterfeiting, according to the people and records. After working with the tech startup, Walmart decided to acquire it, CNBC learned. Additional details about the possible deal weren't immediately clear. Walmart, which is due to report fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday, didn't return multiple requests for comment from CNBC. The news comes two months after CNBC published an investigation into Walmart's online marketplace that found the company made its seller and product vetting controls more lax over time as it looked to grow the platform and take market share from Amazon. During its investigation, CNBC found at least 43 third-party sellers that had used the identity of another business to set up their account. CNBC authenticated 20 beauty products and supplements offered by the sellers who had used the identity of a different business, and all of those products were determined to be counterfeit, according to brands that make the products or outside lab testing. After CNBC shared the results of its investigation, Walmart said "trust and safety are non-negotiable for us." "Counterfeiters are bad actors who target retail marketplaces across the world, and we are aggressive in our efforts to prevent and combat their deceptive behavior," Walmart said at the time. "We enforce a zero-tolerance policy for prohibited or noncompliant products and continue to invest in new tools and technologies to help ensure only trusted, legitimate items reach our customers." To combat counterfeits and other scams, marketplaces generally need a two-pronged approach, experts previously told CNBC. A Walmart acquisition of R&A could help it monitor the hundreds of millions of product listings it hosts on its platform to ensure they're compliant with its rules, according to the people familiar with the matter. Founded in 2022 by entrepreneurs Noam Rabinovich and Raz Abramov, both former members of the Israel Defense Forces' intelligence unit, R&A Data uses artificial intelligence to monitor listings for compliance, according to the people, the founders' LinkedIn profiles, interviews they've given in the past and R&A's website. There's little public information about R&A Data but its website, which was taken down some time in the last two months, described the company as "your partner in portfolio safety." "Scan millions of listings and products at lightning speeds, with incredible accuracy; our AI-powered platform delivers reliable, dependable protection, at scale," the website said, according to an archive of the page captured on Sept. 5. People interested in the software could submit their contact details for further information, but the website said registration for early access was "full" and it was "not accepting any further sign-ups." "If you would like to be considered for 2025 access please submit your details," the website said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To stand out in today's job market, it's crucial to go "one step beyond" other candidates by polishing your personal narrative and preparing for tricky interview questions. In her experience, one interview question that frequently trips up job seekers is: "Where do you see yourself in five years?" Nobody really knows what their future career will look like, but the question "gets so many job seekers rejected — and they don't realize it." Here's her best advice for job seekers on how to tackle this interview question. From a hiring manager's perspective, the purpose of this question is to figure out if candidates are sincerely interested in the job and whether it aligns with their career ambitions, according to Mann. Many job seekers inadvertently "prove that this role isn't in their trajectory" by sharing future goals that have nothing to do with it, Mann says. "They'll say things like, 'I hope to open my own business in five years,' or, 'I hope to get married in five years," she says. Answers that focus on entrepreneurship or personal milestones can "give the impression that this person might be a flight risk," Mann says. Companies are looking to hire employees who will stick around for the long term, according to Mann, not ones who are already planning their exits. Finally, don't tell the interviewer, "I want your job in five years," Mann says — you'll seem arrogant and unrealistic. She recommends thinking of the question as: "How is this role favorable to my trajectory?" Rather than saying, "I expect myself to be the director of this department" in five years, candidates should focus on the steps they would take to achieve that, she says. "Instead of just saying, 'I'm chasing a title,' you're saying, 'I'm chasing outcomes that are going to be beneficial to the business,'" she says. Overall, your answer should be "in flow with the role," Mann says: It'll show the company that you plan to stick with the job, but continue "achieving at higher and higher levels."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump trumpeted Saudi Arabia's $1 trillion investment pledge in the States and the potential sale of American fighter jets to Riyadh, but experts say there are lingering doubts over whether such deals will materialize. Trump rolled out the red carpet for Saudi's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as he arrived in Washington on Tuesday for talks ranging from security to civil nuclear energy partnerships. U.S. intelligence determined that the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul, but Riyadh denied any involvement in the murder. Undeterred by global outrage over the death of Khashoggi, and question marks over Saudi Arabia's rehabilitation and invitation to the White House, Trump and MBS said they had "finalized a series of landmark agreements that deepen the U.S.-Saudi strategic partnership." Among them, the White House said in a statement, was Saudi's pledge to increase the $600 billion worth of investments in the U.S. that it made in May, to $1 trillion. No further detail was given as to a time-scale around that trillion-dollar investment, however. A $1 trillion investment is equal to Saudi Arabia's annual economic output in 2023 (of $1.07 trillion) and economists questioned whether that level of investment would, or could, materialize any time soon. "These sort of pledges have become regular features of the international landscape, even when, as in the case of the EU [and it's pledged investment in the U.S. as part of a trade deal] there's absolutely no enforcement mechanism available," Paul Donovan, chief economist at GBS Global Wealth Management, noted Wednesday. In addition to the investment pledges, Trump and MBS discussed the sale of F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, with the kingdom reportedly looking to buy as many as 48 of the stealth fighter jets in what would be a multibillion-dollar deal. The president "approved a major defense sale package, including future F-35 deliveries, which strengthens the U.S. defense industrial base and ensures Saudi Arabia continues to buy American," the White House said. But no details were given on the number of planes sold, or any timeframe for their supply. Such a sale could prove controversial with U.S. lawmakers whose sympathies and allegiance has traditionally leant toward Israel, the U.S.' main and longstanding ally in the Middle East. Israel is currently the only country in the Middle East to have F-35s and any sale of such advanced stealth technology to Saudi Arabia could be seen as risky, having the potential to shift military and power dynamics in the fractious region. Trump shrugged off those concerns, telling reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday that: "We'll be selling F-35s," although he alluded to Israel's discontent, noting: "This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally." "I know they'd like you to get planes of reduced calibre, but as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line," he added. Analysts say giving Saudi Arabia F-35s before it has signed the Abraham Accords thereby normalizing relations with Israel, would be a reward too far for Riyadh. "Saudi Arabia is an important U.S. security partner, and increasing bilateral defense cooperation can further common interests and support efforts to build a regional security architecture that more effectively deters and defeats aggression," Bradley Bowman, a senior director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said in analysis. "However, before providing Riyadh with the F-35, Washington should address concerns related to Riyadh's relationship with China, follow the law regarding Israel's Qualitative Military Edge, and demand that Saudi Arabia first normalize relations with Israel." Lingering and deep-seated differences over a two-state solution could give the White House reasons to hesitate over the supply of F-35s to Saudi Arabia, analysts noted. "It's one thing to announce big deals. It's one thing to announce that Saudi Arabia will be permitted to buy the F 35 this advanced stealth fighter, but it's another thing to actually have planes touching down and taking off from Saudi runways," Paul Musgrave, associate professor of Government at Georgetown University in Qatar, told CNBC Wednesday. "Now, that's not to say that this deal is not going to go through because, of course, Israel also has suffered some reverses in its public standing, but there is going to be, I think probably, a decently long road between where we are and where we get to," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Porsche on Wednesday revealed an all-electric version of its Cayenne SUV, calling it the "most powerful" production vehicle ever made by the German sports car manufacturer. The 2026 Cayenne EV is capable of 1,139 horsepower, 0-60 mph in 2.4 seconds and up to 1,106 foot-pounds of torque, according to Porsche. Its top speed is up to 162 mph, the company said. To achieve the vehicle's peak performance, Porsche said a launch mode needs to be activated. In normal driving mode, the vehicle features up to 844 horsepower. A top-end "Turbo Electric" model starts at $163,000 — making it among the most expensive Porsches on sale. A standard model with less performance — 402 horsepower and 615 foot-pounds of torque — starts at $109,000. The Cayenne Electric features a 113 kilowatt-hour battery and 800-volt electrical architecture system that's capable of charging from 10% to 80% in less than 16 minutes, Porsche said. The new EV also is the first Porsche to have the option for inductive, or wireless, charging, but it comes at a much slower pace than traditional plug-in charging. Porsche said ordering for the Cayenne Electric is open, with deliveries expected to begin at the end of summer next year. The all-electric SUV launch comes two months after Porsche confirmed it was pulling back its previously announced EV plans to instead continue to offer vehicles with internal combustion engines, including hybrids. "We have set the final steps in the realignment of our product strategy," Porsche CEO Oliver Blume said in a September release. "We are currently experiencing massive changes within the automotive environment. That's why we're realigning Porsche across the board." The Cayenne EV will be offered alongside a combustion-engine model as well as a plug-in hybrid electric version, according to Porsche.

The portrait is the most expensive work ever sold at auction at Sotheby's, blowing past its original estimate of more than $150 million. It was sold to an anonymous buyer on the phone with Sotheby's Vice Chairman and Head of Impressionist and Modern Art Julian Dawes. "Our evening sales were a resounding success and send a strong signal for the art market," said Sotheby's CEO Charles Stewart. The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. Total sales are expected to exceed $1.4 billion and possibly top $2 billion, which would more than double last year's total. Art experts and auction houses say the market is being boosted by a renewed sense of optimism among collectors and by several top collections coming to market, including rare masterpieces by blue-chip artists. This week's auctions included an eye-catching piece by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, who gained notoriety for his $6.2 million "Comedian" sculpture of a banana duct taped to a wall. His piece at auction this week, "America," is a fully functioning, 220-pound solid gold toilet. It sold for $12.1 million, Sotheby's said, above its starting bid of $10 million, but below what many expected. Along with the Lederer portrait, the collection included two Klimt landscapes, which sold for $86 million and $68 million. Sales at Christie's have topped $747 million so far this week. On Monday, it auctioned a Mark Rothko painting that was part of the Robert F. and Patricia G. Ross Weis collection for $62.2 million. A Picasso that was also part of the collection sold for $45.5 million. The sales will continue this week with lower-priced day sales and a big evening sale at Phillips.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blue Owl has decided to call off the merging of two of its private credit funds after the deal caused some angst among investors, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm had planned to merge its smaller, nontraded Blue Owl Capital Corporation II (OBDC II), into the larger, publicly traded fund Blue Owl Capital Corporation (OBDC). News of the restricted redemptions caused shares of the parent company – Blue Owl Capital to slump about 6% on Monday. It also added to concerns about the state of the private credit industry among investors, especially the area that has started to heavily finance the artificial intelligence data center build-out that many fear is overhyped. Blue Owl shares rebounded slightly on Tuesday. Therefore, they chose to reverse course, sources said. Blue Owl confirmed in a press release later Wednesday morning that the proposed merger had been terminated, citing "current market conditions." "Both funds remain strong, with excellent fundamentals, and we are confident in our ability to deliver attractive returns independently as we continue to work with the Board to consider the best future opportunities for OBDC II," said Craig Packer, the CEO of both funds, in the release. Now that the fund merger has been terminated, OBDC II will allow investors to redeem in the first quarter, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing nonpublic information. The fund historically has allowed liquidity on a quarterly basis. Blue Owl shares were little changed in trading Wednesday. We want to hear from you.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. But in a rare public conversation with Sen. Bernie Sanders, the British-Canadian Nobel Prize winner made his view clear: the world isn't ready for what's coming. Across an hourlong discussion at Georgetown University on Tuesday, Hinton warned that AI's rapid evolution could spark mass unemployment, deepen inequality, and even change the nature of human relationships — all while governments and tech giants edge toward crisis. Here are the seven biggest takeaways from Hinton's stark warning. Unlike past technological revolutions, Hinton said, the jobs lost to AI may not be replaced by new ones. He said Big Tech's trillion-dollar investment in AI and chips isn't about empowerment. "These guys are really betting on AI replacing a lot of workers," Hinton said. Sanders pressed Hinton on whether billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg are concerned about the human consequences of their investments in AI. He warned that as AI automates more work, the economic model itself could buckle. "If the workers don't get paid, there's nobody to buy their products," he said — a reality he says tech executives "haven't really thought through." Today, he said, large language models like GPT-5 already know far more than any person. "They know thousands of times more than us already," Hinton said. "Almost all the experts believe that it's inevitable that if we don't blow ourselves up or have massive pandemics or something like that, they're going to get smarter than us — and nobody knows what's going to happen then." The pace of change, he added, is incredibly fast: "We can see clearly for a year or two, but 10 years out, we have no idea what's going to happen." "A person using an AI can still do critical thinking, or they can try and dump everything on the AI, and that's terrible," he said. When Sanders asked how AI might transform geopolitics, Hinton didn't mince words: autonomous robots could make war easier to wage. He warned that authoritarian regimes — from Putin's Russia to future militarized powers — would find that prospect appealing, as it would cause no human deaths. Asked if fears of machines taking over are still science fiction, Hinton said no — and that's why he went public in 2023 after leaving Google. And once they're that advanced, persuasion becomes their greatest weapon. "The AI by that point will be much more persuasive than a person already," he said. Hinton closed with a political punchline that echoed Sanders's worldview. However, he added that "somehow the very rich and people like Murdoch have won the battle to say that taxes are bad — taxes are good. He argued that the US political system has become too easy to buy and that the superrich "pay much too little in taxes" while capturing many benefits from public innovation.</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sophia Sun, 29, from San Francisco. The following has been edited for length and clarity. My first job out of college was at Microsoft, where I worked as a program manager and product manager from 2018 to 2023. In January 2023, I left my Big Tech job to work for a creator commerce platform. My playbook for breaking into AI is to find a real user problem, design a lightweight AI solution, and turn it into proof of work. Then I moved to an edtech team for a further two years. Many creators lack marketing experience, and I imagined the tool would use AI to generate content, for example by taking the transcript from a podcast episode and condensing it into a blog. I thought it could also chop up a creator's hourlong video into short-form videos for TikTok and Instagram. I got the green light and started working on the project around April 2023 with engineers and marketing teammates at Kajabi. Engineering different prompts was key to the project, for example, to generate a good blog post versus a good LinkedIn post. I worked with my engineering team to build an internal tool that easily tested prompts for the main tool and compared them simultaneously. It was helpful to build infrastructure that could help us iterate and experiment quickly. If your company doesn't have internal tools for testing, I'd suggest building them. I had around 200 of my own podcast episodes that I could use as testing material by running them through the tool and seeing what marketing materials it made. We launched the product, called Creator Studio, in March 2024. Shortly after the launch, I saw Microsoft was hiring for a team developing generative AI to make visual content, like posters and infographics. I was excited about the role because I felt that, while there's a lot of industry-wide emphasis on using AI for text generation, we still haven't figured out how to use AI for images and video that well. By joining a visuals team, I thought I would learn skills that others would have to catch up to later, helping me future-proof my career. I rejoined Microsoft in July 2024 as a senior AI product manager. I think the fact that I could talk about my end-to-end experience building an AI product at Kajabi helped me land the role. Having awesome grades is one thing, but if you've built an actual AI project, it demonstrates your abilities. Test out whether an AI agent can solve a real problem for you, like booking your flights. If your company isn't really working on AI, you can pitch a project, like I did. Do you have a story to share about pivoting into AI work?</p>

Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has resigned from OpenAI's board after new emails showing the extent of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein surfaced. The resignation comes less than two days after Summers said he would be stepping back from public life. "I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused," he said in a statement to Business Insider on Monday. "I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Emails released by the House Oversight Committee last week showed that the two men had been in correspondence for years, up until Epstein's arrest in 2019 for federal sex trafficking charges. Epstein was also convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Summers served as Treasury Secretary under former President Bill Clinton and as director of the National Economic Council for former President Obama. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has urged Harvard to cut ties with Summers.</p>

My cofounder and I had an idea for a no-code AI workflow builder and planned to stay in San Francisco for three months, but we decided that running our own hacker house could be more fun. It would also help us build a strong network. The operational stress can be intense at times, but I've now got a better grasp on managing it.

I moved from my hometown of Pittsburgh, and he was in Dallas. San Francisco was always a place I wanted to live because it seemed like the kind of place where people who thought like me were. We planned to share a bunk bed in one room, and fill the rest with people we found, possibly securing free rent for ourselves in the process. They said we had two weeks to close on it if we wanted a master lease for all the units. We were frantically sending messages to people on a San Francisco housing directory, LinkedIn, and X. We scheduled around 100 calls to fill the first cohort. By July 4, we had filled every spot, but some people dropped out, so we continued interviewing until the first move-in day on July 15. For San Francisco, the money I'm making from this isn't great, but it's livable. Ideally, as we expand to more buildings and locations, I can create a better financial situation for myself. But for now, it's nothing to complain about because I'm so inspired by doing this. They're doing some really cool stuff, and I'm constantly getting updates that make me smile. Our first house was taken over by a new management company, and they gave us a two-month notice to leave. But I had the hypothesis that a lot of hotels here are vacant, and if I called them, we could get a good deal and fill one. After we found a building that would work with us, within a day of posting the first advertisement, we had 80 applicants. We priced a private bedroom at $1,500 a month, and that base price has remained consistent, except that we now offer larger rooms or suites as additional options. The house does a lot of community events because when we got here, we were going to networking mixers that droned on. Then, I was sitting in the backyard, complaining about just that, and I had the idea for a Mark Zuckerberg-themed rave. Everyone was cracking up, but then we threw a Mark Zuckerberg-themed rave, and there were no name tags in sight. No one networked, and it was a blast. People try to make community a digital phenomenon, but I think those who are literally shaping the future should be coming together and being physically present with each other. Doing community events is what keeps me engaged. Do you have a hacker house or founder story to share?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Business leaders, including Elon Musk and AMD CEO Lisa Su, joined a dinner with President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House on Tuesday. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev were on the guest list, but it is unclear if they attended the event. Here is a list of US executives who attended the high-profile dinner. Elon Musk made a rare public appearance at the White House since his falling-out with Trump earlier this year, after stepping down as the informal head of the White House DOGE Office. Nvidia chief Jensen Huang attended the White House dinner as one of the most influential figures in artificial intelligence and chipmaking. Nvidia's CEO's presence underscored the pivotal role of advanced computing in US-Saudi economic relations and the global competition to dominate AI technology. Apple chief Tim Cook joined the White House dinner as one of the most powerful figures in global business, representing a tech giant that shapes everything from consumer tech to privacy standards. His appearance highlighted Apple's pivotal role in US innovation — and its importance to any conversation about the future of tech and trade. As the leader driving fierce competition in semiconductors — a sector vital to both AI development and global supply chains — Su's inclusion signaled the critical importance of her industry to US strategy. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman attended the White House dinner as one of Wall Street's most outspoken figures. Known for his bold market bets and influence in finance and policy circles, Ackman's presence reflected the growing alignment between political power and the capital shaping global markets. OpenAI president Greg Brockman joined the White House dinner as a key architect behind the modern AI revolution. His invitation underscored the growing importance of artificial intelligence in diplomacy and economic strategy, with OpenAI's technology now at the center of global debates about innovation and regulation. His presence showed the increasing importance of digital assets in global finance and the White House's commitment to engaging with fintech leaders who are shaping the future of money.</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Vincent Goh, a 25-year-old working in the Bay Area for a Cantonese publishing house, who was on United flight 869 when it made an emergency landing at SFO. It has been edited for length and clarity. I was on my way to Hong Kong for business, just as I had done three times in the past six months. But smoke coming from the plane had me thinking this would be my last flight. I was one of the last to board. It was then delayed for another hour. Then I looked to my left to look out the window — I was in the middle seat — and saw lots of smoke coming out of the plane. Passengers around me were talking to each other and looked anxious. I heard a person say in Chinese, "Are we fucked?" I told her how to contact my family. I was sitting very close to the gas tank. Imagine taking off your earphones, hearing that there is smoke coming from the flight, and being able to see the smoke it's releasing. We got back to SFO soon after, and people immediately stood up when the plane landed. The pilot told them to sit down. But I could not find any information counter for United, so I wandered around the airport for an hour, then ended up going to the United lounge for answers. I was given a $15 meal coupon as compensation. I decided to get a good meal after the ordeal — fries and a chicken sandwich, with a glass of red wine, which came up to $35 after redeeming the voucher. It's Thanksgiving, so I took some time off for myself and decided to fly in ahead of schedule. But if it were another trip with a tighter schedule, it might have really affected me. Representatives for United Airlines told Business Insider that the flight, a Boeing 777 aircraft carrying 336 passengers and 15 crew members, returned to SFO "to address a burning rubber smell in the cabin."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk made it back to the White House. The world's richest man was seen attending a dinner at the White House on Tuesday night with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It's Musk's first public visit to the White House since his feud with President Donald Trump exploded in June following Musk's departure from his role as the de facto leader of the White House DOGE Office. The feud between the two men began as Congress began working on the "Big Beautiful Bill," a sprawling fiscal package at the centerpiece of Trump's domestic agenda. Musk publicly took issue with the bill's impact on the national debt, while Trump and other Republicans alleged that the Tesla CEO was really concerned about the bill's phase-out of electric vehicle incentives. Following the bill's passage in July, Musk floated the idea of forming a third party called the "America Party." But that party has failed to materialize, and in recent weeks, Musk has largely toned down his criticism of the administration. The two men briefly spoke face-to-face at Charlie Kirk's memorial service in September, and Trump said in October that he had spoken with Musk "on and off, a little bit" since then, describing their relationship as "good." "I like Elon," Trump told reporters at the time. Other business executives at the Tuesday dinner included Apple CEO Tim Cook, AMD CEO Lisa Su, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, among others.</p>
