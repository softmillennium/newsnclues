The negative [side] is he's, you know, a man-child. Hawke is quick to credit Harjo for creating such a vivid, authentic character, just as he's eager to share credit with a “magic” crew of talented artists. “He's got this band of players down in Tulsa who are magic, and they're all believers in the same dream,” Hawke said. They're mavericks and outlaws, and they can manage that sweet spot of having an incredibly good time while working really hard. The show's set decorator, who also worked on “Reservation Dogs,” described what went into building two of Lee's essential spaces: a used bookstore he owns and the tiny room upstairs that serves as his apartment. “But it's also trying to be somewhat of a haven for his daughter.” To shed a little more light on Lee's identity, the crew would swap out Lee's sheets depending on who was there. If Francis (Ryan Kiera Armstrong) was sleeping over, they'd used a “sweet, '90s-looking horse pillowcase that might look like something she'd have from childhood.” Whereas if Lee was alone, he'd use a “screen-printed, punk-looking T-shirt as a pillowcase.” “It's him attempting to be fatherly and paternal and make a cozy space, but clearly he's in the throes of his own chaotic life, too,” Sampson said. “For me, set dec — especially things like your character's apartment — when that smells wrong, [it's a problem,]” Hawke said. That makes Lee live in a three-dimensional landscape. “Lee is based on a real guy who worked at a real rare bookstore, so we got in touch with his coworker, and he became a very, very good friend to the production. We're not going to have a Danielle Steele section in Lee's bookstore.” The plan worked a little too well, when actual Tulsa residents would spot the bookstore and walk inside, excited to discover a new bookseller in town. There's always a section that would never be a section at a normal bookstore, like ‘Woody Guthrie's Fever Dream' section — these things that are totally made-up but make sense to Lee.” “All of a sudden, everything started to lock in,” Hawke said. “I didn't even have to look over my shoulder. I hit the ground running with this guy.” Down to Earth and larger than life at the same time, Lee Raybon has all the elements of an iconic character. Hawke may have seen him from the start, but it took a whole team of magicians to put the pieces together. Check out the video above to learn more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: J.K. Rowling has today made her first visit to the set of HBO‘s Harry Potter series. Sources tell Deadline that the author inspected progress on the adaptation of her beloved fantasy franchise, which has been filming at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden and on location in the UK. One person joked that it was like receiving a royal visit, with senior members of the production team clearing space in their diaries to welcome Rowling. Rowling serves as an executive producer on the Harry Potter series, and has contributed to writing and casting decisions on the show, which went into production over the summer. Jason Isaacs & Tom Felton Have 'Harry Potter' Reunion On Broadway: "So Brave. Daniel Radcliffe On The Letter He Wrote HBO's 'Harry Potter' Actor Dominic McLaughlin: "I Just Want To Hug Them" In June, Rowling said she had “worked closely with the extremely talented writers” on Harry Potter, not least showrunner Francesca Gardiner. When the series was first announced in 2023, Rowling praised HBO's “commitment to preserving the integrity of my books,” adding: “I'm looking forward to being part of this new adaptation, which will allow for a degree of depth and detail only afforded by a long-form television series.” Rowling herself has been clear that she has not allowed politics to interfere with casting decisions after Paapa Essiedu, who will play Severus Snape on the HBO series, voiced support for trans rights. “I don't believe in taking away people's jobs or livelihoods because they hold legally protected beliefs that differ from mine,” Rowling said on X/Twitter. Filming has been ongoing for months on the Harry Potter series, which will star Dominic McLaughlin as the titular Hogwarts wizard. Alastair Stout will play Harry's best friend Ron Weasley, and Arabella Stanton will round out the trio of heroes as bookworm Hermione Granger. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amanda Seyfried already has an idea of how to bring Sabrina Carpenter and Sydney Sweeney into the Mamma Mia 3 storyline. Although a sequel to the jukebox musical has not been officially greenlit, Seyfried is hopeful that it will happen and has proposed that Carpenter and Sweeney join the cast. “Maybe I'm just naive, but I'm pretty sure Mamma Mia 3 is a done deal,” Seyfried told Entertainment Tonight at the Governors Awards. “I love portraying a mom, so I would love to see Sophie with her kids,” Seyfried said. “Maybe she has a cousin she hasn't seen in a while, and that could be Sabrina Carpenter. And then Sydney Sweeney could show up. There's a bunch of girls that really want to be a part of it, and I'm all for it.” Seyfried noted that she just knew “the three dads are going to come back, and we still won't know who the dad is because it doesn't matter,” adding, “Meryl [Streep] is a ghost, obviously, so she'll be around. “If Sabrina Carpenter wants to play my daughter, I'll make it happen. I'm a big fan,” Seyfried told ABC News on October 2024. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jennifer Aniston's longtime best friend Adam Sandler gave a big thumbs up to her budding romance with Jim Curtis. The “Happy Gilmore” actor publicly applauded Aniston's new relationship while presenting her with an award at Elle's 2025 Women in Hollywood Celebration on Monday. “When we are around you, me and [my wife] Jackie are so happy you and Jim found each other and are having the love affair you two deserve,” Sandler, 59, joked before giving her boyfriend a shout-out. The “Billy Madison” star went on to praise Aniston's incredible personality. “I can honestly say Jen is the best in so many ways and one of the most rocksteady humans I've ever met,” he said.

Sandler claimed he has only ever seen Aniston get angry “like, two and a half times” in the 40 years that they've known each other. And she has a warmth to her that is intoxicating,” he said, concluding, “She is everyone's best friend.” Sandler and Aniston have been close pals for years and co-starred in several projects together, including 2011's “Just Go With It,” 2019's “Murder Mystery” and 2023's “Murder Mystery 2.” Instead, he was seen supporting her from inside the soirée held at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif. “Hypnotism is one of the many things that he does.</p>

Palme d'Or-winning filmmaker Jafar Panahi, who is now able to move freely out of his home country of Iran, is set to go on “tour” in the United States for the first time. After 15 years of being subjected to imprisonment, interrogation, and house arrest, Panahi made it to the New York Film Festival earlier this fall after last-minute visa issues were resolved. Now, he'll embark on a six-city trip across the U.S., as IndieWire exclusively shares, a first in his four-decade career making films (and often, recently, in secret). Stops will include New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle, where Panahi will visit the storied arthouse cinemas in each city — all while crafting a new short film to document his journey. You can see the full lineup of stops and their dates below. The story of an unassuming mechanic who has a chance re-encounter with a man he believes might be his former torturer, “It Was Just an Accident” is up for Best International Film, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay at the Gotham Awards, set for December 1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kate Winslet appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on Tuesday night to discuss her directorial debut, but ended up divulging the questionable look she wore to meet King Charles III decades ago. Harking back to the 1996 premiere of “Sense and Sensibility,” Winslet shared, “The first time I met him. He had come to support the royal premiere of ‘Sense and Sensibility' when I was only 20.” “I sort of hadn't realized we were really going to meet him. So I forgot about the fact that I really was wearing a kind of transparent lace outfit,” she laughed, adding, “And thank God I'd worn a coat because as he's making his way towards me, I'm like, ‘Nipples! For last night's show, Winslet chose a more tailored black and white pinstriped suit with stiletto heels, though she nearly had a wardrobe malfunction — she confessed that she tripped walking out of her dressing room, on her way to the stage. Die-hard Winslet fans might make a connection to one of the most iconic “Titanic” looks, when Rose DeWitt Bukater wears a white pinstriped coat when we are first introduced to the character, though in the inverse colorway, Winslet is on a press tour for the movie “Goodbye June,” which was written by her son, Joe Anders. Now nearly 22, Anders wrote the film when he was 19, pulling from his own family dynamics when his family came together upon the death of his grandmother, Winslet's mother. It is the first feature film directed by the 56-year-old, making it a milestone moment for both Winslet and her son.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pro-Israel news outlets like Anash, Ynet, and Israel National News, influencers like Libs of TikTok, Fox News reporters, and even a conservative commentator on CNN repeated the claim, which was first published by right-wing activist group Project Veritas. “The Brazilian nationals, linked to Tren de Aragua, face charges of underage sex trafficking and planning a terrorist attack on Chabad South Orlando, a Jewish synagogue and school,” Project Veritas posted on Oct. 11, with mug shots of the two culprits as seeming corroboration of the wild claims. There's no actual evidence of a criminal investigation into this sinister plot: Experts say the narrative is implausible, and the U.S. attorney's office where this allegedly took place confirmed to Rolling Stone that the two Brazilians identified by Project Veritas are simply on their way to a routine deportation for immigration violations, and that no criminal charges are forthcoming. Project Veritas, the activist group founded and formerly run by James O'Keefe known for deceptive undercover videos, has been publishing stories featuring a Brazilian national named Patricia Lélis Bolin for several months now, promoting her bizarre conspiracy theories involving more than a dozen people, including former Attorney General Bill Barr, Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis, the CIA, and Qatar, as well as the federal prosecutor in her own fraud case. Bolin was indicted last year in the Eastern District of Virginia (EDVA) for bilking fellow Brazilian immigrants out of $700,000 by pretending to be an immigration attorney, fabricating entire personas, and forging documents, and is currently wanted by the FBI, with a warrant out for her arrest. People from across the political spectrum have for years denied Bolin's stories about them and called her a liar, from Trump operative Jason Miller, to conservative talk show host Armstrong Williams, to former congressman George Santos, to MAGA publicist Trevian Kutti, who was indicted by Fani Willis for her role in the Georgia election interference case. Kutti, like others, first promoted some of Bolin's claims against their common enemies, before deciding that Bolin was untrustworthy and her materials were forgeries. She was indicted there for making a false accusation against former Brazilian lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of former president Jair Bolsonaro, producing threatening Telegram messages that Brazilian police determined were not authentic. But all of this hasn't stopped Project Veritas from relying on Bolin's elaborate accusations. The group's storifes featuring Bolin include alleged texts, WhatsApp messages, and emails that share far-fetched wording, forensic irregularities, and mistakes — such as a person alleged to be Fani Willis spelling her own first name wrong (as “Fabi”) in text messages. James O'Keefe Spent Project Veritas Money on DJ Equipment and Booze for Girlfriend: Audit Project Veritas Sues Founder James O'Keefe, Accusing Him of Wooing Donors for Rival Company In October, Project Veritas posted new “leaked texts” allegedly between two EDVA prosecutors, Michael Ben'Ary and Russell Carlberg, discussing their hatred of Trump. Ben'Ary became a target of Trump supporters after he slammed the DOJ for persecuting Trump's enemies, and was fired for allegedly refusing to participate in weaponized prosecutions days before Project Veritas shared the supposed text conversation. In both cases, the cell phone number appears above several of the sender's texts, normally only seen in group text conversations on iPhone. Bill Marczak, a senior research fellow at Citizen Lab who has served as an expert technology witness in cybersecurity criminal cases, says it's virtually impossible for iPhone messages to appear this way. “My suspicion is that the screenshots have been manipulated,” or created with an app, he says, having reviewed the screenshots shared by Project Veritas. Bolin also posted, and deleted, screenshots of threatening WhatsApp messages she claimed Carlberg sent her just one week before Project Veritas posted Carlberg's alleged texts with Ben-Ary. Four days after the EDVA “leak,” on Oct. 11, Project Veritas shared more leaked texts — and these were wilder than ever. “Project Veritas evidence sparks FBI raid & arrest of two illegal immigrants,” text imposed over screenshots of iPhone text messages and two mug shots read. The texts show improbably explicit planning of crimes — ”I think 6 explosives will be enough. I can't believe we're so close to wiping out those damn Jews” — as well as the same repeating phone number that appears in screenshots used for other Project Veritas stories featuring Bolin. Bolin even maintains a Google Drive with 31 folders and over a gigabyte of data tracking the couple's movements over the last several years that she shares on her social media. 🚨BREAKING NEWS: Following evidence uncovered by Project Veritas, the FBI and Florida police raided the hotel rooms of two illegal immigrants, Janaina Toledo (32) and Leonardo Corona Ramos (42), today. The Brazilian nationals, linked to Tren de Aragua, face charges of underage… pic.twitter.com/5QVKtnpU89 Israel National News wrote in an unbylined story: “The FBI and the Florida police revealed on Sunday that they recently arrested two men suspected of planning a serious attack against the Chabad House in Orlando, Florida, motivated by antisemitism. “The suspects are expected to be brought to trial before a federal court in Florida on serious charges, including conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack, membership in a foreign terrorist organization, and unlawful presence in the United States,” Israel National News wrote. Israel National News did not reply to emailed questions. A reporter on one bylined story, in Ynet, didn't answer messages from Rolling Stone asking if they had indeed gotten any information from federal authorities. “The two face charges including human trafficking, including trafficking children for sexual exploitation, and conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack against the Chabad in south Orlando,” they reported on Oct. 12. “Crazy this isn't a bigger story,” Fox News and New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz wrote. “It appears Project Veritas stopped a massive terrorist attack with their investigation. Incredible,” Robby Starbuck, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, wrote. Influencer posts amplifying the story received millions of views on X. This is a name you don't hear often on CNN, Project Veritas, of all places.” But a month after Project Veritas' initial post, it appears the couple are not actually being investigated for the serious crimes of planning a terror attack and sex trafficking minors. There is no evidence the FBI has commented on the allegations, no criminal charges have emerged, and Florida police would not confirm they were involved. A spokesperson for the Middle District of Florida U.S. attorney's office confirmed to Rolling Stone that the two Brazilians are in ICE custody being processed for removal and that there are no additional criminal investigations or indictments coming. After being briefly held on an immigration hold in Orlando jail, they were both moved to separate ICE detention facilities in Florida, with Ramos currently at Alligator Alcatraz, and Toledo in Arizona, according to Rolling Stone's monitoring of their detention on the ICE website. Messages from Ramos' mother and his attorney — who specializes in routine immigration issues, not criminal defense — viewed by Rolling Stone also indicate that the two were detained only on immigration charges, not criminal charges, and that they expect them to be deported to Brazil soon. Simply deporting alleged gang members suspected of a hate crime terror plot and underage sex trafficking, rather than criminally prosecuting them here in the U.S., is exceedingly unlikely, experts tell Rolling Stone. Georgia attorney Eli Bennett specializes in defending clients with both criminal and immigration status legal issues. “It would be pretty unheard of for the feds to just process someone for deportation if they suspected them of those serious crimes,” he says. “I'd also expect something to be on a public docket by this point, or for the FBI to make a big announcement showing off that they stopped this major crime from happening.” “If they ‘face charges of underage sex trafficking and planning a terrorist attack on Chabad South Orlando, a Jewish synagogue and school,' as Project Veritas claims, they would not be left in ICE custody,” he says. “Aside from the real risk ICE would deport them (one hand often not knowing what the other hand is doing), ICE custody is less secure in terms of them interacting with other conspirators in custody,” White adds. The notion that you'd leave a suspected terrorist hanging out in ICE custody on the chance you might pick them up later is absolutely not credible, even for this administration.” Toledo was also in contact with an FBI agent on Bolin's case earlier this year, sending him information about a Mexico City hotel where Toledo believed Bolin was hiding. But only several months later, Bolin, a wanted FBI fugitive, claimed that she herself was orchestrating an FBI raid of sex traffickers and would-be Chabad terror bombers. Project Veritas sent a statement to Rolling Stone: “Patricia Lelis Bolin is a whistleblower whom Project Veritas has published four individual reports with, exposing many public figures for alleged illegal activity. That is our relationship with Ms. Bolin.” In response to questions about the source of their claims regarding the terror plot, the group wrote that “a journalist never reveals their sources” and accused us of asking “unethical questions.” Bolin said in a written statement: “I am happy to know that you are following my case and keeping an eye on what the EDVA, Bill Barr, and Armstrong Williams has tried to do to me and my family. She added: “I hope you do better research on Janaina de Toledo and Leonardo Corona. I am not the only person for whom a judge granted a protective order because of the harassment they were carrying out. Any defamation or baseless accusation attempting to claim that I produced messages or that I am Veritas source will be subject to legal action.” It's unclear why Project Veritas would run stories featuring such a dubious source as Bolin, but the stories fit the group's pattern of publishing pieces targeting figures who oppose Trump. Project Veritas rose to prominence while headed by James O'Keefe for its hidden camera videos that claimed to catch liberals in instances of bias or wrongdoing. Benjamin Wetmore, the board director appointed soon after — who has his own connections to some of O'Keefe's most notorious stunts — remains in charge. Wetmore was previously an attorney for a Texas group run by an O'Keefe associate that employed similar hidden camera stunts in Texas. She says it's not surprising to see the group engage in deceptive and unethical practices: “Deception is their bread and butter, and there really isn't a line they won't cross when it comes to going after their ideological enemies. They often straddle the legal line, or stop short of illegality, but they've created fraudulent identities in the past and engaged in other unethical practices.” ‘Faith Is Under Attack': Nicki Minaj Spreads Misleading Information at the United Nations Elon Musk Fires Back After Billie Eilish Calls Him a ‘Coward' for Wealth Hoarding Ace Frehley's Custom 'Smoker' Guitar From His Last Kiss Tour Is Headed to Auction Hagle added that Project Veritas has experience “weaponizing media” and making mainstream media “take the bait,” by keeping a veneer of being a news outlet.“This recent example, in which it seems like they are reaching new lows, and being even more brazen than before, really shows how misinformation can spread so easily through bad actors,” she says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The remaining six celebrity contestants competing for the Mirrorball Trophy all wowed with their dances, and as always, Mark Ballas and Whitney Leavitt delivered incredible performances! They danced not one but two routines, and impressed the judges with both. This meant their total score on the night was 58 out of 60. Ballas is an incredible dancer and choreographer, and Leavitt is a talented dancer who has continued to progress throughout the competition. She has never delivered a weak or mediocre performance, and yet, it was Ballas and Leavitt who were eliminated at the end of the semifinals. Fans have a mix of feelings: outrage, disappointment, heartbreak, and, for some, this was the right move because the other contestants' characters appealed to them more. On posts of her dances, fans have flooded the comment section with their thoughts. Can't believe you guys sent her home. Best dancer on the show!” a comment reads. “Hey so you all robbed us of her talent in the finale,” another person shared. “I hope you bitter ladies are happy. We won't get to see the best dancer in the finale now,” a third fan wrote. Other reactions include, “This woman can dance, there is zero doubt about that. If we are purely speaking about dance skills, she's incredibly talented!! Also Mark always slays,” “She's the best female dancer idc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In another shock elimination, five couples now move onto the Nov. 25 season 34 finale, where a new winner of the show will be named. [This story contains spoilers from episode 10 of Dancing With the Stars season 34.] Tuesday night marked the semi-finals, where couples performed two competitive dances: one in a ballroom style they have already learned on the show and a second number in a dance style they have not yet performed. Each number will be set to a song by Prince. Donald Trump Calls for Pulling ABC License Over "Insubordinate" Epstein Files Question 'Monday Night Football' Livestream: When and Where to Watch Dallas Cowboys vs. Las Vegas Raiders Online for Free Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas were eliminated at the end of Prince Night. Heading into Tuesday's episode, social media star Alix Earle, Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles, The Traitors season three winner (and Zac Efron's brother) Dylan Efron, actress Elaine Hendrix, conservationist (and son of Steve Irwin) Robert Irwin and Secret Lives of Mormon Wives star Whitney rounded out the remaining cast, while Whitney exited the show at the end of the episode. The second round saw three couples given perfect marks, including Alix, Elaine and Jordan, with the latter two celebrities acquiring their first flawless scores ever. After both numbers were performed by each couple, Robert and Witney remained as the top-scoring pair of the night, with a combined 59 points. “Yes, I've gotten 10s in my career, but getting a perfect score is different. Elaine, who was called safe first out of all the couples on Prince Night, told THR she felt “so much shock, gratitude [and] excitement beyond belief” when it was announced she was moving onto the finale. She also reflected on her journey thus far, noting that she “knew [DWTS] was gonna be hard, but I did not know it was going to be just how hard it is.” “So to actually be here now [going into the finale,] just blows my mind that it's actually a reality,” Elaine added. Alix and Val also caught up with THR, where the pro dancer sung praise towards the social media star: “I've had a whole spectrum of emotions throughout my tenure on the show, and there have been times when I was pleasantly surprised, I will tell you, there's been plenty of times when I was unpleasantly surprised. And that's why I don't take anything for granted. Live voting takes place during the East Coast airing of each show and ends shortly after the final performance is completed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This self-contained tale about endings, deprivation, and subsistence without hope gestures toward rising sea levels and humanity's helplessness as the 21st Century unravels. It also happens to be the Mountain Goats' most gleefully arranged outing since Darnielle began the project as a solo artist in 1991. Pedal steel, woodwinds, and strings abound, thanks in part to the maximalist bent of multi-instrumentalist Matt Douglas, who plays foil to Darnielle's literary strain. This juxtaposition of instrumentation and lyrics is hardly ironic: The trio of seamen at Through This Fire's center are delirious from running on fumes as well as starvation and injury, and their song cycle—billed as Darnielle's too-macabre-for-Broadway “musical”—reaches for uplift. Lin-Manuel Miranda shows up to sing backing vocals on several tracks, which isn't such a stretch on an album with an orchestral opener called “Overture” followed by a number, “Fishing Boat” that sets the scene and the showtune tone: “Free as the wind on the ocean/Wild as the rain in the storm.” Miranda's contributions are so trifling that even Hamilton diehards might mistake him for just another Mountain Goat. Devastating, doomed couplets abound: “Nobody thought to carry a compass/It's not the 19th century anymore,” he quips; and later, “You were already talking when I woke up today/For a man on combat rations, you sure do find a lot to say.” Flute, clarinet, and French horn bring a disarming warmth, while percussionist Jon Wurster plays on many of the cuts as if caught in an endless drum fill, his heavy use of toms evoking another theatrical opus, Lou Reed's cracked 1973 masterpiece Berlin. We're made to think of how global warming-related disasters instantaneously transform hum-drum lives into mortal battles with nature. This conceit is weighty, sometimes profound, and also pat for a songwriter who has created towering dramas with more quotidian stakes —the aging of the counterculture, which he depicted with exceptional poignance on 2015's Goths, or the horror of living with an abusive stepfather, a theme that courses through 2005's classic The Sunset Tree. These works are sinuous, robust and thick with implication, while Through This Fire proceeds with event after event, and even as Darnielle's words cut to the quick, we feel as if his songcraft glides across the surface. Presumably in the waning minutes of his existence on earth, the adolescent speaker pictures his campsite discovered in years to come by “Men of old who sailed the seas.” The notion of a civilization destroying itself to rise again in a pre-industrial mode is crushingly resonant, but its exploration of the mysteries of existence feels too predetermined. Through This Fire seems confused about whether it wants to reach for miniaturist genius or ambitious sweep—the Mountain Goats managed to achieve both in the past. On occasion, Darnielle allows us to reach for our own connections, rather than setting them in our hands, wrapped in wisdom and a perfect sense of meter. “Everything that sinks will float,” he repeats in his relentless sing-song on “The Lady From Shanghai 2.” This statement envisions a poetic fate for the corpses of lost sailors, but it also resuscitates a memorable tidbit for fans: on the band's last record, 2023's Jenny From Thebes, the titular character, a woman devoted to protecting the threatened outcasts of West Texas, murders a ne'er-do-well landlord, stores his body in a water tower, and then sets him free, to “float downstream.” Death may be inevitable, but Darnielle casts out lifelines in his work, rescuing old motifs in order to refuse simple interpretations, tidy conclusions, and despair. And so his practice feels bottomless, while Through This Fire pushes ever forward as if its author had a destination in mind when he began the journey of writing. Such unswerving momentum is a mistake for which his immense skill can only partially compensate. The ocean, after all, is not just wide, it's deep.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ROSALÍA makes history with an unprecedented feat, as she becomes the first artist to secure five No. LUX, her fourth studio album, opens at No. Sabrina Carpenter 'Arrests' Elle & Dakota Fanning at L.A. Concert: 'One of You Is Cute, But Two Though?' NBA Star Kevin Durant Gives Wale His Flowers for 'Everything Is a Lot' Album: 'He's a Craftsman' Here's Why Steph Curry Compared Himself to Hayley Williams After Tying a Michael Jordan Record LUX opens with 46,000 equivalent album units earned in the United States on the tracking week ending Nov. 13, according to Luminate. 1 albums on the Top Latin Pop Albums chart previously through El Mal Querer (2018) and Motomami (24 weeks at No. 1 between 2022-23), LUX marks the Spaniard's first effort to reach No. Out of LUX's 46,000 total units in its opening week, streaming activity contributed 27,000 units, translating to 34.1 million on-demand official U.S. streams. Top Latin Albums' Best: ROSALÍA achieves her strongest performance yet on the Top Latin Albums chart as LUX debuts at No. This marks her best showing on the overall Latin albums ranking among three entries. Her 2018 album El Mal Querer peaked at No. First Spanish-Born Woman to Top Classical Albums & Classical Crossover Albums Charts in Modern Era: While the Classical Albums and Classical Crossover Albums charts have featured numerous core Latin and Spanish-born artists over the years, until now, a Spanish-born woman had never claimed the top spot on either chart in the modern era (since Luminate's electronically-tracked data began powering both charts in December 1993). Renowned Spain-born figures José Carreras and Plácido Domingo, and Venezuelan Gustavo Dudamel have all achieved No. 1s on the Classical Albums chart, with Carreras and Domingo also earning a No. With the arrival of LUX, ROSALÍA breaks new ground, becoming the first woman who is both Spanish-born and primarily a Latin recording artist, to achieve a No. 1 on both charts in the modern era. First Spanish-Speaking Solo Woman to Reach No. 1 on the World Albums Chart: Nine acts who speak and predominantly perform in Spanish have previously reached No. Among those, Cuban ensemble Buena Vista Social Club (1999, 2015), Spanish artist Manu Chao (2007), Mexican duo Rodrigo y Gabriela (2007, 2009, 2014), Puerto Rican artist Residente (2017), Mexican musician Santana (2019), Spanish group Gipsy Kings (1990, 1994-1997, 2001, 2004, 2013), Colombian Pedro Ramaya Beltrán (2017), and Peruvian artists Ricardo Delgado and Mario Mendoza (both in 2017).With her album LUX, Rosalía becomes the first-ever Spanish-speaking solo woman to claim the top spot on the 25-position World Albums ranking. Most Simultaneous Songs for a Latin Pop Act on Hot Latin Songs in Over a Year: ROSALÍA sets a new standard for Latin pop acts by placing 11 simultaneous songs on the Hot Latin Songs chart in 2025, which incorporates streaming data, radio airplay, and digital sales to rank songs. Prior, only one Latin pop artist had reached similar milestones in a single week: Kali Uchis, with 14 concurrent tracks in January 2024. 3, “La Perla,” with Yahritza y Su Esencia, leads the new tracks with 4.8 million official on-demand streams. Plus, “Reliquia” the album's second top 10 hit, debuts at No. 10 with 3.2 million official on-demand clicks during its opening week. With these two new top 10 entries, ROSALÍA captures her ninth top 10 on Hot Latin Songs. Here's a rundown of ROSALÍA's LUX tracks on the Hot Latin Songs chart (dated Nov. 22): 30, “La Rumba Del Perdón,” with Estrella Morente & Silvia Pérez-CruzNo. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
