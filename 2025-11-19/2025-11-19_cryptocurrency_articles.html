                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Wednesday, Avalanche activated a new blockchain upgrade called Granite, designed for faster and cheaper onchain transactions on the $6 billion chain. The upgrade focuses on improving how Avalanche handles varying transaction loads, from sporadic usage to peak activity. Granite should give Avalanche a newfound ability to “adjust throughput based on actual demand,” Bart Smith, CEO of Avalanche Treasury, told DL News. “When you're settling tokenised assets during market hours versus moving stablecoins overnight, validators respond to what's actually happening,” Smith said, while adding that such a level of responsiveness is necessary to bring Avalanche closer to how real financial infrastructure behaves. Measured from the 2022 peak, investor deposits into Avalanche DeFi are down almost 90%. Still, proponents say Granite can help unlock new market opportunities for Avalanche, mainly as it includes features that allow users to sign transactions with biometric data, rather than the usual wallet signing process, which can be difficult for less tech-savvy customers. “Biometric authentication is the sleeper here,” Smith told DL News. “Emerging markets with high smartphone penetration can build applications with native fingerprint and facial recognition, and that opens up use cases that have been theoretically possible but impractical to deploy.” Apart from dynamic response to user traffic and biometric authentication, Granite features one additional update: a new standard for communication across blockchains built on Avalanche. Avalanche chains, called subnets, communicate using interchain messaging. Instead, validators approve transfers across different chains. Before Granite, the validator set approving these transactions changed with each new Avalanche transaction block. With Granite, validator sets are frozen in place for short epochs that developers expect will improve transaction flow. Avalanche hosts more than $3.4 billion in tokenised assets, and has attracted interest from Wall Street Banks, including JPMorgan and Citi, that have developed private subnets on its blockchain. Onyx, JPMorgan's blockchain division, has tested tokenisation and portfolio management protocols on Avalanche. Osato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Hampshire's Business Finance Authority (BFA) has announced a municipal bond that provides firms with the ability to borrow against Bitcoin holdings. Worth $100 million, the new conduit bond is a first of its kind in the United States, and follows New Hampshire's passage of a strategic crypto reserve bill in May. BFA Executive Director James Key-Wallace told Crypto in America that fees from bond transactions would be directed to the Bitcoin Economic Development Fund, which has the aim of supporting businesses and economic innovation in New Hampshire. She said, “This is an innovative way to bring more investment opportunities to our state and position us as a leader in digital finance without risking state funds or taxpayer dollars.” Because the Business Finance Authority is self-funded, state legislator Keith Ammon has described the bond as a proof-of-concept for the use of Bitcoin as collateral in government finance, one which could potentially lead to a Bitcoin bond issued by a state treasury. Commentators outside of New Hampshire also recognize the bond's potential for not only catalyzing Bitcoin's growth, but widening its use and application. “If successful, and I expect it will be, it will help to legitimize bitcoin beyond its current role as, mainly, a speculative asset,” Trade Nation Senior Market Analyst David Morrison told Decrypt. More broadly, Morrison expects this type of funding to become more widespread, particularly as numerous U.S. states make moves to introduce their own strategic crypto reserves. Other industry figures agree, including CoinJar CEO Asher Tan, who tells Decrypt that New Hampshire's move highlights Bitcoin's potential as a store of value. “It could inspire other states to consider similar approaches,” he said. “As more governmental and institutional players explore crypto-backed financial products, the market will likely see a boost in legitimacy and investor confidence, further driving mainstream adoption.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Short-term leverage has been flushed out, spot volumes are thinner, and many traders now talk less about “when $150k” and more about how long this consolidation could last. Core fundamentals – Bitcoin's fixed supply, institutional ETF flows, and steady progress on scaling across major networks – remain largely intact. With fixed pricing and insulation from daily order-book chop, the utility-front presales have continued to pull in eight figures even as crypto blue chips cool. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) sits at the front of that pack, with its DeFi-capable Bitcoin Layer 2 presale passing the $28 million mark at a little over one cent per token – a combination of stable pricing and early-stage potential that many now see as one of the few bright spots in a tiring market. Global stocks have now logged a fourth consecutive red session, with major U.S., European, and Asian indices all sliding as investors rotate out of risk. The MSCI World Index is several percentage points off last week's peak, while benchmarks like the S&P 500, FTSE 100, Nikkei 225, and Kospi have all recorded sharp single-day drops. Taking that into account, Bitcoin's slide of roughly 28% from its highs into the low $90,000 area looks less like a crypto-only story and more like part of a broad de-risking phase. Macro conditions are doing most of the heavy lifting. A cautious Federal Reserve, ongoing quantitative tightening, and the recent U.S. government shutdown have all drained liquidity, souring appetite for speculative assets. Bitcoin ETFs have seen persistent outflows, while technical breaks have triggered waves of liquidations worth tens of billions of dollars across crypto blue chips and leveraged altcoin trades, turning an orderly pullback into a more violent reset. However, on-chain metrics and development activity remain solid, which is why many analysts still frame this as a high-volatility mid-cycle shakeout rather than a new crypto winter. In that environment, presales with fixed pricing and strong utility – such as Bitcoin Hyper's $28 million raise, making it one of 2025's largest token sales – are starting to look like a safer way to capture upside while markets clear out excess leverage. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is pitched as a purpose-built Bitcoin Layer 2 rather than just another meme token with a BTC logo next to it. The project uses a high-speed Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) execution layer combined with a canonical Bitcoin bridge and zero-knowledge proofs, allowing it to process transactions in seconds at a fraction of current BTC fees while settling back to Bitcoin for security. The roadmap sets out a phased rollout from presale to a full rollup ecosystem, with funding, development, and exchange listings all mapped to clear milestones rather than vague promises. As a result, the HYPER presale has raised over $28 million to date, ranking among the largest token sales of 2025, with staking currently offering a 41% APY for early participants. Several independent research pieces have started praising the HYPER presale, with Borch Crypto, a well-known crypto analyst and YouTube personality, outright describing it as the best presale of 2025 for investors who want Bitcoin exposure alongside the upside potential that only presales can offer. The HYPER presale is starting to look like one of the clearest ways to play a mid-cycle reset without taking exchange-order-book risk. That level of commitment removes a meaningful chunk of supply from post-launch circulation and signals that early participants are willing to tie up their capital in the project rather than chase the next spike elsewhere. In a market that has just flushed excess leverage, this kind of slow-build positioning matters: fixed presale pricing, staking rewards from day one, and a clear Bitcoin layer-2 use case give HYPER a cleaner risk–reward profile than many purely speculative launches.

That outperformance has been rare for what seems like months, with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies watching from the sidelines as major stock market averages made new record highs on a regular basis. Sadly for the bulls, though, normality has returned just 24 hours later, with bitcoin tumbling 4% back below $90,000 even as U.S. stocks manage gains. Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy (MSTR) fell over 8% to more than a one-year low, while stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL), ether treasury firm BitMine (BMNR), miners Bitfarms (BITF) and Hive Digital (HIVE) saw similar declines. After relentless downward pressure on prices since BTC's early October record, crypto investors remain deeply risk-averse. Steady outflows from ETFs have also added fuel to the selloff, Lunde said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Blockchain Stock will be a blockchain-native class of equity securities, trade on Figure's alternative trading system and will be convertible one-for-one into shares of Figure's Class A Common Stock, the company said in a press release. "This is a new capital markets infrastructure moment for efficiency and risk management — a huge leap forward from the legacy securities market infrastructure, and the start of a world that no longer needs it," said Mike Cagney, executive chairman and co-founder of Figure, in the release. Figure's blockchain structure aims to cut out third parties, improving efficiency, security and cost savings, representatives said. While many of the advantages are investor-focused, the infrastructure also provides benefits for issuers who want to engage more with individual investors, as they can use a listing to further market their company, CEO Micahel Tannenbaum said on the call. The blockchain nature of the security also allows for broader access to investors who struggle with a traditional brokerage account. "You look at [BlackRock CEO] Larry Fink, for example, he talks repeatedly about the tokenization of everything ... We expect the buy side is going to play an important role here in driving this because of how much utility it accrues back to the investor." Figure is currently selling issuers on the idea of the blockchain, but doesn't expect to see material results this quarter. Figure also does not expect it to go live until next year. Figure went public in September, opening at $36 per share. It hit a high of $49.17 in October, but stumbled on Tuesday, falling 7.22% to $39.19. "It is a very ambitious undertaking," Tannenbaum said on the call. "It's hard to do new things, but there's valor and economics in doing so." Stephen Miran argues that banks holding excess reserves are keeping the central bank's balance sheet bigger than it should be, and suggested that regulatory changes could help bring those reserves down. Equities move through a stack of intermediaries, from custodians and clearing firms to brokers. Figure's blockchain structure aims to cut out third parties. While Redfin argues the housing market is stuck and First American was cautious, Remax and Zillow had positive observations about the month's sales activity. His selection allows acting CFPB Director Russell Vought to remain in place for another 210 days.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media & Technology Group, the crypto and social media company controlled by members of the first family, has seen its stock price plummet to all-time lows — wiping out more than $5 billion in wealth for the Trumps as cryptocurrencies continue their slide. Shares of Trump Media, which trades under the ticker DJT, have fallen nearly 70% this year — 34.6% of that just the past month, according to Barron's. President Trump indirectly owns around 115 million shares of the company, Barron's reported. The family's holdings, which were worth nearly $6.5 billion at their peak in mid-May 2024, have lost more than $5.3 billion in value since then, according to Barron's. Cryptocurrencies have taken a big hit since Trump Media said in August it bought $2 billion worth of Bitcoin. Traders have been backing off risky assets amid diminishing hopes for an interest-rate cut next month. Trump Media didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump created Truth Social and its parent company Trump Media & Technology Group, or TMTG, after he was banned from Twitter and Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. After TMTG and a blank-check firm called Digital World Acquisition Corp. announced in 2021 they would be merging, the stock traded as high as $100 in 2022, Barron's reported. While the stock has cratered, the Trump family's personal crypto ventures have been raking in hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a Reuters report published last month. He has also ordered the Treasury Department not to sell tokens seized in enforcement actions, exploring ways for the US to acquire more. “Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French banking giant partners with DRW and Broadridge to launch tokenized debt Societe Generale has made its US debut in blockchain-based finance with the issuance of its first digital bond in the world's largest economy in a move that could reshape how American capital markets handle debt. The short-term floating rate bond, linked to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), was purchased by trading firm DRW and issued via Societe Generale's digital asset subsidiary, SG-FORGE. Broadridge Financial Solutions, headquartered in New York, provided the tokenization platform, while IntellectEU's Catalyst Blockchain Manager enabled node operations across the network's decentralized infrastructure. This issuance is the first to use Broadridge's new tokenization platform, which aims to improve transparency, settlement speed, and asset traceability, and expands the company's tokenization efforts beyond US Treasuries into broader asset classes. BNY Mellon will serve as the paying agent, and Mayer Brown acted as legal counsel, further anchoring the transaction in US financial infrastructure. DRW's Chris Zuehlke added that tokenization could unlock “efficiency, transparency, and broader access”  across financial markets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a big step forward in bringing digital assets into traditional finance. This historic judgment will let borrowers use overcollateralized Bitcoin to get money, which will test the limits of how state-level public finance may use modern technologies. Minutes from a recent BFA meeting show that everyone agreed to let WaveRose Depositor, LLC issue a taxable conduit revenue bond for up to $100 million. Wave Digital Assets, an asset manager, and Rosemawr Management, a bond expert, designed the bond so that Bitcoin could be used as collateral. BitGo is said to be in charge of keeping the Bitcoin safe. Companies can get money by posting about 160% of the bond's value in Bitcoin as collateral under this structure. If the value of Bitcoin as collateral falls below around 130% of the bond's principal, a required liquidation will happen to protect bondholders. The bond follows recognised criteria for municipal and corporate governance, making sure that everything is clear legally and operationally when it comes to protecting investors and following the law. Les Borsai, who helped start Wave Digital Assets, said that this project shows how the public and commercial sectors can work together to make digital reserves more valuable. The bond is meant to attract institutional investors by combining the safety and accountability of municipal finance with the opportunity for innovation and profits that come with digital assets. The transaction fees from this bond will go toward New Hampshire's local innovation and entrepreneurship program, which includes the Bitcoin Economic Development Fund. This happened after a bill was signed that allowed public funds to invest in digital assets and precious metals. There is also a bill in the works to make it easier for people to mine cryptocurrencies at home. This is part of a continuing drive to attract firms and investors interested in cryptocurrencies. The local government's open-mindedness toward digital currency has helped make New Hampshire a good place for crypto businesses to set up shop. State officials have been trying to use Bitcoin in government transactions since 2015, even if past attempts to do so through legislation have failed. The state's new approach, which emphasises stringent collateral requirements and tight controls, could serve as a blueprint for future financial products that combine the digital and traditional economies.</p>

This article is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute investment advice. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to $90,000 on Tuesday, stirring concern that more downside may be ahead – except for Standard Chartered head of digital asset research Geoffrey Kendrick, and for investors increasingly turning to Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), the fastest Layer-2 built on Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hyper's ICO has now surpassed $28 million, signaling growing confidence in the project as BTC trades sideways. The funding provides a solid foundation for development that many believe could reignite Bitcoin's momentum heading into year-end or early next year, with some analysts eyeing $200,000 as a realistic upside target. Of course, Bitcoin will need a fresh catalyst to reach those levels, and utility demand is the catalyst many investors believe is missing. According to Kendrick, several key valuation and sentiment indicators have now reset to levels historically associated with market bottoms, including Strategy's modified NAV, which is a measure comparing the value of its publicly traded shares to the value of the Bitcoin it holds. He noted that other metrics have “collapsed to absolute zero,” signaling seller exhaustion and capitulation. On-chain data reflects a similar trend, with short-term holder losses slowing and traditional bottoming signals emerging. Another widely followed analyst on X, known as Top Gainer Today, shares a similar long-term perspective. He believes Bitcoin could eventually reach the same aggressive price targets proposed by figures like Fundstrat's Tom Lee and BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes (around $200,000), though he sees this timeline stretching into the first quarter of 2026. $BTC now sideline few days like previous pump ✅$Bitcoin retest done in accumulation zone $Bitcoin now be preparing for $150k – $200k Q1 2026$TROLL is my big conviction 💰💰💰 https://t.co/ycpVDeMUP2 pic.twitter.com/iFGeLPDBEA But as mentioned, Bitcoin will need a fresh catalyst to make those targets realistic, something the asset has never truly had before. Bitcoin Hyper, with the utility-driven demand it aims to create for BTC, could be positioning itself as the missing catalyst analysts have been waiting for. In this environment, BTC can move freely across decentralized applications, which is something the Bitcoin network has never supported natively. This system works through Bitcoin Hyper's canonical bridge, where BTC is locked on the main chain and re-minted inside the Layer-2 as a wrapped asset capable of moving fluidly across SVM-powered apps. If this ecosystem gains traction – and it has strong potential to do so – it will be because developers can utilize familiar Solana tooling, making onboarding simple and fast. That ease of development could open the door for a surge in DeFi, gaming, and even real-world applications powered directly by BTC. As the utility of BTC expands, demand for HYPER scales with it, creating a dual-engine model that early adopters are already betting big on. It also stems from the belief that Bitcoin Hyper represents the next major bet linked to Bitcoin's growth cycle – a rare opportunity to capture upside that many feel they missed with BTC itself. Cryptonews analyst Alan Draper predicts that HYPER will reach $0.0583 in 2025, assuming it launches within the next few weeks – a 338.6% increase from its current presale level. For 2026, as BTC is expected to climb toward more ambitious price targets as projected by Top Gainer Today, Draper estimates a potential increase of 1,071% from today's price. Some are even more bullish, like popular influencer Crypto Blockspot, who believes HYPER could climb as high as 1,000x, arguing that its major tie to BTC utility could unlock massive upside once the ecosystem goes live. Of course, these are predictions, and presale participants should always do their own research and evaluate whether the project aligns with their strategy. To get HYPER, head to the Bitcoin Hyper presale website and buy using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card. Bitcoin Hyper recommends Best Wallet – one of the best crypto and Bitcoin wallets – where HYPER is listed under its Upcoming Tokens section, making it simple to buy, track, and claim once live.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CHICAGO - A federal grand jury indicted the founder of a Chicago cryptocurrency company accused of operating an illegal $10 million money laundering scheme. Firas Isa, 36, was accused of conspiring to launder proceeds from wire fraud and narcotics offenses through his business, Virtual Assets LLC, which operated as Crypto Dispensers. The company ran cash-to-cryptocurrency exchanges and a network of crypto ATMs nationwide, allowing users to convert cash into digital currency. According to the indictment unsealed in the Northern District of Illinois, people sent more than $10 million to Crypto Dispensers, Isa or a co-conspirator. Isa and Virtual Assets LLC were each charged with one count of money laundering conspiracy, a felony that could be punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison. A status hearing was scheduled for Jan. 30, 2026 in U.S. District court. Tap here to read the full indictment. All the morning news in under five minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New on-chain data from Santiment suggests that the latest wave of selling across Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP looks less like the start of a new collapse and more like a fatigue event from smaller market participants. It is not about big funds unloading in the background, as the pressure now comes from short-term holders and retail wallets that finally stopped trying to sit through another leg down. According to Santment's recent data, wallets holding less than 0.01 BTC reduced their balances by about 0.36% over the past five days, while sub-0.1 ETH wallets cut roughly 0.9% in a month, and XRP wallets with under 100 coins offloaded 1.38% since the beginning of November. This thesis is backed by CryptoQuant's numbers too, with around 65,200 BTC being sent to exchanges in unrealized loss over a single day, a volume worth close to $6 billion at current prices. This indicator does not track completed trades, but it shows how much Bitcoin short-term holders move onto exchanges while still underwater. In practice, such spikes usually mean that part of this supply is already sold, while the rest is waiting in line on the order books. If that source does not appear, the price often stabilizes and then recovers simply because the most impatient cohort has already exited. From that angle, the current mix of heavy STH transfers and synchronized retail selling across XRP, Bitcoin and Ethereum can be read as an early sign that the sell side is running out of energy rather than gaining it.

Advocates argue the ARC token will lower India's borrowing costs, strengthen the rupee and stem outflows to dollar-backed cryptocurrencies

Proponents argue that the Asset Reserve Certificate (ARC) could hasten the global drive towards de-dollarisation, lower India's borrowing costs and create a “virtuous cycle” for public funding by diversifying the country's investor base.

Every unit of the regulated digital token would be backed one-to-one by Indian government securities or treasury bills – debt instruments issued by the state to finance public spending – maintaining a steady value pegged to the rupee while operating on private blockchain infrastructure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Internet services provider Cloudflare says that a fault in its bot detection system triggered an outage that took down around 20% of webpages, including several crypto platforms.Cloudflare said in a post-mortem statement on Tuesday that a “feature file” used by its Bot Management System to fight off cyberattacks grew beyond its normal limit, leading to a failure in Cloudflare's software. The company initially suspected the incident was caused by a hyper-scale Distributed Denial of Service attack, but confirmed there was no cyberattack or malicious activity. Its outage took out the websites for Coinbase, Blockchain.com, Ledger, BitMEX, Toncoin, Arbiscan, and DefiLlama, as well as X and ChatGPT, leading some crypto commentators to remark on the crypto industry's reliance on centralized systems, some of which also went offline when Amazon Web Services suffered a network outage last month. “A complete decentralized web stack is needed more than ever,” the company said. Related: Building the ‘personalized' internet: Interview with XBorg CEO Last Wednesday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin authored a “Trustless Manifesto,” which called on industry builders to never sacrifice decentralization in pursuit of adoption. Buterin and Ethereum Foundation researchers Yoav Weiss and Marissa Posner, said crypto platforms sacrifice trustlessness from the moment that they integrate a hosted node or centralized relayer, explaining that while it feels harmless, each new checkpoint becomes a potential chokepoint.
