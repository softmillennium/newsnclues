                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Parents may have more influence than they realize when it comes to shaping their children's behavior, especially for those at higher genetic risk for conduct problems, according to Rutgers Health-led research. The study, published in Frontiers in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, found that consistent parental monitoring – meaning knowing where children are, who they're with, and what they're doing – can help offset genetic risk for developing behavior problems during adolescence. Conduct problems, which include aggression, antisocial behavior and rule-breaking, often begin in childhood and are among the most common reasons youth are referred for mental health services. These behaviors are linked to long-term challenges such as substance use, school difficulties and justice system involvement. While genetics contribute to why some children are more likely to develop conduct problems, this study shows that parenting really matters. High levels of parental monitoring appeared to buffer the influence of genetic risk – meaning that attentive, consistent parenting can make a measurable difference, even for children who are more vulnerable biologically." Maia Choi, postdoctoral fellow at the Translational Psychiatric Genomics Lab, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and lead author of the study Researchers examined how genetic predispositions for behavioral disinhibition – tendencies toward impulsivity and rule-breaking – interacted with parental monitoring to predict conduct problems. Researchers found adolescents with higher genetic risk for externalizing behaviors showed more conduct problems only when parental monitoring was low. When monitoring was high, genetic risk had a much smaller impact on behavior. The environment parents create – the structure, consistency and connection they provide – can play a powerful role in protecting youth at risk." The findings build on decades of work showing that family and environmental factors interact with genetics to shape child development. As noted in the scientific literature, only a small number of studies have tested polygenic score effects during early adolescence, making this analysis a notable contribution. "Adolescence is a critical window for intervention," said Choi. "By supporting parents and helping them stay engaged, we can change trajectories for young people who might otherwise struggle." The study was co-authored by Rutgers researchers Genevieve Dash, Sally Kuo, Fazil Aliev, Holly Poore and Sarah Brislin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jennifer Munson, a cancer researcher at Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC, has been awarded two new National Institutes of Health grants to advance greater understanding and improved treatment of a deadly brain cancer. Munson and her team are identifying how liquid called interstitial fluid moves between cells and possibly contributes to the spread of tumor cells into neighboring brain areas, allowing the cancer to return and spread after treatment with surgery or radiation. One of the grants, a five-year, $2.6 million award, aims to study how fluid flow changes with treatment, and how focused ultrasound can be leveraged to better target and distribute therapy. The other grant, a two-year, $411,000 award, supports a project to build a novel model of fluid-filled spaces that surround vessels in the brain and how they behave in health and during cancer treatment. With the two-year grant, Munson is teaming up with Malisa Sarntinoranont, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Florida. The study will employ advanced MRI techniques to generate dynamic imaging of fluid flow in healthy brains and preclinical models with tumors. With the other grant, Munson proposes to leverage interstitial fluid flow in a novel way, to target, assess, and plan individual patient-specific glioblastoma treatment. Munson's lab has previously developed imaging and analysis methods that predict where a tumor is likely to reappear after treatment. Cheng-Chia "Fred" Wu, a radiation oncologist and cancer researcher at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, is using focus ultrasound to transiently open the blood brain barrier, which can keep cancer drugs from reaching tumors. The labs will use mapping to identify the best focused ultrasound targets and work with Associate Professor Eli Vlaisavljevich and Research Associate Professor Adam Maxwell of Virginia Tech's Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics to develop a more precise focused ultrasound system. The study also aims to determine how fluid flow is affected by different therapies. It could serve as a biomarker for therapeutic efficacy. In addition, the researchers will work with Russell Rockne, associate professor at the City of Hope comprehensive cancer care center in California, to develop mathematical models to predict tumor progression and drug distribution in light of changes. "This coupling of precision identification with precision equipment is a major translational leap for our research," said Munson, who also is director of the FBRI's Cancer Research Center - Roanoke. Munson also holds an appointment in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics in Virginia Tech's College of Engineering.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An AI tool that can analyze abnormalities in the shape and form of blood cells, and with greater accuracy and reliability than human experts, could change the way conditions such as leukemia are diagnosed. Researchers have created a system called CytoDiffusion that uses generative AI – the same type of technology behind image generators such as DALL-E – to study the shape and structure of blood cells. Unlike many AI models, which are trained to simply recognize patterns, the researchers – led by the University of Cambridge, University College London and Queen Mary University of London – showed that CytoDiffusion could accurately identify a wide range of normal blood cell appearances and spot unusual or rare cells that may indicate disease. Their results are reported in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence. But the task requires years of training, and even then, different doctors can disagree on difficult cases. White blood cells specialise in fighting infection, for example. But knowing what an unusual or diseased blood cell looks like under a microscope is an important part of diagnosing many diseases." Simon Deltadahl from Cambridge's Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, study's first author However, a typical blood 'smear' contains thousands of cells – far more than any human could analyse. "Humans can't look at all the cells in a smear – it's just not possible," said Deltadahl. "Our model can automate that process, triage the routine cases, and highlight anything unusual for human review." "The clinical challenge I faced as a junior haematology doctor was that after a day of work, I would face a lot of blood films to analyse," said co-senior author Dr Suthesh Sivapalaratnam from Queen Mary University of London. "As I was analysing them in the late hours, I became convinced AI would do a better job than me." To develop CytoDiffusion, the researchers trained the system on over half a million images of blood smears collected at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. The dataset – the largest of its kind – included both common blood cell types and rarer examples, as well as elements that can confuse automated systems. By modelling the full distribution of cell appearances rather than just learning to separate categories, the AI became more robust to differences between hospitals, microscopes and staining methods, and better able to recognise rare or abnormal cells. In tests, CytoDiffusion could detect abnormal cells linked to leukemia with far greater sensitivity than existing systems. It also matched or surpassed current state-of-the-art models, even when given far few training examples; and quantify its own uncertainty. "When we tested its accuracy, the system was slightly better than humans," said Deltadahl. "We evaluated our method against many of the challenges seen in real-world AI, such as never-before-seen images, images captured by different machines and the degree of uncertainty in the labels," said co-senior author Professor Michael Roberts, also from Cambridge's Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. "This framework gives a multi-faceted view of model performance which we believe will be beneficial to researchers." The team also showed that CytoDiffusion could generate synthetic blood cell images indistinguishable from real ones. In a 'Turing test' with ten experienced hematologists, the human experts were no better than chance at telling real from AI-generated images. "These are people who stare at blood cells all day, and even they couldn't tell." Instead, it is designed to support them by rapidly flagging abnormal cases for review and handling more routine ones automatically. "The true value of healthcare AI lies not in approximating human expertise at lower cost, but in enabling greater diagnostic, prognostic, and prescriptive power than either experts or simple statistical models can achieve," said co-senior author Professor Parashkev Nachev from UCL. "Our work suggests that generative AI will be central to this mission, transforming not only the fidelity of clinical support systems but their insight into the limits of their own knowledge. This 'metacognitive' awareness – knowing what one does not know – is critical to clinical decision-making, and here we show machines may be better at it than we are."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing challenges to global public health as harmful microbes evolve to evade these medications. Now, researchers at University of California San Diego and their colleagues have developed a new method to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria using bacteriophages, or phages, for short - viruses that infect and kill bacteria - as an alternative to traditional antibiotics. The researchers targeted Klebsiella pneumoniae, a species of bacteria notorious for its ability to resist multiple antibiotics. The dangerous pathogen can cause severe infections in hospital settings, including pneumonia and sepsis. While phages have been used as a treatment for bacterial infections for over a century, they are extremely specific about which strains of a bacterial species they will attack. This has limited their effectiveness against the most antibiotic-resistant strains. This resulted in significant improvements to their ability to kill a wide variety of bacterial strains, including multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant K. pneumoniae - strains that pose a significant challenge to modern medicine. What's more, the evolved phages also demonstrated an enhanced ability to suppress bacterial growth over extended periods of time. These changes likely contributed to their improved effectiveness. The research, led by senior author David T. Pride, M.D., Ph.D., professor of pathology at UC San Diego School of Medicine, highlights the potential of phage therapy as a powerful tool to address the global antibiotic resistance crisis. The team believes their method could be adapted to target other resistant pathogens, offering an avenue for developing treatments against a wide range of life-threatening infections. The study was published in Nature Communications on November 19, 2025. Experimental phage evolution results in expanded host ranges against antibiotic resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates.

All patients with multiple myeloma who started their treatment from 2006 to 2024 at Berenson Cancer Center, a clinic that specializes in the treatment of patients with this common form of bone marrow-based cancer, were included in the study. Study authors report an average survival of nearly 13 years which is the longest reported to date in any unselected group of multiple myeloma patients. Unlike other myeloma centers which consider stem cell transplant as a standard part of the initial therapy for these patients, none of the patients underwent this as their first treatment and only one patient after that. Moreover, no patient was treated with CAR T-cell therapy or bispecific antibodies. Patients also have 24-hour direct access to the treating physician. Importantly, more frequent regular monitoring of the patient's disease status allows for more rapid changes in treatments that are not working or causing unwanted side effects. Together, these benefits have resulted in unprecedented outcomes for myeloma patients." Dr. Berenson has over 40 years of "hands-on" experience taking care of multiple myeloma patients which he believes has led to the identification of more effective treatments and expertise in using therapies to achieve the best possible outcomes for his patients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new scientific review reveals the molecular networks underlying coffee's most potent compounds, demonstrating how this everyday drink may reduce disease risks through its coordinated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Study: Transforming coffee from an empirical beverage to a targeted nutritional intervention: health effects of coffee's core functional components on chronic diseases. The results are published in Frontiers of Nutrition. Scientists have traced the use of coffee back to 15th-century Yemeni Sufi monasteries, and highlight its relevance within the concept of “food–medicine homology,” where foods possess both nutritional and medicinal functions. The global coffee industry continues to exhibit robust growth, with annual coffee bean production exceeding 10 million metric tons. Arabica accounts for approximately 70% of the global market share, primarily because of its low bitterness and complex aromatic profile. Multiple studies have described coffee as a chemically complex beverage rich in bioactive compounds. Raw (unroasted) coffee beans mainly contain carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. It also includes a minimal quantity of nitrogenous compounds, minerals, and acid-ester substances. The process of roasting coffee beans also produces several compounds, such as melanoidins, driven by Maillard reactions and pyrolysis. For instance, the content of carbohydrates and nitrogenous compounds decreases, while the lipid content increases after roasting. Notably, melanoidins formed during roasting may constitute up to one-quarter of the roasted bean mass, reflecting extensive chemical transformation. Scientists have broadly classified the bioactive compounds of coffee into four major categories, namely, alkaloids (e.g., caffeine, trigonelline), polyphenols (e.g., chlorogenic acids), diterpenes (e.g., cafestol), and Maillard reaction products (melanoidins). These compounds interact through synergistic and antagonistic mechanisms, forming multidimensional regulatory networks that lead to diverse health benefits. It is emphasized that understanding these network-level interactions is essential, as focusing on isolated compounds does not accurately reflect how coffee behaves under real consumption conditions. Caffeine, a methylxanthine derivative, is a highly stable alkaloid that is primarily metabolized in the liver through P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). This alkaloid primarily derives its physiological functions from competitive antagonism of adenosine A1/A2A receptors and specific inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4/5 (PDE4/5) activity. Molecular studies have demonstrated caffeine's neuroprotective role. It acts as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, potentially enhancing cognitive function and reducing the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) through antagonism of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR). However, increased caffeine intake may increase sleep disturbances and anxiety. Multiple studies have demonstrated the anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-obesity, and anti-diabetic effects of caffeine. The review also cites human cohort evidence showing that caffeinated coffee, rather than decaffeinated coffee, is strongly associated with a reduced risk of neurodegenerative disease. Several in vitro studies, animal models, and molecular docking analyses have demonstrated the potential of trigonelline for neurodegenerative disorders, including AD, PD, and depression, through mechanisms that include oxidative stress mitigation, acetylcholine inhibition, and neuroinflammatory suppression. These polyphenols are key contributors to coffee's antioxidant and metabolic regulatory properties. Mechanistically, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA), an abundantly found CGA, activates the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway to suppress oxidative stress and inhibits α-glucosidase to modulate postprandial glycemia. A typical coffee serving contains approximately 27 to 121mg of CGAs. These bioactive compounds are associated with glycemic regulation, anti-inflammatory actions, and neuroprotection. Their physiological effects largely depend on the brewing methods. For instance, paper-filtered techniques remove a significant amount of diterpenoids, whereas unfiltered brewing techniques, such as the French press, retain the full content. It triggers an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, potentially elevating the risk of cardiovascular disease, and induces glutathione S-transferase (GST) for anticancer activity. Diterpenes also exhibit hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. During coffee roasting, the Maillard reaction produces a complex array of compounds, including melanoidins. These compounds exhibit furan and pyrrole ring-enriched molecular structures, responsible for their metal ion chelation capacity and lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity. However, the Maillard reaction also leads to the production of harmful compounds, such as acrylamide, a Group 2A carcinogen. Higher acrylamide concentration has been found in dark-roasted coffee, which exhibits neurotoxic and carcinogenic effects. Although acrylamide levels can be measurable, typical dietary exposure from coffee remains below most regulatory concern thresholds. Coffee contains a variety of chemical compounds that work together, oppose each other, or act in sequence to affect multiple molecular targets. Through these interactions, coffee helps regulate oxidative stress, inflammation, metabolism, and neuroprotection. Extensive epidemiological evidence links moderate coffee consumption with lower risks of type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cardiovascular disorders. Current pharmacological research on coffee is often fragmented, focusing on isolated components and overlooking interactions among multiple compounds. This results in three major research limitations: an overemphasis on isolated compounds rather than multicomponent synergy, a limited investigation of minor bioactive constituents, and an overreliance on in vitro or rodent models that lack human translational validation. By mapping the target networks of CGAs, caffeine, and related compounds, researchers will be able to clarify the biological basis of coffee's multi-target regulation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent study in Finland found that among people aged at least 70 years with rosacea, fewer than 10% were diagnosed before enrollment. Because of rosacea's burden and its association with potentially serious comorbidities in this age group, the authors said, older patients would benefit from increased awareness of rosacea among providers and better access to dermatologic care. For the retrospective cross-sectional study, Laura Huilaja, MD, PhD, and Suvi-Päivikki Sinikumpu, MD, PhD, of the University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland, invited local parents of participants in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 to undergo a skin examination performed by a dermatologist and to complete a health-related questionnaire. Investigators also searched participants' electronic health records for any rosacea diagnosis between 1996 and 2018. Additional reasons may have included time constraints in primary care, limited rosacea awareness among such providers, and patients' unwillingness to seek treatment due to the stigma of rosacea, the authors surmised. Recognizing rosacea in older patients is important, the investigators wrote, because its prevalence rises with age, peaking in men after 70 years, and the risks of strongly associated comorbidities such as Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular and gastric diseases, metabolic syndrome, depression, and anxiety also increase with age. Jonathan S. Weiss, MD, said that study findings closely mirrored what he sees among older patients in his practice. “And there's not a ton you can do medically for erythematotelangiectatic rosacea,” he told Medscape Medical News. Patients hear about rosacea treatments, he explained, “and they don't realize that there are not simple medical treatments for erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, though there are procedural therapies. And papulopustular rosacea responds very well to various tetracycline formulations, particularly doxycycline, added Weiss. American physicians also can consider new low-dose, time-release oral minocycline (Emrosi), Weiss added, although patients are often surprised to learn that branded drugs are difficult to get covered by Medicare. The same can be true for extended-release doxycycline (Oracea), he told Medscape Medical News, although less so because generic alternatives exist. Additionally, Medicare rules exclude devices such as lasers and electrocautery, which he said are among the few effective treatments for telangiectasias, as medically unnecessary. Many older patients — especially those with skin of color — may have less access to dermatologists, Weiss pointed out. The study will have little impact on dermatology, he added, except perhaps to remind dermatologists to exercise caution regarding drug-drug interactions in older patients. Non-dermatologists should be aware that rosacea can arise without a prior history in older patients, said Weiss. Raising awareness of this possibility among general internists and family practitioners assumes increased importance, he noted, because rosacea also can affect the eyes, with a potentially serious impact on vision. Therefore, he recommended that primary care providers always ask patients with skin symptoms of rosacea about ocular manifestations such as dry eye and treat ocular symptoms if present. Improvements in diagnostic protocols and better access to dermatologists, they added, “could help reduce the degree of underdiagnosis and, thereby, could ease the burden of rosacea among older people.” Weiss reported being a researcher, consultant, and/or speaker for AbbVie; Arcutis Biotherapeutics; Aslan; Bausch; Biofrontera AG; Bristol Myers Squibb; Cutera, Inc.; Dermavant/Organon; Galderma; Incyte; LEO Pharma; Novartis; Ortho; Pfizer; Regeneron; Sanofi; Sun Pharma; UCB; and Verrica Pharmaceuticals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The increase of UPFs in diets worldwide presents an urgent challenge to health that demands coordinated policies and advocacy action to address, says a new three paper Series authored by 43 global experts and published in The Lancet. This change in what people eat is fuelled by powerful global corporations who generate huge profits by prioritizing ultra-processed products, supported by extensive marketing and political lobbying to stop effective public health policies to support healthy eating." Professor Camila Corvalan, University of Chile, Chile, adds, "Addressing this challenge requires governments to step up and introduce bold, coordinated policy action - from including markers of UPFs in front-of-package labels to restricting marketing and implementing taxes on these products to fund greater access to affordable, nutritious foods." Dr Phillip Baker, University of Sydney, Australia, adds, "We need a strong global public health response - like the coordinated efforts to challenge the tobacco industry. UPFs, as defined by the Nova classification, are novel branded products made from inexpensive industrial ingredients such as hydrogenated oils, protein isolates or glucose/fructose syrup, and cosmetic food additives (e.g. dyes, artificial sweeteners, emulsifiers). The Series presents consistent evidence that UPFs are displacing long-established dietary patterns, worsening diet quality, and are associated with an increased risk of multiple chronic diet-related diseases. Several national surveys indicate the share of UPFs in diets is on the rise (paper 1, figure 1): estimated energy contribution of UPFs to total household food purchases or daily food intake tripled in Spain (11% to 32%) and China (4% to 10%) over the last three decades, and increased (10% to 23%) in Mexico and Brazil over the previous four decades. Additionally, a systematic review conducted for the Series, encompassing 104 long-term studies, found 92 reported greater associated risks of one or more chronic diseases, with meta-analyses showing significant associations for 12 health conditions, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and early death from all causes. However, they argue future research must not delay immediate and decisive public health action justified by the current evidence. Professor Mathilde Touvier, French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm), France, says, "While healthy debate about UPFs within the scientific community is welcomed, this should be distinguished from attempts by vested interests to undermine the current evidence. The growing body of research suggests diets high in ultra-processed foods are harming health globally and justifies the need for policy action." The second paper in the Series outlines coordinated policies to regulate and reduce UPF production, marketing, and consumption, to hold large companies accountable for their role in promoting unhealthy diets. The paper sets out how improving diets worldwide requires specific UPF policies to complement existing legislation to reduce high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) content in foods. Professor Barry Popkin, University of North Carolina, US, says "We call for including ingredients that are markers of UPFs (eg, colours, flavours, and sweeteners) in front-of-package labels, alongside excessive saturated fat, sugar, and salt, to prevent unhealthy ingredient substitutions, and enable more effective regulation." The authors propose stronger marketing restrictions - especially for adverts directed at children, on digital media, and at the brand level - as well as banning UPFs in public institutions such as schools and hospitals and placing limits on UPFs sales and shelve space in supermarkets. One success story is Brazil's national school feeding program which has eliminated most UPFs and will require 90% of the food to be fresh or minimally processed food by 2026. Authors emphasize that alongside regulating UPFs, policies must expand access to fresh foods. This could be achieved by taxing selected UPFs to fund fresh food subsidies for low-income households. Professor Marion Nestle, New York University, US, says, "Improving diets worldwide requires policies tailored to each country's unique situation and how entrenched UPFs have become in people's daily eating habits. While priorities may differ, urgent action is needed everywhere to regulate ultra-processed foods alongside existing efforts to reduce high fat, salt, and sugar content". Associate Professor Gyorgy Scrinis, University of Melbourne, Australia, adds, "Importantly, policies must ensure that fresh and minimally processed foods are accessible and affordable - not just for those with time to cook, but for busy families and individuals who rely on convenient options. Only by combining stricter regulation on poor quality food products with realistic support for more nutritious choices can we truly promote better diets for all." The third paper in the Series explains how global corporations, not individual choices, are driving the rise of UPFs, and that a global health response to this challenge is urgent and feasible. Authors highlight how UPF companies use cheap ingredients and industrial methods to cut costs, paired with aggressive marketing and appealing designs to boost consumption. With global annual sales of $1.9 trillion, UPFs are the most profitable food sector. UPF manufacturers alone account for over half of $2.9 trillion in shareholder payouts by all publicly listed food companies since 1962. These profits fuel growing corporate power in food systems, by resourcing UPF companies to expand production, marketing, and political influence, thereby reshaping diets worldwide. The Series reveals how UPF companies employ sophisticated political tactics to protect profits - blocking regulations, shaping scientific debates, and influencing public opinion. They coordinate hundreds of interest groups worldwide, lobby politicians, make political donations and engage in litigation to delay policies. Through interest groups, these corporations often position themselves as part of the solution, but their actions tell a different story – one focused on protecting profits and resisting effective regulation." The authors call for a coordinated global public health response to protect policymaking from industry interference, end industry ties with health professionals and organisations, and build a global UPFs action advocacy network. Professor Karen Hoffman, University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, adds "Just as we confronted the tobacco industry decades ago, we need a bold, coordinated global response now to curb the overproportionate power of UPF corporations and build food systems that prioritise people's health and wellbeing." Dr Phillip Baker, continues, "We are currently living in a world where our food options are increasingly dominated by UPFs, contributing to rising global levels of obesity, diabetes and mental ill-health. Our Series highlights that a different path is possible - one where governments regulate effectively, communities mobilize, and healthier diets are accessible and affordable for all."
